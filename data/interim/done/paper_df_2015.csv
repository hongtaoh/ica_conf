2015-0000,2015,Paper Session,Corporate Risk Policing: On the Surveillance Practices of Extractive Multinationals to Corporate Resistance,2,"This article analyzes the role of corporate surveillance and intelligence practices alongside proliferating corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. In the context of critically reviewing the literature on corporate surveillance and intelligence practices, and linking these to theoretical debates on corporate social responsibility, corporate self-regulation, and private policing, the article empirically investigates the different surveillance and intelligence tactics deployed by selected extractive MNCs to silence their radical critics. It is argued that the contemporary bricolage of corporate surveillance and CSR can usefully be understood in relation to wider social changes, including the proliferation of private and hybrid forms of policing to protect new sites of private authority within global governance. While in various ways drawing on intelligence gathering, these forms of policing both contribute to and thrive on the emergence of global information markets where information about various forms of risk is produced and commodified.",Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability,Organizational Communication
2015-0001,2015,Paper Session,Discursively Positioning Environmental Sustainability as Competitive Driver in Emerging Markets,1,"Although “competitiveness” is a pervasive frame in global business discourse, with practitioners frequently urging “sustainable” value addition, the subjective meanings of these concepts in different contexts remain underexplored. This paper adopts a communicative approach to the meaning-making surrounding competitiveness. It draws on in-depth interviews with 12 environmental sustainability practitioners from emerging markets, to trace: 1) how they discursively positioned their work as adding competitive value, and 2) the challenges perceived in realizing this competitive advantage. Competitiveness was positioned via four themes: emphasis on “mainstreaming” sustainability with regular operations, detailed reporting, adoption of established standards to legitimize the company, and operating in an environment with encouraging government policy. Ironically, participants’ understanding of the challenges also hinged on two of these themes—swimming upstream against short-term business interests to “mainstream” sustainability, and the hampering of over-zealous or nonexistent state policy. Implications for future research on competitiveness are also discussed.",Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability,Organizational Communication
2015-0002,2015,Paper Session,Is the Impact of CSR Similar Across Borders? Comparison Between Puerto Rico and United States,2,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a trending topic among academic literature and practitioners. Many countries have evaluated the level of awareness their stakeholders have and the importance they place on the concept. However, there are some countries, such as Caribbean countries, that have not kept up with the development of CSR at the rate the other developed countries have. Therefore, this study evaluated how stakeholders in Puerto Rico evaluate CSR in terms of level of awareness and importance. It further evaluated the influence these two variables have on supportive communication intent and purchase intent, and compared said influence with that of the United States. It was concluded that although the two countries share some similarities, CSR efforts are not seen the same across borders.",Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability,Organizational Communication
2015-0003,2015,Paper Session,Theorizing Sustainability as a Communicative Tool: Communicating Identity in Organizations,1,"Abstract
This paper seeks to contribute to our understanding of the processes of assimilation within the context of identity reconstruction in organizations by using sustainability as a theoretical construct. Furthermore, by theorizing sustainability as a communicative tool in identity construction, the paper dislocates the enduring monolithic explanation of sustainability in its environmental context and instead provides an alternate framework for interpreting the concept. Through interviews and focus groups data of international female engineers, it was noted that in spite of facing organizational barriers that were masculine, the women communicatively create alternate spaces that provide lacunae of sustenance and the ability to re-conform and reengage with the organizational practices.",Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability,Organizational Communication
2015-0004,2015,Paper Session,Times Are a Changin’: How a Merger Affects Construction of News Processes,5,"This study offers an ethnographic analysis of the merger of the digitally native news nonprofit the St. Louis Beacon and St. Louis Public Radio. Researchers observed news work and interviewed journalists before and after the merger, paying close attention to how routines shifted after the merger. Through the lens of gatekeeping theory, researchers discuss how new specialized roles, technical changes and shifting news judgments affected communication routines and how journalists did their jobs. These findings are then discussed in the context of the ever-changing journalism industry and what this means for future gatekeeping studies.",The New Organizational Landscape of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0005,2015,Paper Session,Innovating From the Inside Out: Restructuring the Digital Newsroom Through News Intrapreneurship,1,"Increasingly, journalism organizations are creating intrapreneurial units by embedding startups within the newsroom. While these in-house innovation labs are intended to infuse experimentation, innovation and creativity across the newsroom, several barriers exist toward their success. This research, which features 20 in-depth interviews with A-level news managers and consultants in the United States and Canada, examines how newsroom intrapreneurship interfaces with three qualities of managerial change: newsroom leadership, organizational culture and innovation speed. Because of the bureaucratic nature of newsroom authority and the calcified and change-averse character of newsroom leadership, ideas created in the intrapreneurial unit are ultimately isolated from the lifeblood of the broader news organization. The findings identify three layers of tension (executive, practitioner and internal) that exist with the newsroom’s organizational structure that limit the spread of ideas developed within intrapreneurial units.",The New Organizational Landscape of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0006,2015,Paper Session,"Newsroom Moves and the Newspaper Crisis Evaluated: Space, Place, and Cultural Meaning",1,"Across the United States, newspapers are physically relocating their headquarters to smaller spaces, often
away from the centers of downtown. This is the latest manifestation of the newspaper crisis manifest
through a tangible and visible public manner. This article investigates these newsroom moves through a
discussion of space, looking at why these moves matter by examining their impact on how journalists do
their work and journalists’ sense of cultural meaning. The article relies on a two-part field study of The
Miami Herald for data. The article finds that physical newsroom moves are perceived to impact coverage;
that objects inside the newsroom can also be symbols of newsroom decline and invigoration; and that
saying goodbye to a building gives journalists the sense they may perhaps be losing their institutional
relevance.",The New Organizational Landscape of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0007,2015,Paper Session,"Journalism and the Role of Venture Capital: Navigating the New, News Media Landscape",2,"This article proposes that an increase in engagement between news media organizations and technology and startup communities created a new resource space. An examination of this environment provides insight into the generative mechanisms that help drive growth of new entrants, as well as the tension between startup and legacy news organizations as they attempt to adapt to technological change. Theories of organizational emergence have been utilized to understand the rapid evolution and adaptation of the news media industry; however, research examining journalism and technological communities together is largely void of theoretical propositions that help explicate the emergence process. Utilizing ecological mechanisms of form entrance, this article maps out a new resource space and examines the drivers of entrants in a struggle over resources and growth. In order to illustrate this process, a rich dataset is used to map funding activity in the news media and technology space.",The New Organizational Landscape of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0008,2015,Paper Session,"Connecting the Comedy Dots: Interview Content, Elaborative Processing, and Political Satire Programming",2,"The investigation focuses on the content of political satire interviews and the impact of exposure to interviews from The Daily Show and The Colbert Report on viewers’ elaborative processing. Study 1 presents a content analysis of category types appearing as guests on TDS and TCR over an eleven-year period (N = 3201). Utilizing machine learning to assist a large-scale manual coding process, the results of the content analysis suggest that satire programs are an outlet for more serious content and have proven to be a useful resource for politicians and journalists. Study 2 relies on the analysis of experimental data (N = 265), using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to explore the various factors, including news content affinity, comedy learning, and exposure to comedy interviews, that explain variation in elaborative processing. The results show that viewing comedy is positively related to elaborative processing given a prior affinity for entertaining news.",Entertainment Media and Politics,Mass Communication
2015-0009,2015,Paper Session,"Is This Funny, or What? Explaining Humor Appreciation Through a Mass Communication Theory Lens",1,"Political comedy is a truly universal phenomenon and has attracted an unprecedented share of research. However, reasons why humorous political content is appreciated still lack in scientific explanations. By drawing on a mass communication lens this paper paves the way for a theoretical framework for humor appreciation. Based on an experimental design (N = 346) employing a novel set of humorous stimuli, results indicate that not only the well-established disposition theory of humor but also information appreciation and ego as well as issue involvement significantly predict perceived humor. The study’s significance for already existing inconclusive effect patterns on political comedy is discussed and future lines of research are outlined.",Entertainment Media and Politics,Mass Communication
2015-0010,2015,Paper Session,"Mobilizing the Public at Multiple Levels: Satyamev Jayate, a Case Study",1,"Launched in May of 2012, Satyamev Jayate is the boldest talk show that has come to Indian audiences since TV’s introduction to the Indian society. Apart from being anchored by a popular filmstar, Aamir Khan, and covering some topics that have not been given due attention in the news or popular media, the show is aired simultaneously in five languages. Each of the episodes has sparked a nation wide discussion on topics overlooked by the mass media, except in the form of coverage in print media.

However, Satyamev Jayate (‘Only the truth triumphs’), has combined several factors that make us reconsider the power of a ‘mass medium’, which in the wake of new media revolution, scholars had written off as passé.

This paper analyzes the strategies used by the show to inform, educate, and validate –by interviewing victims, social activists and experts. Building upon the previous work of the author on mobilizing information, the paper extends the argument and definition of what ‘mobilizing information’ can imply and how an ‘old medium’ is still very relevant in bringing attention to social issues, and generating a public discourse. The concept of mobilizing context, embedded in the formant and aim of the show, is introduced, and the first episode is content analyzed to illustrate how the show, very efficiently, utilizes language, appeals, and various interactive features to involve the public.",Entertainment Media and Politics,Mass Communication
2015-0011,2015,Paper Session,Politics in Fictional Entertainment: An Empirical Classification of Movies and TV Series,2,"This paper deals with the representation of politics in fictional entertainment. It presents conceptual considerations on the classification of the heterogeneous field of TV-series and movies according to their political references and introduces an empirical approach for measuring the constituent features. We argue that political representations in fiction vary along two dimensions: political intensity and degree of realism. These dimensions encompass four indicators each relating to characters, places, themes and time. Content analyses and cluster analyses were employed to identify the internal structure of the field. The indicators were coded for a sample of 98 TV-series and 114 movies. Cluster analyses showed four clusters of series and six clusters of movies. “Non-political fiction”, “thrillers”, and “fantasy” turned out to be central types in both series and movies. Movies, however, stand out through a greater diversity and a focus on the past that is reflected in three additional types.",Entertainment Media and Politics,Mass Communication
2015-0012,2015,Paper Session,The Bricklayer Effect : A Primer on Accounting for Method Variance in Cultivation Research (TOP PAPER),2,"While the issue of method bias is a well-known threat to the validity of self-reports, it has seldom been addressed in empirical media effects studies. This may be problematic because independent and dependent variables are often measured using similar methods. Thus, reported correlations may not only reflect common variance between the constructs of interest, but they may also indicate common variance between the measurement methods. In this article, we present two cultivation studies investigating to what extent first- and second-order relationships are influenced by common method variance. In both studies, controlling for a theoretically unrelated marker variable (e.g. the prevalence of bricklayers) diminished correlations between television viewing frequency and first-order prevalence estimates. Controlling for Likert-type response tendencies in second-order (attitudinal) cultivation relationships slightly altered regression coefficients, but did not change their substantive interpretation. These findings suggest a discussion on common method variance in media effects research may be useful.",Clarifying and Advancing Theory in Mass Communication Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0013,2015,Paper Session,The Influence of Closeness on Cultivation Effects,2,"This study investigates the different processes that supposedly underlie cultivation effects. We tested whether closeness of a topic to a recipient’s everyday life is relevant in determining which process applies. We hereby expect on-line judgments for topics close to a recipient and memory-based judgments for distant domains. To test our assumption, we conducted an online survey (n=451) and manipulated processing strategy (heuristic version: time pressure imposed when giving cultivation judgments; systematic version: no time pressure). Only for memory-based judgments, the cultivation effect should be prone to this manipulation. As topic, we chose occupational roles of police officers. The occupational role served as variation of closeness within the sample whereas perceptions of the police served as dependent variables to test for cultivation. Results show the expected effects for crime shows (fictional content). Implications for the future measurement of cultivation effects are discussed.",Clarifying and Advancing Theory in Mass Communication Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0014,2015,Paper Session,D) All of the Above: Reinvigorating Masspersonal Communication Within the Discipline,2,"The masspersonal approach to communication reflects a highly utile, yet relatively unknown, means of bridging mass and interpersonal communication scholarship. This work seeks to reintroduce the concept of masspersonal communication and revitalize scholarship applying the masspersonal model, which affords a means of exploring messages independent of channel. After introducing the concept, we highlight three theories particularly apropos to its application (two-step flow, agenda setting, and parasocial relationships), finally addressing how masspersonal communication may serve as a bridge to connect and guide interdisciplinary theory and research. Thus, a substantive benefit of masspersonal communication is its emphasis on the nature of messages rather than medium characteristics to conceptualize exchanges and effects without temporal or technological limitations, returning communication to the center of theory.",Clarifying and Advancing Theory in Mass Communication Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0015,2015,Paper Session,Media Impact Assessment: The Search for Measures of the Social Value of Public Interest Media Initiatives Abstract,2,"This paper seeks to map the contours of the emergent field of media impact assessment. The first section of this paper seeks to establish a concrete understanding of the inherently broad and somewhat ambiguous concept of media impact; and to differentiate it from the much more recognized and better understood concept of media effects. The second section provides a critical analysis of the range of performance metrics that are being employed to assess media impact. The third section provides a discussion of some of the key challenges and tensions inherent in this kind of impact assessment, and their implications for future research. The concluding section considers the opportunities that media impact assessment represents for academic research to contribute to professional practice.",Clarifying and Advancing Theory in Mass Communication Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0016,2015,Paper Session,Sexual Harassment on Social Networking Sites: Exploring Adolescent Views,3,"Sexual harassment is increasingly being encountered by adolescents on social networking sites (SNS) and is associated with a variety of negative psychological consequences. To develop effective interventions, adolescent views were explored in 16 focus groups and 4 individual in-depth interviews with adolescents aged 12 -18y (N=83).
Situational factors contributing to a high perceived severity suggest priorities for interventions such as gender harassment, situations with restricted escape and the non-consensual use of pictures for sexual purposes. According to adolescents, encountering sexual harassment on SNS is one’s own responsibility, however also the harasser and SNS providers contribute to a setting in which sexual harassment is tolerated. Findings suggest that SNS providers can play a role in decreasing the impact of sexual harassment for adolescents by providing a safer environment and increasing the control for the user. The promotion of positive behavioral norms on SNS and appropriate responses towards harassers demand more attention.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0017,2015,Paper Session,"Does Offline and Online Peer Victimization Make Young People Sick? Psychosomatic Complaints, Peer Victimization, and the Moderating Role of Social Support",2,"Offline peer victimization is linked to psychosomatic complaints. As peer victimization is no longer limited to adolescents’ offline relationships, it is crucial that we investigate whether online peer victimization has similar negative consequences. Up to now, no study has investigated the unique contribution of offline versus online peer victimization to psychosomatic complaints or the protective effect of social support.
The current study disentangled offline and online peer victimization by distinguishing four different victim types: non-victim, offline-only, online-only, both offline and online (N = 897, 9-to-18-year-olds). Non-victims reported the least complaints and offline/online victims reported the most. Notably, online-only victims reported similar levels of somatic complaints to non-victims. Furthermore, social support seemed to buffer the relationship between peer victimization and somatic complaints for youth who were victimized both online and offline. We argue that adults who care for or work with youth should be attentive to all forms of peer victimization.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0018,2015,Paper Session,Longitudinal Evidence for a Cyclic Process Model on Cyberbullying With Media Use as Amplifying Factor,5,"The present study examined the underlying processes of cyberbullying and reciprocal influences of having been bullied, related feelings of anger and frustration, and exposure to media with antisocial and risk behavior content. We proposed a Cyclic Process Model, in which anger and frustration of a bullied adolescent drives him/her to media with antisocial and risk behavior content which further instigates to perform cyberbullying behavior oneself. The adolescent gets caught up in a cyclic loop, since cyberbullies often become victims again. In a longitudinal design with three waves, we tested this model among adolescent participants (N = 1002). Results showed that the Cyclic Process Model holds both within waves (cross-sectional) and across waves (longitudinal). Furthermore, the results provide evidence for the feedback loop from cyberbullying to victimization. Therefore, this study provides unique insights into the underlying mechanisms of cyberbullying and how it evolves over time.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0019,2015,Paper Session,Dark Triad Personality Traits and Adolescent Cyber-Aggression,3,"The current study empirically investigates the relationships between the Dark Triad personality traits and cyber-aggression among adolescents (14-18 year old). The sample consisted of 324 participants aged 14 to 18 (M = 16.05, SD = 1.31). Participants completed the Short Dark Triad (SD3) as a measure of the Dark Triad personality traits, the Facebook Intensity Scale and a scale to measure cyber-aggression. Structural equation modelling was applied to investigate the relationships. Results show that only Facebook intensity and psychopathy significantly predict cyber-aggression, when controlling for age and gender. Findings are discussed regarding the potential importance to further study Dark Triad traits, and psychopathy in particular, in the context of adolescent cyber-aggression.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0020,2015,Paper Session,Short-Term Longitudinal Relationships Between Adolescents' (Cyber)bullying Involvement and Social Anxiety,2,"Previous research suggests that social anxiety is a possible determinant of bullying victimization and perpetration, but also an outcome of (cyber)bullying involvement. However the direction of this association is not yet empirically supported for both traditional and cyberbullying involvement. This study examined short-term longitudinal associations between feelings of social anxiety and involvement in traditional bullying and cyberbullying amongst 2,128 adolescents aged 10 to 17 (56.6 % girls). A cross-lagged panel analysis provided evidence for the contribution of social anxiety to later bullying victimization, both on- and offline. The possibility of a reciprocal relationship was also examined, but not supported. Furthermore, longitudinal bidirectional relationships between social anxiety and bullying perpetration were investigated. Only one significant longitudinal association was found: traditional bullying perpetration predicted later higher levels of social anxiety. The implications of these findings are discussed.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0021,2015,Paper Session,Perpetrators on the Internet: Individual and Structural Explanation Factors of Cyberbullying in School,1,"Up to now, there still is a lack of systematical and theory-based cyberbullying research. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, the present study discusses an integrative model explaining a cyberbully's behavior that refers to both, individual and structural influencing factors. This model was empirically tested among a sample of 1428 German high school pupils within a two-wave panel survey. The results show that technical resources enhanced the perpetration mediated via higher levels of perceived behavioral control. In contrast, social resources and norms also directly favored a cyberbullies behavior, however, only if this was witnessed by a certain audience. Following these results, it is concluded that there may be a group of cyberbullies who use the behavior as an instrumental strategy in order to reach primarily socially motivated goals.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0022,2015,Paper Session,Framing Cyberbullying: A Content Analysis of U.S. Newspaper Coverage of Cyberbullying for the Last Five Years,2,"This study examined how the U.S. newspapers framed cyberbullying from 2007 to 2012. By content analyzing 214 newspaper articles, we analyzed forms, causes, consequences, and preventions of cyberbullying and characteristics of cyberbullies and victims. Findings indicated that most articles do focus on school-aged children, often highlighting dramatic outcomes, such as suicide. However, they do not adequately cover the other important, more typical outcomes, such as loss of self-esteem and depression. Given the media’s role in educating adults about the challenges young people face, more detailed explanations of laws and resources could also be of help.",Online Harassment and Victimization,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0023,2015,Paper Session,Must Environmental Communication be Explicitly ‘Critical’? A Consideration of Tensions Between Doubting and Emancipation,1,"The term ‘critical’ has been used in a variety of ways within recent writings in Environmental Communication: as a casual reference to a style of writing or as a signpost for writing that suggests an urgent need for action. This paper analyses the term ‘critical’, it’s intellectual lineage in the Frankfurt School and the tensions that underlie those thinkers’ definition and use of the term. This analysis shows that there is a key tension within critical work between an impulse to embrace emancipatory struggles and an impulse to reflect and doubt knowledge that has come before. I use these distinctions to discuss the way that Environmental Communication has been framed as a crisis discipline before suggesting the value in not trying to reduce these two impulses to either movement. Finally, I discuss how the concept of praxis has been used to work between these tensions when considering a concrete situation.",Environmental Discourses: Rhetoric and Consequences,Environmental Communication
2015-0024,2015,Paper Session,On Queers and Animals: An Eco-Critical Analysis of Ambivalent Discourses in the Nonhuman Animal Rights Movement,1,"This eco-critical discourse analysis examines discourses circulating in the Nonhuman Animal Rights Movement (NARM). Departing from traditional CDA, this essay analyzes animal sanctuary uses of testimony to both humanize other-than-human animals and linguistically construct the future. Furthermore, this essay compares the NARM to queer activism in order to illustrate how certain discourses can and will be reclaimed by powerful ideological systems if not monitored. In all, instead of praising animal sanctuaries—particularly Farm Sanctuary—this essay finds that the organization’s discourses lack longevity. More specifically, this essay finds that Farm Sanctuary actually relies upon “ambivalent discourses,” which Stibbe (2013) defines as “discourses which at first sight appear to be constructive,” but might actually be problematic insofar as they are either ineffective and/or support the ideology that triggers the problem (p. 123). Farm Sanctuary’s ambivalent discourses work alongside capitalism and thus necessitate the organization’s eventual collapse.",Environmental Discourses: Rhetoric and Consequences,Environmental Communication
2015-0025,2015,Paper Session,The Tragedy of Oil: Bill McKibben’s Reframing of the Fossil Fuel Industry,1,"This paper examines Bill McKibben’s book Oil and Honey, and the way in which McKibben builds a tragic frame against the fossil fuel industry, pitting them as a villain while citizens of the world are described as victims of fossil fuel induced climate change. Although Kenneth Burke describes tragic framing as a tool of manipulation, in this instance, tragic framing is being used to challenge the societal emphasis on “progress” and “economic growth” rather than to scapegoat. Because McKibben’s frame questions a fundamental basis of our system, it has the power to engage American citizens in tearing down hierarchies via transcendence, rather than by resorting to persecution and scapegoating of actual people.",Environmental Discourses: Rhetoric and Consequences,Environmental Communication
2015-0026,2015,Paper Session,"Nature Documentaries, Connectedness to Nature, and Proenvironmental Behavior",2,"We investigate the effects of nature documentaries on pro-environmental cognition and behavior. Of central interest is the concept of connectedness to nature, which describes an individual’s sense of being connected to nature. Based on previous research showing that a direct nature experience in zoos can increase connectedness to nature, we questioned whether watching a nature documentary could increase connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behavior. An experiment using one control group (watching a documentary about Einstein’s theory of relativity) and one treatment group (watching a nature documentary) revealed that a mediated nature experience is not sufficient to elicit an increase in connectedness to nature. However, we found that exposure increased actual donation behavior for animal and environmental protection organizations. It is important to note that nature documentary exposure increased pro-environmental donation behavior only in those already having a strong sense of connectedness. We discuss real-world implications for donation-accepting, non-profit organizations.",Environmental Discourses: Rhetoric and Consequences,Environmental Communication
2015-0027,2015,Paper Session,"Too Hot to Trust: Examining the Relationship Between Attractiveness, Trustworthiness, and Desire to Date in Online Dating",3,"This study seeks to shed new light on the manner in which individuals process online dating profiles by manipulating the dating profile picture to be either “enhanced” or “unenhanced” and investigating the manipulation’s effect on perceived attractiveness and trustworthiness. The results of this study reveal that individuals perceive an enhanced profile picture as more attractive, and men perceive an enhanced profile picture as less trustworthy, while women perceive it as more trustworthy. An indirect effects model also revealed that perceived trustworthiness mediates the relationship between similarity and attractiveness, though these effects were not moderated by the picture manipulation itself. Finally, this study found that individuals have greater intentions to date individuals whose profile pictures are perceived as more attractive.",Dating Processes Using Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-0028,2015,Paper Session,Uncertainty Management and Information Seeking in Grindr,5,"This research used uncertainty management theory (UMT) as a framework to examine individuals’ experience of uncertainty within the context of Grindr, an all male, location-based dating application. In a two-phase study, we first investigated the particular concerns associated with Grindr use. Results indicated that the unique affordances of Grindr generated six categories of user concerns associated with use of the “people-nearby” application (PNA). The second phase of our study confirmed that a specific set of user goals and concerns predicted daters’ desire for uncertainty, which in turn predicted information-seeking behavior. Findings clearly indicate that people’s responses to uncertainty were not limited to simple reduction strategies, but were dependent upon their desire for and tolerance of uncertainty in relation to their goals and concerns of Grindr use. The current results also help to establish UMT’s predictive power and explanatory utility within the realm of interpersonal communication.",Dating Processes Using Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-0029,2015,Paper Session,"The Couple Who Facebooks Together, Stays Together: Effects of Facebook Self-Presentation on Relationship Commitment and Longevity Among College-Aged Dating Couples",2,"Drawing on public commitment theory, this research examined the effects of Facebook self-presentations of coupledom on college-aged dating partners’ relational commitment and relational longevity. Using a longitudinal design (N = 180 participants) and a path model analytic approach, we show that Facebook self-presentational elements (i.e., being listed as “in a relationship,” posting dyadic photographs, writing on the partner’s wall) led to an increase in relational commitment among dating couples which, in turn, increased their likelihood of remaining together after six months. Contrary to predictions, the number of mutual Friends and the number of posts written by the partner on participants’ wall was negatively related to relational commitment. This study is the first to apply public commitment theory to an online romantic relationship context, and one of the few to examine the effects of Facebook on the state and fate of romantic relationships.",Dating Processes Using Social Media,Communication and Technology

Results indicated that the difference in system design affected daters’ feelings of personal control over mate selection decisions, which in turn influenced the overall amount of satisfaction daters experienced during the decision-making process. Decision-making satisfaction also mediated daters’ overall feelings of enthusiasm regarding future relationship pursuit. Results are interpreted in light of the “illusion of control” framework and implications for online dating website design are discussed.",Dating Processes Using Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-0031,2015,Paper Session,Ticking the Box and Closing the Loop: Can Dialogue Be Mandated?,1,"Dialogue is a spontaneous, free-flowing, and untrammeled form of two-way communication between participants who respect, trust, and empathize with each other. Its ethical superiority and effectiveness in bringing participants together mean it is an important aspect of organizational responses to increasingly-empowered stakeholders. But what happens when dialogue is legally mandated between participants who view each other as a problem, if not actually the enemy? When dialogue is perceived as a contest with the winner securing the prize of dictating organizational behavior? Is this – can this ever be – dialogue? Sometimes what happens in the name of dialogue is far from dialogic, and ‘dialogue’ is reduced to ticking a box on a form, or closing a communication loop. This challenges those very characteristics that are the basis of dialogue’s claim to superiority. This conclusion demonstrates the need for a radical reconsideration of both the theory and practice of dialogue in public relations.","Dialogue, Communication, and Social Media",Public Relations

Yet, researchers commonly point out how corporations seldom tap social media’s dialogic potential and note that little dialogue actually takes place. In this discussion paper, we summarize relevant literature and extend it by presenting six propositions about the social media’s dialogic potential for corporations. In particular we focus on the tension between the limited economic rationality of a corporation and the idea that dialogue is an orientation that does not treat other participants in the dialogue as means to and end. Finally, we discuss the propositions’ implications for public relations and social media use.","Dialogue, Communication, and Social Media",Public Relations

In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 communication and HR managers of companies in Belgium to gain insight into the following aspects: the use of social media in the workplace and the development of social media guidelines. It is clear from our research that the use of social media guidelines has become commonplace. The fact that more and more customers and employees - together with the company - have become active on social media is, for most companies in our research, an argument to put something on paper. We discuss these insights in the light of the dialogic theory and conclude that companies in Belgium do in fact consider the importance of dialogue in the business context and the opportunities that social media provide in this regard.","Dialogue, Communication, and Social Media",Public Relations

Based on a content analysis of 205 Chinese NGOs’ Weibo profiles, this study examined the effects of organization capacities, governance features, and external pressures on Chinese nongovernmental organizations’ engagement in dialogic communication with publics on the dominant social media platform in China—Weibo. Results showed that after controlling for organization age, and organization type, organizational capacity and governance features were potentially attributable to Chinese nongovernmental organizations’ social media use for dialogic engagement.","Dialogue, Communication, and Social Media",Public Relations
2015-0036,2015,Paper Session,Has Nationalism Weakened?: Korean Online Discussions about Sporting Nationalism and Citizenship in the 2014 Winter Olympics,1,"This paper aims to explore changing characteristics of sporting nationalism in South Korea by examining online discussions on a speed skater Viktor Ahn’s change of citizenship to Russia in the 2014 Winter Olympics.
First, this study has shown that many Korean people didn’t blame Ahn rather cheered for him because Ahn is not recognized as a traitor of Korea but a victim of corrupt and irrational system of Korean society. Second, in people’s discussion of changing citizenship, Ahn as a sporting hero has been represented as an epitome of cosmopolitan subject. Rhetoric of meritocracy plays an important role in the discussion of cosmopolitanism. People’s cosmopolitan desire seems to overwhelm traditional nationalism in Korea. However, it does not necessarily mean that Korean nationalism has weakened. Finally, this study shows that people’s discussions on Ahn’s changing citizenship paradoxically reveal the desire for strong nation and superiority of Koreanness.",Examining Mediated Sport: Top Papers in the Sports Interest Group,Sports Communication
2015-0037,2015,Paper Session,Examining the World’s Game in the United States: Impact of Nationalized Qualities on Fan Identification and Consumption of the 2014 FIFA World Cup,2,"To explore the role of media consumption as it relates to impressions of one’s nation, data was collected using a nationally generalizable sample of 979 Americans over six different collection points before, during, and after the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Results showed a relationship between four nationalized qualities (patriotism, nationalism, smugness, and internationalism) and amount of World Cup media consumption. However, these reported qualities fluctuated very little over time, indicating that nationalized qualities are very hard-wired for most individuals, more likely serving as predictors of sports media consumption than effects of it. Relationships were also found between nationalized qualities and levels of fan identification toward the U.S. Men’s National Team. Conclusions related to applications to social identity theory and several other potential influences are articulated.",Examining Mediated Sport: Top Papers in the Sports Interest Group,Sports Communication
2015-0038,2015,Paper Session,"Points of Attachment Among Professional, Collegiate, and High School Football Fans in the United States",3,"This study examined points of attachment (POA), or how sports fans experience multiple types of identification beyond team allegiance (e.g., identification players, coaches, levels of sport, the sport itself, university/region) at different levels of fandom. More specifically, American high school, collegiate (i.e., NCAA), and professional (i.e., NFL) football fans (N = 698), were asked to respond to items that have been associated with six points of attachment in previous studies, as well as items that tested a new point of attachment to conference/division of a fans’ favorite team. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that this revised seven-factor, 21 item points of attachment index (PAI) demonstrated adequate overall fit. Our findings also indicated that multiple POA differed significantly amongst high school, collegiate, and professional football fans.

2015-0039,2015,Paper Session,The Role of Twitter and Parasocial Interaction in College Students’ Sport Media Consumption,1,"The present study investigates college students’ use of Twitter to consume sports related content. More specifically, it assesses the relative importance of Twitter in relation to other distribution systems (i.e. television, news websites) and tests where obtaining information about sports ranks among common uses of the microblogging platform. In addition, the study assesses potential reasons for why individuals might prefer Twitter to television to consume sports related content. Findings suggest that social media plays an important role in students’ sport media consumption, but that this importance might have been overstated in previous studies. More specifically, the study finds that television remains the main source sports related content, followed by news websites. Results of a subsequent regression analysis find that the subset of individuals that prefers Twitter is motivated in part by their tendency to engage in parasocial interactions, their Twitter use patterns, as well as their perceived expertise in sports.",Examining Mediated Sport: Top Papers in the Sports Interest Group,Sports Communication

Apart from the cultural, social, political and economic influences, mass media also contributes to the global crisis of gender imbalance in leadership roles. The situation is not much different in the biggest democracy of the world, India. In a recent report published by the IPU on Women’s Representation in Parliament, India ranks 108 among 150 countries. The juxtaposition of social media networking sites and news media has not resulted in a significant change in the portrayal of women candidates. The purpose of this study is to assess the visual portrayal of women candidates in India by the top five Indian English newspapers in their social media networks, specifically Facebook, in the period of January 1, 2014 – May 11, 2014, during the campaign and elections of the 16th Indian Parliament.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies

This study explored how political images of the presidents of the United States and Russia are constructed on their official websites. Visual rhetoric guides this study’s theoretical approach while textual analysis serves as the method for the analysis of symbolic communication. This study extends application of visual rhetoric as a theoretical perspective to discover how leaders of the countries with distinct political cultures use symbolic means to communicate their political images to their constituents. This study revealed similarities and differences in how the political images of the presidents are constructed by supporting aspects of participant (democratic) and subject (authoritarian) political cultures and how it reflects the understandings of who a strong leader is in these countries.,"The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies

However, what was once the estate of professional cartoonists and magazine illustrators is now the wilds of the Web. How the landmark legislation of the Affordable Care Act fared in this new frontier offers evidence and lessons on the implications of a shifting visual discourse. During the roll out of Obamacare during a contentious and watershed moment in U.S. history, political cartoonists and creators of image macros produced and circulated persuasive narratives. This study uses visual rhetoric, humor theory, and narrative criticism to analyze a collection of these images, raising questions about their visual propositions and their roles in democratic discourse.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies

This study examines the role of visual propaganda in the social media age by analyzing themes, frames, and structural features of images posted on the official Facebook pages of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces. Our results show interesting differences and similarities between the two sides in using images for their propaganda purposes during the recent Syrian conflicts following the popular uprisings in 2011. Our research highlights the importance of updating existing models of propaganda, as active two-way communication between political actors and the mass public has become more common.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies

These effects and techniques are widely studied, but behavioral studies do not scale to massive datasets. In this paper, we propose introducing techniques from computer vision to facilitate automated human attribute recognition in mass media photographs. We extend the significant advances in syntactic analysis in computer vision to the higher-level challenge of understanding the underlying communicative intent implied in images. We begin by identifying nine dimensions of persuasive intent latent in images of politicians, such as ""energetic"" and ""trustworthy,"" and propose a hierarchical model that builds on the layer of syntactical attributes to predict the intents presented in the images. We show that the resulting favorability judgments correlate in informative ways with independent measures of public opinion, proposing the contrasting media behaviors of visual agenda-setting and mirroring. This study demonstrates that a systematic focus on visual persuasion opens up the field of computer vision to a new class of investigations around mediated images, intersecting with media analysis, psychology, and political communication.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies

The Effectiveness of an Internet-Based Smoking Cessation Program Among Smoker Subgroups,4,"This study investigated the effects of Internet-based multiple computer-tailoring and counseling (MTC), computer-tailoring without counseling (MT) and usual care (UC) on smoking cessation rates. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 414 smokers recruited by practice nurses. Logistic regression analyses revealed that, after six months, MT was more effective than UC and MTC in increasing 7-day and 24-hour point prevalence abstinence among less addicted smokers and showed a trend of being more effective than MTC in increasing prolonged abstinence among older smokers. After twelve months, a trend was found of MT being more effective than MTC in increasing 24-hour and 7-day point prevalence abstinence among smokers with many previous quit attempts. Internet-based computer-tailoring without counseling may be effective for smokers that are less addicted, older, and have many previous quit attempts. More research is needed on how to adapt these programs for other smokers.",Gaming & Computer Tailored Interventions for Health,Health Communication

Substantial research in this field has provided strong evidence of the effectiveness of serious games, particularly in domains related to learning and health. In light of the previous work on health serious games, there is a need to synthesize research that has examined self-efficacy, enjoyment, and behavioral intention as measured outcomes of serious health games. Using meta-analysis techniques, we investigated the effect of health serious games on self-efficacy, enjoyment, and behavioral intention in a total of 29 unique studies (self-efficacy: k = 19; enjoyment: k = 11; behavioral intention: k = 6; N = 4051). Consistent with our hypotheses, health serious games have significant medium effects on self-efficacy (d = 0.29, p < .001), enjoyment (d = 0.53, p < .001), and behavioral intention (d = 0.32, p = 0.007). Additional moderator analyses revealed that the age of participants was found to be a significant moderator (Q = 4.692, p < .05) for behavioral intention, with adults yielded larger effects than children.

We sought to determine whether infographics inspired by game design would contribute to these goals. Between-subjects experiments compared game-inspired infographics (progress bar and scorecard) to more traditional formats (vertical bar and text-only) in terms of information processing and engagement outcomes. Participants (N = 1162) were randomly assigned to an experiment in one of six modules (behaviors related to tobacco use, alcohol use, vegetable consumption, fruit consumption, physical activity, and weight). A game-inspired format performed better than or as well as the traditional format on all outcomes. The progress bar was the most successful game-inspired design. The findings support the use of game-inspired infographics in assessment feedback to better support comprehension and engagement, which may lead to greater behavior change.",Gaming & Computer Tailored Interventions for Health,Health Communication

Only studies were included that focused on children or adolescents (≤18 years), assessed BMI as the outcome measure, used one or more AVGs as intervention, employed a controlled experimental design, used BMI as an outcome measure, enrolled participants 18 years or younger, and comprised original studies. Nine studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The average effect of active videogames on children and adolescents was small to medium-sized and significant: Hedges’ g = 0.38 (95% CI: 0.00 - 0.77). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = .91) but moderator analyses showed no significant effects for participants’ weight status, sample size, intervention duration and dropout.

2015-0049,2015,Paper Session,"Managing Student Distraction in an Age of Hyperconnectivity: Communicative Perspectives, Practices, and Tensions",3,"Mounting concerns and interest in recent years on student distractions in an age of intensified connectivity and purported attention scarcity has led to striking anecdotal accounts and prescriptive perspectives on instructional communication. This paper discusses and empirically investigates the management of mediated classrooms by professors, in light of recent debates on the opportunities and challenges of mobile media use on learning, typified by portrayals of the “distracted student” surrounded by digital gadgets and immersed in multitasking facilitated by digital and social media connections. Results illustrate how instructors communicatively constitute their authority through their enactment of codified rules, strategic arbitration of competing texts, discursive sanctions and deflection. Furthermore, findings illustrate the multiple constraints and dialectical tensions that undergird instructor communication to manage digital distractions. Insights generated in this paper contribute to deepening understanding of the socio-cultural implications of digital distractions for classroom participation as well as the adaptions and constrains on the accomplishments of contemporary pedagogical authority within increasingly mediated learning contexts.

The first study inductively developed initial typologies for the SEMP scale, refined the scale item pool, and explored the dimensions of the scale. Subsequently, the second study validated the scale through a confirmatory factor analysis and by assessing different concurrently existing communication processes as well as students’ perceived learning outcomes. Four factors were found: Lack of Class Relating, Technology Dependence, Class Easiness, and Overwhelmed feeling. Reliability and validity were established for the scale. Results indicated SEMPs were positively related to students’ cognitive absorption, and negatively related to students’ perception of their affective learning. However, SEMPs were not related to students’ perceived cognitive learning.",Digital Dividing? Managing and Measuring Student Media Multitasking,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Recently, Inzlicht & Schmeichel (2012) have proposed a modified framework, the Process Model, which views motivation as a mediator of depletion effects. In the present study, we test hypotheses derived from the two competing theories in the context of an educational multimedia application developed for use by learners of all ages. Running counter to the dominant, limited capacity model, our findings suggest that ego depletion can actually enhance the processing of information presented in multimedia learning environments.",Digital Dividing?

An assumption about the nature of touchscreen devices is that users intuitively understand them, which improves access to knowledge. Using a framework that includes concepts from cognitive psychology, information studies, and communication theory we explored whether users’ physical interactions on a touchscreen device have consequences for their conceptual understanding of content – in this case mathematics. In the present study, adults completed a math task on a tablet computer using either a tap or a drag gesture. Gestures used during knowledge acquisition can result in the generalization of information practices and this can be either helpful (practice effects) or detrimental (perseveration errors) to learning.",Digital Dividing?

The aim of the study was to determine what benefits patients received through placing personal intimate details of their condition and treatment including photographs in a public blog. After taking an inventory of available blogs written in English from 2003 through August 2014, twenty-five well-developed cases were selected for review. Beneficial statements from the blogs were categorized using House’s (1981) taxonomy of social support and Frank’s (1995) description of illness stories. Three of House’s forms of social support (informational, appraisal, and emotional) were useful for describing specific ways in which bloggers and commenters beneficially support one another through treatment.

In an effort to summarize and advance this body of research, a meta-analytic review of content analyses was conducted. Across the 41content analyses examining social support messages shared in health-related contexts online, informational and emotional support messages were most prevalent. Additionally, the prevalence of particular types of support messages varied based on several stressor dimensions relevant to illness. Nurturant forms of support were more common among content analyses examining health conditions likely to threaten personal relationships and involve loss in the form death. Action-facilitating types of support were more common among content analyses examining more chronic conditions.

The present study examines social comparison processes (i.e., upward identification, downward contrast, upward contrast, downward identification), online activity within the community, and patients’ psychological wellbeing. Results showed no direct associations between online activity and psychological wellbeing.

In these sensitive contexts being shaped by various feelings of uncertainty, the disclosure of private details reveals as a crucial factor. A content analysis of 1,032 posts from 620 different members of an online community was conducted. Compared to social support, the demand or provision of informational support clearly dominated the discourse. Overall, users were rather cautious in providing private information in their posts. Higher levels of self-disclosure were only observed regarding informational support. On the person-bounded level the revelation of private information was evident, but those who engaged in supportive interaction emerged to be more restrictive. Hence, we assume that self-disclosure might be useful for issue-related advice, even though it is not necessary for social support in general.

Despite its growing popularity in social media research, ambient awareness has not been explicitly studied as a construct. We developed a measure of ambient awareness and examined key questions related to the experience and content of awareness. A diverse sample of participants reported experiencing awareness, both as a general feeling towards their network as a whole, and as knowledge of individual members of the network, whom the participants had not met in real life.

To accomplish these goals, these organizations strive to appear credible to target audiences. Metzger, Flanagin, and Medders’ (2010) theory of online credibility assessment explains that Internet users rely on heuristic cues to determine whether website information is credible. We conducted two studies to test this theory in an online extreme ideological environment. In addition, we investigated how website viewers’ pre-existing attitudes regarding the topic affects how they perceive the messages presented on extremist websites. Results of this research found that this theory partially extends to ideological settings. However, participants did not attribute credibility to ideological topics on a reliable basis.

Using the unique Chinese socio-political and socio-cultural context, our findings suggest that institutional forces external to the network have profound impact on the configuration of NGO hyperlink networks. Government-organized NGOs (GONGOs) tend to hyperlink to GONGOs and grassroots NGOs tend to hyperlink to grassroots NGOs. In addition, legally registered NGOs prefer to connect with registered NGOs and non-registered NGOs prefer to link to non-registered NGOs. Further, geography-based homophily embedded in common socio-economic and socio-cultural regional environments had greater effects than the other two types of institutional homophily to construct collective action networks among NGOs in China.

2015-0062,2015,Paper Session,Facebook and Self-Perception: Individual Susceptibility to Negative Social Comparison on Facebook,2,"The use of social network sites (SNS) is believed to evoke negative social comparison (i.e., feeling like others are doing better than oneself), which is detrimental to perceptions about the self according to social comparison theory. The relationship between Facebook use and social comparison and, as a result, self-perception, may be moderated by individual differences in happiness because happier people process social information differently than unhappier people. In a survey among 231 emerging adults (age 18-25) Facebook use was related to a greater degree of negative social comparison, which was in turn related negatively to self-perceived social competence and physical attractiveness. The indirect relationship between Facebook use and self-perception through negative social comparison was attenuated among happier individuals, as the relationship between Facebook use and negative social comparison was weaker among happier individuals. The current study thus suggests a poor-get-poorer effect of SNS use on well-being through social comparison.",Facebook as a Social Comparison Neighborhood,Communication and Technology

The researchers conjectured the co-mingling of optimized self-presentations on Facebook invites increased opportunities for social comparison. Study participants reported engaging in social comparison frequently on Facebook. Low-self-esteem (LSE) individuals were more likely than those with higher self-esteem (HSE) to compare themselves to others on Facebook for self-evaluation, self-enhancement, self-improvement, and self-destruction motives. Moreover, LSEs perceived increased levels of social comparison on Facebook, although the relationship between self-esteem and actual social comparison behavior was non-significant. LSEs also experienced more negative affect after using Facebook and were more willing to stop using the social media website. In addition, significant moderating effects of self-esteem were found: self-improvement and self-enhancement motives influenced positive affect depending on self-esteem, while self-evaluation motives led LSEs to experience increased negative affect.",Facebook as a Social Comparison Neighborhood,Communication and Technology

Two experiments were conducted to examine how selective exposure to the profiles of other users could allow for mood management via self-enhancing social comparisons. In Study 1, the inclusion of rich impression management cues, such as photographs and vivid status updates, led users in a negative mood to seek assimilating upward social comparisons rather than contrasting downward comparisons. Study 2 found that relatively lower levels of group identification with the social networking site users in question led to assimilation-seeking by users in a negative mood. High group identifiers spent more time viewing upward comparisons, regardless of mood. In addition, selective social comparisons to SNS profiles high on career success improved subsequent mood, but selective social comparisons to physically attractive SNS profiles reduced self-esteem. High group identifiers experienced even greater positive mood following upward social comparisons.",Facebook as a Social Comparison Neighborhood,Communication and Technology

Scholars have studied national coalitions; yet, no public relations researchers have assessed an international coalition. Organizations in international coalitions depend on mediated communication to establish relationships with others. The mediated communication can negatively influence the levels of social capital in a network. This study presents the findings of a network analysis of a 137-member international coalition. Three major contributions are made to the literature. First, this study expands the study of meso-level social capital to an international context. Second, the findings reveal that rich communication channels can increase the levels of social capital among network members. Third, a new measurement of trust—a major component of social capital—is introduced to accurately assess interorganizational relationships.","Relationship, Engagement, and PR Professional Development",Public Relations

In this article, the researcher argues that, by considering the ideas of the play theory, public relations scholars can better understand how people interact, create meanings, and agree on the rules of the interaction. Having analyzed the concepts of play in public relations, the researcher proposed several ideas for future public relations scholars to consider. The paper provides with a model of co-creation of meaning that helps to recognize the role of public relations in social construction of communication, meaning, and relationships.","Relationship, Engagement, and PR Professional Development",Public Relations
2015-0070,2015,Paper Session,Delivery of Health and Wellness via Digital Interactive Television (iDTV): The Relevance of Health Literacy,4,"Digital interactive television (iDTV) is often seen as a platform with great potential to deliver health and wellness services directly to people. Despite the advantages of e-Health, public engagement with such services is still limited. Our research assumes that health literacy plays a key role on users’ engagement with this kind of services and we postulate it is one of the main predictors of users’ attitudes and behaviours towards iDTV health services. Our main goal is to identify and describe the factors that limit the efficiency of e-Health interventions and the potential depicted in this context by specific technologies – i.e. iDTV.
In this paper, we shall presents the main results from one of two formative studies, conducted during the first phase of the research project, in order to guide the actual development of the iDTV applications in the realm of this project. The study was conducted in a Southern European country – Portugal - between 2012 and 2013. We found that the groups that depict limited health literacy are also the ones least interested in digital TV services related to health and wellness. Likewise, in a former evaluation study of the two interactive applications developed in this project, we found that the higher the education level, the greater the health literacy of the participants.
Following this, we propose that in order for people to realize the actual benefits of using these applications, it is essential to tailor both content and services in accordance with the depicted level of health literacy.

2015-0071,2015,Paper Session,Effects of Narrative Antismoking PSAs on Forewarning-Induced Resistance to Persuasion,4,"Based on the extended elaboration likelihood model (E-ELM) and the entertainment overcoming resistance model (EORM), this study has tried to see indirectly examines whether entertainment-education (E-E) can reduce forewarning-induced resistance and the effect of transportation or engagement with the storyline on the viewer's behavioral intentions. An online experiment was conducted using 800 male smokers, among which 400 were forewarned about viewing an anti-smoking public service announcement (PSA) and the other 400 were not. The 800 participants were classified into the low, moderate, and high nicotine-dependent groups based on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence. The results indicate that post-message intentions to quit smoking were stronger than pre-message intentions regardless of the presence of a forewarning and the level of nicotine dependence. The forewarning induced resistance only in the high nicotine-dependent group and resistance decreased after PSA exposure. The difference in intentions to quit smoking between the forewarned and non-forewarned groups before PSA exposure decreased after the exposure for the low and high nicotine-dependent groups. The study interprets the results and discusses their theoretical and practical implications for better understanding the ability of narrative persuasive messages.",Entertainment Media and Health Communication,Health Communication
2015-0072,2015,Paper Session,Framing in Entertainment-Education: Effects on Processes of Narrative Persuasion,3,"Nowadays, Entertainment-Education (E-E) is often used as a persuasive strategy to stimulate pro-social behavior. Whereas E-E is mostly regarded as a persuasive strategy in itself, in an increasing number of E-E programs several persuasive strategies are used to communicate the educational message to the audience. This study investigates the effects of a strategy widely used in health communication, but not previously studied in the field of E-E: framing. To this means we examined the effect of two different ways an E-E message can be framed: by either emphasizing the losses of not performing the behavior in question or the gains of performing this behavior. A serial multiple mediation model showed that framing affected intention to refrain from drunk cycling via counter arguing and attitude towards drunk cycling; the use of a gain frame decreased counter arguing, which lowered the attitude towards drunk cycling. This subsequently resulted in a higher intention to refrain from this behaviour. Implications of these results are discussed.",Entertainment Media and Health Communication,Health Communication
2015-0073,2015,Paper Session,How Movies Shape Attitudes Towards Individuals with Schizophrenia: Examining Relationships Between Entertainment Experience and Stigmatization,3,"This study investigates the impact of watching a movie about schizophrenia on recipients’ attitudes towards affected individuals. While media portrayals of mental illnesses are known to shape public stigma, the role of narrative-specific processes such as transportation, enjoyment, and appreciation remained largely unclear so far. Thirty-one female students watched a movie portraying schizophrenia. Stigma-related attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia were assessed one week before watching the movie, directly after, and one week later using standardized scales. Narrative-specific processes were measured directly after watching the movie. Twenty students who did not watch the movie served as control group. Analyses revealed no significant differences between both groups. Within the viewer group, however, narrative-specific processes indirectly evoked positive and negative changes in attitudes. Findings indicate that not only the accuracy of movies, but particularly triggered narrative processes are crucial to understand the cultivation potential of movies for stigmatization and de-stigmatization.",Entertainment Media and Health Communication,Health Communication

As different stakeholders operate as a team under considerable time and cost constraints, the role of communication has been emphasized in implementation and utilization of IPD by both practitioners and researchers in the field of AEC. Taking the organizational communication perspective, this study aims to demonstrate the prevalence of communication behavior and its effect on implementation and innovation effectiveness in IPD projects. This study tests the Klein and Sorra’s innovation implementation model that was revised to include communication metrics, and content analyzes a report of professional IPD case studies and transcripts of interviews with participants in two local IPD projects.

2015-0076,2015,Paper Session,Long-Term Consequences of Interdisciplinarity: How the Need to Sell Work Shapes a Discipline Over Time,1,"Interdisciplinarity is often viewed as a key source of innovation in modern work environments. A robust stream of research has demonstrated, however, that communicative pressures at disciplinary boundaries can lead communities to modify how they conceptualize and perform their disciplinary work. Although we have identified local modifications to work, we know little about if and how these changes persist across relationships. In this paper, I take an initial step toward understanding the long-term consequences of interdisciplinarity through an ethnographic exploration of how a disciplinary community of applied weather researchers established new cross-disciplinary partnerships. I find that researchers faced strong communicative pressures when seeking to sell their ideas to new partners. The evidence suggests these mechanisms reinforced shifts in disciplinary practice that occurred in previous interdisciplinary relationships. Drawing on situated learning theory and path dependency, I close by developing a set of testable network propositions about how the repeated interdisciplinarity can affect a community over time.",Coordination/Collaboration in and Across Organizations,Organizational Communication

A survey was conducted with U.S. adult females recruited through MTurk. We found a strong third-person perception on online cosmetic surgery ads. The results of a path analysis revealed that the perceived other-exposure and descriptive norms were positive predictors of the third-person perception (TPP), while injunctive norms reduced the TPP and perceived deception of the ads. We also found that TPP was a strong predictor of support for regulation. Notably, the results evidenced the indirect effect of TPP on individuals’ intent to engage in corrective action through online political self-efficacy.",Advances in Third Person Effect Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0080,2015,Paper Session,The Third-Person Effect Over Time: Support for Censorship in a Highly Regulated Media Environment (TOP PAPER),2,"Support for regulation of media content as a consequence of biased perceptions of media influence has been studied extensively. However, support for censorship in relation to third-person perceptions and other factors has only been examined at a single point in time. This paper presents findings from the first longitudinal study of the third-person effect, and it does so using a rigorous specification of the relative contribution of perceptions of influence on self and others. It uses nationally representative samples from Singapore and examines perceptions of sex and nudity in films, which are allowed but regulated. Comparing independent probability samples from 2001 and 2013, it is evident that while demographic factors changed, culturally linked self-construals, perceptions of media influence and support for censorship did not. As expected, a more interdependent self-construal and the third-person perception predicted support for censorship, as did assessments of total media influence. The pattern of prediction was quite consistent from Time 1 to Time 2, and by controlling for multiple influences a slight increase in support for censorship becomes manifest. The results are discussed in terms of their theoretical significance and the context of study.",Advances in Third Person Effect Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication

Contentious news refers to the same news topic that can be interpreted in opposite ways by people from different geographic regions, which has not been fully studied by previous TPE literature. Results confirmed the robustness of third-person effect in the context of contentious news. Citizenship is found to be an important moderator in the relationship between social desirability and third-person perceptual gaps. Unlike previous literature, attitude toward regulation is a new and significant predictor of restrictive and promotional behavioral consequences, which is worthy of being examined by future scholars. Apart from contributing to the TPE literature, this study also obtained a policy value by offering empirical implications to cross-border communication.",Advances in Third Person Effect Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0082,2015,Paper Session,Blinded by the Light: P-Value Misreporting and Excess P-Values Just Below .05 in Communication Science,6,"Publication pressure and/or verification bias motivate researchers to report statistical relationships at the p<0.05 (significance) level. These motivations may yield (1) (un)intentional p-value misreporting, and (2) excess prevalence of p-values just below .05. To examine whether such distortions occur in Communication Science, we analyzed 5,834 test statistics extracted from 692 recent (2010-2012) papers from 25 ISI-rated Communication Science journals, as well as 19,830 test statistics extracted from 28 Social Psychology ISI journals.
In Communication Science journals, 6.8% of p-values were misreported; most were erroneously downsized. 0.9% stated p<.05 while in fact p>.05. P-values between .055 and .01 were up to 166% more prevalent than expected based on p-value probability density distributions. Stronger discrepancies occurred just below .05. Results were strikingly similar for Social Psychology, although this field was less biased toward downsizing flawed p-values.

Drawing on data from a survey of the ICA membership (N = 221), we assess the degree to which communication scholars endorse false statements about the interpretation of inferential statistics, looking not only at NHST but also at confidence intervals as its most prominent alternative. The vast majority of communication researchers committed at least one error in interpreting both p-values (91%) and confidence intervals (96%), while being confident, on average, about their performance. The performance of pre- and postdocs hardly differed, and statistical experience (training, teaching, and applied) did not entail substantially better interpretation outcomes.

Furthermore, based on the prototype-willingness model, having favorable prototypes of peers engaging in casual sex was investigated as an underlying mechanism of this relationship. A longitudinal three-wave panel study among 1,467 adolescents (aged 13-17, 50% female) showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material and sexually oriented reality TV had a direct influence on adolescents’ willingness to engage in casual sex, but did not influence adolescents’ prototypes of peers engaging in casual sex. Exposure to sexy self-presentations of others on social network sites, in turn, influenced willingness to engage in casual sex indirectly, through increasing the favorability of prototypes of peers engaging in casual sex.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

However, although adolescents use sexually explicit Internet material (= SEIM) frequently, we know little about which specific type of SEIM they are exposed to. Moreover, knowledge is lacking about the antecedents of using different types of SEIM and whether these antecedents differ between boys and girls.The present two-wave panel survey among 2,137 Dutch adolescents addressed these lacuna by studying the use of affection-themed, dominance-themed and violence-themed SEIM. Younger boys and girls, boys with higher levels of academic achievement, and more religious girls more often used affection-themed SEIM. Older boys and girls, boys with higher levels of academic achievement, less religious girls, and high sensation seekers more frequently used dominance-themed SEIM. Hyper masculine boys and hyper feminine girls were more likely to use violence-themed SEIM.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

Most studies have focused only on the objectification component of sexualization, and on limited assessments of media exposure. Our goal was to extend tests of objectification theories both to understudied media genres and to men, and to do so using broader measures of self-sexualization. Surveying 1,191 undergraduates, we tested contributions of exposure to popular reality programs, romantic-themed movies, and music videos, and contributions of perceived TV realism to measures assessing objectified body consciousness and participants’ valuing of sexiness. Frequent consumption of reality TV programs consistently predicted self-sexualization for both sexes, and music video exposure predicted self-sexualization only for men. Perceived realism contributed to self-sexualization in direct ways for both sexes. Findings confirm pathways proposed by objectification and cultivation theories, and indicate unique contributions of understudied media.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

The results revealed that teen mothers on 16 and Pregnant were younger, White, and had healthy babies as compared to national averages. The babies’ fathers were more involved in the daily care of their child as compared to reality. Medical insurance or receipt of government assistance was almost never discussed. Teen mothers in the Teen Mom shows were significantly more likely to receive a high school diploma as compared to reality. Finally, mothers on Teen Mom were significantly less likely to voice concern about finances and had more active social lives than mothers on 16 and Pregnant. Using social learning theory as a theoretical framework, we argue that these shows provide mixed messages to young audiences about teen pregnancy.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

The present study investigated the relationships between self- and other-generated sexy self-presentations (i.e., posting sexy pictures or looking at sexy pictures of others) on social network sites and a relevant aspect of adolescents’ sexual self-concept (i.e., the importance of being sexually outgoing) over time. Results from a representative two-wave panel study among 1,586 Dutch adolescents (aged 13-17) showed that both self- and other-generated sexy self-presentations influenced adolescents’ sexual self-concept directly. In addition, looking at others’ sexy self-presentations also had an indirect influence on sexual self-concept through increased favorability of prototypes of sexual others. Moreover, adolescents’ sexual self-concept predicted their exposure to sexy self-presentations of others, as well as their own sexy self-presentation over time. These results did not differ for boys and girls.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

Four-wave longitudinal data from 1,132 Dutch adolescents (Mage T1=13.95; 52.7% boys) were used. Mean-level developmental trajectories showed that boys occasionally and increasingly used SEIM, which co-occurred with increases in their permissive attitudes and their experience with sexual behavior. Cross-lagged panel models revealed unidirectional effects from boys’ SEIM use on their subsequent endorsement of permissive attitudes, but no reverse effects. Moreover, no consistent directional effects between their SEIM use and sexual behavior emerged. Girls’ SEIM use was consistently low and not longitudinally related to their decreasing permissive attitudes and increasing experience with sexual behavior. These findings demonstrate the need for gender-specific theories and research with regard to adolescents’ sexualized media use.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

Our goal was to investigate the influence of exposure to sexual media content across six different formats (TV, movies, music, magazines, Internet, and social networking sites) on attitudes and behaviors related to hooking up. Results revealed that those who consumed higher amounts of sexual media content were more likely to accept the norms and expectations of the hookup culture. Gender moderated the relationship, however, such that the influence of SMD on EHC was stronger for male participants than female participants. Further, there was an indirect effect of (a) SMD on hookup experiences, as well as (b) SMD on sexual risk-taking through EHC. The results are interpreted through the theoretical lens of social cognitive theory (Bandura, 2009).","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

Both Study 1 and Study 2 revealed that playing a video game with a sexualized avatar increased self-objectification in adolescents and that this effect occurred regardless of the gender of the adolescent (gender congruency hypothesis). In line with the activation frequency hypothesis, Study 1 showed that the effect of playing with a sexualized avatar was more intense among frequent video game players who played with a female avatar. Such interaction effect was, however, not found in Study 2 suggesting there are conditions related to the occurrence of the activation frequency effect. Given the adverse consequences of self-objectification, research on how these effects may be countered is needed.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

In this paper, we consider the possibility that these lessons might affect the use of digital media in the context of dating relationships. Specifically, we posit that young men’s exposure to traditional media forms (e.g., sitcoms, movies) affects their endorsement of gendered sexual scripts, which in turn affects their endorsement of dating violence-supportive attitudes, which ultimately affects their likelihood of perpetrating digital dating abuse. Using a sample of 340 heterosexual undergraduate men, we use structural equation modeling to examine these associations and find support for our hypothesized model, uncovering indirect (but not direct) effects of several traditional media genres on digital dating abuse perpetration. Findings contribute to our understanding of the effects and use of media in modern dating relationships.","From Hook Up to Pregnancy: Sex, Sexuality, and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

This paper explores how participants in one of these genres—fashion blogging—represent themselves in their textual and visual content. Bringing a systematic sample of top-ranked blogger narratives and Instagram images together with data from in-depth interviews, we show how bloggers depict an idealized version of “having it all” through three interrelated tropes: passionate work, the “glam life,” and carefully curated social sharing. These tropes articulate a form of “entrepreneurial femininity” that draws on post-feminist sensibilities and the contemporary logic of self-branding. Yet, we argue that these depictions obscure the labor, discipline, and capital necessary to emulate these standards.",Building Brands: Deconstructing Media Institutions' Constructions and Omissions,Popular Communication

For creative or commercial purposes, they tend to change both in terms of what commodities they hold and what stories they contain. This paper analyses Hasbro’s Transformers by way of a combined theoretical framework that considers franchise changes in relation to both ‘world-building’ and ‘brand-building’. While each concept has gained increased scholarly attention recently, they are rarely or only superficially combined in the existent literature on media franchising. The paper argues that this combination of theory allows us to, on the one hand, understand how franchises like Transformers are constituted both as ‘story-worlds’ and ‘brand-worlds’, and, on the other hand, detect potential power asymmetries in the industry/fan relationship. The Transformers case study makes evident that the processes of world-building and brand-building are not always easy to combine in ways that satisfy both companies and audiences.",Building Brands: Deconstructing Media Institutions' Constructions and Omissions,Popular Communication

Focusing on museums, we argue that museums and audiences co-construct one another on social media, and we explore how modes of communication and discursive genres serve to generate mutual online positionings. Based on in-depth analyses over three months’ Facebook communication at nine Danish museums and applying theories and methods from discourse analysis, we offer an analytical model of social media communication; and we examine how processes of co-construction are established, modified and developed. We find that museums and users largely co-construct one another along familiar lines of institutional authority and that more dialogic modes of interaction mainly result when museums harness users’ knowledge resources. We discuss the implications of our results for the cultural sector, offering a sobering corrective to the often celebratory claims made to the de-stabilizing of institutional authority wrought by social media.",Building Brands: Deconstructing Media Institutions' Constructions and Omissions,Popular Communication

To what extent are girls learning about multiculturalism from the Disney princesses? We sought answers to these questions by studying 120 girls of various ethnicities from four countries (the United States, India, Fiji, and China) within three age categories (8–10, 11–12, and 13–15). We aimed to investigate what these Western and non-Western girls were learning from Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Mulan, three Disney princesses with non-Western heritage at the time of our study.Our findings, grounded in a comparative consideration of themes emerging from the data, indicate several areas of consensus among our research participants, and several areas of disagreement between girls in Western settings and girls in non-Western settings. Many girls in all the countries included in the study defined princesses, including Disney ones, by reference to an appealing physical presence, and described the Disney princesses with non-Western heritage as not much different from other princesses in Disney animated films. However, most girls in the United States regardless of ethnicity characterized Disney princesses as wealthy and free, expressed a strong desire to be like them, and felt a strong identification with them; yet most girls in India, Fiji, and China characterized Disney princesses as having numerous duties but not being free, lacked the desire to be like them, and did not identify even with the Disney princesses with non-Western heritage.",Women and Girls Respond to Media: Using and Interpreting Media Texts and Spaces,Feminist Scholarship

It focuses on Amish and ultra-Orthodox Jewish (Haredi) communities. Questionnaires containing both closed and open-ended questions about the use of new media were completed by 82 participants, approximately half from each group. Findings show that while their discourses included similar framings of danger and threat, the two groups developed different patterns of use (and nonuse) of new media. A quarter of the Amish women used the internet, half of the Haredi women did so, and in both groups only a few used mobile internet. The strategies applied by these women to negotiate the tensions between their roles as gatekeepers and agents of change – nonuse, control and setting limits – are analyzed as valuable currencies in the cultural and religious market of fundamental societies.",Women and Girls Respond to Media: Using and Interpreting Media Texts and Spaces,Feminist Scholarship

The study explores single women’s responses to media stereotypes on their group, which tends to depict single women as deviants from the institution of marriage. Drawing on the third-person effect framework, the study examines how single women perceive prejudicial media message would influence themselves and two important stakeholders in marriage choice (parents and other single women) with a survey of single women in urban China. The results revealed significant third-person perceptions when judging the perceived influences of a prejudicial advertisement for matchmaking service. The behavioral component of third-person perceptions was not significant; however, the data are more aligned in the influence of presumed effect that single women counteract the presumed negative media effects on parents and peers.",Women and Girls Respond to Media: Using and Interpreting Media Texts and Spaces,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0103,2015,Paper Session,Examining the Construction of Identity by the Immigrant Brides of South Korea in Relation to Their Consumption of South Korean TV Dramas,1,"Although marriage migration through marriage brokering agencies has become increasingly common globally over the last several decades, the impact of local media consumption on these diasporic women in their new homeland is rarely studied. Given that watching South Korean TV dramas is a major entertainment for immigrant brides in South Korea (hereafter Korea) (Yoon, Kim, & Eom, 2011), this research will delve into the everyday consumption of Korean primetime TV content by immigrant brides married to Korean working-class men. The goal of this study is to provide insight into the role mass media plays in the ongoing process of self-identification by immigrant brides. In our contemporary media saturated society, mass media play a significant role in the creation of cultural discourse. Cultural discourse, in turn, provides an outlet within which individuals can pursue their own reflexive projects, i.e, create their identities (Giddens, 1991, p. 53). Korean TV dramas, typically targeting female audiences, center on discourses about family matters and romance. In doing so, these dramas influence the audiences’ identities as they intersect with gender, class, and race/ethnicity. This research will specifically investigate the role Korean TV dramas play in the development of immigrant brides’ understanding of themselves and their place in Korean society.",Women and Girls Respond to Media: Using and Interpreting Media Texts and Spaces,Feminist Scholarship

2015-0105,2015,Paper Session,Alignment Within Troubles Talk,1,"Interpersonal coordination is a fundamental behavior in interpersonal interactions. Interlocutors coordinate verbal behaviors which influence individual and relational outcomes. Matching of language style is a predictor of emotional improvement and cognitive reappraisal within supportive communication (Author, 2014a), listeners language is interdependent on a disclosers initial lexical choice (Author, 2014b), and lastly, relationship history is marked by the amount of repetition in conversation (Author, 2014c). Indeed, the coordination of language in supportive communication influences coping and relationships. Through stance analysis (Du Bois, 2007), the current study addresses the differences in how trained active listeners and friends, not trained in any listening techniques, take stances and align language to change (or preserve) the evaluation of a stressful event. Results suggest that both friends and active listeners align language use but in different ways. Friends co-narrate the story by taking personal stances, whereas active listeners align by repeating the evaluation of the discloser.",Managing Interaction in Medical Encounters and Troubles Talk,Language & Social Interaction

Drawing on an ethnographic study in an Intensive Care Unit, this paper analyzes the negotiation of infectious disease diagnosis and antibiotic treatment which occurs among a team of attending physicians with the same specialty and working in this highly critical health care context. Examining examples from video recorded morning briefings, the analysis focuses on how physicians differently construct the assessable object as treatable or not yet treatable in the report phase and how, in doing so they: a) “talk into being” and, therefore, index two contrastive policies concerning the use of antibiotics in Intensive Care Units; b) position themselves towards these policies, and c) display and - at the same time - locally establish a ranking in their relative epistemic rights. We contend that physicians’ contentious navigation between the available (and known) evidence–based guidelines and the “off-label” policy adopted in the ward has crucial consequences in the way this extreme policy is jointly accomplished “one interaction at a time” as a non standardized process sensitive to the contingencies of each and any particular case.",Managing Interaction in Medical Encounters and Troubles Talk,Language & Social Interaction

Results from this research project indicate that 1) the seemingly smooth transition from one patient to another in Chinese medical consultation in fact demands laborious interactional work; 2) when physicians and patients are involved in multiple concurrent lines of action, they may use a variety of linguistic resources and bodily resources to manage these multiple involvements; 3) when interruption occurs in the on-going consultation, patients need to negotiate with each other to determine who gets the interaction floor.",Managing Interaction in Medical Encounters and Troubles Talk,Language & Social Interaction
2015-0108,2015,Paper Session,Sugar Talk: Presenting Blood Glucose Levels in Routine Medical Visits,2,"This paper examines how physicians and diabetic patients discuss and deal with the potentially sensitive topic of “good” and “bad” blood glucose levels. Utilizing conversation analysis (CA) to analyze audio taped adult diabetic medical visits, the data indicate that physicians present “good” glucose levels using an assessment format that explicitly evaluates the patients’ condition. In contrast, physicians present “bad” glucose levels in a report format using the patients’ blood sugar readings. “Bad” blood glucose levels are therefore structured and presented using a format that leaves more latitude for the patient to respond but leaves it to be determined by the patient that the result is a problem that needs an explanation. Physicians exhibit “cautiousness” in their glucose level assessments/ reports in order to avoid direct positive or negative moral characterization of the patient. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the intricate organization of adult diabetic medical visits sheds light on the continual and complex process of negotiating medical responsibility between the physician and patient as they work together to determine the “meaning” or “representativeness” of the patients’ blood glucose level as well as to maintain a functional doctor-patient relationship.",Managing Interaction in Medical Encounters and Troubles Talk,Language & Social Interaction

Both anger- and goals-based explanations have been generated for this phenomenon; the purpose of this paper was to merge both into a testable model. To test the model, an experimental study was conducted in which subjects interacted with a confederate who either did or did not cooperate with instructions.

2015-0110,2015,Paper Session,Eye-Catching?! Using Eye Tracking to Examine the Effect of Health Literacy on the Attention-Recall Relationship,2,"The aim of this paper is to investigate how health literacy influences attention to text and illustrations in online health information, and whether such attention is related to recall of information. Sixty-one participants were exposed to either text-only or text-illustrated information. Using eye tracking, we recorded attention patterns on a health webpage after which recall of information was assessed. Results showed that health literacy influenced the attention-recall relationship. For people with limited health literacy, attention to the illustrations was positively related to recall, and attention to the text improved recall of information in the adequate health literate group. Our findings indicate that illustrations play a key role in improving information processing among people with limited health literacy, whereas text is important for people with adequate health literacy. Effective health communication therefore includes both effective text and illustrations that attract attention and improve understanding of the health message.",Promising Student Work in Information Systems,Information Systems

This study adopted the perspective of the hybrid definition of interactivity, which includes the interactivity effect outcomes mediated by perceived interactivity. A 2 (Technological features: swiping and tapping) x 2 (Range of thumb movement: wide and narrow) between-participant experiment was conducted. The results showed the ranges of thumb movement to have significant effects on perceived interactivity, engagement, attitude, and behavioral intention, whereas no effects were observed for interaction techniques. Narrow range of thumb movement had more influence on the interactivity outcomes, rather than a wide range of thumb movement. The implications of the finding were discussed.",Promising Student Work in Information Systems,Information Systems

Previous empirical tests however lacked (1) an integrated, longitudinal approach, which combined and tested these three hypotheses longitudinally in a single comprehensive model (2) a differential approach, which distinguished between different types of social media use, as well as. Therefore, the present two-wave panel study (N = 1,604) developed an integrated and differential model which aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between loneliness, different types of Facebook use and adolescents’ depressed mood. Using structural equation modeling, results point to the presence of a poor-get-richer mechanism with respect to adolescents’ active public Facebook use, but revealed a poor-get-poorer mechanism with respect to adolescents’ passive Facebook use.

2015-0113,2015,Paper Session,Finding a Voice Through 'Humanitarian Technologies'?,3,"Voice, understood as the ability to give an account of oneself (Butler 2005; Couldry 2010) and participate in social processes (Tacchi 2008) is increasingly recognised as significant for humanitarian action and disaster recovery. Giving people the opportunity to make their voices heard has the potential to democratize humanitarianism and correct the power asymmetries on which it is based. Humanitarian agencies have embraced interactive communication technologies as tools for voice. Drawing on a year long ethnography with communities affected by super-Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines our paper assesses the potential of new media for voice. Our findings highlight a disconnect between assumptions about technology present in humanitarian policies and the actual uses of technology by affected populations. Communication technologies only facilitate voice if other parameters such as a strong civil society, are present. Further, we observe that opportunities for voice are stratified mapping onto existing social inequalities.","Voice and Experience in Mediated Civil Society: Conditions, Limitations, and Metaphors","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0114,2015,Paper Session,Citizenship and Power: Containment of Critical Voices in the Public Sphere,2,"Internet technologies have been celebrated for their potential to help civil society actors expose discrepancies between companies’ words and practices. Recent reporting on dangerous and unethical business practices gestures towards an increased visibility of corporations vis-à-vis stakeholders and wider publics. On closer inspection, however, this is a two-way street. In response, companies have tried to protect and repair their reputation. This paper examines companies' attempts to contain activists’ criticism of discrepancies between oil companies’ CSR discourses and fossil fuel extraction.
In doing so, it draws on the case of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and examples of oil companies’ surveillance of individual activists’ online communication. We draw on media theory, and theories of the post-political and radical citizenship to discuss the ethico-political implications of practices of management of visibility.","Voice and Experience in Mediated Civil Society: Conditions, Limitations, and Metaphors","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0115,2015,Paper Session,Experience in the Customized Online Media Environment,1,"Online display advertisements are often uniquely generated through a technical process that collects and combines demographic, psychographic, and additional behavioral information to determine who sees which ad when. While some internet users are aware of this practice, if only vaguely or conceptually, the complexity of this dynamic, multipart, sociotechnical system makes it largely unapproachable for most. As a result, the customized online advertising message itself has come to represent a site of cognitive struggle due in large part to processes the produce and reproduce information asymmetries, contributing to a broader inability to fully know the world in which we live. This study inquires in this recent media phenomenon by analyzing the experiences of single, arguably ordinary, individual. By reassembling one individual’s interpretations of his experiences using the internet, and specifically those related to personalized, tailored, or customized online media, this study located multiple themes. These are identified as: Awareness, Incessancy, Reluctant Utility, Active Avoidance, and Channel Lock. Implications for experiencing the world through today’s personalized media environment are discussed.","Voice and Experience in Mediated Civil Society: Conditions, Limitations, and Metaphors","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) provides a uniquely apt case for considering the conceptual link between mental disability and media technologies. Tracing the history of the disorder through its various media connections and connotations, we propose a narrative of the transition from impaired sociability in person to fluent social media by network. Digital media introduce new affordances for people with ASD: The Internet provides habitat free of the burdens of face-to-face encounters; high-tech industry fares well with the purported special abilities of those with Asperger’s syndrome; and digital technology offers a rich metaphorical depository for the condition as a whole. Running throughout is a gender bias that brings communication and technology into the fray of biology versus culture. Autism invites us to rethink our assumptions about communication in the digital age, accounting for both the pains and possibilities it entails.","Voice and Experience in Mediated Civil Society: Conditions, Limitations, and Metaphors","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

This paper aims to uncover the participatory mechanism of how players actively create new meanings for cheats in video games by considering the underlying psychological and sociological rationales for engaging game cheats. Six focus groups were conducted to explore this rationalization process among players of different video games. It was discovered that elements of intentionality, utility, core gaming goals, game norm and community feedback serve as important rationalizing mechanism to justify game cheating behaviors. Through the discovery of these mental schema, the paper discusses how the concept of cheating and fairness in video games can be re-looked through this active meaning making process of the game players.",Emerging Methods and Measures in Game Studies,Game Studies

PAX is defined as the perceived social and functional association between an MMO player and game avatar, inclusive of four factors: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of player control. These four factors were stable across two large multi-game (N = 494) and game-specific player samples (N = 458), in both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Construct validity tests show scale dimensions have expected significant relationships with a sense of human-like relatedness and player-avatar relationship features, and predictive validity tests indicate theoretically likely and relevant factor associations with gameplay motivations and MMO genres.",Emerging Methods and Measures in Game Studies,Game Studies

In this paper we present three studies aimed at 1) validating a dimensional structure of online realism judgements on shooting games and 2) examining the psychometric properties of the proposed measurement instrument. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support at least five of six dimensions of perceived game realism that are commonly presented in previous studies.

2015-0120,2015,Paper Session,Predicting Moral Responses in Video Games: A Theoretical Integration of Moral Emotion Research With Video Game Play,7,"There is a current flurry of research interested in examining the potential for video games to serve as “moral sandboxes” that influence moral emotions and moral judgments, and their subsequent effect on moral values. This research, however, is in danger of reaching a theoretical block as moral theory has not been completely integrated with the specific attributes of video game play. The current paper seeks to provide such an integration. The paper describes the theoretical underpinnings of current moral psychological approaches, with a focus on moral emotions, and combines these understandings with known mechanisms related to video game play. These mechanisms include character actions (both non-playable characters and the player character), narrative (linear vs. open-ended), view (first-person, third-person, god’s view), and game play interaction (motivations). Through this combination, the paper presents nine testable hypotheses that could guide future research examining moral judgment and video game play.",Emerging Methods and Measures in Game Studies,Game Studies

Inevitably, as it is a multi-faceted phenomenon, no single measure is able to fully capture all types of player engagement with games. Given that educational game literature, in particular, argues that engagement is an antecedent to learning, making sense of what engagement entails is crucial. Rather than using a limited definition, we posit that available measures tap into different aspects of engagement. In this study, we focus on five commercial games to test different measures ability to assess different types of game engagement. Specifically, we look at genre (Call of Duty 4 vs. Left 4 Dead), mechanics (Portal vs. Call of Duty 4 vs. Left 4 Dead), and narrative- (Indigo Prophecy) or environment- (realMyst) driven games.

By law, those letters were considered petitions. The editorial offices had to register and answer them in a timely manner or transmit them to the authorities for consideration. This policy of focusing on individual cases whilst avoiding the public sphere levels of mass communication and public meetings had two advantages for the ruling communist party: Critics were satisfied and “kept quiet” and other people were left in the dark unless they heard rumours during “encounters”. Having said that, those in power accepted that the absence of a critical discursive space hampered the process of innovation and social change – setting the GDR apart from countries with autonomous media systems.","Inventing Communities, Spheres, and Publics",Communication History

As this paper argues, the story of “Middle America” is much broader: the term was coined by liberal syndicated columnist Joseph Kraft, and journalists and liberals as well as conservatives saw Middle Americans as a key political constituency alienated by cultural change, uneasy about racial progress, antagonistic to upper middle class white liberals, and critical for elites to better understand. Drawing on coverage of white workers in major newspapers, magazines, and popular books from 1968 to 1972, this paper develops a new origin story for the term “Middle America,” one that stresses the role of journalism in constructing reality and marking class difference.","Inventing Communities, Spheres, and Publics",Communication History

In opposition to these public relations masters of persuasion that had a pessimistic view of human condition, Spinoza’s Ethics is based on a positive anthropology of man that squares well with contemporary and more ethical relationship building approaches to public relations.","Inventing Communities, Spheres, and Publics",Communication History

Consequently, its focus is on the role that public opinion played in the constitutional framework of one of the most prominent European city-states, the Republic of Venice. In order to capture the complexity of the issue, the study juxtaposes normative political ideals against the social praxis of Venetian political life. This historical excursion culminates with an account of the dramatic defeat at Agnadello in 1509, which serves as a backdrop illustrating not only the deep impact that public opinion exercised over Venetian domestic politics, but also the extensive international role that it played in the realm of the Renaissance world of politics, economics, and warfare.","Inventing Communities, Spheres, and Publics",Communication History

2015-0131,2015,Paper Session,Revisiting the Spiral of Silence: How Majority and Minority Groups Differ in Voicing Their Opinions in the Prodemocracy Movement in Hong Kong,2,"Recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, also known as the Umbrella Movement, have attracted global attention. While the opinion climate in Hong Kong seems to support the movement in general, there has also been discussion on how protests may negatively impact a harmonious society as well as local economy.

According to the spiral of silence hypothesis (Noelle-Neumann, 1974), one’s perception of the public opinion motivates his/her willingness to express personal views. People would estimate the opinion climate before they decide to speak up in public. Those who perceive themselves with minority positions on a divisive issue may not be willing to voice their opinions due to fear of isolation. While there is no shortage of empirical evidences (e.g., Kerr, et al., 1987; Lasorsa, 1991; Neuwirth, Frederick, & Mayo, 2007; Taylor, 1982; Willnat, 1996), critics also point to several deficiencies of the theory. For instance, the theory is considered missing a specified role for communities, organizations, and reference groups in mediating the effects of a larger society.

In Hong Kong, social conflicts between local Hong Kong residents and mainland Chinese migrants have intensified in recent years. According to a recent poll, even though both groups are ethnic Chinese, a majority of Hong Kong people (67.3%) would rather identify themselves as Hong Kongers; whereas less than a third (31.1%) of the Hong Kong people reported themselves as Chinese, more than 15 years after Hong Kong returned from the British to the Chinese rule (HKU POP, 2014). Smith (1991) defined majority status primarily in terms of a group’s superior, numerical representation within a given society. In pluralistic societies, members of majority or minority ethnic groups have salient conflicts in identification with each other (Smith, 1991). In the case of Hong Kong, it appears that Hong Kongers tend to be more vocal on such divisive issue as the pro-democracy movement than would mainland immigrants.

Hence, we argue that group status will mediate the spiral of silence effect. In other words, individuals who belong to the majority group but with minority opinions are still likely to speak up; while individuals who belong to the minority group but with majority opinions are still less likely to speak up, as isolation from the primary group would seem to be more critical for individuals than isolation from the society as a whole (Moy, Domke, & Stamm, 2001). Hence the pressure to conform to the reference group would be greater. We thus predict that group status will mediate individuals’ willingness to speak through perceived group norms (H1).

Furthermore, studies have found that perceived future congruency would significantly impact respondents’ willingness to express opinions on controversial topics (Scheufele, Shanahan & Lee, 2001). Empirical evidences also suggest that people with more firmly held beliefs are less susceptible to perceptions of the opinion climate, and thus are more likely to express their views (Lasorsa, 1991). Hence, we predict that group status will mediate individuals’ willingness to speak through future opinion congruency (H2).

Lastly, when people express their views, majority and minority group members may be concerned about the consequence of such speech to different degrees, affecting their outspokenness. Hence, we predict that group status will mediate individuals’ willingness to speak through the awareness of consequences (H3).

Data are being collected through an online survey. We expect to see salient differences in individuals’ opinion expression between majority and minority groups through different perceived group norms, future opinion congruency, and the awareness of consequences. The findings serve to extend and revise the spiral of silence theory, and advance our knowledge in public opinion research.",Intergroup Communication Research in Progress,Intergroup Communication
2015-0132,2015,Paper Session,Talking With Different Others: Roles of Superordinate Citizen Identity in Cross-Cutting Discussions,1,"The theory of deliberative democracy envisions inclusive deliberation in which people in different social groups—with different identities, opinions and interests—engage in reflexive, cross-cutting discussions. Yet both theorists and practitioners recognize various real world challenges, including structural inequalities, cultural differences, and linguistic biases. In this paper, I argue that a construction of relational citizenship identity can be a key internal dynamic to navigate these challenges. Specifically, by drawing on the notion of “superordinate identity,” a concept that has been advanced in the literature of collective identity and self-categorization, I set out to examine the effects of highlighting a relational dimension of citizenship in the context of a hypothetical discussion. I argue that a superordinate citizenship identity, which on a more general level is a consequence of an inclusive democratic polity, can work against various barriers to deliberative interactions, such as group-based or opinion-based biases and cognitive closure.

This proposition is tested in an exploratory empirical study. Specifically, I examine how an individual’s deliberative practice in a context characterized by disagreements and conflicting voices is influenced by (1) his/her general understanding of citizenship (relational vs. conventional) and (2) a heightened sense of the superordinate, relational citizen identity. A web-based survey study, which embedded a quasi-experiment, was conducted to examine the roles of relational citizenship understanding. Student participants (N=458) in a large Midwest university first responded to questions about their citizenship understanding and their opinions about affirmative action. They were then exposed to an invitation flyer to a hypothetical discussion event on the topic of affirmative action in college admissions, along with a hypothetical Student A’s opinion profile about the topic. The message that heightens either the relational citizenship identity or group-level identity was embedded into the invitation flyer. Approximately a half of the participants were exposed to the message in which a super-ordinate level of social belonging and relationships between citizens is highlighted; the other half were exposed to the message that emphasizes a sub-group level belonging and ideological differences. After the citizenship identity was (1) measured and (2) sensitized (vs. not sensitized), participants’ expectations about the discussion event and the hypothetical discussion partner Student A were examined. The opinion difference between the participants and the hypothetical Student A on the topic of affirmative action issue was calculated by measuring the difference score. This study tests the following research questions and hypotheses.

RQ1: Does sensitizing superordinate (relational) citizenship identity have any effect on people’s perceptions about the potential discussion (e.g., willingness to have the discussion and positive expectations about the discussion)?
H1a: There will be a positive relationship between opinion similarity and the perception that the opinion of other is based on rational considerations.
H1b: There will be a negative relationship between opinion similarity and the perception that the opinion of other is based on biased considerations.
H2: There will be a positive relationship between opinion similarity and willingness to discuss the issue.
H3: There will be a positive relationship between opinion similarity and positive expectations about the discussion.
RQ2: Is the tendency to privilege the like-minded moderated by individual’s relational citizenship understanding?
RQ3: Can the tendency to privilege the like-minded be reduced when people are sensitized of their relational citizenship identity?
The results present some preliminary evidence that supports the theoretical argument of this paper. (Further analysis will be conducted).

2015-0133,2015,Paper Session,An Examination of Influence From Self-Esteem and Media Stereotype on American Students' Discrimination and Aggression Toward Asian International Students,1,"With increased number of international students in the United States especially from Asian countries, intercultural and intergroup research has focused on their view of identity, without much focus on possible discrimination and aggression toward them held by the majority American college students. As a result, building on the self-esteem hypothesis under the social identity theory as well as media stereotype on Asian, the current study aims to shed light theoretically on whether self-esteem from viewing collective-self would influence out-group discrimination/aggression, and to answer whether stereotype will impact American students’ out-group discrimination/aggression toward Asian international students. An experimental study with between-subject design is conducted. Stimuli are designed to manipulate participants into two levels of self-esteem from viewing of collective-self as well as two levels of stereotypical portrayal of Asian international students. In addition, self-report of each participant’s self-esteem and ethnocentrism before the experiment are used as covariates in data analysis.",Intergroup Communication Research in Progress,Intergroup Communication

Extending previous work by applying a Web 2.0 participatory framework (Walther & Jang, 2012), the current research examines the effect of instructor responses to negative student evaluations on RateMyProfessors.com. The responses focused on the primary dimensions of credibility: competence, trustworthiness, and caring. In an original experiment, the results demonstrated that statements of trustworthiness robustly increased cognitive learning and likelihood of enrollment.

A measure of instructor swearing was created to assess college students’ (N = 363) perceptions of when teachers swear. Results yielded a six-factor structure that supports past research: swearing at self and job tools; swearing at students and their assignments; swearing to elaborate course concepts; swearing seen as part of the instructor’s disposition; swearing to gain attention; and, swearing to converge and be humorous. Framed by Emotional Response Theory (ERT), students’ emotions in the classroom (i.e., pleasure, arousal, dominance) significantly predicted students’ cognitive learning, affective learning, and motivation, above and beyond instructor swearing. Additionally, instructor swearing significantly predicted students’ pleasure and dominance emotional responses, but not arousal.

By affecting how individuals appraise stressful events, communication can either prolong or ameliorate physiological and emotional responses to stress. This study investigated the effects of hope-inducing and rumination-inducing messages on heart rate and state anxiety after a stressor. Continuous heart rate was monitored for 127 college students (64 female, 63 male) throughout an experiment that included a performance stressor and messages designed to (a) cause feelings of hope, (b) evoke rumination, or (c) be a distraction (control). Heart rate varied by message, such that heart rate was lowest in the hope condition. State anxiety was lower in the hope and distraction conditions than in the rumination condition. Overall, the study implies that hope evocation messages may be an important tool to add to our supportive communication toolbox.","Health Message Framing: Fear, Gain/Loss, Emotions",Health Communication

The current study tested whether two message features (dose, efficacy) and four individual difference variables (grit, walking self-efficacy, consideration of future consequences, cancer information overload) moderated the persuasive impact of loss and gain framing. Adults (N = 341, Mage = 38.09, SD = 10.94) were randomly assigned to a one of eight message conditions advocating exercise behavior. All four individual difference variables significantly moderated framing effects such that loss framed messages were significantly more effective at increasing intentions to exercise for individuals with higher grit, walking self-efficacy, and consideration for future consequences, and for those with lower cancer information overload.","Health Message Framing: Fear, Gain/Loss, Emotions",Health Communication

A recent review suggested that the within-individuals approach might be more appropriate. Studies that measured fear at different time points have consistently revealed a curvilinear association between fear and persuasion, as originally proposed by the drive theory. An online experiment (N = 454) using tobacco warning labels was conducted to replicate the inverted-U shape curvilinear relationship between fear and persuasion, and to revisit the role of fear in fear appeal theories. Results showed that the inverted-U fear curve positively predicted persuasion effects of tobacco warning labels and reduced maladaptive responses; and that the linear trajectory of fear positively predicted maladaptive responses and failure of persuasion. Fear is reinstated into a central role in fear appeal.","Health Message Framing: Fear, Gain/Loss, Emotions",Health Communication

Effect sizes for 11 outcome variables were extracted from 48 studies and analyzed (N = 8598). Fixed-effect model indicated small but statistically significantly positive effects of self-affirmation in increased message acceptance, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, response efficacy, intentions, and behaviors. The results lend empirical support to self-affirmation as an effective intervention strategy. Moderator analyses with random-effects model revealed that self-affirmation was most effective when kindness self-affirmation domain was used, when participants were exposed to cessation messages, and among low-risk participants. The two most commonly used self-affirmation domains, i.e., kindness and values, did not work equally well in reducing defensiveness.","Health Message Framing: Fear, Gain/Loss, Emotions",Health Communication

A national sample of adult non-users of tobacco, exclusive smokers, and dual users of conventional cigarettes and smokeless tobacco saw print ads for moist snuff, snus, and e-cigarettes with 1 of 4 warning labels, no label, or a control ad. Graphic warning label evoked the highest levels of all of the negative emotions and the lowest levels of positive emotions. Differences between smokers, dual users, and non-users were found in emotional arousal for both positive and negative emotions and across different products. Hope was a consistent significant predictor for interest in alternative tobacco products among all categories of participants.

To help create persuasive messages to dissuade people from texting while walking, this formative study attempted to identify critical predictors of intention to texting while walking based on theory of planned behavior. In addition to three components of TPB, perceived risk, personal norms, and self-efficacy were added into the model. The results indicated that subjective norms, personal norms, and self-efficacy significantly predicted intention to sending and reading text messages while walking. Regarding the relative predictive power between two types of norms, personal norms was a stronger predictor of intention to texting while walking than subjective norms. These findings provide people’s perceptions of texting while walking, which would be useful resources to inform them of the dangers of texting while walking.",Focusing Theories on Communication and Technology #2,Communication and Technology

Challenging previous research positing a halo effect of the mere disclosure of one’s religion, the present research introduces social identification as an additional factor influencing attributions in professional relational contexts. Two-hundred forty college students were randomly exposed to one of four experimental conditions (Christian, Islamic, Satanic, and secular quotations in a signature block), and completed measures of social identification and interpersonal attraction. Findings reveal social identification mediates the relationship between religious disclosure and interpersonal attraction. Moreover, results indicate that, contrary to prior research, merely disclosing one’s religion does not increase attributions provided the religion is culturally typical; but that disclosure of an atypical religion (i.e., Satanism) can reduce attributions of a sender. Implications of these findings are discussed with regard to social categorization and social information processing theory, as well as for professionals’ practice in developing signature blocks as a means of self-presentation.",Focusing Theories on Communication and Technology #2,Communication and Technology

Ambivalence users indicated greater levels of willingness to express opinions on Facebook but also indicated greater levels of fear for potential conflicts. Ambivalent users also indicated greater civic participation on Facebook and greater perceived effects of political discussion on Facebook.

2015-0150,2015,Paper Session,Like to Engage: A Multilevel Analysis of Connective Action on Facebook,2,"This paper presents the results of an empirical study on the use of Facebook groups and pages for connective action. More specifically, the substrate for civic action (i.e. self-efficacy and involvement) and general motivations for using Facebook (i.e. self-presentation and social connection) are juxtaposed in explaining individual action. Second, drawing upon literature on the interface of individual and collective efficacy, we question the extent to which personal efficacy, as well as individual and collective action, explains the perception of collective efficacy.

The results, based on 73 groups/pages and 774 individual users, suggest a substantial confound of involvement with the issue and self-efficacy on the one hand with the dominant self-presentational and social connective motivations on the other in explaining individual action. Furthermore, besides personal efficacy, collective efficacy is explained by social factors (i.e. social connection and actual collective behaviour within groups and pages).",Political Facebooking,Communication and Technology

The research analyzes the big data phenomenon from a socio-technical systems theory perspective: cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomena that rest on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology provoking extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. It examines the development of big data by reviewing this theory, identifying key components of the big data ecosystem, and explaining how these components are likely to evolve over time. Despite extensive investment and proactive drive, uncertainty exists concerning the evolution of big data and the impact on the new information milieu. Significant concerns recently addressed are in the areas of privacy, data quality, access, curation, preservation, and use. This study provides insight into these challenges and opportunities through the lens of a socio-technical analysis of big data development, which includes social dynamics, political discourse, and technological choices inherent in the design and development of next-generation ICT ecology.

In the context of public service advertisements promoting HPV vaccination, this research specifically assesses the relative persuasiveness of narrative vs. non-narrative messages as well as the influence of narrative perspective (first- vs. third-person) and modality (text-based vs. audio-based) on message effectiveness. Results of a controlled experiment (N = 121) suggested that a non-narrative message led to greater perceived risk of getting HPV than a third-person narrative, but was equally persuasive as a first-person narrative. These findings were confined to the text-based condition, however. When the messages were audio-based, no differential message effects were detected.

In line with theory, trust served as a mental shortcut leading to positive judgments about vaccine effectiveness, whereas the lack of trust functioned as a heuristic for making negative judgments. Trust also interacted with physician communication – for individuals with relatively low trust in doctors, having talked with a healthcare provider about the HPV vaccine lessened perceived vaccine effectiveness.

We show this through a study in which unstructured idea generation processes were compared with an alternating divergent-convergent idea generation process, or two passes through Laseau’s (1980) funnel, in the context of an undergraduate engineering course. We performed a content analysis on text collected in the form of transcribed team conversations, sketch annotations, and student reports to extract prominent concepts from the text. Using text visualization techniques to examine the concepts that emerged in the teams, our analysis shows that the two idea generation processes shape conceptual development differently as reflected in the talk of the groups. This has implications for when certain idea generation methods may be more useful as well as offering an alternative way to measure group idea generation efficacy.","Group and Work Team Interactions: Antecedents, Processes, and Outcomes",Organizational Communication

Using data from 46 four-person groups, we found that members with lower self-confidence in task-related expertise were more likely to accommodate to the linguistic styles of those with higher self-confidence in FtF groups, but not in CMC groups. CA, in turn, influenced expertise perceptions such that members who accommodated to others were judged as having less expertise in CMC groups. In FtF groups, accommodating to another group member lowered evaluation of the focal person’s expertise, but the effect of CA was mediated by perceived task-oriented communication and perceived influence. The findings emphasize the importance of communication dynamics and communication channel in influencing expertise perceptions.","Group and Work Team Interactions: Antecedents, Processes, and Outcomes",Organizational Communication

The ""Fat Head"" on YouTube",1,"With online media becoming more and more engrained in people's media routines, fragmentation research has seen a new wave of interest in the academic field as well as political debate. Some fear that online media will be detrimental for social cohesion, while others underline the complementary role that these play in everyday media repertoires. The study examines how content structures on a popular video sharing site, YouTube, differ from mass media and discusses implications for a possible fragmentation of the audience and social cohesion.

2015-0167,2015,Paper Session,Measuring Narrative Transportation: Comparing the Validity of the Transportation Scale in Relation to Written Versus Audio-Visual Narratives,3,"Many scholars investigating narrative persuasion make use of Greene and Brock’s (2000) transportation scale to measure the degree to which audiences get carried away into a narrative. However, it was originally designed for written narratives, while many studies now use it for audio-visual stimuli, in some cases dropping items, in others rewording or replacing them. In this study, we exposed 125 participants to either a written or film version of the same narrative. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the scale was not uni-dimensional, and follow-up questions showed that significant numbers of participants who viewed the film version were puzzled by items that asked about their ability to imagine what they had seen. When the data were separated by medium, the written version of the scale reduced to a single factor, but the film version contained four factors. The relationships between these subscales and enjoyment and appreciation are discussed. Further research into how transportation might vary across media is encouraged.",Issues in Narrative Research,Mass Communication
2015-0168,2015,Paper Session,Predicting Narrative Enjoyment From Message Content and User Perceptions: The Role of Intuitions,6,"Independent coders rated the extent to which the content in eight narratives upheld/violated 11 different altruistic or egoistic intuitions. Before an experiment, an affect misattribution procedure (AMP) measured the salience of these intuitions in participants. Participants were randomly assigned to hear one of the eight narratives and rate liking. Next, they provided subjective perceptions of the extent to which content upheld/violated these intuitions. Analyses revealed that measures of both coded content and subjective perceptions of content accounted for unique variance in liking. Furthermore, intuition salience (AMP scores) moderated the impact of both measures such that intuition salience increased the extent to which both content and subjective perceptions predicted liking. Analyses suggested that both content and subjective perception of content play important roles in liking. The value of these altruistic and egoistic intuitions for understanding individual differences in the perception and appraisal of narratives is discussed.",Issues in Narrative Research,Mass Communication
2015-0169,2015,Paper Session,The Influence of Narrative on Third-Person Perception,3,"Individuals tend to believe that other people are more susceptible than they are to media influence. Such third-person perception is most prominent when individuals view a message as objectionable. Emotion-evoking messages can attenuate this perception and sometimes reverse it. As a form of communication, narratives can elicit emotions and amplify message desirability. This study examined the effects of persuasive narratives on third-person perceptions. The study involved two experiments, with duplication in Singapore and the U.S. Results show consistent third-person perception and it inverse when persuasive messages are objectionable and desirable, respectively. Consistent with prior research, these self-other asymmetries increase as social distance increases. While results suggest individuals perceive certain kinds of narrative messages as being more persuasive than non-narrative expository messages, results showed no effect of narrative on third-person perception.",Issues in Narrative Research,Mass Communication

The Influence of Narrative Pace on Empathy, Perceived Social Distance, and Intentions to Help Stigmatized Groups",3,"This paper examines how narrative pauses, defined as moments of non-action in audiovisual narratives, influence the viewing experience in terms of empathic processes, and ultimately affect viewers’ perceived social distance and intentions to help stigmatized groups. The results of a 2 (short film) × 2 (narrative pauses: present vs. not present) online experiment (N = 253) confirm the assumption that a slower narrative pace created by narrative pauses intensifies viewers’ sharing of emotions with the main character (affective empathy) and their general empathic response. They also lend further support to the potential of narratives in evoking empathy, thereby reducing social distance, and ultimately promoting prosocial behavioral intentions in the context of stigmatization. Overall, this paper provides validity to the concept of narrative pauses and its empirical investigation within narrative persuasion.",Issues in Narrative Research,Mass Communication

This study examines parents’ monitoring, internet mediation, and modeling behaviors as predictors of adolescents’ computer/internet use among 629 US adolescents and their parents. Parents’ time spent computers was positively associated with teens’ computer time, and parents’ engagement in seven internet activities (e.g., IM/chat) also predicted teens’ engagement in those activities. Greater general parental monitoring of adolescents predicted less teen engagement in IM/chat, social networking site use, video streaming, and multiplayer online games, while parental tracking of internet use predicted more teen IM/chat. Older teens spent more time with computers and in various internet activities and reported lower rates of general parental monitoring and parental internet mediation. Findings suggest that parents act as models for their children’s internet use. Additionally, general parental practices not specific to media may affect youths’ media behaviors as well.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0172,2015,Paper Session,Comparing Two Models of Parent Mediation of Adolescent Social Media Use,2,"The goal of the present study was to compare two models, one based on a mediation approach and the other on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), to understand parents’ mediation of their adolescents’ social media use. Data was collected from parents of adolescents ages 10-18 in two countries, the United States and the Netherlands. Results indicated significant differences between the two samples. Specifically, American parents reported more worry about adolescent social media use, higher attitudes and perceived subjective norms to control adolescent use, and higher levels of active and restrictive mediation. In general, the mediation approach model accounted for more explained variance in mediation behaviors among Dutch parents, while the TPB models accounted for more explained variance among American parents. Results suggest important implications for researchers’ understanding of cross-cultural differences in parent mediation, as well as implications for the use of different theoretical models to explain parent mediation behavior.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0173,2015,Paper Session,Family and Religious Influences on Restrictive Parental Mediation and Video Game Addiction,4,"Research on parental mediation has focused on psychological and developmental variables, but has neglected the broader ecology in which the family is situated. Drawing on family systems theory, the current study hypothesizes that systems within the family (i.e., sibling spacing and hostile sibling relationships) and systems outside of the family (i.e, religion) operate to produce conditions that lead to restrictive mediations practices by parents, and video game addiction in adolescents. Data was supplied by the Flourishing Families project. Families with siblings (n = 387) completed measures of religiosity, sibling relationship quality, restrictive mediation practices, video game addiction, and demographics. Structural equation modeling shows that religiosity is positively related to restrictive mediation. Furthermore, the results support the idea that as spacing between siblings narrows, their relationships grow more hostile, leading to restrictive mediation. However, restrictive mediation did not predict video game addiction. Implications of these results are discussed.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media

This study compares US mothers’ and fathers’ use of five types of mediation (structural, monitoring, restrictive, active, and co-use) across four media platforms (television, video games, Internet, and cell phones). Research on gender differences in parenting practices and styles is reviewed to provide a context for studies of parental mediation. Results indicate that fathers mediate less, but that those differences are significant only for Internet and cell phone mediation. Varying levels of parental involvement and parent-child talks were better explanations of mediation. Highly involved parents were more frequent mediators for television, video games, and the Internet. Parents who reported frequent talks with children more frequently mediated all four media. The results are discussed within the context of research on parenting styles and practices.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media

A longitudinal survey was conducted in 28 randomly selected primary and secondary schools in Singapore. The data of 3079 students were analyzed through path analyses across two time points. The results confirmed reciprocal associations between parental monitoring and youths’ online risky behaviors. Active and restrictive monitoring were predictive of lower online risky behaviors, which supports the significant role of parents in online guidance and supervision. Additionally, youths’ engagement in online risky behaviors were also found to result in lower parental monitoring, which implies that parents of youths who engage in online risky activities can also be negatively affected and parenting efforts may decrease as a consequence.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0176,2015,Paper Session,"The Relation Between Norm Accessibility, Pornography Use, and Parental Mediation Among Emerging Adults",4,"Widespread access to and acceptance of pornography has led to concern about effects of exposure to pornography on emerging adults. Because salient social norms can influence subsequent behavior, this study explored the relationship between salient pornography-related norms and pornography use among emerging adults, as well as the relationship between parental mediation of pornography during adolescence and emerging adults’ salient pornography-related norms. Results revealed that accessible close peer descriptive and injunctive peer norms are associated with emerging adults’ pornography use. Results showed that accessible parental injunctive norms attenuate the relationship between accessible peer injunctive norms and pornography use, and accessible parental injunctive norms mediate the relationship between restrictive mediation and pornography use. These findings suggest that peer norms about pornography use may be an important predictor of emerging adults’ pornography use, and parental mediation may be an effective method of transmitting parental norms to adolescents that can persist into emerging adulthood.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media

A sample of 364 parents of children aged two to ten years was used to investigate the relations. The results showed that children who spent more time using the tablet had more conflicts with their parents. Also, children who received high amounts of restrictive mediation had more conflicts with their parents about the tablet. Children who often co-used the tablets with their parents had less conflicts, however. Significant two-way interactions indicated that instructive mediation and co-use decreased parent-child conflicts if children often used a tablet, while restrictive mediation increased parent-child conflicts in this condition.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media

Prior research also indicates low knowledge and use of the V-chip, a device that blocks programming using the ratings. This study sought to examine modern parents’ awareness and perceptions of the TV ratings, as well as their use of the V-chip and alternative strategies to protect children from inappropriate content.

Speculation exists that these suboptimal effects are due to psychological reactance following a restrictive mediation interaction leading the adolescent toward defiant behavior. A survey of undergraduate students (N = 483) was conducted to investigate the process of psychological reactance as a mediating factor in the relationship between restrictive parental mediation and three boomerang effects: negative attitude toward parents, positive attitude toward restricted content, and intention to view restricted content with friends. Results revealed that a direct effect was present between restrictive mediation and attitude toward parent, but not between restrictive mediation and attitude toward restricted content or intention to view restricted content with friends. Moreover, the reactance process fully mediated the relationship for attitude toward restricted content and intention to view restricted content with friends, but only partially mediated attitude toward parents.",Cutting Edge Research on Parental Mediation of their Children's Media Use,Children Adolescents and the Media

This project strives to incorporate the gendered experience as a source as well as an effect of rhetoric thereby embodying materialist notions of a gendered body at the site of production. Thus, this paper questions the persuasive element of being a gendered worker within the techne of neoliberalism and the flexible workspace. It also contends that rhetoric in this regard incorporates material effects upon the body of the worker. Therefore, defining this project with expectations that the persuasive elements of organizational life -within the contemporary economy- influences workers to follow certain gendered discourses when faced with uncertainty due biopolitical policies. In essence, the materialist embodiment of gender’s immanence lies within rhetoric. One cannot just accept the choice of freedom within the market without being in the intrinsic field of discourse. In this study, rhetoric plays a role in delineating and analyzing potential gendered issues within the market. By acknowledging the inherent nature of rhetoric within governing apparatus, I am able to examine power within discourse and performance as neoliberalism uses the dialogue of rationalized intervention to solve problems of labor through the use of governmental technologies.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0181,2015,Paper Session,Waging Battle Against Wage Inequity Through the Reframing of Social and Personal Narratives of Work and Worth,1,"It’s 2014 and with all the advancement that we’ve made since our most revolutionary eras, women still earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Despite the alarming difference (23 cents!), for many women this wage gap goes unnoticed. Furthermore, even for those who recognize the severity of the gap, its existence is difficult to comprehend because its history is disjointed. Specifically, the wage gap is the result of a variety of forms of sex discrimination in the workplace, including discrimination in hiring, promotion and pay, sexual harassment, occupational segregation, and bias against mothers. Thus, for working women it is important to not only understand how to negotiate for wages, but also to recognize why the wage gap exists, as a more comprehensive knowledge of gender discrimination strengthens arguments against it.
As a trained professional who facilitates workshops on wage negotiations for working women I emphasize the importance of breaking down cultural and social barriers that prevent women from advocating for their worth. In these workshops we focus on helping women reconceptualize social and cultural narratives of employment, emphasizing that they are their own best advocates. As such, the current paper speaks to the personal level shifts that are needed to enable individual women to address the wage gap effectively. Specifically, while still accounting for structural inequalities and discrimination, the current paper hopes to argue for the individual reframing of both social/cultural narratives of work and employment, and personal narratives of self-worth and skill.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0182,2015,Paper Session,Defying the Defensiveless Nature of Working Women,1,"The female body is regularly used as a vehicle for political agendas and capital. These movements, which often frame women as passive victims of failed reform and social unjust, take away agency from the individual and suggest that women are defensiveless. This is not to say that social and political movements, such as those challenging structural inequalities related to wage gaps, are ineffective, but rather that they limit the capacity of individual women to enact change and power on their own accord because they critique organizational policies instead of individual understandings and experiences.
The current paper argues that focusing on skilled labor and human capital creates a more comprehensive space for examining issues related to women in the workplace. Specifically, though critiques and reforms of policies are necessary and useful, they reiterate the very inequalities that create the problems because they focus on structural failings and successes, rather than the abilities of individuals to succeed and fail. In this sense, both the shortcomings and the triumphs of an employee are due to policies and structures. On the other hand, reforms that are designed to increase the number and abilities of skilled and educated workers return the power to the individuals, allowing them to be active in their successes (and failures) in the workplace. This paper will demonstrate the importance of skilled labor and human capital in the fight toward equality in the workplace by showcasing the effectiveness of education based initiatives in a number of cities.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0183,2015,Paper Session,The Discursive Paradox of the Female Leader,1,"Fairhurst (2011) describes the design problem of leadership: “Leaders must figure out what leadership is in the context of what they do and, through their framing and actions, persuade themselves and other people that they are doing it” (p. 350). This design problem of leadership can be especially challenging for women. Female leaders must understand how to behave as a leader in a given context based on others’ assumptions. Further, research has demonstrated that the attributions of leaderly behavior are not always ascribed to the behaviors of men and women similarly (Powell, Butterfield, & Parent, 2002). Directive-giving male managers may be viewed as authoritative, while directive-giving female managers might be viewed as bossy.
This difference in attributions of leadership is due in part to the material nature of communication. All communication is embodied. Ashcraft, Kuhn, and Cooren (2009) explain “…communication is constrained by the body: Performances of identity are limited by physical capacities,” (p. 34). While all organizational members have agency (i.e., the ability to act otherwise) though the discursive construction of their body and identity, not all members have access to all options (e.g., female leaders cannot completely reframe the brute facts of their bodies and subsequent attributions of their behaviors). As such, this paper examines the structural, cultural and interpersonal processes that shape perceptions of female leaders. Further, this paper offers new insights for organization scholarship by employing critical feminist theory as a framework for understanding the material nature of organizational life.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0184,2015,Paper Session,(m)Othering in the Workplace: How Structural and Interpersonal Inequalities Work Against Working Mothers,1,"Historically, motherhood and employment have existed within a resistance-based relationship. Being a good mother means you sacrifice yourself for your children; being a good employee means you sacrifice yourself for your work. These competing narratives are rooted in social, relational, and organizational expectations, and generate fleeting levels of self-worth, confidence, and competence for women who attempt the ‘balancing act’ of working and motherhood. In the workplace these ‘jugglers’ are branded with a scarlet M, a marking of their maternal identity, and an indication to others that they are not fully invested. In terms of their parental responsibilities, these women are often criticized for their lack of commitment. These criticisms take shape internally, as women struggle to come to terms with changing family values, as well as externally where they are constantly fighting for their right to work, often being expected to take on what some call the second and third shifts.
The current work speaks to the structural and interpersonal frameworks that create these struggles, and begins to deconstruct the narrative of ‘the working mother.’ Specifically, by looking at the similarities and differences between formal and informal policies, as well as discourses surrounding these workplace ‘rules’, this paper sheds some light the roots of gender inequality in the workplace. Furthermore, this work highlights the important role that informal interpersonal relationships and communication play in conceptualizations of identity, and thus, this paper argues for a shift in the discursive practices surrounding parenting, and motherhood in particular.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0185,2015,Paper Session,‘You Teach Like a Girl’: A Critical Re-Visitation of Young Women’s Gendered Performances in Pedagogical Settings,1,"Women and their relationship with the teaching profession has historically been an issue in feminist scholarship, as well as in the every day reality of gender performance in pedagogical settings. Because the classroom can prove to be a tenuous zone of gender performance, young female instructors often find their pedagogical identities to be a highly contested performance. Women of many identities entering the teaching profession find themselves attempting to subvert old stereotypes by reproducing masculinity or other identities as a power play, in order to maintain and promote their authority in college classroom settings. While a myriad of scholars have worked with the subject previously, this paper argues for a re-opening of this discussion; especially in the case of young, female instructors. From an organizational standpoint, it also argues that absence of conversations regarding this issue may be highly consequential for young women in beginning their teaching careers.
This paper explores the pedagogical world for women instructors from a critical perspective. Additionally, it argues for a more comprehensive and full-bodied discussion on what pedagogical settings might lose when women instructors face the decision of performing masculinity when it is not their chosen identity. Furthermore, this paper will also discuss the possible implications of forgoing a more intuitive, empathetic, and nurturing classroom dynamic based on a perceived need to subvert archaic gender stereotypes. Finally, this paper will argue that both university systems and scholars of all genders maintain a reflexive position where they constantly critique and self-analyze their own understanding of power in the classroom, and where their particular instructional identity performance came from.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0186,2015,Paper Session,“I Don’t Depend on Men for Shit”: Gender and Labor in Rio de Janeiro’s Funk Movement,1,"Women in Rio de Janeiro’s funk movement (the funkeiras), a contemporary cultural expression that emerged in the city’s slums, face labor-related challenges that are unique to the intersection of their gender and socioeconomic class. This essay investigates how the funkeiras negotiate those challenges in order to make ends meet through music. Based on qualitative interviews with eight artists from Rio’s funk, I establish that some of the issues they face pertain to the movement in general, such as their criminalization by the Brazilian mainstream media and some local governments (Facina, 2009), as well as the tense relationship between artists and the few companies that dominate the industry—having to pay to be played in parties and on the radio, as well as having few venues to perform because of the military occupation of Rio’s favelas, which has ruled funk parties illegal (Lopes, 2011). Other matters are certainly gendered, like the limitations the funk industry and mainstream media impose on their artistic performances of femininity, which are generally deemed inappropriate and vulgar, along with men’s career-boosting promises in exchange for sexual favors, as well as the power imbalances in the relationships between those female artists and their managers, who are mostly men in charge of their careers, and often also their romantic partners (Moreira, 2014). Even with all the barriers a male-dominated funk imposes on women, this study concludes that the funkeiras are still able to negotiate and/or divert from those obstacles, and achieve professional autonomy and some financial independence.",WomXn Working in the Intersections: Intersecting Experiences and Problematics of WomXn in the Workplace,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0187,2015,Paper Session,Lesbians of Color Need Not Apply: Working Towards Equality for Women Who Love Women,1,"For many, the fact that women make $.77 for every $1.00 a man makes is not new information. However, the conversation halts when the discussion turns to queer bodies in the work place, specifically when those queer bodies happen to be of women of color. LGBTQ identified individuals are at higher rates for workplace discrimination and violence, and receive lower pay. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, African American women and Latinas in the United States are paid $18,817 and $23,298 less than non-Hispanic white men yearly, respectively. That’s 64 cents and 55 cents for every dollar a man earns. Given these staggering wage gaps, it is imperative that we examine pay equity and its specific implications for lesbian couples of color.
The current paper hopes to address this specific need for research and information through an examination of the individual and social narratives surrounding queer women of color in the workplace.

Yet few researchers examine how individuals can solicit support when needed. To begin, the current study defines social support seeking and studies retrospective support seeking messages to identify the dimensions on which support seeking messages vary. Three a priori dimensions of support seeking messages are identified from prior literature and seven additional dimensions are identified through an inductive coding process. Using exploratory factor analysis, the ten dimensions are distilled into four support seeking message factors: informativeness, secondary appraisal, politeness, and valence of directed communication behavior. Next, the study examines the relationships between the four message factors and two support outcomes. Results indicate that politeness and the valence of directed communication are related to support receipt and support quality.

One of the major characteristics of bullying behavior is aggression. Aggression is commonly seen in a bully’s vocalic behavior and, in particular, increased volume. Interpersonal distance is another nonverbal behavior that is easily perceived but may go unnoticed in bullying interactions. Patterson’s sequential model of arousal (1976; 1982) is used as a foundation to explain the effects of speaking volume and distance between a bully and a victim on third-person perceptions of bullying intensity. Bullying is predicted to be perceived as most intense when the distance between the bully and victim is short and the bully speaks loudly",Always There When I Need You!: Providing Social Support in Close Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

While relevance is individually oriented, resonance is oriented collectively; thus, it is an important concept in extending the role of public relations in fostering civil society, social capital, and deliberative democracy (Kent, 2013; Sommerfeldt, 2011; Taylor, 2013). To that end, this paper seeks to build conceptual connections between public segmentation sharing (Grunig, 1978, 1989; Kim & Grunig, 2011) , social movements, and organizational communication research.

2015-0196,2015,Paper Session,Toward a Model of Government-Public Relationship With Digital Publics in Crisis,1,"This study seeks to test a model of government-public relationship (GPR) with digital publics in crisis. Using the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster in South Korea, an online survey with 545 social media users was conducted to examine the government crisis through suggested model. The model introduces communicative actions (positive and negative expression) as its dependent variable. To explain communicative actions, the model introduces two-way symmetrical communication efforts, the four factors of GPR, and crisis outcomes. This study reports the supporting evidence for the model based on Structural equation modeling (SEM) testing survey data.",Best Student Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations
2015-0197,2015,Paper Session,An Affective Turn for Public Relations,1,"This paper suggests affect theory as a new theoretical approach for PR. I first review how affect and emotion have been treated in areas of PR literature including organizational theory, crisis communication, and activism. I argue that PR scholarship has generally treated affect and emotion interchangeably, simplistically, and often quantitatively. Further, PR research is often aimed at “fixing” ""ugly feelings"" (e.g., unhappiness, anger) rather than understanding them as symptoms of larger social problems or sources of productive agency. Next, I suggest affect theory, inspired by feminist and postmodern traditions, as an innovative perspective for understanding affect in PR research. Affect theory problematizes nomothetic treatments of affect as discrete, isolatable, and quantifiable, adding conceptual depth and complexity that can help scholars understand dimensions and functions of affect that otherwise escape us. I conclude with future research directions for an affective turn in public relations.",Best Student Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations
2015-0198,2015,Paper Session,The Practical Paradox of Technology: The Influence of Communication Technology Use on Employee Well-Being,3,"Technological advancements in the workplace produce contrasting consequences, by facilitating greater accessibility and efficiency while also enabling increased interruptions and an unpredictable work environment. This study combines insights from organizational paradoxes and the Job Demands –Resources (JD-R) model to present a framework identifying the underlying positive and negative mechanisms in the relationship between communication technology use (CTU) and employee well-being, operationalized as work related burnout and work engagement. As hypothesized, our model (N=663) demonstrates that CTU increases well-being through positive pathways (accessibility and efficiency) and decreases well-being through negative pathways (interruptions and unpredictability). This study underlines the importance of simultaneously studying the CTU resources and demands to fully grasp the relationship between CTU and employee well-being. Also, it highlights the importance of considering the downsides of CTU for a successful implementation of new communication technologies or flexible work designs.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication

Using survey data from an online peer production community and structural equation modeling, this study demonstrates that motivational factors alone cannot fully predict outcomes of CBPP. How people perceive their freedom in setting their own agenda affects their confidence in producing CBPP artefacts. It further provides evidence that how individuals perceive their own ability in peer production significantly affects their relationships with the collective. This study contributes to the literature on CBPP and online collective action by highlighting the value of open governance and efficacy.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication
2015-0200,2015,Paper Session,The Creation of Information Goods in Online Knowledge-Sharing Communities,4,"Online knowledge-sharing communities continue to grow considerably. Two issues of both scholarly and practical interest are what actions can be considered contributions to an online knowledge-sharing community, and what factors influence whether individuals will be more (or less) contributive over time to the continuous creation of an open, online information good. To answer these questions, we first review past literature on information public goods and online communities, and then point to the various assumptions that these studies rely on to make their claims. We argue that because of these context-dependent assumptions, the models need modifications to apply to open online knowledge-sharing communities. In particular, our theoretical argument proposes two extensions to information goods models of collective action for online knowledge-sharing communities, and develop several propositions that can be tested in the context of online communities. We conclude with implications for this model, as well as future directions for empirical research.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication

The unique capacities of social media afford organizations to share knowledge in, across, and between organizations. The primary goal of this study is to explore the influence of social media on organizational learning practices. Using a grounded analysis approach, we conducted and analyzed 30 interviews with social media managers. The findings revealed three main themes related to organizational learning on social media: (1) creating knowledge on social media, (2) learning through collaborating with others, and (3) learning from practice and experience. The findings introduce important theoretical considerations concerning the role of communities of practice on social media and the blurred contextual boundaries for organizational learning on social media.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication
2015-0202,2015,Paper Session,Enterprise Social Media as a Multifunction Public Good: The Role of Perceived Critical Mass in Motivating Differential Use,3,"Organizations are increasingly adopting Enterprise Social Media (ESM) technologies to facilitate increased knowledge sharing among employees. However, despite positive expectations regarding the attractiveness of these technologies, empirical studies indicate that ESM implementations are plagued by low participation. This study recognizes ESM as a public good and considers how use of the technology is influenced by the presence or absence of a critical mass of users and content. Specifically, this study uses a case study of workers’ perceptions of ESM at a large professional service firm to develop a model demonstrating how individual ESM use is influenced by perceived critical mass, and that this influence operates differently depending upon the stage of ESM use and whether workers intend to use the technology to connect with coworkers or access information. The unique contribution of this study is the reciprocal nature of the model where continued technology use is influenced by a perceived critical mass, and a perceived critical mass is influenced by continued use.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication

2015-0204,2015,Paper Session,Project Managers’ Communication Behaviors and Their Relation to Information Systems Use : An Exploratory Study,3,"There is considerable interest in characteristics of project managers that are associated with their effective performance, especially with regard to their communication competencies in team settings. However, efforts to develop a research-based framework of “effective” project managers' behaviors must consider a complex array of project sizes, duration, complexities, pace, objectives, constraints, and managerial styles. This study examined a broader set of communication behaviors associated with project managers across several industries. Key finding from the purposive sample (n = 160) of project management team members revealed significant differences between the importance of messy talk, open communication environment, and initiating structure and planning and their actual reported use in project teams. Analyses further indicated that actual reported communication behaviors and information system use significantly predicted project success. These findings offer tentative insight into the importance of communication behaviors role in project settings in general and in project managers' actions in particular.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication

2015-0206,2015,Paper Session,The Nonlinear Design Trajectories of Cyberinfrastructure: How Organizational Factors Play Out in the Development and Diffusion of Big Data Software for e-Science,1,"Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is a complex ecosystem based on different technologies and participating groups. The design of CI’s big data software and its trajectory is nonlinear and emergent. Based on a qualitative analysis of 66 interviews, the study suggests that specifications in funding solicitations and framing of projects to leverage funders’ prior investments are two key factors of how an experimental software project gets selected for design and development. Furthermore, adaptation to new funding solicitations, usefulness in another scientific domain through coincidental technology transfer efforts, and prospect to generate future funding are three nonlinear ways the designs of a piece of experimental software can be rationalized as appropriate solutions to new problems, thus attracting continuing funding and development. The nonlinear factors operate in complex ways among three main groups of participants: domain scientists, supercomputing centers, and funding agencies. These three groups of participants actively shape the design, decision making, development, and diffusion of CI software applications, under the influence of various organizational factors and each other’s independent goals.","B.E.S.T.: Organizations, Communication, and Technology",Organizational Communication
2015-0207,2015,Paper Session,Led it on Reddit: An Exploratory Study Examining Factors of Opinion Leadership on Reddit,8,"This study offers an exploratory examination of online opinion leadership in Reddit. Unlike other social networking sites, Reddit provides a space for semi-anonymous posting and commenting, in which the only identifiable user traits are karma, a reputation score based on posting and commenting, and length of time on the site. Both posts and comments can be identified by a netvote, which reflects the number of upvotes and downvotes a contribution receives from readers. This study examines posts and comments of political subreddits with large and medium readership status. Highly voted posts generate more top-level and total comments, and a small percentage of highly active posters engage in conversations by posting and commenting. This study also finds that karma plays a significant role in predicting high levels of posting or commenting, while longevity does not.

But who reaps the participatory potential of Twitter, Facebook and other similar services? Is it people who are already inclined to protest or, rather, those who would otherwise remain demobilized? We tackle the role played by social media use on gaps in protest participation by analyzing survey data from 17 countries (N = 27,744) in Latin America—a region with deeply ingrained political and socioeconomic inequalities that, nevertheless, has witnessed a reemergence of protest movements. Results confirm that using social media for political purposes significantly increases the chances of protesting, even after controlling for several common predictors. More importantly, the findings suggest that social media may reduce gaps in protest behavior associated to individuals’ resources, psychological engagement with politics, and social recruitment networks. While these results are in line with optimistic accounts of the Internet and citizenship, they are not a panacea: socioeconomic gaps in protest remain unaltered and, moreover, the reduction of other traditional inequalities is rather weak.",Social Influence in Social Media,Communication and Technology

We base our argument on heightening pertinence of issue publics in the late modern societies and digital media environment, where life politics become central in contemporary politics. We ask how they view the case of smoking and e-cigarettes, how they politicize and mobilize around the issue by utilizing digital media, and how they construct the meanings of such politicization and build identities around issue engagement. Our preliminary findings suggest that, they define and frame the issues as “values and principles” and are actively constructing their identities around smoking and vaping by emphasizing the civic-nature of issue engagement as well as “scientific” engagement. Findings also suggest significant role of digital media, as well as implications for moving beyond mass-oriented anti-smoking campaigns.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0212,2015,Paper Session,Systematic Review of Measures Used in Graphic Cigarette Pack Warning Experiments,5,"Graphic cigarette pack warnings are a common tobacco control strategy worldwide, and experiments are commonly used to evaluate such warnings. We sought to better understand measures used in graphic cigarette pack warning experiments, describe their psychometric properties, and provide recommendations for future studies. We identified 128 measures assessing 40 constructs from 37 studies. Most measures came from three categories of the Message Impact Framework: warning reactions, perceived message effectiveness, and attitudes and beliefs. There was great variability in outcomes that studies assessed, measures used, and names for outcomes. Lack of consensus on outcome measures has created a fragmented literature and reduced our ability to synthesize findings across studies. Recommendations for future studies include a greater emphasis on theoretically informed measures, use of reliable and validated (preferably multi-item) measures, and better reporting of measure source. Implications of these results for measurement in tobacco warnings and health communication research will be discussed.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0213,2015,Paper Session,The Association Between E-Cigarette Information Scanning and Cognitions Among Youth and Young Adults: Does Current Tobacco Use Matter?,4,"E-cigarettes are affordable and accessible, are promoted and advertised, and sometimes can be used in public places. Routine exposure to e-cigarette information in the media and through conversations may shape cognitions about e-cigarettes. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between e-cigarette information scanning and related cognitions, and to explore whether current tobacco use moderates this relationship. We collected a nationally representative telephone sample of 13 – 25 year olds from June – October 2014 (N = 1150). Multiple regressions indicated that scanning was universally associated with normative beliefs, and pro-e-cigarette beliefs about the consequences of use, but not with self-efficacy to stop use. Only tobacco users showed a significant association of scanning with intentions to use e-cigarettes. Future research needs to investigate what kind of information about e-cigarettes is prevalent in the current public communication environment and whether prior scanning predicts later behavior in a longitudinal design.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0214,2015,Paper Session,"The Relationship Between Knowledge, Tobacco Use, and Support for Vape-Free Policies: A Motivated Reasoning Perspective",3,"State and local jurisdictions are implementing policies to restrict the use of e-cigarettes (vaping) in smoke-free venues. Lack of public support could adversely impact successful policy implementation and enforcement. Applying motivated reasoning theory, we predict of young adults’ support for vaping restrictions in smoke-free venues.
Data were from nationally representative panel of US households (N=1227). Separate step-wise ordinal logistic regression analyses, weighted to the US population, were completed for support for restrictions on vaping in bars and on college campuses.
Daily smokers were less likely to support campus vaping restrictions. There was a significant interaction between knowledge and e-cigarette use such past users (compared to never users) with greater knowledge of e-cigarettes were more likely to support vaping restrictions on campus. Greater levels of perceived risk were associated with more support for vaping restrictions in both contexts and greater levels of marketing exposure were associated with reduced support.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0215,2015,Paper Session,Public Perceptions of Health Literacy and Associated Stigma,6,"Health literacy (HL) is a serious concern in the US as approximately one-third to one-half of Americans experience difficulty obtaining, understanding, and/or acting appropriately on health information. Low HL is associated with a number of negative outcomes throughout an individuals’ life span such as more frequent and longer hospitalizations, difficulty managing chronic health conditions, and challenges navigating the healthcare system. These issues may be exacerbated because individuals with lower HL often hide their challenges from medical practitioners due to a perceived stigma associated with low HL. A nationally representative sample (N=265) of participants took an online survey that measured stigmatized perceptions about individuals with low HL. Preliminary findings suggest certain situations (e.g., a parent with low health literacy incorrectly administering medication to a child) elicit greater stigma than others.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore multiple layers of illness identity and social support in relation to a specific treatment decision. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 46) were conducted with cancer patients. Patients were recruited from four cancer clinics if they were offered a randomized cancer clinical trial as a treatment option. Preliminary results suggest a possible relationship between individuals’ illness identity, received social support, and clinical trials decision. Implications for future clinical trial interventions are discussed.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0217,2015,Paper Session,Who Provide Care to Dementia Caregivers?,2,"This qualitative study investigates functions of family support in the lives of caregivers who take care of their close family members with dementia. In Singapore there were 22,000 persons estimated to suffer from dementia in 2005 and the number is expected to exceed 50,000 by 2020 (Alzheimer’s Disease Association of Singapore, 2009). Singapore is situated in a cultural context that emphasizes filial piety and strong family bonds. As such, close family members, especially adult daughters, are expected to take the role of primary caregivers. Past studies indicate that caregivers face much tangible, intangible, and health strain during the prolonged caregiving process (Niederehe & Frugé, 1984). Thus, it is pertinent to investigate the types of support that caregivers receive to maintain their well-being and to continue the provision of care to dementia patients.

Extant literature suggests that social support functions through three main modes: physical, informational, and emotional (Cohen, 2004; Cutrona & Suhr, 1992; Landale & Oropesa, 2001; Queenan et al., 2010). Physical support includes the provision of tangible good and services such as money, groceries, physical companionship, and transportation. Informational support functions through communication that provides useful or needed information relevant to a person’s decision making. Emotional support fulfills a person’s emotion and affection needs, which yields the feeling of being cared and loved (Langford et al., 1997; Schaefer, Coyne, & Lazarus, 1981). In this paper we seek to explore the support that caregivers receive from their close family members. To better understand the functions of support in family dynamics, we developed the following research question: How is support being communicated within immediate family context?

We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with caregivers who identified themselves as the primary care providers of family members with dementia. A University Institutional Review Board approved our research. With help from the Alzheimer’s Disease Association of Singapore (ADA), we recruited participants by sending invitation emails to caregivers registered in the ADA database. In total twenty participants completed the interview. The duration of each interview was about 60-90 minutes. Each interview began with general questions such as the relationship between the participant and the dementia patient and the experience of being a caregiver. The major interview questions asked different types of support that participants received from their family, the significance of family support in the caregiving process, and the impact of family support on participants’ management of their health as well as their care of dementia patients.

The majority of our participants were females (N = 18), aged from 40 to 75, with the exception of one 23-year-old. Fourteen participants took care of their parents, two took care of in-laws, three took care of their spouses, and the 23-year-old took care of her grandmother. The length of caregiving ranged from 1.5 years to 12 years.

Results of the thematic analysis illustrated that participants drew financial resources to sustain their caregiving from personal income, pension, or children’s income. For day to day physical care, participants acquired physical support mostly from maids insofar the financial conditions allowed. Siblings may chip in financially, but their emotional support was rather missing. Informational support came directly from the medical site instead of from close family members. In addition, the patients also had other medical problems like diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. Hence, much information support was medically driven for the patients, rather than revolved around caregivers’ health needs and ways of adjusting their lives. Findings from this study reveal meaning of how family support is communicated and enacted in the area of dementia caregiving and provide implications for support programs tailored to caregivers in the Singapore context.","Smoking, Stigma, Social Support: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

When traditional communication channels became non-operational, non-traditional information sources and communication platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, became salient. In-depth interviews with 36 individuals from various groups—government officials, journalists, and citizens—yielded three large themes that speak to the social functions served by social media during the disaster. First, social media became a platform for survivors to tell their friends and family that they were alive. Second, social media also became a venue for survivors to collectively cope with their family, friends, and fellow survivors. Finally, social media provided a means for residents to participate in the social construction of their experiences.

A critical discourse analysis of interview text conducted with community leaders, facilitators of NGOs, and government representatives, illuminates how stakeholders construct and produce discourses about environment, development, and sustainability. Competing meanings were identified regarding notions of nature, progress, and conservation. It is argued that these different meanings correspond to the stakeholders’ positions and locations within the process. Thus, NGOs and government representatives have an instrumental approach to nature, a state-driven understanding of progress, and an apolitical and ahistorical notion of conservation. On the contrary, communities have a sense of communion with nature, a wary interpretation of progress, and a political and historical stewardship grounded in the notion of territory. This study closes suggesting that competing and contesting meanings are symptomatic of an environmental crisis that in the end is an epistemic crisis.",Media and Communities Across the Life Span: Facing an Environmental Crisis,Environmental Communication
2015-0221,2015,Paper Session,Notes From the Field: Living With Colonialism and Environmental Injustice in Puerto Rico,1,"Puerto Rico is the world’s oldest, still existing colony. Its life as an unincorporated U.S. territory has been imbued with discourses of “progress,” which have helped legitimize innumerable environmental and other injustices against Puerto Ricans throughout the years. Drawing on two months of fieldwork in Puerto Rico during the summer of 2014, this paper examines how colonial logics are (re)produced and resisted discursively by attending to community member struggles for livability against environmental injustice. This focus reveals that conqueror ideologies and policies have functioned to significantly restrict quality of life and sometimes life itself for Puerto Ricans. The essay argues that copresence, or the researcher’s presence in the field, is essential for nuancing and better understanding the complexities, challenges, and possibilities of communication research interested in transnational, multilingual, and multicultural contexts. Using Puerto Rico as a case study, this paper offers “translating field rhetorics” and “the field-text” as instructive concepts for researching diverse settings and groups. This essay, in a decolonizing effort, foregrounds marginalized voices and explores the stakes of ethnographic practices for intervening in the still very “live” discursive colonial apparatus and the ways in which this approach might illuminate how colonialism evolves over time—in Puerto Rico and beyond.",Media and Communities Across the Life Span: Facing an Environmental Crisis,Environmental Communication

So far, the scientific discourse on visual ethics has mostly focused on visual research ethics and the ethical norms within professional fields of mass-media production, neglecting ethical and moral dimensions of mundane visual practices. The paper illustrates the necessity of a critical engagement with “ethical practices” in the field of visual everyday communication, using various areas of conflict regarding the production, distribution, and use of images (e.g. non-consensual photo sharing, reproduction of visual stereotypes in selfies) as starting points for the discussion.

2015-0224,2015,Paper Session,A Rubric for Transcultural Visual Media Production,1,"The purpose of this project was to create a rubric from which researchers and filmmakers can begin producing media different from the existing English language, jargon-laden, instructional videos currently in use in the American healthcare industry. From this rubric, one video detailing a clinic visit was produced, screened for a diverse audience and evaluated for its efficacy. This video utilized only images to convey information in an attempt to circumvent the confusion that may result while viewing media in a foreign language. The details of the video’s screening and feedback sessions are included in a separate paper. This paper focuses on the video production rubric and the visual communication theories that provided its framework. The overarching strategy behind this production guide was to create media that was more comprehensible to a culturally diverse viewership by excluding the use of some representations (such as verbal or written language, symbols, graphs or diagrams) because their meanings are arbitrary and culturally assigned. Instead, this rubric recommends presenting procedures in as direct and uncomplicated a manner as possible. To reduce the tedium of such a straightforward approach, the resultant video was structured as a narrative involving characters that model appropriate and inappropriate behavior, allowing for the occasional opportunity for physical comedy. This paper lists each of the formal filmmaking strategies considered in this rubric (shot composition, editing, mise-en-scène, representation, and casting) and details the workability of these tactics during a film shoot.",Advances in Visual Communication Studies: New Challenges and New Frameworks,Visual Communication Studies

Habits, since they are stored in more primitive areas of the brain, are expected to have roots in deeper, stable facets of personality, which are also located in the same areas of the brain. Cognitive processes, because they are contextually bound, are premised on assessments of information adequacy. The relative influence of habits and processing are examined using an experiment where individuals are phished via email. The results suggest that habits are stronger among individuals who rate high in conscientiousness and low in emotional stability, with information adequacy having no effect. Overall, email habit caused more than a two-fold increase in individual victimization.",Focusing Theories on Communication and Technology #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0228,2015,Paper Session,Effects of Group Response on Continued Newcomer Participation in Online Groups,2,"The study examines the influence of mediated-communication and interaction on continued participation of newcomers in online social groups. It investigates the effects of various group responses on the continued newcomer participation in a large online Question & Answer community, Stack Overflow. The quantitative analysis of 67,399 newcomers in Stack Overflow shows that different group responses would predict different patterns of newcomer participation in online groups. Existing group members’ helpfulness to newcomers’ first help request positively predicts newcomers’ intention to stay in the group as a help seeker as well as their transition to help others. Having a group sanction decreases a newcomer’s probability to help others but increases the likelihood to seek for help again in the short run. Group assessment of a newcomer’s first question is not significantly related to newcomers’ continued participation as help seeker, but significantly increased the likelihood of newcomers to help others.",Focusing Theories on Communication and Technology #3,Communication and Technology

They also allow others to share information about us, which can threaten our online identities. This study investigates the effects of face-threatening information in SNS using an experiment (N=120) in which pairs of friends posted about each other on Facebook. This study tested the effects on embarrassment of: the content shared, relationship to the target, individual differences, and network characteristics, as well as emotional, behavioral, and technical responses. Results show that embarrassment due to information shared by others depends primarily on how well that information captures the individual’s identity and its perceived audience, while relationships with the target and the audience inform strategies for dealing with the information. These findings inform our understanding of how embarrassment is shaped by technology and how this technology can better arm individuals against the effects of shared face-threatening information.",Focusing Theories on Communication and Technology #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0230,2015,Paper Session,An Examination of the Moderating Role of Group-Identification in the Peer Norm-Mediated Media Influence,2,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted among college students (N = 609) to understand the influence of media exposure on binge drinking intentions with norm (i.e., descriptive norm and injunctive norm) perceptions as mediators and group identification as a moderator. The results of the survey showed that perceived peer binge drinking prevalence (i.e., descriptive norm) and perceived peer approval of binge drinking (i.e., injunctive norm) mediated the effect of prodrinking media contents on college students’ binge drinking intentions. People’s injunctive norm perceptions, rather than their descriptive norm perceptions, interacted with group identification to influence people’s binge drinking intentions. Our moderated mediation analysis further showed that the conditional indirect media influence on binge drinking intentions through the injunctive norm perceptions was stronger for these who highly identify with their university peers.However, the conditional indirect media influence on binge drinking intentions through the descriptive norm perceptions didn’t differ for people at different level of group identification.

Despite celebrities’ lack of medical expertise and concern from federal officials about the amount of misleading dietary claims in the media, many individuals believe dietary misinformation. An experiment (n = 466) builds upon appraisal and social cognitive theories to analyze a theoretical model whereby audience involvement (e.g., identification, parasocial interaction, and liking) as well as social norms shape subsequent affective and cognitive reactions, which in turn foster susceptibility to misinformation. A second experiment (n = 303) tested potential strategies for countering celebrity-espoused dietary misinformation and identified keys variables (identification and injunctive norms) that underscore effective remedies.",Health Communication Media Effects,Mass Communication

Using an experimental design that manipulated comparison direction by exposing participants to the beginning and/or the ending of a weight loss reality program, the present study found that different comparison directions contributed to specific emotions and health behaviors. Those who made more upward health comparisons felt more envy, which in turn contributed to increased health behavioral intent. Further, upward comparisons led individuals to consume more healthy snacks, and downward comparisons led individuals to consume more unhealthy snacks. This experiment indexes the importance of discrete emotions in social comparison processes, and highlights the need for research on nuanced comparison behavior that evolves as characters evolve.",Health Communication Media Effects,Mass Communication

We theorized that the relationship between media use and individual-level knowledge would be stronger when community-level knowledge was low than when community-level knowledge was high. An analogous hypothesis was formulated for individual- and community-level attitudes. Data come from the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (N = 12,608 women and 1,237 men) conducted in Nepal. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS and stigma toward people living with HIV were the two dependent variables. Study hypotheses were tested 12 times: across the use of three media (newspaper, radio, television) x two study outcomes (knowledge and attitudes) x two genders. Community-level knowledge and attitudes were significantly associated with individual-level knowledge and attitudes. Predicted interactions were supported in nine of the twelve tests.

To fill this gap in literature, this study examined the framing of childhood autism news stories in U.S.-based local and national newspapers. Based on previous studies, the following five major news frames were identified and measured: (a) attribution of responsibility, (b) human interest, (c) conflict, (d) morality, and (e) economic consequences. Under the theoretical framework of framing theory, a content analysis of news stories was conducted to investigate the presence of the five news frames using an established 20-item questionnaire. Findings revealed that news stories about autism were largely framed as human interest pieces. Furthermore, the study disclosed local and national newspapers tended to adopt different frames for childhood autism. Articles published in different sections also showed varied preferences on employing the five frames.","Health News: Autism, Hep B, HIV",Health Communication

By dividing the 28 years into three stages based on the time when the important government AIDS prevention policy came out, this study found that the Chinese government-controlled news agency paid more attention to HIV/AIDS during 1996-2003, while after 2003 the Chinese media showed fatigue in reporting the disease. This study also examined four news frames applied in the AIDS stories from Xinhua wire news. It found that the Xinhua wire news was more likely to frame the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a disease in foreign countries and applied more thematic frames than episodic frames during the 28 years of coverage. The affected social groups and dominant themes in the Xinhua wire news, however, varied in the three stages.","Health News: Autism, Hep B, HIV",Health Communication

As a longitudinal study in the U.S. context, the study analyzes and compares news indexes, public opinion polls and reality indicators based on a ten-year time frame from 2001 to 2010. Overall, the results show that the news media especially the newspapers had a certain degree of agenda-setting effects on the public opinion regarding the most urgent health problems and issues. But the news coverage had little to do with the reality indicators. These findings call into question the responsibility of journalists in providing a complete and proportional representation of health concerns.

A combined quantitative (n=1000) and qualitative (n=50) analysis of comic email forwards circulated among Israeli students traced: (1) the extent to which Israeli students share local content, global content and various combinations thereof; (2) the mechanisms through which local affiliation is established in verbal and visual texts. The results show that while Israelis' ""humorous diet"" is mainly non-local, a pervasive use of the Hebrew vernacular plays an important role in creating affinity. We identified five main discursive frames signaling locality: Presumed locality, Dramatized locality, Ex(im)ported locality, Banal localization and Estranged localization. A comparative analysis of these categories reveals that counter intuitively, in contemporary digital culture verbal humor often functions as a covert globalizing agent whereas visual humor is associated with overt significations of local-global tensions.","Transnational Media, Cultural Knowledge, and Local/Global Identities",Popular Communication

Guided by social and ideological criticism, it offers a deconstruction of the Lifetime TV series Devious Maids to demonstrate how Puerto Ricans continue to be portrayed according to conventional Latino/a Hollywood stereotypes that reinforce the hegemonic values of a collective non-Latino/a community. This distortion results in the failure to acknowledge the co-existence of both American and ethnic Puerto Rican cultural traits among Puerto Ricans living on the mainland, and rejects them as equal participants in overall US society.","Transnational Media, Cultural Knowledge, and Local/Global Identities",Popular Communication

This programme is part of a wider trend in reality television where shows use certain representational strategies to make fun of working-class participants’ behaviours, ideas and lifestyles. The analysis shows in detail how different semiotic resources are combined to represent the participants’ mental processes and achieve comic effects. This trend is discussed within a framework of an ongoing discursive shift in which the working class is devalued. We are increasingly beginning to find what Levitas (1998) calls “a moral underclass discourse” that puts the blame for social exclusion on the culture of the excluded themselves. This discourse has gained particular prominence through the neo-liberal ideas that permeate the current political agenda and public debates.","Transnational Media, Cultural Knowledge, and Local/Global Identities",Popular Communication

Through a case study of the series’ respective depictions of Canada, the paper argues that spatial dynamics inherent to the format privilege either globalized or centralized conceptions of national identity that obscure or reframe regionalism, demonstrating the challenge of hyperliminal rituals to capture the complexity of place-identity through its transitory movement through social and cultural space.","Transnational Media, Cultural Knowledge, and Local/Global Identities",Popular Communication

This paper starts from a political economic review of transcultural TV in China, followed by a structural analysis of the online sphere of transcultural TV fandom. Through a textual analysis of posts on the Baidu post bar for fans, this paper shows how Chinese fans interpret one recent American political TV drama, House of Cards, according to two themes of contradiction: authentic/unauthentic and foreign/indigenous. When interpreting the depiction of American politics in the show as authentic, the fans were not hesitant to say that the depiction of Chinese politics is unauthentic. By contrasting the “real” American politics depicted in the show and the “real” Chinese politics based on personal experience, the identity struggle of being Chinese in the contemporary conditions of a network society is explored in the fans’ discourses.","Transnational Media, Cultural Knowledge, and Local/Global Identities",Popular Communication

Despite its emerging prevalence, speed-driven journalism has received scant attention in scholarly research. Through semi-structured interviews with journalists and a between-subject experiment with 220 U.S. adult Internet users, this mixed-method study finds that speed-driven news production is influenced by a perceptual disconnect—that is, journalists are wrong at times in their assessment of how audiences are affected by new media technology, but nonetheless proceed to produce news and content based upon their mistaken judgment. In particular, whereas most interviewees believed that speed negatively affects audiences’ perceived news credibility, the experiment revealed that speed does not have such an effect.

Cognitive development was also tested as a moderator perceived realism. Results from a survey of 163 Belgian adolescents between 12 and 18 years old indicated that overall television exposure did not contribute to dysfunctional relationship beliefs either directly (aside for belief in love at first sight) or indirectly. However, perceived realism was found to fully mediate endorsement of idealization and one and only beliefs, and partially mediate overall dysfunctional relationship beliefs and endorsement of love finds a way. Although no indirect effects were found for love at first sight, both overall media exposure and romantically-oriented media exposure were significant predictors.

Yet, often fans’ attachments to media figures are dismissed as frivolous elements of teen life and belittled or ignored psychology and communications literatures (Jenkins, 1992; Caughey, 1984; Willis, 1972; Duffett, 2013). This project provides insight into the experience of parasocial love in adolescence, specifically, the uses and gratifications of these relationships. In a series of in-depth focus groups, college women discussed their adolescent experiences with romantic attachment to media figures. Fiske’s (1992) concepts of enunciative and semiotic productivity and Bourdieu’s (1984) discussion of cultural capital are applied to the emergent focus group themes and reflect participants’ focus on social ties, identity development, and romantic socialization.

Egocentrism was measured as Imaginary Audience ideation and Personal Fable ideation, two distinct concepts of adolescent egocentrism. We also examined whether age moderates the aforementioned relationship. A total of 381 participants completed the survey instrument. The sample consisted of adolescents from two high schools and college students in the Netherlands. Results indicated a positive relationship between Imaginary Audience ideation and Facebook self-disclosure. Also, more narcissistic adolescents disclosed more on Facebook than less narcissistic adolescents. However, this effect became weaker when controlling for Imaginary Audience ideation. Finally, Imaginary Audience was related to Facebook self-disclosure for all age groups except 19-22. Thus, adolescent egocentrism is a somewhat stronger a predictor of online self-disclosure than narcissism.","Finding Myself, for Better or Worse: Adolescents and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

The purpose of the study is to examine physiological predictors of the development of PVGU across adolescence. The paper involves a 1-year longitudinal study across mid-adolescence. Participants were 374 adolescents and their parents from a large metropolitan area in the Northwest USA. PVGU was assessed via questionnaire, as were a number of control variables. A number of physiological indicators including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and galvanic skin conductance (SC) (indicies of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity respectively) were measured during baseline, a cognitively stimulating task (Rubik’s cube) and a family problem solving task. Less RSA withdrawal to a cognitively simulating task was related to greater pathological video game symptoms, but less RSA withdrawal to a family problem solving task was associated with the presence of pathological video game symptoms (p<.05). For girls only, SC activation during the family problem solving was related to greater pathological video game symptoms (p<.01). These findings suggest that adolescents who do not find cognitive tasks physiologically stimulating have a greater severity of PVGU. Additionally, adolescents who show physiological signs of stress in a family task were more likely to have PVGU symptoms, and for girls only, have more severe PVGU levels. This study is the first to show that physiological indicators predict PVGU over time in adolescence and has important implications regarding the prevention and treatment of PVGU in adolescence.","Finding Myself, for Better or Worse: Adolescents and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

The present study aimed to explain adolescents’ preferences and moral judgments of media portraying antisocial behaviors from social exclusion and peer pressure. We designed an experiment in which social exclusion (vs. acceptance) was manipulated. Then, participants were presented descriptions of media-clips which were combined with either approving, disapproving, or no peer comments in a YouTube format to manipulate peer pressure. Results showed that socially-excluded adolescents made more permissible moral judgments of the antisocial behaviors portrayed in the media and reported higher preferences for such contents compared to their accepted counterparts. As for peer pressure, media preferences were highest when peers approved the media content. Interestingly, peer pressure did instigate moral permissibility in socially-accepted adolescents, but did not affect the moral judgments of socially-excluded adolescents.

Nevertheless, research on what makes young people susceptible to the occurrence of this relationship is scarce. The current study examined the behavioral activation (BAS) and inhibition system (BIS) as moderators of the relationship between soap opera viewing and alcohol attitudes. Previous research showed associations between both systems and risk behavior. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a sample of 922 adolescents (Mage=14.96 years, SD=.85, 56% girls). Regression analyses showed that soap opera viewing is associated with positive attitudes towards alcohol use. Additionally, moderation analyses indicated that BAS did not moderate this relationship. In contrast, BIS acted as a moderator of this relationship and showed the relationship between soap opera viewing and positive alcohol attitudes was only significant for adolescents with a low BIS-profile.","Finding Myself, for Better or Worse: Adolescents and Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

A survey for 12-18 year old Flemish adolescents (n=1,640) measured two emotional regulation strategies (reappraisal and suppression), music importance, and the use of music as an expression of identity. Besides confirming what has been known in previous research, the study showed that gender is an important moderator in these relationships. A parsimonious structural equations model for each gender was composed. This paper contributes to the understanding of the relationship between music and emotions by focusing on gender while demonstrating that emotion regulation processes predict the importance adolescents attach to music and their perception of music as an expression of their identity.

As Janet Abbate (2012) contends in Recoding Gender, STEM fields remain male dominated, lacking sustained professional opportunities for women to enhance both technological aptitude and attitude. Women’s labor continues to be devalued and deskilled in both academic and workplace contexts, and both visual rhetorics and economic realities reflect and reinforce this. Thus this presentation addresses two questions: (1) How do the rhetorics of gender/technology reinforce women's techno-realities both historically and culturally? and (2) What types of technofeminist research and curriculum development allow us to challenge the larger cultural assumptions about women's techno-mediated lives?

Just as Abbate historicizes women’s role in the history of computer science, relying heavily on the life histories of her women participants, this presentation will trace larger cultural representations of the relationship between women and technology, relying on classic films such as the 1957 Deskset to the more recent Microsoft Tablet advertising campaign. Despite stereotypical portrayals then and now, as technofeminist scholars, how can we highlight women’s lived experiences with technology both to increase the visibility of these narratives and to use them to bridge the gaps between circulating rhetorics (e.g., advertisements, film, and newer media) and the material conditions of women, which impact their relationships to technology and—as Nadella’s remarks and the current statistics surrounding women’s STEM careers inside and outside the academy suggest—their professional and economic advancement?",Free and Digital Labor of Women: Technofeminist Examinations of Cyber-Inequality and the Politics of (In)visibility,Feminist Scholarship

This push, responding to public demands for a more relevant education at the post secondary level, has been rhetorically positioned as transformative, or brain washing, for those pushing back against service learning. These rhetorics frequently conceal that service learning as a trend is highly gendered, with the vast majority of ""service"" classes led by women, many in already highly precarious positions in relation to their institutions. This gendering contradictorily positions service learning professors in the role of changemaker and servant, a leader of outreach and engagement, but also a free laborer donating (her) expertise in emotional and domestic management.

A technofeminist approach to service learning, however, challenges the gender binaries that plague service learning, positing women as powerful creators and users of digital technologies towards shared community goals. This perspective, influenced primarily by Judy Wacjman (2004) and Liz Losh (2012), will guide the discussion of the service leaning organization MediaNOLA, which I founded in 2008, as a technofeminist pedagogy and politics.",Free and Digital Labor of Women: Technofeminist Examinations of Cyber-Inequality and the Politics of (In)visibility,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0259,2015,Paper Session,"Making a Normal Hyperproductive Ethos: The Gendered Labour of Making and Using Fitbits, Nike Bands, and Jawbone Ups",1,"This paper addresses the gendered tensions existing between the distinct, overproductive female consumer market for newly popular activity trackers (Fitbits, Nike Bands, Jawbone Ups, Samsung Gears, and IWatches) and the strained female labourers globally who produce them. Activity trackers pursue a upper middle classed female consumer who has been normalized as a hyperproductive subject, able to maintain constant pace and productivity to achieve success in family, work and social life. In the digital economy, the flexible and enduring female will fend off economic and job insecurity that plagues the middle class and those left out of the digital job market. Activity trackers offer a popular automated solution to fend off underproductivity. Trackers monitor consistent pace through home, corporate life and exercise regime/leisure time; remind us to walk, sleep, hydrate; and report our results to our digital social networks and coworkers. The ads are gendered female and classed, reifying the ideal female as hyperproductive, multi-tasking, competitive and corporately successful; these biometric managers are offered as tools to meet complex demands for female productivity. The advertisements fails to note the insecure, excessive labour required of the (largely female) workers who build these devices in China, Taiwan, Pakistan, Argentina, and thus forfeit caring for their selves and families. Activity trackers invite us to glorify neoliberal ethics lauding increased productivity and endurance as digital economy labourers, while ignoring the essential hyperwork, and resulting economic insecurity, of women workers who make these devices.",Free and Digital Labor of Women: Technofeminist Examinations of Cyber-Inequality and the Politics of (In)visibility,Feminist Scholarship

At the same time women and girls are being made more and more visible online framed through what Sarah Banet-Weiser would term as ""visibility politics.""
What sorts of shifts are we seeing in relation digital labor, cyberfeminist responses to male-stream internets and materiality in present times? As more and more financial and everyday business activities are moving into digital platforms and women are encouraged to become entreprenuers through domestic space, we see a resurfacing of a particular kind of domestic goddess entrepreneur. However how does the continuing binary of productive vs reproductive labor play out in relation to new domesticity, wom-entrepreneurship and makerspaces?

In regards to the making and connecting within the emerging context of DIY crafting and new domesticity, therefore, we see that what these women engage in is indeed different from the domesticity of their grandmothers and even mothers. Still, this new domesticity certainly plays out differently within hierarchies of race and class.

The present study applies Communication Privacy Management theory to explore the ways adult children (n=52) disclose their estrangement with their parents to members of their social network as well as the ways those social network members react to the disclosure. Findings from a thematic analysis suggest that adult children actively attempted to keep the information surrounding their estrangement private. If social network members learned about the estrangement, it was typically because they were physically present to witness the dissolution. Yet, some participants explained that they were able to talk about the estrangement when they felt it was appropriate, when they had evidence of their abuse, or when they could tell their story as a third party observer. Unfortunately, social network members were often unsupportive.

2015-0262,2015,Paper Session,Measuring Alcohol-Specific Communication With Friends: Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Communication as Multidimensional,3,"According to primary socialization theory, adolescents develop beliefs about alcohol by interacting with peers, as well as other socialization agents. Although communication is essential to this belief-formation process, few studies have identified the specific alcohol-related messages that adolescents exchange with their peers, and more specifically, friends, that lead to certain anti- and/or pro-alcohol-related beliefs. Consequently, the goal of this study was to develop a multidimensional measure of alcohol-specific communication with friends. Based on survey data from 259 high school students, the results indicated that communication with friends involving warnings against drinking alcohol, disapproval of alcohol consumption, and making fun of others for drinking alcohol were negatively related to pro-alcohol beliefs and intentions. Communication with friends involving rumors, teasing each other about drinking alcohol, intentions to drink alcohol, different types of alcohol, experiences with alcohol, and talking about how many peers drink alcohol were positively related to pro-alcohol beliefs and intentions.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Yet, the atheoretical nature of the research on resilience continues to make it an elusive construct. A new theory called the Theory of Resilience and Relational Load (TRL) is advanced to fill this void in the literature. The TRL focuses on resilience/growth as a process of calibration in relationships. Specifically, it examines how relational partners’ and family members’ perceptions of stress and the communicative maintenance of their relationships on a daily basis influence their appraisals and communication during stressful moments. The theory also incorporates elements of ego depletion as a way to explain how these appraisals and communication patterns influence risk and resilience. Finally, the concept of relational load is set forth, which is the wear and tear that chronic stress and depletion of resources (emotional, psychological and relational) during repeated, stress-related conversations have on relationships.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

This study examined interpersonal and relational factors that predict individuals’ perceptions of their efficacy to achieve their weight loss goals. We conducted a longitudinal study in which individuals who were trying to lose weight (N = 120) completed online surveys about their romantic relationship and their weight loss efforts every two weeks for a period of two months. Results indicated that relational uncertainty was positively associated with topic avoidance and negatively associated with enacted talk about weight. Partner facilitation was negatively associated with topic avoidance and positively associated with enacted talk about weight, whereas partner interference was positively associated with topic avoidance about weight. Finally, enacted talk about weight was positively associated with weight loss efficacy. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for promoting relationship behaviors that support individual weight loss efforts.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0265,2015,Paper Session,Digital Inequality and Second-Order Disasters,1,"This article investigates whether new communication technologies can mitigate the consequences of disasters and disaster recovery for affected populations. We pay particular attention to questions of social inequality and how it intersects with digital inequality. Drawing on a long-term ethnography with affected communities recovering from Typhoon Haiyan that hit the Philippines in 2014 triggering a massive humanitarian response, we observe that digital inequality can amplify social inequalities leading to a ‘second order disaster’. This refers to humanly perpetuated disasters that can even surpass the effects of the natural disaster. The fact that some participants are recovering at a rapid pace while others are languishing behind represents a deepening of social inequalities. Those already relatively better off have access to a richer media landscape which they are able to navigate often reaping significant benefits. By contrast, the more disadvantaged participants have access to a diminished media landscape and are less likely to take advantage of any opportunities. Rather than democratising opportunities digital media exacerbate social inequalities by heightening the life chances for the better off, whilst leaving the poorer participants further behind.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0266,2015,Paper Session,Mapping Political Discourse of the Iranian Green Movement,2,"Recognizing the creative political communication strategies initiated by the Iranian Green Movement in June 2009 following disputed Presidential election results is imperative in broadening current narrow conceptualizations of “Arab spring” protests. Our analyses map the character of this discourse as creative, in its strategies, and as transnational, in terms of language, distribution, and gendered expectations. Despite emphases in western media on the prominence of digital media in mobilizing activism, the Green Movement worked through a variety of communications approaches, as versatile as traditional sweet desserts concocted in commemoration of the Tragedy of Karbala inscribed with political statements in cinnamon powder, to graffiti on bus sides, street curbs and walls posting marg bar khamnei (death to Khamnei), and resistance slogans written on national currency. With this latter illustration of money stamped with anti-regime messages such as green victory signs, we consider how the material bill serves as a site for resistance against state-controlled artifacts, re-appropriated as symbolic currency in political protests.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change

It situates place-making as communicative praxis, a thought-action nexus focused on communicating for social and/or political change. Drawing upon historical and ethnographic research of a village in south Lebanon, I trace goals of place-making-as-communicative-praxis that I encountered within face-to-face and mediated discourses among translocal Lebanese about the means and ends of communication. Delineating an emergent mode of communicative praxis oriented toward “being connected,” or associating via a technological device, I note changes over time in translocally shared goals of communicative/connective praxis, as well as changes in the broader communicative values these goals reflect (for instance, communicative values of visibility, representation, or participation). I describe relationships between these shifts in goals and values of praxis and observed processes of place-framing, identity, and memory practices related to the village.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0268,2015,Paper Session,The Content Analysis of Song Sequences in Bollywood Cinema,2,"Bollywood research on the impact of song sequences has slowly emerged over the past decade. In this paper, we utilized extensive content analysis for the first time to compare song sequences with non-song sequences in popular Hindi films in order to map out the impact of liberalization on these sequences within the context of globalization. Given scholars oft-repeated arguments that song sequences represent the essence of Bollywood cinema and provide soft-power appeal, we analyzed those found in 61 years of top-grossing films – one film per year – to identify any structural changes that might impact this appeal. Overall, the data indicated that song sequences have been utilized primarily as vehicles for romantic and sexual content during the 61 year period, and have featured significantly less violent, criminal, political, and geographical content than non-song portions of these films. We conclude that Bollywood song sequences will most likely continue to function as semi-autonomous vehicles for the presentation of Indian romantic content, particularly as part of various soft-power campaigns.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change

Analysis of 70 organizations’ Twitter ad Facebook data from one month before to three months after the typhoon revealed different network mechanisms and the corresponding evolutionary patterns. Specifically, the networks constructed based on Twitter’s features of mentions and retweets were similar to each other while the networks built on Twitter’s replies and Facebook’s tags resembled one another. Overall, the four types of networks were rooted in earlier relationships, yet after temporarily disrupted by the typhoon, these networks were able to be restructured in a dynamic way. In contrast, the interorganizational collaboration on the ground exhibited a consistent and stable pattern of evolution where the relationships in consecutive phases positively influenced one another. Addressing the theoretical and empirical gaps in understanding the emergence and evolution of technological affordances for organizing, findings of this study shed light on the opportunities and constraints in enabling sustainable digital humanitarian organizing.",Top Four Faculty Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0270,2015,Paper Session,Tweeting Supertyphoon Yolanda: Evolving Functions of Twitter During and After a Disaster Event,3,"Abstract
When disaster events capture global attention users of Twitter form transient interest communities that disseminate information and other messages online. This paper examines content related to Yolanda/Haiyan as it hit the Philippines and grew into an international humanitarian concern. It reveals how Twitter conversations about disasters evolve over time, showing an issue attention cycle on a social media platform. The paper examines different functions of Twitter and the information hubs that drive and sustain traffic about the event. Content analysis shows that the majority of tweets contain information about the typhoon or its damage, and disaster relief activities. There are differences in types of content between the most retweeted messages and posts of the general public, with regular users being more likely to tweet emotions, messages of support, and political content compared with official sources. Key information hubs include news organizations, aid organization, and celebrities. General public users of Twitter reveal use of the site beyond information to relief coordination and response.",Top Four Faculty Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

The data were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Both communication load resulting from private email and social media messages as well as Internet multitasking were positively related to perceived stress and had a significant indirect effect on burnout, depression, and anxiety. While older Internet users showed stronger stress reactions to communication load, they were less susceptible to the detrimental effects of Internet multitasking than younger users. Perceived social pressure and the fear of missing out on relevant information and rewarding social interaction were key drivers of communication load and Internet multitasking. Again, the data revealed clear age-differences: While younger Internet users were more strongly driven by social pressure, older users were more susceptible to the influence of the fear of missing out.",Top Four Faculty Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

This experiment therefore investigated how mode of anticipated interaction affects idealized self-presentation. Ninety-two heterosexual women constructed a dating profile while anticipating meeting a date either face-to-face or through text-based chat. When they anticipated computer-mediated (as opposed to face-to-face) interaction, they experienced greater self-presentational efficacy, that is, the degree to which they expected their profile would make a positive impression on a potential date. Participants who reported greater self-presentational efficacy presented themselves more positively in their profiles. This idealization of profiles predicted positive changes in romantic self-esteem. In this way the mode of anticipated future interaction was shown to affect romantic self-esteem as mediated by self-presentational efficacy and idealized self-presentation (respectively).",Top Four Faculty Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

Websites have become an essential communication platform (Dawkins, 2004). This study aims to investigate how CSR can be used as a driver in enhancing organizational corporate image. A pilot test comprising content analyses of 150 corporate websites of local and MNCs headquartered in Singapore was conducted, followed by in-depth interviews with 24 public relations practitioners to examine the motivations behind their CSR engagement. Findings show that organizations utilized CSR as a means to enhance corporate image via four ways: engaging in two-way conversations with stakeholders, adopting an inside-out communication approach with employees, recognizing the relevance of other CSR communication channels, and communicating CSR with authenticity. However, some organizations hesitate to use CSR communication to enhance their corporate image because they wanted to avoid being seen as using CSR as a promotional tool (148 words)",Best Faculty Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

2015-0278,2015,Paper Session,Standing on the Edge of Control: Power and Privacy in the Age of Public Shaming,1,"This paper discusses the rise in public shaming on social media and attempts to situate it theoretically within prior considerations of power and discipline. I argue that the recent rise in online public shaming is symptomatic of a tension between traditional formulations of top-down discipline and newer, decentralized forms of power and censure brought about by information communication technologies. Subsumed within this tension are questions about the role of personal information as both a ticket into the online social sphere and a weapon within it, as well as questions about what constitutes user privacy – both in the minds of users themselves as well as those monitoring their information. Specifically, I argue that new formulations of power reflect a control society, in which protocol (theorized by Alexander Galloway) operates as a mechanism of power and censure. This clashes with Foucauldian disciplinary mechanisms that operate through centralized panoptic surveillance.","Shame, Hackers, and Nonhumans: Control and Resistance in New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0279,2015,Paper Session,Demonstrating and Articulating Expertise: Hackers Acting About Media Technologies and Infrastructures,1,"Hacker cultures, ever since their emergence in the 1950s, are grounded on expertise related to technology. As practices related to digital media have become a constitutive part of societal constellations the political significance of hackers’ expertise is ever more substantial. Yet, empirical investigations of the ways hackers practice expertise remain rare. In particular the entanglements of hackers’ expertise with media environments and institutional politics are poorly understood. This paper fills parts of this gap by presenting research on one of the world’s largest and oldest hacker organizations – the Chaos Computer Club. The paper demonstrates that the Club acts as an expert collective bringing together a wide range of knowledge, skills and experience related to media technologies and infrastructures. Overall the paper points to emerging engagement practices by conceptualizing the demonstration of expertise through hacking and the articulation of expertise through media-related practices and interactions with institutional politics as interlocking arrangements.","Shame, Hackers, and Nonhumans: Control and Resistance in New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

It focuses on a subset of hacktivism—the distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack for political ends—that aims at making an Internet host unavailable to its intended users. Since the early 2000s these attacks have been increasingly conducted by means of botnets—networks of infected computers that send bogus requests to a target website without the consent of their users. While the liberal tradition would hardly consider this unknowing form of participation as political, the article argues that botnets have a political capacity to engender new sets of actions and relations. Such capacity is analyzed from two distinct theoretical angles, which borrow from the philosophies of Gilbert Simondon and Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. These two conceptual frameworks are brought together through an analysis of the political economy of botnets, their technical functionalities, and their problematic use for political ends.","Shame, Hackers, and Nonhumans: Control and Resistance in New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

But what differences do the testimonial’s characteristics make? We present experimental data from a 2x2 between-subject-design using male and female celebrities (two of them with/without publicly known alcohol and drug affinity) claiming for anti-drink/-drug-driving on billboards. Effects were analyzed for those participants who recognized the celebrities correctly. Respondents’ gender and drug affinity served as covariates. ‘Clean’ male celebrities were estimated more credible and thought-provoking, while risk-taking testimonials were rather skeptically viewed. Respondents with own drink-/drug-driving experiences were more reactant towards the messages, particularly if ‘clean’ celebrities were displayed. Only a small proportion of variance was explained by the respondents’ gender. For successful celebrity endorsement strategies, recognition of the character is the first relevant barrier to entry. The testimonial’s authentic risk behavior experience can be a key factor for message appeal, if it fits to the target audience.","Alcohol, Diet, Behavior Change: High-Density Panel in Public Health Communication",Health Communication

How Gain-Loss Framing and Kernel State Framing Influence Adaptive and Maladaptive Health Outcomes,2,"This experimental study examines the separate and joint effects of gain-loss framing and kernel state framing on readers’ adaptive and maladaptive behavioral intentions. Four hundred and thirteen students completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire that included a news report about diabetes. Headline and article text were manipulated with regard to gain-loss framing (health gains vs. losses if article recommendations are followed/disregarded) and kernel state framing (health, energy, and self-confidence vs. pain, exhaustion, and uncertainty). Articles portraying negative kernel states produced more reactance than articles mentioning positive health conditions. Loss-framed articles motivated the higher levels of information seeking than gain-framed articles. Gain-loss framing × respondent gender two-way interactions emerged for the intention for detection behavior and reactance. Overall, findings suggest that both message frames affect readers’ health-related intentions, albeit independently and partly gender-specific. Consequences for effective health message design as well as the appropriate theoretical foundation of these framing techniques are discussed.","Alcohol, Diet, Behavior Change: High-Density Panel in Public Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0284,2015,Paper Session,Making Sense of Bystander Intervention: Student Explanations of Other's Risk and Responsibility,2,"One approach to addressing problems of excessive drinking on college campuses is to encourage students to intervene when they see others engaged in risky behavior. This approach, referred to as bystander intervention, has been shown to have the potential to increase student awareness of how they can help others and to have the potential to decrease problem behavior (Banyard, Moynihan & Plante, 2004). Prior research indicates that a number of factors influence students’ willingness to intervene and their ability to do so effectively (Levine & Crowther, 2008; White & Malkowski, 2014). However, to fully understand bystander intervention processes, we need to know how students make sense of others’ drinking behavior, how they assess the risk others may face from drinking excessively, and what they understand intervention to entail. We used focus group analyses to identify the frames and discourses students draw on as they make sense of other student's risk and responsibility around excessive drinking.","Alcohol, Diet, Behavior Change: High-Density Panel in Public Health Communication",Health Communication

A more nuanced understanding of why these messages fail is important to help develop more effective campaigns. The present study examines this relationship and proposes message reactance as an explanation for why messages have differential effects. The study found that a more accessible anti-drinking and driving norm led to less reactance and less intention to drink and drive. Less accessible norms led to increased reactance, more favorable attitudes and higher intention to drink and drive. Implications for persuasion are discussed.","Alcohol, Diet, Behavior Change: High-Density Panel in Public Health Communication",Health Communication
2015-0286,2015,Paper Session,Self-Persuasion in Health Communication: Reducing Alcohol Consumption by Framing Antialcohol Messages as Questions,4,"Self-persuasion (i.e., self-generation of arguments) as an influence technique has been shown to be more effective than commonly used direct-persuasion (i.e., providing arguments; Aronson, 1999). The application of this technique in mediated health communication, however, has not been studied. In two experiments we examined whether self-persuasion can be successfully applied to anti-alcohol media communications by framing the message as a question (experiment 1) and whether this framing is more effective than direct-persuasion in reducing actual alcohol consumption (experiment 2).

Results from the first experiment indicate that exposure to an anti-alcohol media message framed as a question results in more self-generated arguments ‘why to drink less alcohol’ and more favorable message reactions than framing the same message as a statement. The second experiment further showed that the self-persuasion messages were more effective in reducing actual alcohol consumption than the direct-persuasion versions or no intervention.","Alcohol, Diet, Behavior Change: High-Density Panel in Public Health Communication",Health Communication

However, this framework and its persistent reliance on questions of risk and harm fail to address issues of historical inequities and the very real possibility that ""big data"" tools and techniques will exacerbate existing social inequities. In the United States, some civil society representatives, regulators, and researchers have begun to question the extent to which automated computer decision systems might upend existing legal protections to prevent disparate impact and discrimination against racial, ethnic, and other minorities. The framework raises several important questions related the Oscar Gandy's concept of cumulative disadvantage and the possibility that some individuals and groups may find themselves targeted, tracked, and primed for particular personal destinies over time, with long-term and possibly inter-generational consequences. In this conference theme session, I will adopt a critical lens on data analytics and reflect on the adequacy and inadequacy of both privacy and civil rights laws to guard against the exclusionary consequences of ""big data"" tools and techniques. I will explore the four facets of big data's equity and discrimination problems: historical examples that point to pre-digital forms of data profiling by both corporate and government actors; economic examples that demonstrate how corporate actors lack incentives to model ""good"" market behavior, especially in the creation of products and services that target vulnerable populations (e.g., alternative credit products); technical examples that illustrate problems of performance versus interpretability in data analytics, on the one hand, and data quality, error, bias, and integrity, on the other; and sociolegal factors in the United States that contributes to a wait-and-see stance, particularly in the legislative and judicial branches of government. By the end of this examination into big data's problems, I will present both legal and ethical considerations that may motivate government and corporate actors, as well as the research community, to move more capably in anticipating the problems of cumulative disadvantage that may arise from unfettered growth of data analytics in the everyday technologies in the home, workplace, and other realms of daily life.",CLAP Conference Theme Session: Communication Law and Policy Issues Across the Life Span,Communication Law & Policy
2015-0292,2015,Paper Session,Identity Construction Across the Lifespan: Realizing the Right to Memory in Communication Law and Policy,2,"Memory is crucial to the physical and spiritual wholeness of the human being as it knits together an individual’s identity over his or her lifespan. A collective form of memory, social memory, preserves the unity of a group’s identity. Communication law and policy has a determining effect on the ability to create, preserve, retrieve and endow memories, both individual and collective, because memory is a mediated phenomenon; and because laws ‘invite[s] the citizens to remember' (Fronza, 2005, p. 609). We propose a ""right to memory,"" the right to remember and forget events, construct and reconstruct collective representations of the past, archive mnemonic artifacts, gain access to collective archives and endow unique representations of the past to next generations. We suggest a framework highlighting the role of communication law and policy in advancing this right as the basis for the development of identity over the lifespan of individuals and communities.",CLAP Conference Theme Session: Communication Law and Policy Issues Across the Life Span,Communication Law & Policy

Singapore, a small city-state in the Southeast Asian region, will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2015. The government’s liberal immigration policies have culminated in growing unhappiness among citizens, manifested in the xenophobic speech online. Lessig (1999) posited four regulators that control the Internet - the law, norms, market and architecture. In Singapore, the law has been the default mechanism that the government turns to when trying to manage problematic phenomena, evident in its array of legislative mechanisms. Through keyword searches and snowballing, we identified online articles and posts surrounding five prominent incidents involving immigrants, and analysed their content and comment threads. We present data collected from our study on xenophobic speech and make a case for non-regulatory measures as more sustainable approaches to curbing xenophobic speech and why a departure from the government’s regulation-by-default mentality is needed.",CLAP Conference Theme Session: Communication Law and Policy Issues Across the Life Span,Communication Law & Policy

The results provide key insights for environmental communicators, especially communicators in coastal regions. In-depth interviews with both environmental psychologists and environmental communicators showed that both groups emphasized knowing the audience, telling local stories, building relationships with target audiences and targeted messaging. Both psychologists and communicators also frequently mentioned general messaging concerns of source credibility, avoiding controversial terms and talking about issues, impacts and solutions to which the target audience can relate. A representative survey revealed that Louisiana residents are most interested in hearing about how environmental issues such as climate change, coastal land loss and flooding are affecting their own communities. This finding supports the idea that environmental communicators could do a better job tapping into strong place attachment and sense of community among coastal residents to promote action.",Communicating Science and Environmental Issues: Addressing Challenges and Controversies,Environmental Communication

Polyrational Communication presents an excellent framework for being able to address these problems from the perspective of every rationality that exists within a given community. The importance of Polyrational Communication doesn't simply lie in understanding the four rationalities it presents in its model; it lies in simply understanding that everyone adheres to a different rationality, and understanding that simple fact can produce extremely effective public engagement campaigns. Polyrational Communication helps planners, policymakers, and communication scholars remember that everyone wants to feel like they are a part of the future. This paper explores how Polyrational Communication was utilized to help implement a riparian ordinance in the town of Shady Cove, Oregon.",Communicating Science and Environmental Issues: Addressing Challenges and Controversies,Environmental Communication
2015-0297,2015,Paper Session,Mediatized Risk Culture: News Coverage of Risk Technologies,2,"Risk coverage has become an inseparable part of modern news reporting. It provides information on how technological lifestyles affect our human and natural environments. Risks circulate and develop among a variety of technological risks and are rarely confined to a single risk. As a consequence, public risk communication constitutes a broader mediatized risk environment. Based on a comparative research design the paper investigates media coverage of four contemporary risks across three different media platforms (TV, radio, newspapers). Data shows that risk reporting varies substantially depending on dominant news themes, cultural resonance and media platform. However, across these variations we also find the presence of master frames that presents risk as contested and/or manageable. Based on these findings we argue that media may both contest dominant risk evaluations while at the same time present risk as endemic to modern lifestyle: as an end point rather than starting point for critical reflections.",Communicating Science and Environmental Issues: Addressing Challenges and Controversies,Environmental Communication

Examining the Impact of Aggressive Communication in the Context of Nuclear Energy,4,"The impact of aggressive science communication is important to understand because of its consistent presence in popular science communication. To understand the effect of aggressiveness in science communication, we conducted an experiment (n = 298) to assess the impact of exposure to aggressive risk communication by a scientist on respondents' perceptions of risk communication quality, supportive behavior (i.e., forwarding the communication), risk communicator likability, and overall views about scientists. PROCESS models suggest both direct and indirect negative impacts of aggressive risk communication in the case of likability but potentially positive impacts in terms of evaluating the message quality. Agreement with the underlying message and the degree to which the communication style violated respondents’ expectations moderated the impact of aggressive communication and had direct impacts on perceptions and behavioral intentions of the respondents.",Communicating Science and Environmental Issues: Addressing Challenges and Controversies,Environmental Communication

Based on a modified Extended Parallel Process Model, this study examines key components of efficacy (i.e. self and response efficacy) and perceived threat (i.e. susceptibility and severity) and incorporates new variables of media trust and affective attitude. With a stratified sampling, this web survey recruits 410 undergraduate students in Singapore (response rate of 30%). The PLS analysis shows that response efficacy is a significant mediator of perceived self-efficacy and behavior intentions. The results also find that perceived threat (i.e., severity and susceptibility) positively predict response efficacy to seek haze-related information and fearful affective attitude toward haze-related health problems. In comparison, affective attitude toward haze (emotional appeal) is a strong predictor than response efficacy (cognitive appeal) for behavior intention to take protective measures. Most importantly, among Singaporean youths, trust in new media heightens their fear and worry towards haze, which positively affects their behavior intentions; however, trust in traditional media has no significant effect.

2015-0300,2015,Paper Session,"Women’s Experiences With Harassment in Online Video Games: Rumination, Organizational Responsiveness, Withdrawal, and Coping Strategies",2,"We conducted an online survey to assess women’s (N = 293) experiences with general harassment and sexual harassment in online video games, including the frequency of harassment; rumination about the harassment; perceptions of organizational responsiveness (i.e., what efforts the gaming company made to address harassment); and withdrawal from the game. Women also reported coping strategies they employed to mitigate harassment, including gender bending or gender neutralization through screen name or avatar choice; avoiding communication with other players; and seeking social support inside and outside the game. Findings indicate that both general and sexual harassment predict women’s withdrawal from online games. Sexual harassment, but not general harassment, leads to rumination and subsequent withdrawal. The path from sexual harassment to withdrawal was also mediated by organizational responsiveness, indicating the gaming industry plays a key role in whether women are alienated or continue to participate in games after harassment occurs.",Top Four Competitive Papers in Game Studies,Game Studies
2015-0301,2015,Paper Session,Occupy the Galaxy: Social Movement Theory in a Virtual World,1,"After the 2007-2008 financial crisis a wave of protest quickly spread around the globe. Academics and other commentators quickly noted that these new social movements differed significantly from previous models. Instead of relying on incentives provided by tightly knit groups headed by experienced leaders as predicted by existing ""collective action"" theories these new movements employed a looser structure with a greater emphasis on personal framing and identity. The emerging ""connective"" action theory seeks to describe these new structures and contrast them with earlier approaches. While theoretically sophisticated there have been few quantitative explorations of this debate, in part due to the trouble of obtaining data on such transient social organizations. This paper sidesteps that issue by contrasting both approaches through the lens of an online protest within the popular multiplayer game EVE Online. Results suggest that communication, in game experience and the willingness to explore different perspectives within the game world are significant predictors of participation in the protest. These findings suggest that the connective action approach may be a productive line of inquiry for researchers examining both virtual and physical social movements.",Top Four Competitive Papers in Game Studies,Game Studies

The main aim of the current study was to explain the antecedent structure of IGD. In doing so, this study is the first to longitudinally examine the causal relationship between a set of personality and situational factors, and the newly classified IGD. A two-wave panel study was conducted among 643 Dutch adolescent games over the course of six months. Using autoregressive structural equation models, the causal relationship between each identified factor and IGD over time was examined in more detail. The analyses yield valuable insights for the understanding of the pathological involvement with video games among adolescents, in particular with respect to the prevalence, progressiveness and antecedent structure of pathological gaming.",Top Four Competitive Papers in Game Studies,Game Studies

This debate has been marked my numerous claims and speculation from researchers that scholars with different opinions are influenced by biases ranging from funding sources to interest in video games as an avocation. This study was an analysis of survey data from N = 544 scholars from several disciplines involved in research on video games exploring their opinions about video games’ possible beneficial and harmful effects. Results indicate inconsistent relationships between demographic variables, academic background, and video game familiarity and perceptions of effects, though self-identification as a games researcher was consistently associated with more belief in beneficial effects and more skepticism about harmful effects.

Participating in the study were 208 young persons between the ages of 14 and 20, randomly distributed into three conditions in which each group was exposed to a different episode of the television series “Revelados, desde todas las posiciones.” The results showed that greater identification with the main character of the episode transmitting the prevention message was associated with greater cognitive elaboration, which in turn led to more favorable attitudes toward the topics addressed. However, counter-arguing did not play a significant mediating role.

In Study 1, participants read a traditional narrative, an interactive narrative, or no narrative (control). The effect of interactive narratives on behavioral intentions was mediated by readers’ feelings of responsibility for the character’s decisions. Additionally, when readers made decisions based on what they would actually do, identification was increased. In Study 2, readers’ decision-making methods were manipulated. Though there were no direct effects of decision-making methods on attitude change, results from Study 1 were replicated (i.e., responsibility and identification as key factors).

2015-0307,2015,Paper Session,The Influence of Narrative and Numerical Messages on Integration-Relevant Attitudes among Muslim Immigrant Minorities,5,"This study assesses what types of messages may generate greater openness toward three core Western European norms (i.e., gender equality, sexual minority rights and secularism in public life) among Muslim immigrant minorities. We build on theoretical insights from integration studies and message effectiveness to test whether narrative versus numerical evidence will be more effective among different subgroups of Muslim immigrants. Based on an experiment in which participants from the Dutch Muslim community (N=454) were exposed to narrative or numerical messages related to these norms, we show that those born in the Netherlands were more receptive to a narrative, while numerical messages generated greater openness to the tested norms among those born in majority-Muslim countries. We interpret these findings in the light of different cultural orientations during the socialization process. The study offers a first step towards a theoretical framework for understanding message effects and evidence effectiveness in increasingly multi-ethnic societies.",Narrative Persuasion Research,Mass Communication

A 2 (information creator: a governmental agency vs. a fictional organization) X 2 (information sharer: public health experts vs. friends) between-subjects experiment was conducted to examine how different types of online risk information sources and their varying degrees of credibility affect receivers’ information evaluation, which subsequently influences individuals’ personal- and social risk perception, and information behaviors. Results demonstrated that information creator’s credibility more influentially affects participants’ perception of the believability of information while sharer’s credibility more greatly contributes to perceived utility of information. Amongst three source credibility dimensions, only both creator’s and sharer’s trustworthiness were positively associated with information believability. Personal risk perception was positively associated with information seeking intention, whereas social risk perception was positively associated with information sharing intention.","Social Media, Public Health, and Mental Health",Health Communication

Using as our corpus all the messages on these pages between the period of July 1 and October 15, 2014, we shift in narrativizing of Ebola risk from a) consulting and containment, to b) an international concern, and c) the possibility an epidemic in the US. In a second part of our analysis, we also provide a quantification of user engagement generated by Ebola-related posts on the official Facebook pages.","Social Media, Public Health, and Mental Health",Health Communication

2015-0312,2015,Paper Session,“Calling It Starts”: Prosmoking Information Scanning Using Social Media and Increased Young Adult Smoking,1,"The amount of pro-smoking information appearing on social media has increased sharply in the past few years. This proliferation has expanded the potential for widespread exposure to pro-smoking information. Being in a critical age group (aged 18-25) for lifelong smoking behavior, young adults use social media ubiquitously. To show the role of pro-smoking information scanning using social media – routine patterns of social media exposure to pro-smoking information– in smoking behavior, the authors collected survey data from 249 young adults who are social media users. Applying theoretical constructs from the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IMBP), the authors offer 3 major findings: (a) pro-smoking information scanning using social media had an indirect effect on young adults’ intentions to smoke cigarettes via changing attitudes, perceived norms, and self-efficacy, with perceived norms being the strongest predictor; (b) levels of participation on social media will be positively related to pro-smoking information scanning; and (c) susceptible non-smokers reported higher pro-smoking information scanning using social media than insusceptible non-smokers.

Critics worry that algorithmic filtering based on homophily leads to a loss of diversity. In turn, “serendipity”, positive experiences due to the encounter of surprising content, is touted as an antidote to overly polished, repetitive use experiences. Little is known, however, about the antecedents and effects of online serendipity. Studies suggest that these antecedents and effects vary by online context, yet few have analyzed this empirically. We identify antecedents of online serendipity using a survey of German Internet users. We then differentiate the proposed serendipity model according to three online contexts: shopping, information and social networks. We find that online serendipity is indeed context-specific. While in the shopping and information context serendipity does not lead to satisfaction with the user experience, on social network sites it has a significant positive effect.",Focusing Theories on Communication and Technology #4,Communication and Technology

Participants in training workshops across the region ranked a set of core values that were related to ideational organizational culture (Martin, 2002). Spearman correlation coefficients of these rankings indicated that a few values were considered important in nearly all nations, but the ranking of some cultural values varied sharply from country to country. Factor analysis of those rankings produced three distinct groupings of value orientations, and therefore we concluded there was no support for a common organization culture operating within the field of broadcasting in Asia. We observed that industry-wide values appeared to interact with local cultures within each nation producing sub-regional patterns.

2015-0320,2015,Paper Session,The Role of Electronic Word of Mouth in Predicting Bollywood’s Overseas Box Office Performance,2,"Electronic word of mouth (eWOM), such as aggregate ratings (valence) or ratings volume, is known to predict a movie’s box office performance. But extant research is largely limited to Hollywood movies and their performance in the US. This paper examines this relationship for overseas box office performance of movies from Bollywood, the India-based world’s largest movie producing industry. Unlike Hollywood, whose movies are aimed at more general overseas audiences, Bollywood’s primary overseas target audience is the Indian diaspora. Hence, we also disentangle the role of eWOM from domestic cues people receive from India. Our empirical analyses of a sample of 95 A list Bollywood movies between 2012 and 2013 show that ratings volume rather than valence predicts the proportion of Bollywood’s box office revenues after the opening weekend, after accounting for domestic cues. However, domestic performance also seems to exert considerable influence on Bollywood’s overseas box office revenues, confirming previous findings for Hollywood movies.",Issues in the Study of Media Industries,Mass Communication

Having had a parasocial relationship with Williams was positively related to willingness to seek mental health treatment and reaching out to other people with depression or suicidal thoughts. Believing stereotypes about depression was also associated to reaching out to others. Exposure to media stories celebrating Williams’ life and career was associated with reduced stigma and more support for public funding of healthcare, but also with less outreach to others and less willingness to seek treatment for depression. Exposure to media coverage of suicide/depression was associated with more frequent outreach to others, but stigmatizing media coverage was associated with stronger stereotypes of depression.","Patient Perspectives: Celebrities, Tanning, Vaccines",Health Communication
2015-0324,2015,Paper Session,Perception and Acceptance of the Meningitis Vaccine Among College Students,2,"The incidence of meningococcal infection among young people between the ages of 18-24 is on the rise (Harrison et al., 2000). This increase is attributed to the ease of transmission among college populations. Research indicates that the dense living conditions (e.g. residence halls) characteristic of the college experience places students at increased risk of contracting and spreading bacterial meningitis. Although bacterial meningitis is a vaccine preventable disease, many college students are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated. The intent of this exploratory research is to uncover college student perceptions regarding bacterial meningitis. A survey based on the constructs of the Health Belief Model was administered to 5,196 students residing in on-campus housing. Survey data indicate that communication campaigns should focus on enhancing awareness of how living in a community setting increases susceptibility to contracting bacterial meningitis. The benefits of vaccination, perceptions of self-efficacy and physician recommendations are also positively associated with vaccine acceptance.","Patient Perspectives: Celebrities, Tanning, Vaccines",Health Communication
2015-0325,2015,Paper Session,Acculturation as a Predictor of Employment: An Australian Study of Refugee Communities,4,"In 2012-2013, Australia granted over 20,000 humanitarian visas, of which Ethiopia, Burma and Congo were the most frequent countries of origin for offshore humanitarian visa applicants.

This study investigated the relationship of socio demographic factors with refugee employment status, and the role acculturation, acculturative stress, and resilience, played in the employment status of refugees.

Quantitative data was gathered from 169 participants from Ethiopian, Congolese, and Burmese refugee communities. Hierarchical Logistic regression was used to investigate the factors that predicted the employment status.

We found that only length of stay and English proficiency increased the odds of employed status. An increase in acculturation was associated with the odds of being unemployed, while an increase in acculturative stress was positively associated with the odds of being employment. Resilience and demographic variables (age, education, gender, and country of origin) were not associated with employed status in any way.",Intercultural Research in Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication
2015-0326,2015,Paper Session,"Acculturation, Ethnic Performance, and Ethnic Media Use",2,"The present study focuses on how and why immigrants in a transnational global context access and engage with home country media. This paper applies the integrative acculturation model, group vitality theory, and, uses and gratifications approaches to understand media engagement among Indian-American immigrants. Existing literature has narrowly focused on lack of proficiency with host county language as the primary reason for ethnic media consumption. We argue that for Indian-Americans the motivation for using ethnic media is not driven by a lack of assimilation into the U.S. or by lack of English language skills but by their ethnic identification. We developed the “Ethnic Performance Index,” a new measure that captures a broad range of ethnic performances such as food, festivals, and shared customs. A survey was conducted with Indian-Americans across various educational backgrounds, income levels, and age groups to explore the relationships amongst ethnic media use, level of acculturation, and ethnic identification. Results show that the new “Ethnic Performance Index” measure is a better predictor of ethnic media usage than length of stay in host country, acculturation indices, language proficiency, and existing measures of ethnic identification.",Intercultural Research in Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication

Prior literature shows that large and diverse social networks are ideal for increasing international students’ adaptation. Using an online questionnaire administered to 71 international Chinese students studying in the U.S., we explored the potential impact that the utilization of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) could have on the construction of such social networks, when used during study abroad preparation. We found that students who used American SNSs more often during their study abroad preparations had more diverse social networks abroad, than students who used American SNSs less often or not at all. Students with larger and more diverse social networks reported significantly higher levels of social and academic adaptation to the host culture.",Intercultural Research in Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication

Areas of focus include differences in interpersonal communication style (compliment usage, politeness strategies, verbal directness, greetings to strangers and responses in hierarchical relationships), independence and group behavior (traveling alone versus with others, preference for group photos, dealing with crowded streets and buses and changes in traffic rules), and channel switching (shift in available social media, shift from speaking in English to speaking in Chinese). Each of these differences resulted in a reverse culture shock challenge. The reasons for the communicative differences and their impact on reverse culture shock were examined using “western” communication theories. The key to a successful reentry is adaptation to the expectations of their native culture.

But what drives consumers to make online endorsements? This research investigates in four experiments the processes that underlie consumers’ intention to endorse brands on social media. We suggest that consumers aim to signal their identity by endorsing brands online. Based on the Brands as Intentional Agents Framework and related research in (social) cognition and consumer behavior, we argue that consumers on social media primarily want to emphasize their warmth rather than their competence. Experiments 1 and 2 distinguish between nonprofit and for-profit brands and show that brand warmth (and not competence) mediates the effect of brand type (nonprofit vs. for-profit) on consumers’ intentions to endorse brands on social media. Experiment 3 demonstrates that this process is moderated by brand symbolism (moderated mediation). A high level of brand symbolism increases the positive effect of warmth on consumers’ intention to endorse brands online, but only for for-profit brands. The final experiment shows that these effects are conditional upon the public vs. private distinction in consumer behavior: consumers prefer to publicly affiliate with nonprofit (vs. for-profit) brands but with regard to private affiliations, there is no difference between both types of brands.",Advances in Advertising Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication

In a 3x4 between subjects online experiment we varied type of video (beauty of the earth, unity of humankind, portrayals of human kindness and funny control videos) and context of proliferation (presentation within an unknown video platform, presentation as YouTube video with low number of views vs. high number of views). Meaningful videos indeed led to greater elevation, more universal orientation and prosocial motivation – with videos showing human kindness standing out against other forms of meaningful videos. Additionally, especially human kindness videos fostered more positive attitudes toward stereotyped groups – mediated by the feeling of elevation and the subsequent feeling of universal orientation. Against expectations, the context of proliferation did not affect these dependent variables.","Mass Communication: Elevation, Meaningfulness, Altruism",Mass Communication

The present study employs film drama exposure and reflective writing to investigate the impact of tragic drama on gratifications and the potential moderating effects of entertainment-focused variables, namely hedonic and eudaimonic motivations (Oliver & Raney, 2011). In a between-subjects experiment, tragic drama exposure and contemplation were manipulated in a laboratory and participants reported their levels of fun enjoyment and appreciation. Main effects of reflection on gratifications were found, as well as an unexpected gender difference in fun enjoyment. The results also show that hedonic motivations moderated the impact of contemplating tragic drama on enjoyment and appreciation as moving/thought-provoking, whereas eudaimonic motives does not moderate this effect. Thus, film hedonists stand to obtain more enjoyable and profound entertainment experiences from “serious” films through self-reflection. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","Mass Communication: Elevation, Meaningfulness, Altruism",Mass Communication

Based on theories of eudaimonic entertainment and destigmatization, we hypothesized that empathic feelings elicited by the portrayal of human virtues and values exemplified by Paralympic athletes would increase audience interest, and would lead to changes in attitudes and behavioral intentions. Three online experiments were conducted. Participants watched television spots about the Paralympics that elicited different levels of empathic feelings. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed an indirect effect of empathy on audience interest, attitudes, and behavioral intentions that was mediated by elevation and reflective thoughts (Studies 1 and 2) and by feelings of closeness, elevation and pity (Study 3) with positive mediation effects of reflective thoughts, elevation and closeness, and a negative mediation effect of pity.","Mass Communication: Elevation, Meaningfulness, Altruism",Mass Communication

Whereas research thus far has focused primarily on portrayals of altruism to elicit elevation, the results of this study show that portrayals of connectedness, love, and kindness in meaningful films are also able to elicit feelings of elevation. Moreover, elevation mediated the relationship between meaningful films and feelings of connectedness to the transcendent, gratitude towards one’s family; the importance of love in life; compassionate love towards close others; and compassionate motivation to love and be good to humanity. Helping behavior was the greatest for females who remembered a meaningful film and experienced very high levels elevation. The study demonstrates the potential of meaningful films to increase experiences of connectedness to the transcendent and motivation to be more compassionate even to strangers.","Mass Communication: Elevation, Meaningfulness, Altruism",Mass Communication

Alternatively, they can engage in strong relationships with other persons. So-called meaningful films are thought to provide recipients with such film-internal anxiety buffers that help them cope with their existential fear. In particular, the salience of life within a film is hypothesized to be an important aspect to provide symbolic immortality. The results of an experimental study (N=83) demonstrated that participants who had been reminded of their own mortality appreciated a meaningful movie and liked the protagonist most when the protagonist survived (=high life salience), but not when he died at the end of the film (=low life salience). Further, when life salience was high, participants did not activate an external self-esteem-related anxiety buffer following the movie. The findings are discussed regarding aspects in meaningful films and their role in shielding against existential thoughts.","Mass Communication: Elevation, Meaningfulness, Altruism",Mass Communication

As new cases continue to surface, military leaders have considered how to address events that constitute a crisis in within the armed forces. This paper analyzes news articles from two cases of sexual assault in the military to understand the use of apologia in rape cases. Researchers, employing qualitative textual analysis, found that military leaders and their attorneys accused the government of making their clients a scapegoat, minimized the seriousness of the offense, charged that there were more important issues to consider than the behavior of individuals, and bolstered their clients’ reputations as good soldiers. Sexual assault was presented as as a problem for the military’s image more so than a problem for women.",Feminists Examine Violence and Heroism,Feminist Scholarship

It examines the construction of femininity by Sina Weibo users, the empowerment on the woman, and how mainstream news influences this process. Applying textual analysis method, it analyzes over 800 Weibo posts and a news article. The hegemonic femininity has created a sympathetic supporting group to empower the woman. The ongoing anti-corruption movement motivates the supporters to treat the woman as a fighter, hero, or justice citizen, erasing her femininity from her public image. There are still blames on her based on the traditional male-dominant cultural hegemony. Sina Weibo as a social media network successfully provides an open space for individual users to freely construct individualized and diverse femininity of the woman.

A child has its best chance of being killed by its parents the day it is born. If she/he survives the first 24 hours, the chances s/he will die are greater the first year of life than any other time in childhood or adolescence. To better understand how contemporary media report on infanticide, this paper analyzes newspaper articles on infanticide published since the 1970s. It asks: How do journalists frame infanticide? Results from this qualitative textual analysis showed news reports typical present infanticide as an isolated event, failing to provide any background or context on cultural factors (stigma against teen pregnancy, lack of information on postpartum illness). This analysis suggests that journalists might offer information about where mothers can get help—crisis lines, adoption information, abortion information, and “safe havens.”",Feminists Examine Violence and Heroism,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0341,2015,Paper Session,Symbolism in Female Terrorism: Five Overarching Themes,1,"This paper examines symbolism in female terrorism through five overarching themes. These themes symbolize (1) continuity of the fight, (2) strategic desirability, (3) revenge, (4) restoration of honor, and (5) change. For example, during the First Intifada, Palestinian women were symbolic warriors in the resistance movement. Today, terror propagandists increasingly exploit this type of female zeal to further justify terrorism against their enemies. Taken as a whole, these five overarching themes shed light on a phenomenon that tends to be underrepresented in the mainstream media. An important conclusion of this analysis is that female terrorism symbolizes a grand strategy to strike the enemy in unremitting ways (i.e., “continuity of the fight”), in unprecedented ways (i.e., “strategic desirability” and “change”), and sometimes as the only viable way (i.e., “revenge” and “restoration of honor”)",Feminists Examine Violence and Heroism,Feminist Scholarship

Drawing on my work of writing and editing articles about campus sexual violence, I document the way a group of Wikipedians mobilize expertise in Wikipedia’s policies in order to censor information that challenges male privilege – a privilege that is itself at stake on Wikipedia in ways that other forms of difference – on various grounds of notability and validity as per Wikipedia policies, and not “reality” as such. I then examine the ways in which these policies are used to produce consensus, a process I refer to as the hegemony of the asshole consensus because of the ways in relies on deference to “pragmatism” and fears of harassment. I conclude by making a “positive move,” proposing that Wikipedia shift from “filling the gender gap” and introducing women into a hostile culture, and towards a cultural shift model that places gendered social consciousness at the core of training future Wikipedians – male and female – to produce knowledge and information in ways aware of gendered relationality.

With its foundation in ethnography of communication studies of classroom and home communication and incorporating data collected in a grounded practical theory investigation of the instructional communication practice of instructor-facilitated collegiate classroom discussion (IFCCD), this is an in-depth analysis of one case in which there was consistent engaged and participatory classroom discussion. Incorporating ideas from invitational rhetoric, the invitation-offering-follow-up (I-O-F) is proposed as a discussion-based version of the traditional direct instruction tripartite classroom participation structure. Examining this case, the teacher’s first-turn questions are found to be invitational, second-turn student comments are analyzed as offerings of perspectives, and three distinct instructor third-turns are identified as part of the talk that construct lively classroom discussion.

By comparison, Chinese media reported pollution with more Chinese sources, more self-legitimizing frames in which topics regarding strategies and solutions of the pollution were emphasized; it also framed the issue with mild self-criticism, projecting the issue using an ""international public relations"" strategy. Additionally, results showed that the two media shared some common sources. It is also suggested that nationalistic praise or justification for China was more mild and strategic than originally expected, and western-media criticism or ""anti-communism"" was milder than it used to be.

Although research on media coverage of climate change has been well-documented and varied in a wide range of topics, few studies have tried to look at media coverage of climate change from the perspective of psychological distance. This study employed content analysis as the primary technique to examine the portrayal of climate change in relation to psychological distance dimensions in two national and thirty-six local newspapers over a 13-month period. The results indicate that climate change is most likely to be presented as to pose impacts in a very distant or unspecified future, at the globe-level or unspecified locations, and with high certainty. Temporal dimension of climate change was positively related to both spatial and social dimensions. Moreover, national newspapers portrayed climate change as spatially more distant than local newspapers.

This randomized experiment (N = 363) tested whether user comments that support or contradict a news story have an effect on message reception. Additionally, it assessed how message reception was influenced when commenters used anecdotal evidence versus empirical evidence. Findings show that participants exposed to empirical comments were more skeptical about climate change than those exposed to anecdotal comments. Especially for participants with lower need for cognition, anecdotal comments led to more certainty about climate change than did empirical comments. Political ideology was also found to be an important moderator of effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that, in the context of climate change communication, comments from users can influence whether a story is perceived as credible and can also disrupt an article’s intended message, particularly if comments relay personal experience or anecdotes.","Environmental Journalism: Coverage, Reader Response, and Mediators",Environmental Communication

Nevertheless, there are substantial barriers and communication challenges reported by oncology nurses. Therefore, this study was conducted to present a summary of communication challenges faced by oncology nurses. From November 2012 to March 2014, 121 inpatient nurses working in the oncology setting participated in an online pre-training qualitative survey that asked nurses to describe common communication challenges in communicating empathy and discussing death, dying, and end-of-life (EOL) goals of care. The results revealed six themes that best describe the challenges in communicating empathically with patients: dialectic tensions, burden of carrying bad news, lack of skills for empathic communication, perceived institutional barriers, dealing with “difficult” patients/families, and perceived dissimilarities between the nurse and the patient. The results for challenges in discussing death, dying and EOL goals of care revealed five themes: dialectic tensions, challenges in discussing specific topics related to EOL, lack of skills for empathic communication, patient/family characteristics, and perceived institutional barriers.

This study aims to investigate personal predisposition predictors of news media attention on this issue, including knowledge accuracy, knowledge complexity, fatalistic belief, and risk perception. A national representative data (N = 802) was collected among Singapore women (aged between 30 and 70). Structural equation model was used to test the impacts of knowledge accuracy, knowledge complexity, and fatalistic belief on women’s attention to news media through an examination of the mediation effect of risk perception. Findings showed that knowledge complexity and fatalistic belief could raise women’s risk perception, which in turn lead to news media attention on breast cancer. However, women’s knowledge accuracy on breast cancer was found to have no significant association with their risk perception. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",Cancer Health Communication,Health Communication

In an NIH supported investigation entitled Conversations about Cancer (CAC), we integrated the social sciences and the arts to create and implement a research protocol for addressing a major social problem in contemporary society: Communicating about cancer from diagnosis through death of a loved one. From verbatim family phone interactions When Cancer Calls…(WCC) was produced, an 80-minute video that was designed to assess viewing impacts across cancer patients, survivors, and family members. A multi-site, group-randomized, pretest-posttest controlled quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of WCC….
When compared to a cancer nutrition video, findings revealed that pretest-posttest and 30 day follow-up change scores were significantly higher. Key implications are raised for cancer research, education, and training that promotes meaningful dialogue about often complex communication challenges.",Cancer Health Communication,Health Communication

The effectiveness of Go Sun Smart (GSS), an occupational skin cancer health communication program, was evaluated five-seven years out from the conclusion of a randomized dissemination trial that compared an enhanced v. basic dissemination strategy. Employees’ (n=2,940) awareness of GSS, their sunburn prevalence, and sun protection practices were assessed at 53 ski areas originally enrolled in the dissemination study. Employees at ski areas in the enhanced condition reported fewer sunburns but did not differ from employees in the basic condition on any other sun protection measures. Significant differences for all sun protection practices were identified at ski areas that displayed 9 or more GSS materials or a combined total of 9 or more GSS and other sun safety messages. GSS demonstrated continued to improve sun protection over the long-term due to sustained exposure to health communication messages.

This study focuses on parents decision-making process of the cochlear implant for their child(ren). The goal of this research is to understand the dynamic influences and values, that carry weight when making such a decision, so that ultimately so it can help parents make the most informed decision. There were 33 interviews conducted of parents who had a d/Deaf child and at least once considered cochlear implantation. The findings speak to which information sources parents seek and value when making this decision, what factors parents consider when making the decision, what personal experiences they have with stigma that may or may not affect the perception of information about this risky medical procedure, and to what extent parents’ communities and networks influence their decision-making. Understanding these the decision-making process for this often times stigmatized and risky decision is important an important step because it will advance our understanding of values and perspectives surrounding cochlear implants which will facilitate the education of parents, surgeons, academics, the deaf community, and policy makers about the potential advantages and disadvantages of making such a risky and possibly furthering stigmatized decision.",Children & Family Health Communication,Health Communication

Specifically, this study explores how one’s own stress is related to one’s health outcomes and how a family member’s stress is related to one’s own health outcomes, as moderated by the frequency of communication with that family member. The effect of stress on health was tested using actor-partner interdependence models (APIM; Kashy & Kenny, 2000). Results illustrate crossover effects of stress and related health and overall well-being outcomes, including: energy, physical functioning, emotional well-being, social functioning, and loneliness, between college students and their family members.

We conducted a 2 (message frame: positive or negative) x 3 (parental mediation: no mediation, unguided mediation, or guided mediation), randomized between-subjects experiment with parent-child pairs (N = 322; age of children: between 6 and 9 years old). Results indicated that unprompted recall was greater in the unguided mediation condition. For the other outcomes (understanding, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions), positive frames were superior to negative frames. Guided mediation, on the whole, was superior to no mediation or unguided mediation. Overall, results support the effectiveness of positive framing and parents participating in a teachable moment with their kids in order to enhance the positive effects of media messages.",Children & Family Health Communication,Health Communication

With this overwhelming offer of available product versions the question how media consumers make their choice becomes pivotal. While recent approaches primarily on consumer’s attitudes towards adopting specific products and services this paper explores the applicability of findings related to the endowment effect on decision making for VoD content. Based on an online survey using a one-factorial experimental design (N=270) the study analyzes if people endowed with a premium version of a movie are more willing to keep it when offered an alternative product version (endowment effect) and subsequently are more willing to pay a higher price. Results supported for this assumption demonstrating that the willingness to pay is highest for individuals endowed with a premium movie version. Still, an even stronger endowment effect was found for individuals endowed with a lower quality (and thus cheaper) movie version.",Issues With the Study of Media Use,Mass Communication

Using data collected from a diverse sample of 1,115 college students, results indicated differences for the presence and total number of technology rules, as well as the specific reasons for those rules, based on participants’ gender, race/ethnicity, and their parents’ educational attainment. Contrary to predictions, having at least one technology rule, or having a rule restricting technology use because it cut into homework time, was negatively related to young adults’ college grades. These findings have practical importance for researchers’ understanding of what types of parents place rules on what types of children, and theoretical importance in the mediation literature for the long-term impact of technology-related rules on academic outcomes.",Issues With the Study of Media Use,Mass Communication
2015-0368,2015,Paper Session,Love Isn’t Just for the Young: Examining the Online Dating Experiences of Older Adults,1,"Recent data suggest that one of the fastest growing demographics in the online dating realm is people age 50 and older. Not only has this group gained a significant presence on sites like eHarmony and Match.com, but many in the online dating industry have begun devoting increasing amounts of attention to this population through niche services for older singles. Despite this shift, few scholars have given attention to the online dating experiences of older adults. This study is a textual analysis of an online discussion forum for older adult users of the popular dating website Plenty of Fish. The analysis suggests that online dating can serve at least three basic functions for older adults: (1) as a solution for a lack of offline dating opportunities, (2) as a virtual community for a wide range of peer interactions, and (3) as a learning environment when re-entering the dating scene.","Love, Same-Sex Marriage, Story-Telling, and Sleeping Across the Lifespan",Theme Sessions
2015-0369,2015,Paper Session,Metaphors and Social Generational Change in Discourse About Same-Sex Marriage in the US,1,"Public opinion about same-sex marriage in the U.S. has liberalized rapidly, exhibiting both cohort and period effects. This pattern suggests social generational change is occurring, but scholars have not identified the cultural reasons for the shift. In an analysis of discourse of two cohorts of Midwestern Americans, I show that informants rely on two contrasting sets of metaphors to talk about homosexuality and to justify opinions about same-sex marriage. One set of metaphors—comparing homosexuality to race and heterosexuality—defines homosexuality as identity, while the other set of metaphors—of lifestyle, nature, invisibility, and business—defines homosexuality as behavior. I interpret these metaphors as manifestations of social generational change because of the periods in which the two cohorts came of age. I argue that metaphor analysis allows scholars to measure social generational change in implicit worldviews, in figurative language, and among groups who do not collectively identify as generations.","Love, Same-Sex Marriage, Story-Telling, and Sleeping Across the Lifespan",Theme Sessions

I combine ethnographic and participatory research practices with narrative theorizing to understand the ways in which church-based stories work with, for, and on community members. I seek to understand how these stories foster a culture of altruism and spirit of stewardship that can ultimately build an inclusive community, nurture a sense of responsibility across generations, and enable residents to age in place with meaningful connection, purpose, and support.","Love, Same-Sex Marriage, Story-Telling, and Sleeping Across the Lifespan",Theme Sessions

These behaviors are related and can result in poorer physical and cognitive well-being. Using data from the Annenberg Media Environment Survey, this study assessed responses of 814 parents with children, age 10-17. Parents reported children’s exposure to media, bedtime, sleep duration, general health and grades. The goal was to disentangle the relationships between these variables. Results indicate that media use in the hour before bed was associated with later bedtimes. Later bedtimes were then predictive of poorer general health, suggesting that the experience of shifting one’s sleep-wake cycle has adverse effects. Only media use was associated with children’s grades in school, supporting a displacement hypothesis and countering the research suggesting sleep impacts academic performance. Thus, this study revealed the relationships between media, sleep and well-being emerging during the vital period of adolescence.","Love, Same-Sex Marriage, Story-Telling, and Sleeping Across the Lifespan",Theme Sessions

Previous research has addressed various factors influencing these prosocial behaviors, but there is a dearth of research using consumer socialization theory. Through the use of an online survey of college students from a small Eastern University (N = 310), the current body of research utilized consumer socialization theory to examine the influence of three socialization agents (parents, peers, and media) have on individuals’ prosocial attitude and behavioral intentions. Analysis reveals interpersonal agents had the greatest influence. Specifically, peer socialization had the strongest direct influence on prosocial attitudes and behavioral intentions, while parental socialization only had significant influence on prosocial behavior. Additionally, gender differences were found with females having more favorable prosocial attitudes and behavioral intentions.",Effects of Interpersonal Communication on Persuasion and Compliance Gaining,Interpersonal Communication

This study further extends IMPR to understand the connections with social judgment theory (SJT) predictions of persuasive boomerang. Findings corroborate that IMPR is not specific to freedom threat. Counterattitudinal messages can induce reactance from individuals with vested interest in the issue under consideration. Lack or absence of attitude change often observed in heated political or economic debates could also be understood based on reactance stemming from issue involvement. Reexamining other rational models of persuasion through the lens of IMPR should help further the external validity of, and establish the boundary conditions for, the synergistic approach of persuasion that considers both affect and cognition in predicting attitude change.",Effects of Interpersonal Communication on Persuasion and Compliance Gaining,Interpersonal Communication

Further, efficiency and certainty were correlated in the third minute of an interaction but only when the detector had ample cognitive resources to make use of pursuers' efficient language.

2015-0377,2015,Paper Session,The Trouble With “Screen Time”: Disability and the Social Construction of Children’s Mediated Bodies,1,"This paper critically analyzes popular discourse around “screen time,” a phrase coined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in the early 2000s that refers to children’s time spent with any screen-based media. The concept is frequently employed in the US press, mostly in the pejorative sense—for example, campaigns aimed at reducing children’s screen time. While critical media scholars have pointed out myriad ways in which this terminology is problematic (e.g. as determinist and classist), new angles emerge when considering children with disabilities and their varied uses of media. This analysis of screen time discourse draws on feminist disability scholar Alison Kafer’s political/relational model of disability, which emphasizes identifying ableist rhetoric in sites where disability is not overtly present. I contend that while youth with disabilities are largely rendered invisible in popular discussions of children and media, their social construction as “other” underpins the cultural hegemony of screen time.","Coming of Age With Popular Media: Tracing Youth Cultures Through Screens, Comics, and the News",Popular Communication

The methodology used to examine the narratives is based upon Kenneth Burke’s dramatism, while Julia Kristeva’s concept of abjection informs the analysis. On one hand, a paradigmatic reading suggests that the films frame self-injury as resistance to repressive maternal domination of female adolescents. On the other hand, syntagmatic analysis reveals a privileged response to NSSI in the form of pacification administered by psychotherapists functioning as the return of the phallic-mother fantasy.","Coming of Age With Popular Media: Tracing Youth Cultures Through Screens, Comics, and the News",Popular Communication
2015-0379,2015,Paper Session,"""Share Your Universe"": Gender, Generation, and the Future of Marvel Comics Publishing",1,"Through its “Share Your Universe” campaign, Marvel Comics cultivated a new generation of consumers, addressing the existing audience frequently as parents (usually as fathers) who could transmit their interests to their children. This paper examines the initiative as a crucial articulation between industrial anxieties about reproduction of cultural product and industrial assumptions about children, adults, and generational reproduction. The analysis first considers the state of Marvel's comic book market, in terms of its contracting, aging, gendered readership and in comparison to other markets where comic-themed heroes increasingly thrive. Examination moves secondly to “Share Your Universe” itself, investigating how Marvel discursively constructed and hailed comic book readers as aged and gendered agents of industrial promotion who could ensure generational continuity. Overall, this campaign shows how calculated inter-generational marketing strategies rely on the construction of meaningful audience identities that facilitate cultural reproduction and enable gendered claims to authority over it.","Coming of Age With Popular Media: Tracing Youth Cultures Through Screens, Comics, and the News",Popular Communication

What does this mean for the future of democracy? This paper illustrates that traditional definitions of civic engagement do not adequately capture contemporary ways that youth are becoming informed about news, developing political views and participating in forms of civic engagement. Based on interviews with 100 racially diverse US teenagers, it reveals how they learn about current events; their disillusionment with traditional mainstream news media; and changing attitudes about what it means to be informed. The findings suggest that youth are not as disinterested in news as adults assume, and have not abandoned concern for the public good. Their desire for and appreciation of the larger meanings and impacts of news events attracts them to online blogs, Facebook, Twitter, “fake news” and other “non news” popular media sources whose lack of journalistic “objectivity” makes them more newsworthy to the young. The media consumption behaviors of today’s youth illustrate that civic engagement occurs in a variety of ways that fall outside the realm of “official news and politics” and suggest how mainstream news outlets might better attract young audiences.","Coming of Age With Popular Media: Tracing Youth Cultures Through Screens, Comics, and the News",Popular Communication

Theoretically, this study builds on insights from celebrity studies, social constructionist childhood theories and intersectional feminist theory regarding age and gender as power structures. One constructed week of articles (N = 668) and comments (N = 5302) on celebrity gossip website JustJared and its teen spin-off JustJaredjr. is subjected to a quantitative and qualitative framing analysis. Results show that 16-20 year old celebrities hold a special position, being judged most negatively by JustJared audiences, and most positively by those of JustJaredjr. This age group is framed as having increasing agency, but is also subjected to strong scrutiny. Additionally, framing analysis shows JustJaredjr. to use more positive frames with regards to young celebrities, while Justjared’s concern with protecting young children strips them of their agency.","Coming of Age With Popular Media: Tracing Youth Cultures Through Screens, Comics, and the News",Popular Communication

This study seeks to determine the forms of “participatory journalism” that it is taking in an authoritarian space by subjecting to analysis the way the polls are used offline and online by Chinese media. Through a longitudinal content analysis of China’s largest official newspaper and its news website, we attempt to identify the signs of “media logic” vis-à-vis “political logic” in its poll reporting, and to test whether its online and offline platforms share the same logics. While abundant literature suggests that U.S. reporting of opinion polls conforms to a horse-race image, this study found that Chinese media’s use of polls tends to reinforce an image of “consensus” in support of superiors. Furthermore, this study found that compared with the print version, the online platform creates more participatory and entertainment features to existing poll stories.","News and Journalism in Authoritarian, Postconflict, and Emerging Democracy Regimes",Journalism Studies

This study employs a census of journalism educators in Republic of Georgia to explore adoption of innovations in journalism courses in the educational institutions across the country. Applying diffusion of innovations framework, findings of this research suggest that although larger journalism programs adopt more innovations, at least one innovation is adopted even by the smallest programs. This study also found that observability of an innovation is mostly positively related to adoption behavior. In addition, findings suggest that Georgian educators most frequently teach multimedia skills, social media and digital storytelling, while the least taught are basic programming skills and entrepreneurship.","News and Journalism in Authoritarian, Postconflict, and Emerging Democracy Regimes",Journalism Studies

It uses three different but still comparable countries as examples on the subject: Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia. Through assessing roles and perceptions of journalists this paper identifies influences on journalism in a form of self-censorship. The combination of these two approaches along with the qualitative methodology also allows to look at the phenomenon from a cognitive perspective, shedding light on self-censorship as particular category of influence on the news production in (post-) conflict societies. Thus, the selected cases enable to understand the situation in (post-) conflict and explain particularities of the media development and journalism paths along with the perceptions of journalists themselves on the subject. The overview that we get from our qualitative interviews demonstrates journalists from similar background countries to be in similar situation facing self-censorship.","News and Journalism in Authoritarian, Postconflict, and Emerging Democracy Regimes",Journalism Studies
2015-0386,2015,Paper Session,Models and Evidence: Globalized Journalism in an Emerging Democracy,1,"Recent research has called for a closer look at non-Western journalism and press systems in light of the world's increasing globalization and the interconnectedness Internet technology allows. This topic engenders lively debate between scholars who claim the world of professional journalists is increasingly homogenized, those who claim local mores and habits are as influential as they have ever been, and scholars who note there is simply not enough information on non-Western journalism practices to stake a claim. The research presented here joins the discussion on globalization and media typologies by proposing a media systems typology that draws from multiple models to create a hybrid systems approach. To test this proposal, the hybrid typology is tested with the most-likely case of Kenya's Daily Nation, where a content analysis of two constructed weeks of coverage in 2013 finds that news content does appear to share values with many other media systems, both in judgments of newsworthiness and in writing patterns. Evidence of historical-globalized, goal-based, and local influences along with unique tendencies in this outlet's news style supports the claim that news style is informed by a mixture of outside influences which cannot be easily encompassed by extant categories. This leads to compelling future research directions for globalization and the study of emerging press systems.","News and Journalism in Authoritarian, Postconflict, and Emerging Democracy Regimes",Journalism Studies

The fast-changing, digitalized media environment leads to a new application of this theory. Using the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster in South Korea, an online survey with 545 respondents examined how media affect perception of congruent opinion, in turn, how fear of isolation (FOI) and situational perceptual and cognitive variables mediate perception of congruent opinion and the willingness to speak out.

An online survey with 224 participants recruited from Mechanical Turk at Amazon.com found that two groups of media sources contributed to cultivating different manners of media gratifications among audiences. The online media users tended to rely less on their preferred online sources when they gathered information about the controversial issue than they did for the non-controversial issue. Yet, this was not true of traditional media users. While traditional media users demonstrated great deviance in seeking information offline on social issues, they highly engaged with interpersonal discussions about two of the less sensitive and debatable issues. However, new media users engaged more often with interpersonal discussions for contentious issues than non-contentious ones.

The current study investigates how mass media cues develop over time and how they affect the depth of opinion formation of citizens, drawing on panel and content analysis data. Findings show that media and public attention decay across issues. However, the speed of decay varies strongly between issues. Investigation of individual-level mechanisms indicate that media users use visibility cues from media content to allocate their opinion formation efforts. Analyses of invariance show that different outcomes (decay curves) for different issues are not the result of issue-specific mechanisms but of different media portrayals and initial perceptions of issues (input values).",Advances in Public Opinion Research (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication
2015-0391,2015,Paper Session,Short and Sweet: The Persuasive Effects of Message Framing and Temporal Context in Antismoking Warning Labels,4,"Warning labels on cigarette packages are generally focused on long-term costs that can be incurred if one continues smoking. This study compares the effects of these labels against warning labels that stress short-term costs of smoking, as well as labels that stress benefits that can be obtained when one quits smoking. A 2 (message frame: gain vs. loss) x 2 (temporal context: short vs. long-term) between-subjects experiment was conducted among 134 smokers. Findings were in line with theory regarding message framing and temporal discounting, showing enhanced effects of gain versus loss frames and short- versus long-term consequences on warning labels. Additionally, an interaction between message frame and temporal context was found. Gain framed messages showed stronger effects on intentions to quit smoking than loss framed messages, especially when warning labels concerned short-term outcomes. Findings suggest that warning labels should stress the immediate benefits of quitting smoking.",Anti-Smoking Messages and Campaigns,Health Communication
2015-0392,2015,Paper Session,The Effect of Anticipated Regret Appeal on Adolescents’ Smoking Intentions,2,"Objectives. To examine the impact of anticipated regret messages in enhancing risk beliefs about smoking and reducing smoking-intentions among non-smoking adolescents.
Methods. Non-smoking adolescents (age 13-17, N=491) who were recruited nationally were randomly assigned to either no-message control or an anticipated regret-messages condition. Self-report data was analyzed in AMOS. Teens were classified based on contextual risks - whether or not they have any family members or close friends who smoke).
Results. Among at-risk youth, the regret messages resulted in greater anticipated regret and perceived DNA harm, which, in turn, resulted in decreased intentions to smoke. For adolescents not-at-risk, the regret messages did not result in feelings of anticipated regret but instead, heighted perceived DNA harm, which decreased likelihood to smoke.
Conclusions. Implications for message design and anti-tobacco campaigns as well as future research are discussed. In particular, campaign messages should include the impact of tobacco use on DNA.",Anti-Smoking Messages and Campaigns,Health Communication
2015-0393,2015,Paper Session,Using the Theory of Planned Behavior to Design Messages Aimed at Increasing Compliance With a Tobacco-Free Policy,4,"The implementation of a tobacco-free policy is the leading recommendation among health organizations for reducing the harms associated with tobacco exposure—for both smokers and nonsmokers—on college campuses. Despite the health benefits associated with tobacco-free policies, compliance with these policies remains a serious challenge on college campuses that have adopted them. Interventions aimed at increasing smokers’ willingness to comply with tobacco-free policies are essential for improving public health. Guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study aimed to design theory-based messages to increase compliance with a tobacco-free campus policy. To achieve this aim, focus groups were held with undergraduate smokers to discuss messaging strategies related to increasing tobacco-free policy compliance. Results from this study were used to design persuasive messages that were employed in an effective University-wide campaign that increased tobacco-free policy compliance.",Anti-Smoking Messages and Campaigns,Health Communication
2015-0394,2015,Paper Session,Why Do Smokers Talk About Antismoking Campaigns? Predictors of the Occurrence and Content of Campaign-Generated Conversations,4,"Smokers often talk about antismoking campaigns and these conversations can contribute to campaign effectiveness. Yet, little is known about what predicts naturally-occurring campaign-generated conversations and the content of these conversations. In two studies (Study 1 N=480; Study 2, N=232), we systematically examined whether the occurrence and content of the conversations smokers participated in after they were exposed to one of eight antismoking television advertisements was predicted by characteristics of: (a) the message; (b) intrapersonal responses to the message; and (c) the individual. We found that smokers had more conversations when they experienced emotional responses and thought about their own behaviour while watching the ad and the findings suggested that talk may also be predicted by message novelty. However, there was little evidence that conversation occurrence or content was predicted by individual characteristics. These findings suggest several promising avenues for future investigations into why smokers talk and talk in particular ways.",Anti-Smoking Messages and Campaigns,Health Communication
2015-0395,2015,Paper Session,Tailoring By “Cloning”: A User-Based Collaborative Filtering Approach to Recommend Effective Antismoking PSAs,5,"Theoretical and empirical approaches to the design of effective messages to increase healthy and reduce risky behavior have shown only incremental progress. Recommendation systems as employed by companies like Amazon and Netflix, utilize user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) which holds the potential to leapfrog conventional models of message research and achieve individual-specific tailoring at scale. This paper reports the effectiveness of statistical “cloning” and “contra-cloning”, an innovative test of the applicability of UBCF, in the context of anti-smoking PSAs. With a nationally representative sample of current smokers and an archive of professionally produced PSAs, “clones”/“contra-clones”—other participants sharing “similar”/“dissimilar” rating patterns with the target individual—were found to positively/negatively predict the target individual’s evaluation of a PSA unseen, even after controlling for individual characteristics and the confounding of mere aggregation. The UBCF approach, and recommendation systems broadly, have important implications for health communication research in general and message tailoring in specific.",Anti-Smoking Messages and Campaigns,Health Communication

An extensive body of research points to a strong connection between youth exposure to tobacco marketing and subsequent interest in and/or initiation of smoking behavior. Our study examined effects of e-cigarette and cigarillo advertisements on perceived social norms, perceived risks and benefits, and intentions to use tobacco products among a nationally representative sample of 1,336 adolescents ages 13-17. We did not find significant effects on perceptions, but those who saw cigarillo ads were more receptive to trying cigarillos.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0397,2015,Paper Session,An Exploratory Investigation of the Links Between Colleges Students’ Social Networking Site Use and Problem Drinking,2,"Posting alcohol-related content on social networking sites is associated with increased alcohol use, even problem drinking, among college students (e.g., Moreno, Christakis, Egan, Brockman, & Becker, 2012). Problem drinking is associated with driving under the influence, alcohol poisoning, physical sexual assault (Hingson, Zha, & Weitzman, 2009), as well as alcohol abuse and dependency (Jennison, 2004) and even death (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2013). Numerous interventions have been enacted to combat problem drinking (c.f., Careya, Scott-Sheldonc, Elliotte, Gareya, & Carey, 2012), and the National Institutes of Health (2014) recently urged researchers to better understand the connections between social networking use and problem drinking. Thus, through an online survey of 348 undergraduate students at a mid-sized U.S. university, the present study explored what influences alcohol-related SNS use, the individual factors related to SNS use and problem drinking, and the SNS sites most related to drinking and its related consequences.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0398,2015,Paper Session,Do Children on the Autism Spectrum Learn Emotion Recognition From Media Content? A Survey of Parents,1,"Research out of Cambridge University suggests children ages 2-8 with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are learning emotion recognition skills from media content such as Thomas the Tank Engine (Baron-Cohen, 2008). Whereas these researchers have posited in their Hyper-Systemizing Theory that the reason for such learning lies in idiosyncrasies related to ASD, this author contends that the way the media itself is crafted is the key element in determining successful learning. This survey asks parents of children with ASD about their child’s relationship with media, what media has been most successful/unsuccessful, whether there are specific programs/characters that seem like favorites, and whether they believe their children are learning skills such as emotion recognition and perspective-taking from their media diets. The survey was launched November 1, 2014 via Qualtrics and will reach parents of children with ASD via snowball sampling. The goal is to get 350-400 responses.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media

MRN fan letters demonstrate the efficacy of this invitational tone in the respectful, familiar, and conversational manner in which they address the program’s host. This paper examines fan letters written to Fred Rogers during the first fifteen years of MRN (1968-1983) from the perspective of Mikhail Bakhtin’s dialogical theorization of the conversational moment – a moment which “provokes an answer, anticipates it, and structures itself in the answer’s direction.” The abundance of fan letters written to Rogers during this period reveal a remarkable consistency in their collective thematic quality and constitute a field of study about the dialogical relationship between the program’s host, the historical Fred Rogers, and MRN’s audience.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media

This study analyzes the effect of aggressive music on implicit and explicit aggression. Fifty-six undergraduate students listened to music excerpts from one of four different genres and completed a priming exercise following this exposure. Results showed that participants were not implicitly primed for aggression following exposure to aggressive music, nor were they found to record higher amounts of aggression following aggressing music exposure. Discussion revolves around potential reasoning as to why results reported in this study contradict previous findings. Specifically, the required duration of music exposure necessary to evoke an emotional response is emphasized, further highlighting interdisciplinary connections between this and other disciplines.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media

Drawing from the results of a mixed-methods study (surveys, in-depth interviews) involving twelve 10-14 year old students in an urban after-school program, we describe how social media may enable underprivileged youth to engage more fully with peers and community support organizations, while simultaneously generating tension with adults and enabling surveillance of spaces and social interactions that were once privy only to other children. We conclude by suggesting possible future directions for both research and school- and after-school- based youth programming related to social media and social capital.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media

2015-0404,2015,Paper Session,Bridging the Deficit in Moral Panic: A Sociopolitical Analysis of Middle Aged Women in the Philippines,1,"This discourse argues for an emerging model of communication in conveying ideas where sense making of panic research is critically analyzed. The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) framed the investigation of (1) anger, (2) fear and (3) threat among the different stereotypical roles of middle age women as young wife, mother to children, career executive and economic provider.

It attempts to bridge the gap of social intersubjectivity in panic research by providing an emergent model for analytical discourse. While a number of analytic studies have examined how particular linguistic repertoires are used in news coverage, still it remains under researched (Carvalho, 2007:225).

EPPM provided the impetus to determine how select news reportage sensitize mid-life women in the Philippines to potential risks using fear or threat appeal (Leventhal, 1970). Debunking the extended parallel process model in conjunction with feelings of severity (one’ perception that if the potential negative outcome occurs, it will be serious), susceptibility (feelings of being vulnerable), self efficacy (one’s ability to perform the necessary behavior) and response efficacy (the ability of that behavior to alleviate risk) (Witte, 1992), the study tested all constructs as evoking stronger positive intention/ unintentionally in promoting moral panic. This was undertaken to elucidate the normative and temporal actions/reactions of the study’s subjects.

Three case studies tested EPPM factors employing a sociological critical discourse analysis where the first phase will be a textual analysis. Here, discourse analysis centers on textuality as a level of discourse establishing pertinent relations or significances anchored on the premise that discourse not only embeds meaning but also produces it. The second case in point approached discourse as a singular event centering on context as the space where discourse emerged and in which it acquires meaning. Finally, the third investigation socio-political analysis treated discourse as information, ideology and a social product.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 1",Children Adolescents and the Media

A combination of message coding and patient evaluations was used to analyze present and future-oriented temporal message content in 46 adherence messages drawn from personal interviews and focus groups with chronically-ill patients. A total of 1,968 chronically-ill patients completed an internet-based survey to assess message quality, message agreement, message liking, and message engagement.

2015-0406,2015,Paper Session,An Exploration of Sociopsychological Factors Associated With Suboptimal Adherence to Therapeutic Regimens Among Patients on Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis,3,"Peritonitis is a leading complication and has significant health and social consequences to end-stage kidney disease patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Prior research has shown that nonadherence to the therapeutic regimens is a risk factor of peritonitis. However, very few studies identified the factors associated with nonadherence. By applying the health belief modal, this study attempts to explore the risk perception of peritonitis and the sociopsychological factors that contribute to suboptimal adherence to the therapeutic regimens among patients on CAPD. Seven focus groups were conducted with CAPD patients (n = 34). The results indicated that the perception of susceptibility varied across patients’ past experience with peritonitis. Physical pain, prolonged hospitalization and technique failure, psychological distress, work and personal finance, and a burden to the family were identified as the health and social consequences of peritonitis. The patients perceived autonomy and independence and minimizing the sense of guilt as the benefits of adherence to therapeutic regimens. Perceived barriers to adherence included social activities and work, cost of treatment, fatigue, and environmental constraints. Patients considered adaptation to the CAPD treatment and a pessimistic attitude toward the kidney disease as sources of influence on their self-efficacy. Finally, patients mentioned the mutual support from other patients and the hotline provided by the renal center, at the public hospital, as effective cues to action. The discussion of findings emphasizes the design of health messages and intervention programs for health communicators and healthcare professionals.",Health Messages for Adherence and Compliance,Health Communication

A total of 418 adults were first asked to read a patient profile and then were randomly assigned to one of four website conditions. The Judge-Advisor System (JAS) was the research paradigm used in this study which recognizes that in many decision-making situations, more than one person is involved in the decision-making (Sniezek & Buckley, 1995; Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001). The results indicated that perceived doctor-website concordance was significant predictor of participants’ intentions to comply when the participants were assigned to concordant condition whereas perceived doctor-self concordance predicted intentions to comply in conflicting conditions. Mediation analyses showed that exposure to concordant advice condition led to increased perceived doctor-website concordance which in turn led to increased intention to comply with doctor’s advice.",Health Messages for Adherence and Compliance,Health Communication

Creating campaigns to slow the incidence and spread of antibiotic resistance is challenging because the goal—antibiotic stewardship—encompasses multiple behaviors. This study provided a novel approach to audience segmentation for a multifaceted goal, by using a person-centered approach to identify profiles of US adults based on shared stewardship intentions. The latent class analysis identified three groups: Stewards, Stockers, and Persuaders. The findings suggest campaign goals of encouraging Stewards to follow through on their intentions, encouraging Stockers to dispose of their leftover antibiotics, and convincing Persuaders to accept medical advice when an antibiotic is not indicated.

2015-0410,2015,Paper Session,"Women, ICT for Development, and Multistakeholder Partnerships: Individualism, Collectivism, and Neoliberal Flexibility",1,"Public-private partnerships (PPPs), encouraged by international development agencies, have become the norm in approaches to information and communication technology for development (ICTD). Public-private partnership schemes—where governments, communities, the business sector, civil society organizations, and development programs—are said to allow government enablement of both markets and communities. This policy arrangement now is the norm in ‘development’. However, even if PPPs are able to create wealth, the equitable distribution of that wealth does not follow; almost invariably, the business and government sectors benefit more than do members of the community, enjoying a financial largesse that the women who have become attractive targets for PPPs will never experience. The key concern of most development programs is service delivery. On the contrary, I address the power relations and gender-centered contexts within which PPPs are implemented in India. Unlike the common North American interpretation of labor organizations, the ‘woman problem’ in India does not always center on how to incorporate women into already-existing trade unions and worker federations. Women worker associations sector are abundant in India, particularly in the informal sector. Information technology companies flock to India in order to engage in PPPs that create an extensive worker and consumer base. The women targeted by these PPPs are positioned discursively as self-reliant ‘entrepreneurs’, ‘enterprising women’ who will become empowered individuals despite the likelihood that their ICT skills training tends to open the door to low-paid, low-skilled information worker, purportedly linking their enterprises to the national and global economy. Women's ICT entrepreneurship programs appear troubled by a situation in which neoliberalization erodes affinities that exist within women’s collectives and leads to atomistic individualism (the un-doing of feminist potential), In this paper, based in empirical analysis, the conceptual framework focuses on the extraordinary flexibility of neoliberal policies, thereby necessitating that individualism and collectivism co-exist and are co-implicated from the inception of a PPP to the ongoing experiences of women targeted by them. This is central to the neoliberal imaginary as it pertains to women in today’s society.",Feminist Contributions to Global Communications Governance and Policy,Feminist Scholarship

In Kenya, e-health strategy implemented in 2011, seeks to exploit the expanding ICT in the country for the healthcare and health communication with a focus on five strategic areas: telemedicine, health information systems, information dissemination, m-health and e-learning. Limited knowledge, however, exists on the challenges for e-health in the less developed nations that face challenges with connectivity, infrastructure, security, expertise in medical informatics and human and financial resources at the same time that they are disproportionately impacted by disease and poor health. The goal of this study is to examine e-health strategy in Kenya and the extent to which health organizations have implemented it in addressing HIV/AIDS among women in Kenya. With 8% HIV prevalence compared to 4.3% among men, women’s infection rate exceeds the national average of 6.2%. The Kenya HIV/AIDS policy promotes gender-centered healthcare, treatment and communication for HIV prevention and it is important to examine how health and non-profit organization have adopted e-health in implementing the policy. Data reported in the study were gathered through in-depth interviews with health organizations in Kenya.

In the hot spots of Europe, such as Greece and Spain, alongside with policies of privatization and severe lowering of wages and secure labour, the withdrawal of the State from its public service responsibilities has caused the impoverishment of previously economically safe social groups The case of the forced closure of the Greek Public Service Broadcaster ERT is of particular significance within the context of the shrinkage of public services in Europe. The presentation examines the condition of the PSBs closure as endemic of two major policy forces in the European area: first, the general challenging of public services in Europe, and second, a sustained approach of limiting public service media with a view to the privatization of world radio frequencies in 2015. Through the lenses of communication policy, the paper will situate the human at the centre of its institutional analysis with the aim to provide a feminist evaluation of public policy with the case study of Greece. Women are central agents in the domains of public service, media and cultural production, by providing voluntary unpaid labour to organizations, through their unpaid labour of care, and as media workers and media consumers. The closure of ERT will be analyzed as an example of symbolic and structural silencing of the channels that gave voice to the marginalization of society under the austerity regime. Finally, the paper will examine the sustained resistance of former ERT workers during their self-governed broadcasting and running of ERTOPEN, the ‘pirate’ ERT.

Results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses indicate that the effect for leader-member dyadic communication differentiation and the dyads ethnicity similarity only occurs near the end of the group’s lifecycle. These findings show that effects for leader-member dyadic communication differentiation on group member performance differ depending on the ethnicity of the dyads to which they belong at what point in the group’s lifecycle dyadic communication is assessed.

2015-0414,2015,Paper Session,Constructing Common Ground for Cross-Cultural Communication: An Interactive-Metaphorical Approach,1,"It is a long-cherished wish of many people to establish common ground for cross-cultural communication. Various conceptualizations of how to achieve this have been developed through the centuries. That which is most encouraging and inspiring is not, however, based on the notion of a gift from God or the foundation of humanity, or a universal structure of human experience, but rather is conceived as the terms, agreements, and consensus reached by two cultural parties to facilitate communication and mutual understanding. This essay takes the archetypal metaphor as the point of departure to discuss the possibility of building such common ground. It is argued that cross-cultural communication is an interactive, two-way metaphorical process. The founding of a basis of understanding between two cultures depends on whether their conceptual systems are able to reconcile the divergences in their metaphorical structures by way of mutual projection and accommodation, and on whether they are willing to agree to such reconciliation.",Short Intercultural Presentations (SIPs),Intercultural Communication

A qualitative approach involving 40 interviews with Americans living in Sweden and Swedes living in the U.S. was employed in order to gain a nuanced, in-depth, and contextual understanding of how immigrants and expatriates experience the process. Several differences in communication patterns between the two cultures emerged, including willingness to communicate, communication apprehension, communication regulation; argumentativeness, self-disclosure, affect display, and eye-contact. The results provide insights into how intercultural communication competence is developed differently across cultures and how the cognitive, affective and behavioral components are inter-related and influenced by culture-specific aspects and conditions. Findings revealed that intercultural awareness is acquired by comparing and evaluating home and host-culture aspects, that intercultural sensitivity is understood from a home-culture perspective, and that effective communication across cultures requires intercultural sensitivity which, in turn, requires intercultural awareness.",Short Intercultural Presentations (SIPs),Intercultural Communication

Through a content analysis of research articles published in 11 journals listed in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), 73 articles focusing on the social mediated crisis communication (SMCC) in the period from 2002-2014 were identified. This study examined the crises (e.g., crisis types, time, and region) and the CCS addressed in these articles. Findings showed that, among the total of 73 journal articles, new strategies such as enhancing and transferring from the organizational perspective were added; the more involved “stakeholders” and their desired strategies were analyzed; an asymmetrical CCS pattern from a contextual perspective was proposed within the SMCC research. Results also pointed out some weaknesses (e.g., the inconsistency in traditional CCS theories, the ambiguous “interactive” strategy, and the lack of a synthesized strategy toolkit) within current literature. An “interactive crisis communication” (ICC) model was proposed for future research agenda.

Findings demonstrate the use of social media to facilitate two-way communication with internal and external publics; the emergence of new situations requiring response in a social media environment; the importance of connecting with audiences on an emotional level; and the challenges of cultivating ""brand ambassadors"" among internal stakeholders.",Social Media Communications in Critical Situations,Public Relations
2015-0421,2015,Paper Session,To Err is Human? How to Establish a Human Voice in Organizational Responses to Online Criticism,1,"Organizations increasingly respond to online criticism to counter its detrimental effects on other consumers, a practice that is referred to as webcare. The success of webcare is found to hinge upon an organization’s ability to demonstrate a conversational human voice. Hence, for organizations it is important to gain insight into the antecedents of conversational human voice. This research examined two message characteristics that can potentially enhance an organization's conversational human voice: message personalization and message formality. The results show that message personalization, but not message formality, can directly enhance an organization's conversational human voice. An interaction effect was also found, such that personalization can enhance the conversational human voice of formal messages, and informality can enhance the conversational human voice of unpersonalized messages. However, a combination of personalized informal messages does not result in an even higher degree of conversational human voice, thereby indicating a ceiling effect. For brand evaluations, a combination even resulted in negative effects.",Social Media Communications in Critical Situations,Public Relations
2015-0422,2015,Paper Session,Using Social Media for Organizational Resilience: Alumni Relations Across the Life Span of Identification-Disruptive Events,1,"The specific focus of this project is on university alumni relations offices’ use of social media to restore organizational identification and establish organizational resilience during identification-disruptive events. According to Buzzanell (2010), constructing resilience is a process of reintegrating from disruptions in life, which, she hypothesizes, consists of five primary communication processes: crafting normalcy, affirming identity anchors, maintaining and using communication networks, putting alternative logics to work, and legitimizing negative feelings while foregrounding productive action. This study will build upon this theoretical work by conducting interviews with alumni directors and discourse analyses of critical periods of social media use to provide empirical evidence of those social media practices that build/maintain identification and those that construct resilience. When universities and colleges undergo significant changes, become embroiled in scandal, or lose prestige, alumni may distance themselves from their alma mater and experience disidentification, or the separation of personal identity from organizational identity (Elsbach & Bhattacharya, 2001). Therefore, this project seeks to understand how, when changes occur that threaten alumni’s organizational identification, institutions use social media to construct resilience.",Social Media Communications in Critical Situations,Public Relations
2015-0423,2015,Paper Session,Examining Organizational Support Networks: Homophily in a Korean Immigrant Church,3,"Given the important implications of social support on managing volunteers and their organizational commitment, we investigate how members of a Korean immigrant church (N = 178) exchange various kinds of social support (i.e., informational, emotional, and tangible) using a social network approach. Employing an exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), the current study estimates the likelihood of age and gender homophily in forming supportive ties while simultaneously considering structural parameters (e.g., edges, degrees, and geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners.) Hypotheses regarding the effect of members’ socioeconomic status and hierarchical positions on their network centralities were supported overall; however, ERGM for the three types of support networks produced a more nuanced picture of selective process of Korean immigrants’ support exchange. The findings shed light on the internal structuring of organizational support networks and suggest practical implications for managing organizational volunteers.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication

Drawing on recent advancement in two-mode Exponential random graph model, we examine two-mode network generated by a digital collaboration platform on employee participation during a 12-day idea challenge in a global IT corporation. We assess the network logics and individual-level factors that shape network structure of idea generation and selection of a few good ideas from a large amount of ideas pitched. Results demonstrate a Matthew effect leading to employee participation that is highly centralized around a few “super-active” employees engaged with many ideas, and highly centralized idea popularity with very few ideas attracting most employee activity and most ideas garnering little attention. We also find some support for employee-idea clustering or “block-voting” as well as geographic homophily in employee participation.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication
2015-0425,2015,Paper Session,An Adapted Structurational Framework of Network Emergence,4,"Although structuration theory (ST) has endured a considerable influence in organizational communication research, there remains a paucity of quantitative empirical research using ST as a viable framework. The purpose of this paper is to develop an adapted structurational framework to explain the emergence of communication interactions within and between organizations. The adapted framework distinguishes between relational states/events and internal/external structural rules. For analysis, we introduce multi-panel relational event modeling, a technique that uses processual inference to empirically demonstrate the recursive nature of system and structure. As an introductory example, we examined the organizational socialization processes, using cell phone data, of students living in the same dormitory from September 2008 through February 2009. Our results demonstrate how different structures (i.e., perceived social relations and internal structural rules) are reproduced and transformed over time. Our research contributes to empirical applications of ST, theories of network science, organizational socialization, and computational social science.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication

We analyze changes compared to data collected in 2007 (as reported in Barnett, Danowski, Feely, & Stalker, 2010), and we identify the factors that underlie the formation of recruitment ties. Our findings challenge prior conclusions that faculty-hiring patterns measure quality in doctoral education; instead, our models suggest that recruitment networks result from inter-organizational dynamics that are likely to be generated by employee mobility. Controlling for these endogenous forces, institutional prestige and faculty seniority are the most important factors shaping the hiring and placement network.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication
2015-0427,2015,Paper Session,"Partnership Networks for Public Diplomacy: Power Differential and Resource Transaction in the 100,000 Strong Network",1,"Recently, public diplomacy scholarship started to focus beyond the traditional monologue and dialogue models and towards collaborative and relational approaches. However, there has been little examination of partnership networks gathering resources for public diplomacy implementation. This paper applies social network analysis to a case study, the 100,000 Strong network, and explains two network mechanisms for public diplomacy: power differential and resource transaction. It outlines the power dimensions of the network and explores the functions of bridging network structural holes that transact resources among network actors. This study concludes that through connecting with organizations in the network, the 100,000 Strong Foundation gains various resources for public diplomacy. This study also informs a new perspective on public diplomacy: while admitting the importance of the public diplomacy implementation, we should also pay attention to partnerships and interorganizational networks that provide new momentum to gather and share resources for public diplomacy implementation.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication
2015-0428,2015,Paper Session,"Interorganizational Social Capital: Examining Structural Holes, Closure, and Constrained Choice Models of Civil Society Networks",4,"Organizations in the civil society sector pursue organizational social capital through the formation and maintenance of interorganizational relationships. Scholars have suggested three strategies that enhance social capital: closure, exploitation of structural holes, and “cupid” collaboration arrangements. We examine the evidence for each of these three strategies in a network of 489 international nongovernmental organizations during a 14 year period (1990-2004) using Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Modeling. The results provide strong support for closure mechanisms, particularly in the first half of the observation period. In contrast, social capital generation through structural holes and cupid relationships is present in only a few years, and those strategies do not persist over time. Overall, this network of civil society organizations dominantly uses a strategy of generating collective social capital by forging multiple collaborative ties among the INGOs which constitute this community.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication

Data were collected through an online survey with humanitarian organizations and through longitudinal tracking of social media data of these organizations from one month before to three months after the storm. The results from the survey data showed that the interorganizational network among relief organizations evolved in a consistent and stable manner where prior relationships positively influenced the following ones. This consistency in turn helped organizations’ engagement of multiple types of resource exchanges (relational multiplexity) and multiple ways of communication (multimodal communication) with one another. Analysis of these organizations’ Twitter data revealed a generally stable yet dynamic pattern of network evolution, with the typhoon serving as the force temporarily disturbing the system. The online and offline results of these organizing networks were a wider scope of partnering organizations for relief operations on the ground and a self-sustained and quickly mobilized network of organizing on Twitter. Addressing the interplay between the temporal dynamics of humanitarian organizing and technology use, findings of this study bring to light ways to foster and sustain the development of collective efforts in humanitarian support.",B.E.S.T.: Communication Networks in and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication

I contribute to the internationalization movement by drawing on the Montreal School’s actor-network theory and postcolonial theory to excavate the voices of Islamic faith-based organizations (FBOs)—through their hybrid associations with spokespersons and Nigerian news texts—during the polio vaccination stoppage in Northern Nigeria (which led to national and international crises with continuing impact). I found the FBOs articulating several obstacles to interorganizational cooperation over polio eradication: different health priorities between international health organizations (IHOs) and the FBOs, a criminal collusion (between IHOs, the Nigerian government, and the US) to depopulate Nigeria, and different FBO interpretations of test results for vaccination contamination.

Taking an organizational trust perspective, this paper develops an integrated framework to understand key antecedents and processes leading to collaboration. Dynamic network analysis (SIENA) was employed to test three hypothesized effects on collaboration in a community-based health coalition network: network multiplexity, organizational status, and network transitivity.

Therefore, this study investigates the effect of online profile pictures on impression of employability. 101 participants recruited from 59 organizations first evaluated either a professional or unprofessional resume. They were then shown a professional or unprofessional online profile picture after which they evaluated the job candidate again. Results showed that congruent information (that is, both a professional resume and profile picture, or a negative resume and profile picture) caused little or no change in impressions. However, in the case of incongruent information (that is, a professional resume followed an unprofessional profile picture, or an unprofessional resume followed by a professional profile picture) impressions changed in the direction of the valence of the profile picture, indicating the influence of online profile pictures.",Presenting the Self in Social Media,Communication and Technology

This research, the third in a series, further explores the influences of identity shift, specifically exploring the effects of the publicness of feedback to an individual and the relational closeness between the individual and feedback provider on the individual’s subsequent self-perceptions of her or his extraversion. An experimental study (N = 57) utilized a 2 (extroverted/introverted) × 2 (private/public feedback) × 2 (feedback from a relationally close/nonclose partner) design.

Participants' independent and interdependent self-construals were either measured (Study 1, N = 137) or manipulated with priming (Study 2, N = 121). Public self-consciousness was measured with self-report in both studies. Positive self-presentation on Facebook was measured in the form of self-reported tendency to engage in positive self-presentation (Study 1) and behavioral intention to engage in positive self-presentation (Study 2). Results showed that independent and interdependent self-construal did not have a main effect on positive self-presentation. However, there was a significant interaction between self-construal and public self-consciousness, such that participants' interdependent self-construal strengthened the positive association between public self-consciousness and positive self-presentation on Facebook.

Complementing to a current research focus on legitimacy as credibility (e.g. “warranting theory”), we ask how a given information comes to convey a more or less valorizing image of one’s taste and lifestyle: which standards are applied to assess the cultural value of specific posts, and how do the users position themselves with respect to these standards?
We combined a qualitative content analysis of posts found in the facebook streams of 20 users during one month with subsequent guided interviews centered on exemplary posts. Findings show general standards of evaluation regarding the content and form of posts as well as principles leading to differences in the ways users of different educational backgrounds try to position themselves. One dividing principle seems to be embedded in the users’ perspective on privacy and discretion.",Presenting the Self in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-0436,2015,Paper Session,Quantitative Analysis of Large Amounts of Journalistic Texts Using Topic Modeling,2,"In this paper we explain how LDA topic modeling can be used for journalism research. We explain how this technique works and how its outcome - a set of topics, shown as word clusters - can be meaningfully interpreted. Also, we discuss the different parameters of the model and how they change the outcome of the analysis. Then, we demonstrate the usefulness of LDA in a case study of The New York Times coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to the present, partially replicating the study by Gamson & Modigliani (1989). We interpret the topics and use them to show how this coverage changes over time. The larger the number of topics, the more events and issues will be separated into different word clusters. Clusters however do not represent a single theoretical concept, so using LDA to code documents automatically requires interpretation and selection by researchers.","News Content Analysis: New Issues, New Directions",Journalism Studies

The research is operationalized as a question of monetization – what kind of content can online newspapers charge for, and what kind of content can remain free? Results show that the premium model primarily reserves content of high journalistic treatment with local affiliation for subscription readers, while wire copy, syndicated content and immediacy news remain open to non-subscription readers. Moreover, the Paywall content choices of these newspapers reflect the competitive situation in their respective markets.","News Content Analysis: New Issues, New Directions",Journalism Studies

Instructional communication also may occur in other contexts. This analysis contributes to that growing body of literature by examining instructional communication in the context of risk and crisis messages. More specifically, this study employed the IDEA learning cycle model to design and test a television news report about a contaminated food product. The researchers compared affective, cognitive, and behavioral learning outcome results reported by viewers of the IDEA model message (treatment) with those of viewers that watched the status quo (control) message. IDEA model message viewers reported significantly higher perceptions of message effectiveness (affective and cognitive learning), as well as behavioral intention (cognitive and behavioral learning) than control message viewers.

A survey of 881 university students found that mothers, followed by educators and fathers, were the most encouraging VAS source. The most frequently cited message type was students’ fit (abilities/skills). The second most frequent encouraging messages provided career details. Mothers often guided children to follow their passion. Teachers/ professors mostly gave career detail messages. Friends frequently provide discouraging messages. FGCS identified teachers/professors as the most influential VAS source. Males were more confident of their career goals.

An Exploratory Study Linking Psychological Factors to Mobile Social Game Addiction,2,"The purpose of this study is to explore how psychological factors (including perceived gratifications, loneliness, leisure boredom, and self-control) are related to mobile social game use and addiction. Data were gathered from 419 respondents in China. The exploratory factor analysis yielded a gratification structure of five factors (mobility, entertainment, sociability, achievement, and relaxation) based on 13 motives obtained from mobile social game playing. The unique gratifications of mobility, entertainment, and sociability were attributed to Candy Crush, which is generally played on mobile devices. According to Young’s (1998) classic definition, 7.2% of the participants in the study sample were considered addicts. They were characterized as lonely, bored, and motivated by the mobile nature of games. It was interesting to note that the addicts seldom thought that they played mobile social games because they wanted to fill leisure time or relax, but because they were lonely and bored. As expected, frequent players had a higher tendency to become addicts. In particular, loneliness and self-control were significant predictors of mobile social game addiction, while leisure boredom was linked to the intensity of game use. The limitations of the study and its implications for future research are discussed.",Revisiting the Phenomenon of Game Addiction,Game Studies

Several studies have looked at associations between personality and media use, but media research integrating BAS and BIS is scarce. The current cross-sectional survey study (n=1016) investigated associations between BAS and BIS and game use and game engagement in adolescents. BAS was positively associated with playing violent and non-violent games. BIS was negatively associated with violent game use, while it was positively associated with non-violent games. Also, BAS was positively associated with game engagement. No association was found between BIS and game engagement. Game engagement mediated the relationship between BAS and playing violent and non-violent games.

The psychometric properties of these scales were tested among a representative sample of 2444 Dutch adolescents and adults, aged 13 through 40. All scales also showed satisfactory structural validity and criterion-related validity, as indicated by positive correlations with time spent playing games, loneliness, aggression, and negative correlations with self-esteem, prosocial behavior, and life satisfaction. The dichotomous 9-item IGD scale showed solid psychometric properties and was the most practical scale for diagnostic purposes. Latent class analysis of this dichotomous scale indicated that a small group of disordered gamers could be discerned (4%). If the DSM-5 threshold for diagnosis (experiencing five or more criteria) is applied, the prevalence of disordered gamers is more than 5%.",Revisiting the Phenomenon of Game Addiction,Game Studies

Declining attention to traditional news is so strongly linked to growth in media choice one cannot tease out the separate effects of each, but all three relate to dispersion of public concern across more issues. Polarized news affects the public agenda in complex ways.

2015-0452,2015,Paper Session,Privacy Expectations in Online Contexts: A New Approach for the Legal Protection of Privacy,2,"Advances in digital networked communication technology over the last two decades have brought the issue of personal privacy into sharper focus within contemporary public discourse. For the legal protection of personal privacy under the Fourth Amendment, a person must have what courts term “a reasonable expectation of privacy.” For an expectation of privacy in a given context to be deemed reasonable, society must consider that expectation as reasonable, yet no empirical research has explored how society thinks about privacy in online contexts or what society in general would deem unreasonable or intrusive. This article provides such data, and finds that the degree to which Internet users feel the information they post online is ""observable"" by others, rather than the existing “content/noncontent” approach, underpins how people form their privacy expectations online. This ""observability approach"" represents an entirely new way to understand and gauge societal expectations of privacy in the networked world.

This dissertation study explored four Arizona towns that developed during the era of the American Old West: Tombstone, Jerome, Oatman, and Globe. The study broadly examined issues of remembering/forgetting and historical authenticity/myth. It specifically analyzed historic tourist destinations as visual phenomenon: seeking to understand how town histories were visually communicated to contemporary tourists and what role historically-grounded visual narratives played in the overall tourist experience. The study utilized a visual methodology to organize and structure qualitative data collection and analysis; it incorporated visual data from historic and contemporary photographs and textual data from observations and interviews. Through a careful exploration of each town’s past and present, the research proposed a measure to assess how the strength of visual connections between past and present impacted tourist impressions of each town.","Visuality, Space, and Place",Visual Communication Studies

2015-0459,2015,Paper Session,"From Testimony to Memorial: Rhetoric of Korean ""Comfort Women"" Memorial as a Transitional Memory Media",1,"After the Japanese colonial era, contentious arguments lingered between Korea and Japan. The “comfort women” was the name given to young Korean girls who were coerced and dragged into sexual slavery for the Japanese military during the colonial era. Since 1991, after a long silence, comfort women memories are being publicized by survivors’ testimonial movements. With this testimonial movement, a controversy between Korean and Japan has been ongoing. However, the memory practice of comfort women has encountered a second wave following the death of some survivors. The survivors have constructed a comfort women memorial in Korea, and it has spread to the United States. In 2013, the survivors established the same memorial as what South Korea has at Glendale, California in the U.S. This research focuses on this transition of memory media, which means the vehicle of memory practice, from human body to memorial. Can the trauma and memory be imparted in different memory media? Through absence and presence between testimonials and memorials, I analyze the rhetorical meaning of the transition from human body to memorial, and ultimately I reveal how memory media embody the memory and incarnate trauma itself.","Visuality, Space, and Place",Visual Communication Studies

For the purpose of this study, 500 graffiti images from 5 different Facebook pages that are dedicated to the Egyptian 2011 uprising’s graffiti were examined. Specifically, this study aims to inquire about the political function of the Egyptian uprising’s graffiti and the messages that are referenced in those graffiti. Findings indicate that graffiti messaging reflected the sociopolitical struggle in which the graffiti artists/activists are involved. Such graffiti served as radical media enabling those who are subordinated to express their opposition at those who are in power (Downing, 2001). Some of the most recurring themes were images against the military junta and images of martyrs who lost their lives in clashes between protestors and the police during and post the January 2011 uprising.","Visuality, Space, and Place",Visual Communication Studies

This kind of media production is common among social movements and insurgent organizations whose members do not see themselves and their causes represented in mainstream media. This is the case of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST), which since its foundation in 1984 has been creating media outlets and producing content for different platforms. However, realizing that alternative arenas would not grant participation in the public debate, MST became also active in the area of media and communication rights in Brazil. Based on fieldwork carried out in 2013 and 2014 this article proposes a perspective to communication rights (cf.

It also uses OLS to explain different countries’ variation in proportions of campaign types. There are 5 campaign types, identified by the 5 different campaign goals: governance, distribution of resources, human rights, environment, and consumer satisfaction. The analysis reveals that countries with one or more of the following characteristics have more civic digital campaigns: more traditional values, a higher average of years of schooling, and less satisfaction with life in general among the country’s citizens. It was also found that perceived political efficacy increases the proportion of consumer satisfaction campaigns but decreases the proportion of governance campaigns; also, more secular countries exhibit increased proportions of environmental civic campaigns.",Digital Media and Communications Activism,Global Communication and Social Change

2015-0467,2015,Paper Session,The News is in the Frame: A Journalist-Centered Approach to the Frame-Building Process of the Belgian Syria Fighters,4,"This paper presents a model for understanding the frame-building process, based on the early coverage of the Belgian Syria fighters in the four leading newspapers in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. For a period of six weeks, a frame analysis of news stories was linked to reconstruction interviews with reporters and supplemented by newsroom observations and in-depth interviews with superiors. The findings show that the frame-building process passes through various phases, from fitting the events into news formats to seeking explanations. More than being only a selection criterion, news values are equally added to the news story in retrospect, in line with the applied frame, which implies that the newsworthiness of the story may be increased by the way it is told. When journalists report an exclusive story, they are more likely to remain closer to the frame as it is presented to them by their main sources.",Framing: National and Global Issues,Journalism Studies

Extant studies indicate that political control influences how news organizations present an issue. The assumption is that the framing of highly sensitive issues is similar across Chinese news outlets, while the framing of modestly sensitive issues diverges. An examination of the news frames used by six newspapers in Guangzhou in their coverage of a highly sensitive issue (Issue 1) and a modestly sensitive issue (Issue 2) confirms this assumption. In the coverage of Issue 1, all newspapers use more leadership and factual frames than responsibility, conflict and human interest frames. Contrastingly, the party newspapers use more leadership frames, whereas nonparty newspapers use more conflict frames in the reporting of Issue 2.",Framing: National and Global Issues,Journalism Studies

However, it is unclear why some of the public events happened in the critical period entered into people’s memories while other events did not. The current study integrates the insights from memory studies and agenda setting theory to explore 1) the extent young people share their memories of pubic events which are either ongoing or happened recently, 2) what characteristics of events and individuals count for the remembering, and 3) the role of news media in the formation of collective memory in the context of China. It reveals that the sharedness of youth’s memories of public events is limited, factors including Communist Party membership, level of news attention, perceived issue seriousness, online and offline political discussion affect the number of events recalled from memory.

We draw a distinction between implicit AAS, which conceptualizes media effects on automatically activated object-attribute associations, and explicit AAS, which deals with their overt expression. Previous research has relied almost exclusively on explicit AAS. This is unfortunate, because people must have the motivation and the ability to report inner mental associations. We investigated AAS in the context of the 2014 EU parliamentary elections using a content analysis and a two-wave panel survey. Exposure to the mediated attribute agenda elicited implicit AAS effects, but no impact on the explicit dimension could be revealed. Only by additionally taking into account implicit cognition were we able to reveal substantial AAS effects.",Advances in Agenda Setting Research,Mass Communication

The paper argues that Facebook acts as an agent of change in the transition to parenthood since Facebook is involved in shaping expectations, practices, and rituals. Findings show how these processes are enhanced and reflected through the acts of posting photos related to family life. The paper contributes an identification of three ideal-typical strategies of new parents’ Facebook activities and photo-postings: Performative, dialogical and preservative.

The Difficulties of Self-Regulatory Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Programs,1,"While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary administrator of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Section 312.11(a) of the Rule allows for industry groups or other organizations to apply for a safe harbor status (Federal Trade Commission, 2013b). In short, the safe harbors establish self-regulatory guidelines for meeting COPPA compliance and participants in the harbors are usually subject to these guidelines and disciplinary procedures rather than official FTC protocol. Reviewing the publicly available information about safe harbors, this paper critically analyzes the difficulties in assessing the efficacy of self-regulatory COPPA oversight programs and makes policy recommendations for increasing the transparency of how safe harbors review and regulate websites directed at children. The paper is structured as follows: (1) an analysis of safe harbors’ policies for the collection, storage, and utilization of children’s data over time; (2) an examination of currently existing criticisms of safe harbors; (3) identification of additional criticisms of safe harbors; and (4) recommendations for practices that would help in measuring the role of safe harbors in protecting children online.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 2",Children Adolescents and the Media

While educational TV is still very popular for the preschool age group, many educational programs now have accompanying apps and games that can be played on mobile devices and computers. One prominent feature of these new technologies is their interactivity. This study will utilize a 2x2 experimental design (N = 100) to test the unique influence of interactivity on preschoolers’ learning of STEM content. Embracing an embodied cognition perspective, we hypothesize that children who engage with an interactive mobile app that teaches STEM content will show greater evidence of learning than children who engage with a non-interactive app that otherwise presents that same content. Because children have been found to demonstrate a passion for interactive media, we also expect interactivity to have a positive impact on enjoyment.","Children, Adolescents, and Media: Research Escalator 2",Children Adolescents and the Media

2015-0485,2015,Paper Session,"Fifty Shades, Sex Media, and Media Studies",1,"Fifty Shades has become firmly established as a focus for debate about sex, sexuality and gender. Debates about Fifty Shades have focused on what it might reveal about the way female sexuality is now expressed, about kink, about consent and about sexual violence. It has become a reference point in obscenity and extreme porn trials, in sex scandals, and in accusations of sexual abuse.

What recurs in these discussions is a desire to understand what Fifty Shades is saying to us; whether it demonstrates an increasing awareness of kink, reflects changes in sexual practice, instructs women in submissiveness, misrepresents BDSM cultures, or reiterates mainstream values around sexuality and consent. Yet it is not clear that fictional accounts can or do operate in these ways, particularly in the context of the swiftly changing mediascape within which sexual representations are consumed. The release of Fifty Shades in film form offers an opportunity to consider it as a form of sex media and to ask how it conforms to or challenges distinctions between romance, erotica and pornography, ‘alternative’ and ‘mainstream’ styles, and whether these terms are useful in making sense of it. This papers asks what questions this process raises about the way we read its characteristics as a media text in the process of adaptation from fan fiction to written trilogy to feature film, and about the role that Media Studies might play in debates about the Fifty Shades phenomenon.",A Much Anticipated Release: Exploring Reactions to Fifty Shades on Film,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0486,2015,Paper Session,Understanding Fifty Shades of Grey’s Audiences,1,"Writing about the Fifty Shades series in a contentious cover story in Newsweek, New York University professor Katie Roiphe (2012) argues that the series’ popularity demonstrates that contemporary women, who experience more power and freedom than their mothers and grandmothers, have a secret wish to be spanked. Yet Roiphe’s titillating suggestion fails to consider what feminist cultural studies research has already shown about the blending of patriarchal domination and love in women’s romance reading. My presentation endeavors to engage this literature, and connect it to scholarship on the contemporary postfeminist media culture (e.g., McRobbie 2008; Gill 2007; Douglas 2010). To help make sense of the popular reaction to Fifty Shades’ Hollywood release in February 2015, I draw upon interviews I previously conducted with 36 Fifty Shades readers and ground their reflections with feminist media research that explores women’s use of romance reading. I will explore the series’ messages about gender roles, romance, and sexuality and argue that Fifty Shades’ appeal is rooted in women’s use of the series’ recurrent themes of fantasy, romance, and sex to make sense of the sexualized cultural environment in which they are immersed. Overall, I assert that erotic romances like the Fifty Shades series can help audiences traverse the push and pull of feminist and anti-feminist cultural sentiments that mark our contemporary culture.",A Much Anticipated Release: Exploring Reactions to Fifty Shades on Film,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0487,2015,Paper Session,Merchandising Desire: The Fifty Shades Consumer,1,"In 2012, the racy trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey took the world by storm, quickly becoming what one writer described as an “erotic money making machine.” The merchandising possibilities that followed were seemingly endless: There were Fifty Shades-inspired weekend getaways, a classical music album, a clothing line, and an official sex toy line, the latter of which included blindfolds, riding crops, and other sexual accouterments mentioned in the books. The books became a resource for many women interested in exploring their sexuality, resulting in a new consumer demographic—what we might think of as the “Fifty Shades consumer.” Many adult businesses, especially those that define themselves as “women-friendly,” developed specialized marketing and merchandising strategies to reach fans of the book. With the release of the long awaited Fifty Shades of Grey movie on Valentine’s Day, it is a good time to revisit how manufacturers and retailers imagine, cater to, and capitalize on the Fifty Shades consumer. What does it mean to “merchandise desire” in the era of Fifty Shades?

2015-0488,2015,Paper Session,Consensual Entertainment? An Examination of BDSM Culture and Fifty Shades of Grey Portrayals,1,"Literature suggests that individuals or groups articulate and interpret media to fit their own interests (Skeggs 2004, Morley 2009, Grindstaff 2012, Radway 1984, Shively 1992, Long 2003, Press 1991). This body of work argues that one’s connection to media narratives is tied to one’s cultural background, class position, and gender. While this research provides a rich understanding of active audiences, there is little work addressing the relationships between media portrayals and community identity. By understanding how media interacts with a community’s sense of cultural identity, we can better understand how the media representation of some hides the practices of others.

To demonstrate this, I conducted ethnography inside a BDSM community and compared field notes/interviews to focus group data among fans of Fifty Shades of Grey who do not identify as BDSM members. My comparisons reveal that while the language in the Fifty Shades text mirrors some of the language used by community members (i.e. “vanilla sex” or “safe words”) a great deal of the lifestyle remains hidden (specifically trust, consent, and aftercare). I argue that because Fifty Shades excludes these imperative aspects of BDSM relationships, it hides from public view the important role of consent in the BDSM community. This is important because non-BDSM fans believe that the series is a very ""real"" depiction of the lifestyle and the series is extremely popular.

2015-0489,2015,Paper Session,Social Capital Split: International Students’ Dual Social Network Site Use and its Influences on Social Capital,2,"Previous work on social network sites (SNSs) typically compares cross-cultural SNS use by using two groups of users on two different sites, such as Chinese users on Renren and American users on Facebook. In this survey study, we examined how Chinese and Korean international students’ cultural values influence both Facebook and Renren/Cyworld use. We anticipated that Facebook use would lead to bridging social capital, whereas use of Renren/Cyworld would lead to bonding social capital. A survey of 335 Chinese and Korean students in the U.S. showed that respondents had similar levels of bonding and bridging social capital on both FB and Renren/Cyworld, which suggests that users use both SNSs to serve their bridging and bonding needs. We conclude with some thoughts as to how our findings might be used to help people manage social relationships across two different sites in different countries.",Short Intercultural Presentations (SIPs) #2,Intercultural Communication
2015-0490,2015,Paper Session,Testing Measurement Equivalence of Eudaimonic and Hedonic Entertainment Motivations in a Cross-Cultural Comparison,5,"Equivalence is a key concept in cross-cultural research. Within Hofstede’s framework of individualistic and collectivistic cultures, this contribution examines measurement equivalence of hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment motivations in two different cultures, namely Germany representing a more individualistic culture (N = 209) and Turkey representing a more collectivistic culture (N = 112). By means of a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA), we could secure configural invariance for both hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment motivations across the German and Turkish sample. Metric invariance, however, could only be obtained for hedonic, but not for eudaimonic motivations. Scalar invariance was obtained for neither of the two entertainment motivations. The study points to the importance of equivalence testing when conducting cross-cultural research.",Short Intercultural Presentations (SIPs) #2,Intercultural Communication
2015-0491,2015,Paper Session,The Emotional Side of Forgiveness: A Cross-Cultural Investigation of the Role of Anger and Compassion and Face Threat in Interpersonal Forgiveness and Reconciliation,4,"This study examined the dynamic interplays between emotions (i.e., anger and compassion), face threat, forgiveness, and reconciliation in relational transgressions in U.S. and Chinese cultures. Results indicated that Chinese participants reported more relationship-oriented forgiveness than U.S. participants, but no distinction was uncovered in self-oriented forgiveness. Results also showed that, relative to pre-forgiveness, there was less post-forgiveness anger but more post-forgiveness compassion in both cultures. Anger had a negative association, but compassion had a positive association, with forgiveness and reconciliation in both cultures. Perceived face threat first evoked initial emotions, which influenced forgiveness and in turn counter-influenced reactive emotions, which then affected reconciliation.",Short Intercultural Presentations (SIPs) #2,Intercultural Communication

This qualitative study conducted in-depth interviews with American K-pop fans to discuss their meaning-making from K-pop as a hybrid music product and their participation in the subculture of the K-pop fandom. The degree of “Westernization” of K-pop, issues of sexual and racial stereotypes of Asian people, and a sense of identifying with traditional Eastern cultural values were discussed. Participants agreed that the U.S. still maintains a barrier to Asian and Asian-American entertainers, which K-pop may be uniquely positioned to penetrate.",Short Intercultural Presentations (SIPs) #2,Intercultural Communication

2015-0494,2015,Paper Session,Marketplace Commodification of Risk Communication: Consequences for Risk Bearers and Implications for Public Relations,4,"Society’s attempt to understand and communicate about risk may be the most fundamental aspect of this conference’s theme regarding the multiple ways communications affects and directs life’s trajectory. To support responsible practice in what has become known as the risk society, public relations scholars and practitioners are obligated to consider the intended and unintended consequences of risk communication and management. The purpose of this paper is to take critical stock of public relations scholarship and practices in the daunting complex that has become known as the infrastructural approach to risk communication. This approach blends critical judgment of the community structures where risk is discussed and the discourse in which it is analyzed as the foundation for risk governance needed for fully functioning societies. The critical lens of postmodernism reveals how an unfortunately increasing amount of risk communication scholarship and practice has evolved into a new professional, industrial, and societal hegemony that often marginalizes risk bearers and risk arbiters as a nuisance in an otherwise modern and elitist approach to risk control through which risk communication becomes a “priced commodity.” Such commodification can empower organizations to take further risks because of the perceived confidence that its robust risk management programs and risk communication teams, including public relations, can control the dialogue and thereby help protect it from business continuity failure. The great challenge is whether risk communication and management ultimately favors the interests of elites over, and even to the marginalization and subjugation of, the interests of risk bearers and arbiters.",Risk Communication and Perception,Public Relations
2015-0495,2015,Paper Session,The Impact of Cultural Biases and Self-Construals on Risk Perception,2,"This study aims to analyze how risk perception and attribution of responsibility of Korean people are influenced by sociocultural (cultural biases) and self-interpretive (self-construal) perspective. From the sociocultural perspective, cultural theory views that individual’s risk perception is influenced by social structure and views about nature, and risk perception is influenced by four cultural biases which is hierarchy, egalitarianism, individualism, and fatalism. By conducting a survey with total 200 participants, this study will examine if egalitarians perceive the risk more seriously than other cultural biases during high-responsibility risk and if in the independent self-construal case, the interaction effect between risk types and cultural biases disappears even though the interaction effect exists in the interdependent self-construal case. This study will be valuable in the field of public relations by providing empirical findings in risk communication. It also can contribute to the public relations practice as well, by organizations will benefit from learning the relationship between the sociocultural and self-interpretative dimensions of their publics and their risk perception.",Risk Communication and Perception,Public Relations

Media framing was also introduced into risk communication literature in order to understand how public perception of risk varies under different media frames. In this study, the effects of individualism- collectivism cultural orientation on risk perception and attribution of responsibility are examined in the light of risk amplification theory and media framing theory. The findings of the experiment suggest that cultural orientation has effects on perception of risks and certain risks are amplified in the interaction of media framing and cultural orientation.",Risk Communication and Perception,Public Relations
2015-0497,2015,Paper Session,"Risk, Crisis and Social Media: A Metastudy of Six Years’ Research",2,"The literature on social media use in risk and crisis communication has grown tremendously over the last few years. This paper presents a meta-study covering 80 empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals and of the few literature reviews that have been conducted so far. It is illustrated how the literature has increasingly focused on causality, explaining the impact of different communicative choices on citizens' perceptions of organizations in crisis. How organizations model communication through social and traditional media choices, sources, tone, frequency of updates, etc., affect perceived credibility and attitudes. In reviewing the literature, however, we also found that there are certain aspects that are largely missing. In addition to the lack of generalizable samples and studies of actual, preventive risk communication, very little attention is given to the effects of the digital divide on social mediated risk and crisis communication. In order to better encompass different citizens’ living conditions and life trajectories, the paper calls for more attention to questions of channel complementarity through new and older media.",Risk Communication and Perception,Public Relations
2015-0498,2015,Paper Session,The Public Tragedy: Clarifying and Defining a Public Relations Challenge,2,"Tragedy is substantively different than a crisis. Tragedies, whether man-made or natural disasters, have a substantially larger and singular impact than a traditional industry crisis, and current typologies of crisis fail to account for organizations being impacted by and having to respond to events that they are neither the victim nor the perpetrator of. Thus, tragedies require explication and, possibly, a different paradigm for public relations and crisis communication, both in industry response and academic scholarship. The goals of this paper are twofold: First, we define and extend our understanding of public tragedies within the scope of public relations and crisis communication, particularly for third-party organizations, those organizations not directly impacted by an event. Second, we discuss the potential role of organizational involvement in the conversation surrounding a tragedy, including the consequences and affordances of social media in tragedy response.",Risk Communication and Perception,Public Relations

A 2 (race of character) x 2 x2(music genre) experimental design was used to test the effect of game use on implicit racial attitudes and stereotype endorsement of African-Americans. Multivariate analysis was used to determine results, which indicate dancing with a character of African-American representation to music that confirms the racial stereotypes associated with the musical genre has a positive affect on attitudes of African-Americans in contrast to dancing with a character of Caucasian representation, which has negative affects on attitudes towards African-Americans. This study contributes to our understanding of whether contact with a virtual character can influence racial attitudes outside of the game environment.",Portrayals of Identity in and Around Video Games,Game Studies

The present study employs an experiment exploring effects of protagonist sex on liking, wishful identification, and similarity, as well as behavioral intentions to try, recommend, and purchase a video game. Participants were shown fictional descriptions of video games with names and gender pronouns manipulated to include male, female, or sex-neutral. Results indicate male participants had more positive evaluations of protagonists and games, with no effect of protagonist gender. Results also indicate positive effects of identification with the protagonist on overall evaluations of the game, including purchase intention.",Portrayals of Identity in and Around Video Games,Game Studies
2015-0501,2015,Paper Session,Kawaii Japan: Defining JRPGs Through the Cultural Media Mix,1,"Despite frequent reference in academic and fan work to the video game genre known as JRPG (Japanese role-playing game), little critical scholarship has been dedicated to understanding what, exactly, comprises the genre. Often, JRPGs are conceptualized as a cultural phenomenon, with the “J” operating as a cultural appendix to established and well-defined genre of RPGs. The fact that the term JRPG emerged in Western fan communities to differentiate the genre, however, suggests something else may contribute to how the genre is conceptualized. Drawing from representations of and discourse about gender in the MEXT’s Cool Japan campaign, this paper argues that instead of treating JRPGs as an independent object we should treat them as part of a larger creative ecology which comes to define Japan and its culture overseas.",Portrayals of Identity in and Around Video Games,Game Studies
2015-0502,2015,Paper Session,"Women are From FarmVille, Men are From ViceCity: The Cycle of Exclusion and Sexism in Video Game Content and Culture",4,"While female players comprise almost half of the video game playing community, there remain pronounced differences in the extent to which females are involved within gaming communities and industries as compared to their male counterparts. Gender socialization processes and the exclusion of females’ in the games industry have been independently proposed as contributing to these differences; however, no known research has assessed the potential cultivation of sexist beliefs and attitudes among video game players over time. Enlisting a longitudinal design, the cultivation of sexist beliefs and attitudes among game players was assessed among a representative sample of players (N = 902). Multi-group structural equation modeling revealed no evidence for the cultivation of sexist attitudes and beliefs among players over time. The current results indicate that video gaming communities remain separated along gender lines and that sexist beliefs and attitudes may contribute to this divide, albeit not through direct cultivation effects.",Portrayals of Identity in and Around Video Games,Game Studies
2015-0503,2015,Paper Session,Girl Playing <3: Video Game Live Streaming and the Perception of Female Online Gamers,1,"Video game live streaming is becoming increasingly popular among viewers and hosting streams is also a desirable occupation. The present study takes a multi-methodological approach to exploring the evolving codes and conventions for live streaming and how they differ by gender. It further investigates relationships between streams and the online games being played on these streams in regard to how objectifying female streamers might influence the perception of female online gamers. Employing qualitative data from an analysis of Twitch.tv streams and quantitative data from an online survey (N=165), the study finds that the criteria for success as streamers heavily differ for male and female streamers: a female streamer’s attractiveness is a more important criterion than her gaming skills. While frequently watching female streamers had no direct connection to negatively perceiving female gamers, multiple regression models demonstrated the negative influence of objectifying female twitch streamers on the perception of female players.",Portrayals of Identity in and Around Video Games,Game Studies

An experiment was conducted to examine the influence of the reduced social cues associated with CMC on the outcomes of supportive interaction. Participants discussed a stressor with a confederate either face-to-face or via CMC and received informational or emotional support. Despite receiving the exact same support messages, participants in the CMC condition reported significantly greater worry and uncertainty discrepancy following the interaction than participants in the face-to-face condition. A main effect was also found for support message type. Consistent with the optimal matching model, informational support led to more beneficial outcomes than emotional support in response to the (controllable) stressor experienced by participants.",Social Support via Social Media #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0505,2015,Paper Session,Anonymity and Interaction in an Online Breast Cancer Social Support Group,1,"The reported study examined the implications of anonymous communication in the context of an online breast cancer support group. Despite the benefits of using online social support groups, the research does not provide a solid understanding of the online factors related to an individual’s supportive interaction. In particular, this study explored how various kinds and the level of anonymity predict different levels of social support engagement. The study sample included about 2000 social support messages exchanged in a two-week period. The current study uncovered that visually identifiable group members were more likely to get supportive responses from other support group members than were visually anonymous members. Also, the study found that when support group members are visually and discursively identifiable, they are more likely to get supportive messages from group members than those who are visually and discursively anonymous. Additionally, the more identifiable support group members are, the more they receive positive messages. Practical implications for the role of social support group member’s anonymity/identifiability on the overall social support process are presented.",Social Support via Social Media #1,Communication and Technology

In the present study, using a 2-Wave survey of college students, we investigated the effects of using instant messaging (IM), social networking sites (SNS), Twitter, sharing photos and videos, and participating in discussion boards on subjective well-being. Additionally, we investigated whether social support was a moderator of the effect of Internet use on subjective well-being. We found that using IM and Twitter was beneficial to one’s well-being only for those with high levels of social support. Checking and updating SNS profiles increased well-being over time, regardless of the level of social support. Lastly, sharing photos and videos online as well as posting messages on discussion boards decreased well-being over time.",Social Support via Social Media #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0508,2015,Paper Session,"Big Data and Journalism: Epistemology, Expertise, Economics, and Ethics",2,"Big data is a social, cultural, and technological phenomenon—a complex amalgamation of digital data abundance, emerging analytic techniques, mythology about data-driven insights, and growing critique about the overall consequences of big-data practices for democracy and society. While media and communication scholars have begun to examine and theorize about big data in the context of media and public life broadly, what are the particular implications for journalism? This article introduces and applies four conceptual lenses—epistemology, expertise, economics, and ethics—to explore both contemporary and potential applications of big data for the professional logic and industrial production of journalism. These distinct yet inter-related conceptual approaches reveal how journalists and news media organizations are seeking to make sense of, act upon, and derive value from big data during a time of exploration in algorithms, computation, and quantification. In all, the developments of big data potentially have great meaning for journalism’s ways of knowing (epistemology) and doing (expertise), as well as its negotiation of value (economics) and values (ethics). Ultimately, this article outlines future directions for journalism studies research in the context of big data.","Journalism, Metrics, and Big Data",Journalism Studies

The rapid proliferation of audience metrics has prompted concerns that journalists’ news judgment will be corrupted or undermined. Drawing on in-depth interviews at the New York Times and Chartbeat, a prominent analytics startup, this paper shows how Times editors safeguard their professional and managerial authority by carefully managing the ways in which metrics are circulated and interpreted within the newsroom. Rather than vehemently resisting metrics or passively allowing themselves to be displaced, editors have metabolized this data in strategic ways that neutralize its threat and maximize its usefulness in serving their ends. The paper considers the implications of these findings not only for journalism, but also for the relationship between big data and experts in fields of cultural production more generally.","Journalism, Metrics, and Big Data",Journalism Studies

Two sets of data compare the complete text-based annual news output, and use of interactive features, on its online portal www.nrk.no in 2009 and 2013, comprising approximately 150,000 news items subjected to a hybrid methodology of manual and computational coding. Aimed at analyzing developments in online journalism, and the debated role of public service news online, the analysis finds that nrk.no’s content profile moves slightly away from the disruption-oriented news profile of online news journalism and towards a stronger public service orientation, particularly seen in its increased focus on self-produced audiovisual content, facilitation of public discussion and use of interactive features and social media sharing.","Journalism, Metrics, and Big Data",Journalism Studies
2015-0511,2015,Paper Session,"Big Data Analytics and Journalism: New Tools, New Insights?",1,"Riding on the wave of technological progress, journalists celebrate the integration of big data analytics to the reportage of political news. Big data are expected to usher in new insights, and as such, to help the press perform in its democratic role as a watchdog of government. Through a historical investigation of the Washington Post’s data based reports on political campaign financing, I will indicate how their use hinders rather than promotes that role. Big data’s gleaming appearances obscure from view journalism’s firmly conservative view of political life; conservative, that is, in the sense of reiterating established narratives about politics due to their uncritical reliance on what Herbert Gans (1979) has called the profession’s “enduring values.” The watchdog role is best served when journalists make use of new technologies in ways that challenge those values, thus providing their public with a diversity of interpretive approaches to political life.","Journalism, Metrics, and Big Data",Journalism Studies

A Case Study With Experimental Results,4,"This paper describes the design and development of a serious game to teach a difficult topic, presented in the form of answers to 12 general questions of game design and evaluation. These questions are a skeletal description of decision points applicable to any tutorial game development project, and are answered in this case by describing the specific decisions made at each stage. The resulting game was tested for learning efficacy in a formal quantitative experiment. The game was found to produce significantly better learning than conventional classroom instruction. However, student acceptance of learning from the game was mixed. Analysis of player responses to open ended questions about their experience provide some specific reasons, most of which are probably applicable beyond this single case. Of note, the single largest negative reported by players of the game was the lack of communication with the instructor and other students experienced during game play.",Playing Around With New Media Both in and As the Classroom,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2015-0513,2015,Paper Session,Validating a Standardized Procedure for Effectiveness Assessment: Learning English Vocabulary Through Gameplay,4,"Recent years saw the emergence of a need for systematic effectiveness assessment of digital game-based learning (DGBL) interventions. This paper presents the results and lessons learned of a case study of Mingoville, a game for primary school English learning for non-native speakers, using a standardized experimental procedure for assessing the effectiveness of DGBL. Results show a mixed picture with the game-based intervention being more effective in terms of enjoyment, similarly effective in terms of short-term learning yet less effective in terms of long-term learning. Moreover, results indicate that shortening the gaming intervention and implementing a debriefing session yielded lower learning gains both in the short and long term. Overall, this study shows the potential of a standardized procedure for DGBL effectiveness assessment providing a baseline for comparison in future DGBL studies.

It is generally accepted in the extant literature that the creativity of something amounts to the way it is judged creative by a certain group of people. However, no assessment technique has to date been able to evaluate the degree of creativity of something by accounting for the way people assess its creative nature. Inspired by Actor Network Theory and the CCR (Communication as Constitutive of Reality) perspective, we theoretically and empirically show that it is possible to do just this by analyzing how people speak about the creative nature of something.","Exploring Creativity, Stress, Emotional Messages, and Classroom Discussions",Language & Social Interaction

The research builds on existing work on text and sentiment analysis (e.g., Devitt & Ahmad, 2013; Ehmann et al., 2007; Pennebaker et al., 2007). However, STRESSnet is unique in several important ways. First, it was specifically developed to assess stress and related cognitive/emotional states such as workload and anxiety in normal communication. Second, we draw on existing astronaut communication and mission logs to develop a lexicon that includes terms unique to this environment. Third, we developed STRESSnet with the specific goal of application as a tool to assess user state and provide automatic interventions to address counter identified deficits.

The construction of an open-access discussion is demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of the I-O-F seen in the discourse, collected using action implicative (ethnographically informed) discourse analytic methods in a grounded practical theory project on the instructional communication practice of instructor-facilitated collegiate classroom discussion (IFCCD), in one classroom in which there was consistent engaged and participatory classroom discussion. Incorporating ideas from invitational rhetoric, the teacher’s first-turn questions are found to be invitational and second-turn student comments are analyzed as offerings of perspectives. The work of instructor third-turns in providing structure for the interaction is highlighted through analysis of four distinct instructor talk techniques. In this classroom, students still learn course curriculum but practice different life communication skills than in a traditional classroom.","Exploring Creativity, Stress, Emotional Messages, and Classroom Discussions",Language & Social Interaction

They are characterized as selfish venting or incessant personal attacks. However, a discourse analysis of a qualitative corpus of 35 video rants on YouTube problems suggests that rants exhibit a consistent set of characteristics. These include: articulating a problem, elaborating on the problem, and providing next steps such as potential solutions or motivators to action. The rants in the corpus generally exhibited similar feeling tones in which the ranter displayed anger, frustration, or confusion. The data suggest that emotionalism is not incompatible with logical arguments that, when used in combination, may rally like-minded fellow sufferers to contemplate action to address communicative problems.","Exploring Creativity, Stress, Emotional Messages, and Classroom Discussions",Language & Social Interaction

We compiled and reviewed existing systematic research reviews and meta-analyses to organize and summarize the text-messaging intervention evidence base, identify best practice recommendations based on findings from multiple reviews, and explore implications for future research. Our review found that the majority of published text messaging interventions were effective when addressing diabetes self-management, weight loss, physical activity, smoking cessation, and medication adherence for antiretroviral therapy. However, we found limited consistent evidence across the population of studies and reviews to inform recommended intervention characteristics. Although strong evidence supports the value of integrating text-messaging interventions into public health practice, additional research is needed to establish longer-term intervention effects, identify recommended intervention characteristics, and explore issues of cost-effectiveness.",Health Technologies and Communication,Health Communication

One solution to meet this problem is the usage of E-Health applications. Research in this field mainly investigates the overall outcomes of interventions, paying little attention to specific design characteristics. Especially the impact of video arranged in a network-like structure hasn’t received any attention. This paper investigates the effects of hypermedia in the context of a video application that supports the execution of physical exercises. Based on Multimedia and Hypermedia Learning Theories we developed two versions of the application and conducted an experiment to investigate the impact of hypermedia on the usability, the utilization of the application for a self-determined training and the competence in executing the exercises. Results show that hypervideo initially leads to more usability problems than primarily linear video but also facilitated a more active utilization of the E-Health application for a self-determined training.",Health Technologies and Communication,Health Communication

However, research on interpreter-mediated medical communication from the perspective of patients is scarce and mostly a-theoretical. Therefore the aim of this study was to explore the perspective of Turkish-Dutch GP patients on informal interpreting from an integrated theory base, focusing on interpreters’ roles, trust and power. Findings from 21 semi-structured interviews with first generation Turkish-Dutch female GP patients show that besides translating, informal interpreters are expected to and perform the roles of advocates and caregivers. Furthermore, patients trust informal interpreters more than professional interpreters and feel empowered by them during consultations. This study contributes to theory building by linking interpreters’ roles to trust and power and could also be used by policy makers for design and implementation of effective interventions to improve health care delivery to patients with insufficient language ability.",Interpersonal Communication in the Health Care Context: Patients and Providers in Interaction,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0525,2015,Paper Session,Empathic Communication Between Physician Assistant Students and Patients: Perceptual Differences and Genetic Antecedents,5,"In the relationship between health care providers and their patients, few interpersonal characteristics are as consequential as the providers’ ability to convey empathy. Although a robust literature attests to the importance of physician communication skills—particularly those related to empathy—in the provider-patient relationship, remarkably few studies have examined empathic communication by physician assistants, who provide primary care for an increasing number of Americans. The present study assesses empathic communication between physician assistant students and standardized patients. Each student conducted three interviews over a six-month period, and each interview was evaluated for empathy by the students themselves, their patients, their clinical instructors, and third-party observers. Students also provided saliva samples for genotyping six single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) that are linked empirically to empathic behavior. Results revealed that students consistently rated their empathic abilities as higher than did patients, instructors, or observers, and that the assessments of all four raters varied over time. Moreover, cumulative risk on OXTR receptor gene predicted lower patient empathy scores as rated by instructors and observers, but not by students or students.",Interpersonal Communication in the Health Care Context: Patients and Providers in Interaction,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0526,2015,Paper Session,Examining the Peer Educator: Emotional Contagion Within Peer Health Education,1,"This paper examines the role of peer educators within Peer Health Education programs, specifically focusing on their susceptibility to emotional contagion. As various studies have identified the potential effect of emotional contagion within positions similar to PHE (ie. counseling, therapy, etc..), the susceptibility of peer educators to this contagion must be analyzed. The present study seeks to draw connections between PHE and emotional contagion, building our understanding of both topics and how they connect. Peer educators from across the country were contacted and asked to complete an online survey, which examined their general and PHE specific demographics, susceptibility to emotional contagion in a general and PHE specific setting and potential lingering effects of emotional contagion. Multiple analyses were run to analyze these variables, including correlations and regressions. Results revealed peer educators as more susceptible to contagion in PHE specific settings than in general situations. Additionally, a significant relationship was shown between peer educators who reported exhibiting characteristics associated with emotional contagion and lingering effects of emotional contagion. These findings suggest peer educators are highly susceptible to emotional contagion through a variety of factors, ultimately providing insight into Peer Health Education as a whole.",Interpersonal Communication in the Health Care Context: Patients and Providers in Interaction,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0527,2015,Paper Session,Patients’ Reports of Barriers to Expressing Concerns During Cancer Consultations,3,"This study aimed to identify cancer patients’ most influential barriers to expressing concerns during cancer consultations in a new manner by examining patients’ reports of perceived barriers and perceived occurrence of barriers in consultations. Two online focus groups (N = 16) and an online survey (N = 236) were conducted among cancer patients and cancer survivors to examine perceived barriers and perceived occurrence of barriers in consultations. Composite scores of these two elements were calculated to determine influential barriers. Results showed that the most influential barriers were related to providers’ behavior (e.g., providers do not explicitly invite patients to express concerns) and the environment where the consultation takes place (e.g., perceived lack of time in consultations). The results of this study indicate that influential barriers to expressing concerns are barriers that patients cannot overcome themselves. A collaborative approach between researchers, providers and policy makers is needed to overcome these barriers.",Interpersonal Communication in the Health Care Context: Patients and Providers in Interaction,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0528,2015,Paper Session,Unraveling the Determinants of Cancer Patients’ Concern Expression,4,"Little is known about the behavioral determinants that underlie cancer patients’ concern expression. This information is relevant to design effective interventions to enhance concern expression. Such interventions are necessary since most cancer patients do not express their concerns sufficiently while this has been associated with better health outcomes. This study aims to unravel determinants of concern expression by using the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IBM). An online survey based on the IBM determinants was distributed. In total 236 cancer patients and cancer survivors participated. Results showed that an intervention for patients who do not or do not always intend to express concerns should be focused on patients’ affective attitude and perceived social norm. Furthermore, results showed that an intervention for patients who do not or do not always act upon their intention should be focused on patients’ communicative skills.",Interpersonal Communication in the Health Care Context: Patients and Providers in Interaction,Interpersonal Communication

A Du Boisian theoretical framework demonstrates how Claudia Jones, a Trinidadian-born journalist, placed “superexploited” voices at the center of a conversation about war and race, class, and gender politics. Employing a historical analysis of Jones’ editorials published in the Weekly Review from 1938-1943, the author argues that she called for a single victory linking Jim Crowism to fascism, critiquing capitalism and colonialism, and promoting transnational solidarity while privileging US global power. Jones’ journalism, therefore, tells a story that considers the lifespan of black thought in the United States by complicating previous literature on the relationship between black struggle and citizenship. It places black intellectuals, activists, and journalists at the heart of national and trans/national conversations about US national interests and its imperialistic projects.",Identity and Nation,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

In particular, I focus on a series of Twitter campaigns that centered on images of Asian Americans in the media. Through tracing the different conversations that took place around the hashtags #HowIMetYourRacism, #NotYourAsianSidekick, and #CancelColbert, we can more clearly see the way that media provides both a rallying point for activism and a means for shifting conversations to what it is that really matters—the place of Asian Americans in American society. I look at the impact of cultural formations, political identities, and affective relationships on how new media technologies are taken up as part of Asian American media activism. Within the efforts of Twitter activists and participants we can better understand the possibilities for using new media to generate a form of politicized participatory culture for Asian Americans online. I argue that even when media activism is seen to “fail,” the dialogues fostered through Twitter hashtags serve to illuminate the connection between engagement with problematic images and the fight for cultural citizenship.",Identity and Nation,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

A Freeman’s Promised Land?: Reading Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Position on the National Mall",1,"Using textual and visual analysis, this paper analyzes discussions of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial (MLK), its position within the national landscape, and the type of work it has the potential to do. Focusing on MLK’s centerpiece, the ""Stone of Hope,"" I argue that while specifically intended to contribute to the story of progress common to the National Mall’s broad-ideal-based historical narrative, the sculpture in fact broadcasts the deepest tension of black cultural identity, its twoness. With this, the work of public art opens a new discursive space for the (re)telling of the veil’s effect on black experience in America (see Du Bois, 1903). Thinking with Peters (1999), MLK serves as a communication technology that permits visitors to commune with the dead and resuscitates a version of King, allowing him, at least in theory, to outlive his human life span. The ""Stone of Hope"" effectively stands in the gap connecting traces from America’s racial past to present and even future moments in the racial order.",Identity and Nation,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Using as a case study the discourse of Israeli political leaders during three distinct periods from 1967 until the present, the study proposes analytical tools based on recognition theory to examine how the relationship between recognition of the other and constitution of the self impact recognition gaps. The study illustrates that partial recognition of the other – either affirmation of peoplehood coupled with denial of statehood or conversely affirmation of statehood coupled with denial of peoplehood – can result from an untenable view of self based on ontological dissonance. Recognition of the other is shown to be an essential aspect of self-constitution within the context of a transformation of self-identity towards an identity that frees itself of mastery over the other.",Identity and Nation,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

In the case of movements that do not reach a wider tipping point, I argue Twitter functions as a performative, identity-building space, more than a means to reach external audiences. I examine a two-week window into an environmental movement trying to gain traction in the public sphere, centered on a transnational day of action calling for a ban on the drilling technology hydraulic fracturing, Global Frackdown. Findings show that Global Frackdown tweeters engage in framing practices of: movement convergence and solidarity, declarative and targeted engagement, prefabricated messaging, and multilingual tweeting. The episodic, loosely-coordinated and often personalized, transnational framing practices of Global Frackdown tweeters support core organizers’ goal of promoting the globalness of activism to ban fracking.","Media, Social Media, and Environmental Action",Environmental Communication

oil merits an examination of how the public understands the issue. This study looks at public discussion of fracking on Twitter by coding all tweets between July 2009, when the word fracking first appeared on Twitter, and September 2014. Using a computer-aided content analysis platform, the authors coded more than 5 million tweets that discuss fracking. The results show how public framing of fracking has evolved over time, including the frames people use to discuss fracking and the number of tweets and individuals who are participating in discussions of fracking.","Media, Social Media, and Environmental Action",Environmental Communication
2015-0535,2015,Paper Session,Role of Collective Efficacy in Climate Change Communication: A Multilevel Analysis,5,"Climate change communication scientists are increasingly concerned about how best to communicate the challenges of climate change to increase public engagement. Successful mitigation and adaptation to climate change, however, requires behavioral and policy changes at the individual, community, and national levels. Based on Bandura’s social cognitive theory, this paper examines the role of collective efficacy—people’s shared beliefs about their group’s capabilities to accomplish collective tasks—in influencing Indians’ adaptive capacity to deal with drinking water scarcity, a condition likely to be exacerbated in the future by climate change. Using data from a national survey (N=4031) in India, we found that individuals’ with robust collective efficacy beliefs are more likely to participate in community activities intended to ensure the adequacy of water supplies. Moreover, the relationship between individual collective efficacy and behavioral involvement was stronger in communities with high levels of community collective efficacy compared to communities with low levels of community collective efficacy. In addition, the level of collective efficacy in the community was positively associated with self-reported community adaptation responses. Taking steps to increase the collective efficacy beliefs of community members—for example, through mass media campaigns—may strengthen the adaptive capacity of communities to climate change; this important possibility should be tested in future research.","Media, Social Media, and Environmental Action",Environmental Communication

The paper offers a critical discourse analysis of campaign material and media coverage related to the divestment campaign. The divestment campaign offers a contrast to other environmentalist interventions in the economic realm. Campaigners use three major lines of argument: economic, moral, and political. While superficially economic in nature, the divestment movement aims for a broad societal transformation, based on confronting power and bringing a politicized discourse to public debate on climate change. The paper considers how this case informs social theory regarding risk, modernity, and human-nature relationships in the Anthropocene.","Media, Social Media, and Environmental Action",Environmental Communication

In the context of accelerated globalisation, the rise of eco-business governance, Greenpeace climate activism, and social movement theory, we examine the connective action frames and e-tactics used to mobilize transnational supporters to actively participate in the campaigns. Based on a discourse analysis of the campaigns’ communication on Greenpeace’s website and social media, including Facebook and YouTube, and on three depth interviews with key Greenpeace personnel, our analysis reveals Greenpeace framed the campaigns in terms of political consumption and mobilized its supporters via its website and social media to engage in discursive forms of political consumption. Implications for digital mobilization and climate advocacy campaigns are discussed.","Media, Social Media, and Environmental Action",Environmental Communication
2015-0538,2015,Paper Session,Ethical Considerations of Visual Health Communication Strategies and Their Effects,2,"While health and illness are highly sensitive and private issues with vital importance for every individual, health communicators essentially pursue persuasive targets and aim at manipulating the people’s health-related attitudes and behaviors. Regarding the fact that particularly visuals can enfold a strong affective and persuasive power which is not always in line with health promoting intentions, the relevance of ethical considerations for any health communication effort is evident. The paper thus offers a normative perspective on visuals and visual framing in health communication. On the basis of theoretical and empirical background information in the field of health-related visual communication research, five interconnected main dimensions of ethically relevant effects are described and further discussed: (1) intended and unintended effects, (2) individual- and societal-level effects, (3) intended and unintended audiences, (4) content-specific and content-diffusive effects, (5) short- and long- term effects. Finally, implications for future theory, research, and practice are drawn.","Doing Things With Images: Practices, Strategies, Meanings",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0539,2015,Paper Session,What People Do With Images: The Various Modes and Meanings of Sharing Photographs,1,"Photo sharing has become a pervasive and “natural” activity in current highly mediatized societies provoking buzzwords such as „ubiquitous photography“ (Hand, 2012; Rubinstein & Sluis, 2008), „networked camera“ (Rubinstein & Sluis, 2008) and „social photography“ (Weilenmann, Hillman, & Jungselius, 2013). The paper uses the polysemic metaphor of “sharing” to identify the multiple and heterogeneous modes and practices of photo sharing and to discuss its highly diverse social functions, thereby differentiating between photographs as shareable objects and the actual communicative act of photo sharing. It is shown that even though photo sharing practices as well as the shared objects have changed alongside the transition from analog to digital consumer photography and with the merging of mobile communication and networked communication, the social functions and uses of photo sharing have remained relatively stable. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and critical future implications of photo sharing and researching photo sharing.","Doing Things With Images: Practices, Strategies, Meanings",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0540,2015,Paper Session,Life Experience Narratives in the Digital Space: Images in Richard Deitsch’s Single Best Moment Project,3,"On July 8, 2013, Sports Illustrated media critic Richard Deitsch—inspired by a photo that captured a friend with his brother shortly after winning the NCAA Hockey Championships—asked his 90,000-plus Twitter followers if they had the best moment of their life captured in a photograph. Deitsch retweeted the initial pictures, which prompted many more people to send out photos of their favorite moments. Many of his followers shared photos of some of their most intimate moments, leading CNN to call Deitsch “the sportswriter who made Twitter cry” (Mendoza, 2013). Through a thematic examination of 314 photos shared in the Deitsch exchange, the authors reveal that an overwhelming number of images are identified as milestone moments, or narratives of life experience, which denotes that as communication platforms evolve and technologies offer different modes of expression, users are still selecting narrative structure to disseminate their messages.","Doing Things With Images: Practices, Strategies, Meanings",Visual Communication Studies

2015-0542,2015,Paper Session,Meaning of Cuteness and Cultural Difference,3,"This article is about how cute artifacts can be perceived to have different meanings across cultures. The cute artifacts contain salient visual cues from young creatures and often relates to appealing forms. Those biological cues include small size, round shape, pale colors, and tilted arrangement. The positive effect of such cues seems objective and universal, because they are based on our common experience of infants. It is believed that our evolution system has encoded this special reaction mechanism in order to communicate the innate value of youth; protect the young generation to thrive the species. However, the valuation of cuteness is not always positive especially depending on the culture. The meaning of cuteness across cultures was measured by semantic differential scales. Participants of two countries (the United States and South Korea) perceived the same geometric shapes to have significantly different meanings. Socio-cultural factors underlying such a discrepancy are discussed.","Doing Things With Images: Practices, Strategies, Meanings",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0543,2015,Paper Session,An Exponential Random Graph Modeling of Patient-to-Patient Interactions on Social Media,4,"To understand the interactions among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), the study maps the topology of patient-to-patient interactions on SNSs and examines the roles of two tie-generation mechanisms (i.e., homophily and preferential attachment) underlying such interaction structure. The study decomposes patient-to-patient interactions into two ways: passive interaction by paying attention to peers’ up-to-date status and active interaction by directly communicating with peers on SNSs. The results show that the PLWHA’s attention and communication networks are small world characterized by small diameters and large clustering coefficients. Homophily and preferential attachment mechanisms play different roles in tie-generation of these two networks. Specifically, PLWHA are likely to pay attention to peers who are similar to them in terms of location, membership, and concern, and follow those influential peers on SNSs. However, they prefer to directly communicate with peers who share the same membership and concern, and avoid communicating with influential peers on SNSs.","Social Ties, Social Networks, and Social Media",Communication and Technology

Furthermore, little is known about how mobile users process and assess location information shared by friends on Facebook. Undergirded by persuasion knowledge and dual processing models, a self-instructed online survey with 255 undergraduate students found that friendship tie strength was positively correlated with students’ attitudes toward and perceived credibility of the location information shared by their friends. However, this relationship was true of those who reported a high level of mobile phone competence rather than those with low mobile phone competence. Prior experience with location sharing on Facebook also showed the positive relationship of student evaluations on the location information.

Firstly, factor analysis outlined four gratifications obtained from SNS: self-presentation, peer pressure, social network maintenance and information seeking. Then regressions showed narcissism significantly related to identified gratifications and SNS use, while communication anxiety only relates to peer pressure motivation. Narcissism and intensity of SNS use were positively related to social capital, whereas communication anxiety and motivation of peer pressure and SNS use negatively predict social capital. Results imply that SNSs primarily benefit extraverted individuals rather than the introverts. Although communication anxious individuals have a higher motivation to use SNS, the usage doesn’t necessarily benefit their social capital. Culture differences between China and the West were also implied in the discussion.

As a test of this phenomenon in mobile contexts a neighborhood texting platform for improving health and neighborhood cohesion was employed in New York City public housing. Results of a 3-month field experiment revealed that participants in the intervention reported better health but worse neighborhood cohesion than those in the control condition. Exploration of mechanisms through qualitative analysis of texts and follow-up interviews indicates that participation increased interpersonal ties, but not ties to the neighborhood. Findings broaden the concept of glocalization and demonstrate support for a theory of networked individualism, which argues that digital groups are really a compilation of overlapping interpersonal ties. Secondary findings lend support for multiplexity theory and technology maintenance.","Social Ties, Social Networks, and Social Media",Communication and Technology

Drawing on the social ecological framework and the IMB model of behavior change, the study compared a content analysis of critical information on the websites with other state-level environmental factors – such greater prevalence of smoking, state focus on tobacco control, and presence of tobacco industry - that may affect website quality.
Results showed that states with higher needs to control childhood asthma and that provide Medicaid coverage for cessation had better websites for pregnant women who smoke. There was no relationship between website quality and smoking prevalence, and states focused on tobacco control were less likely to have quality websites for pregnant women who smoke, indicating a missed opportunities. Tobacco producing states had better websites but weaker tobacco control measures.","Anti-Smoking PSAs, Web and Peer Influences",Health Communication
2015-0548,2015,Paper Session,Analyzing Messages for Their Effectiveness: Content and Executional Features on Smoking Cessation Advertisements,5,"In order to advance the scientific basis for message design, theories of belief, attitude, and intention change focusing on the importance of arguments must be joined with theories that deal more with a message's executional (or format) features. This paper takes some steps in that direction arguing that theories such as AMIE (Stephenson & Southwell, 2006) and LC4MP (Lang, Bradley, Sparks, Lee, 2006a) can be integrated with the ELM (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) to advance theory and message effectiveness predictions. The basic hypotheses derived from the resulting model are tested on a set of 200 smoking cessation ads evaluated by a large, representative sample of adult smokers. Three robust results were obtained: More effective smoking cessation ads are ones that have strong arguments, use narrative forms to present their content, and invoke strong emotion (fear & guilt). Other significant effects are observed but treated as less robust and await replication.","Anti-Smoking PSAs, Web and Peer Influences",Health Communication

Results indicate that the type of appeal being used in a health ad does not impact that ad’s effectiveness, while messages advertising a third-person benefit of the health behavior are more appealing than those advertising a first-person benefit. They also indicate that an ad presenting both a third-person benefit and an emotional appeal, or a first-person benefit with a rational appeal, would have a greater influence than an ad presenting only an appeal, only a benefit, or a different combination of either. These results were especially true for females and viewers who already had low intentions to smoke.

Although many empirical investigations have explored the relations between peer norms and adolescent smoking behaviors, the effect has never been systematically quantified. The present meta-analysis synthesized 208 effect sizes from 67 different studies that examined associations between descriptive peer norms and adolescent smoking initiation and progression with longitudinal panel designs. Both fixed-and random-effects models with robust variance estimates were used to estimate weighted mean odds ratios. The study found significant associations between peer norms and smoking initiation (OR=2.16) and progression (OR=1.82). Moderator analyses revealed that the social closeness between adolescents and their peers was significantly associated with effect size magnitude such that smoking initiation (but not progression) was more influenced by socially closer (vs. more distant) peers. Implications for theory, measurement and campaign practices to prevent adolescents from smoking onset and progression are discussed.","Anti-Smoking PSAs, Web and Peer Influences",Health Communication

In this study, we test a conceptual model in which perceived parental mediation strategies are related to conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy in SNG. In turn, both conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy are related to pestering intention. A total of 781 participants (10-14 years old) were asked to view a video clip of SNG Habbo, including a commercial message, and to fill in a questionnaire. SEM analysis confirmed that autonomy-supportive restrictive media mediation was related to understanding selling intentions. Autonomy-supportive active media mediation was positively related to understanding persuasive intentions of SNG advertising and negatively related to children’s critical attitude towards SNG advertising. Further, our model indicates that children’s critical attitude towards SNG advertising is negatively related to pester intentions and that children’s understanding of the persuasive intent is positively associated with pester intentions.",Understanding and Countering Effects of Advertising on Youth,Children Adolescents and the Media

However, other theorists have suggested that age is not the necessary determinant of persuasion understanding but that cognitive development is (via theory of mind). In addition, Kunkel (2010) has suggested that advertising knowledge represents a number of competencies. Working with elementary school children, this study tested whether children’s ToM capabilities predicted advertising knowledge. Results indicate that children’s understanding of selling intent is significantly linked to theory of mind development beyond the influence of age and linguistic competence and that children showed stronger knowledge of selling intent than knowledge of persuasive intent.",Understanding and Countering Effects of Advertising on Youth,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0554,2015,Paper Session,Strengthening Children’s Defenses Against Advergames: The Effectiveness of an Approach-Avoidance Training,2,"This study examined whether children’s susceptibility to advergames can be decreased by strengthening their advertising defenses. To this end, an intervention was developed based on the approach-avoidance task (AAT). The goal of this intervention was to induce an avoidance tendency (i.e., negative attitude) towards a character named Reccie. It was expected that, when Reccie was placed in an advergame, the intervention-induced negative attitude towards Reccie would transfer to the game and advertised brand, resulting in more negative responses towards the game (i.e., game involvement, game attitude) and the brand (i.e., brand attitude, brand choice). An experiment among 7 to 11 year old children (N = 58) showed that the intervention had no effect on children’s self-reported attitude towards Reccie, nor on their game involvement, game attitude or brand attitude. However, results did show a significant effect of the intervention on brand choice: Children who participated in the intervention were less likely to choose the advertised brand after playing the advergame. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications regarding the underlying mechanisms of children’s advertising defenses.",Understanding and Countering Effects of Advertising on Youth,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0555,2015,Paper Session,Strengthening Children’s Advertising Defenses: The Effect of Forewarnings of Commercial and Manipulative Intent,3,"This study investigated whether a forewarning of advertising’s intent can increase 8- to 10-year-old children’s (N = 159) defenses against TV-commercials to make them less susceptible to its effects (i.e., brand attitude and advertised product desire). Two different forewarnings were tested: one for advertising’s commercial intent (i.e., warning for the selling and persuasive intent) and one for advertising’s manipulative intent (i.e., warning for the deceptive nature). Results showed that the warning of manipulative intent prior to advertising exposure was most successful in increasing children’s advertising defenses: the forewarning increased children’s skeptical attitude toward advertising (i.e., attitudinal advertising literacy) which in turn led to less favorable brand attitudes and less advertised product desire. The forewarning of commercial intent was not effective in strengthening children’s advertising defenses. These findings demonstrate that forewarnings of manipulative intent are successful in stimulating children’s attitudinal advertising literacy (i.e., skepticism), and offer potential to reduce advertising susceptibility.",Understanding and Countering Effects of Advertising on Youth,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0556,2015,Paper Session,The Effectiveness of a Social Network-Implemented Intervention to Promote Water Consumption: A Cluster-Randomized Control Trial,4,"This study examined the effectiveness of a social network-implemented intervention promoting water consumption.

The intervention consisted of identifying and training the most influential children in each classroom to promote water consumption within their social networks. The schools in the control condition did not receive any intervention. Water consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages consumption (SSBs), and intentions to drink more water in the near future, were assessed before and after the intervention was implemented. Findings revealed that children who were exposed to the intervention consumed more water, less SSBs, and showed a greater intent to drink more water than nonexposed children. These findings indicate that a social-network implemented intervention promoting water consumption could positively influence children’s consumption behaviors. This in turn could reduce the risk of obesity among children.",Complementary and Integrative Treatments and Interventions,Health Communication

Quantitative analysis (n = 229) reveled that stories were tailored to a particular city in Texas when they were advertorials, and to the entire state of Texas when they originated from Texas health organizations. Stories that addressed how American healthcare works and Western biomedical approach to health employed some words in English, while stories about alternative medicine mostly relied only on Russian. Qualitative analysis provided evidence that while the sample contained relatively few stories that were clearly tailored to the Russian-speaking population, methods approximating cultural sensitivity were employed in health coverage.",Complementary and Integrative Treatments and Interventions,Health Communication
2015-0558,2015,Paper Session,How to Find an Alternative? A Typology of Cancer Patients’ Information Behavior Regarding CAM,2,"Due to a lack of evidence-based information, there is a controversial debate on the status of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in cancer treatment. To participate in shared decision making processes and to make informed decisions, patients need to gain an adequate understanding of medical information regarding their illness and respective treatment options. In this, media play an essential role in empowering patients. We thus ask: What types of information behaviors do cancer patients apply with regard to complementary and alternative medicine? From existing literature, we developed a theoretical framework a theoretical framework to analyze cancer patients’ information behavior regarding CAM and conducted 50 semi-structured qualitative interviews with cancer patients. As a result, we present a typology of cancer patients’ information behavior based on the theoretical framework. We discuss how different types may influence patients’ empowerment in the decision making process and outline potential improvements in media-related health communication.",Complementary and Integrative Treatments and Interventions,Health Communication
2015-0559,2015,Paper Session,Predicting the Use of TCM Health Maintenance Approach From Cultural and Religious Perspectives,1,"As an important type of complementary and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been long practiced in East Asia and other regions. TCM health maintenance approach is widespread among the lay public as a tool of health maintenance and disease prevention. This study aims to investigate the factors which exert influences on the intention to adopt/continue using TCM health maintenance approach, as a response to the call for culturally sensitive approaches of health communication research under the guideline of extended theory of planned behavior. Based on an online survey of a Chinese national sample, this study confirmed the predictive power of the factors of the theory of planned behavior in determining the intention to adopt or continue using TCM health maintenance approaches. Moreover, the respondents’ Chinese cultural orientation and spirituality positively predicted their attitude toward TCM health maintenance approaches. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Complementary and Integrative Treatments and Interventions,Health Communication
2015-0560,2015,Paper Session,The Intimate Distance of a Feminine Industry,1,"This paper identifies a contradictory scale of intimate distance demanded by post-Fordist production and personified in the scrapbook industry by the self-branded celebrity designer. Discourses of uniqueness provide a space of overlap between craft and marketing in which the craft designer is aligned with the possessive individual of traditionally masculine and capitalist modes of production (Scharff, 2012, p. 6). The paper also points to the role of design contests as a pathway where hobbyists are reconfigured into designers and, for a limited few, celebrities. Attention is paid to the scandal surrounding the 2007 Creating Keepsakes magazine’s annual Hall of Fame contest as readers challenged rhetoric of the magazine that anyone could win as a cover-up for the promotion of predetermined celebrities. Throughout, the paper situates designer celebrities or self-brands as part of a negotiated feminine scale of intimate distance used to mask the depersonalized scale of industrial production.",If/When We Have Fun: Gender Subjectivities in Leisure,Feminist Scholarship

Disrupting the boundaries between the commercial/public and personal, virtual and physical, work and consumption, transnational mobile middle-class Chinese women have “reinvented” prosumption as a cultural, technological, and economic solution to the contradictions that inhere in competing demands of different gender regimes. In their hands, prosumption becomes a gendered response to the tensions inherent to China’s Post-Socialist modernity, allowing some women more choices, autonomy, flexibility, and mobility through the strategic performance of gendered identities and networks. But such freedom is often already contained by the biopolitical governmentality of both advanced capitalism and the patriarchal Chinese state, which divide women based on class, race, and nationality, render employment precarious and atomized, encourage consumer global citizenship, and foster a self-promotional, commoditized, and “always-on” interactive subjectivity. As such, this article seeks to complicate the current discussion of prosumption by highlighting the structuring imperatives of gender, class, race, and nation.",If/When We Have Fun: Gender Subjectivities in Leisure,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0562,2015,Paper Session,Still White Male's Predominance: An Intersectional Analysis of the Alpha/Beta/Omega Framework in Online Fan Fiction,1,"Fan fiction is a type of fiction in which authors use established characters and stories to create original narrative works. Since 2010, there has been a popular framework in online fan fiction called Alpha/Beta/Omega (“ABO”). Many writers followed this ABO framework to create their fan fiction. In this framework, the society is divided into six genders instead of two. People are either male or female, and either Alpha, Beta, or Omega. The purpose of the paper is to examine by intersectional analysis representation of gender, sexuality, race, and class in online ABO fan fiction - a cyberspace constructed by writers, who are predominantly female. A thematic analysis reveals that the ABO framework in the cyberspace created by fan communities has not been free from the “white male” discourse.",If/When We Have Fun: Gender Subjectivities in Leisure,Feminist Scholarship

Following from observations about the potential for “new sports” to generate space for gender alternatives, we explore the rise of extreme fitness programs as a national (and in some cases, global) phenomenon that is also entwined with changing discourses of “ideal” workplace identity. Specifically, we link the extreme fitness program of CrossFit to neoliberal discourses that promote the need to be “self made” or “enterprising.” We discuss two main implications—the promotion of the literal self-made man and female masculinity/muscularity. Ultimately, we conclude that extreme fitness provides one site from which to articulate female masculinity and muscularity in relationship to neoliberal discourses of self-hood. While we situate our conversation in the world of extreme fitness, we theorize broader implications to understandings of gender in everyday life.",If/When We Have Fun: Gender Subjectivities in Leisure,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0564,2015,Paper Session,Consumption in the City: The Turn to Interiority in Contemporary Postfeminist Television,1,"In this article, I discuss a postfeminist ‘turn to interiority’ which takes place in U.S. postfeminist television from 2005 onwards. Drawing on the postfeminist theories of retreatism (Negra, 2009) and girlie femininity, this turn is characterized by a concern with interior spaces – reviving domesticity and the importance of finding and securing a home – as well as internalized consumption – replacing superficial forms of material consumption with the quest for self-actualisation, through eating and expressions of the authentic self. I analyse this shift through a comparative analysis of the television shows Sex and the City, Girls and The Mindy Project. I argue that the turn to interiority is a product of the U.S. cultural context, but also that this examination evidences the malleability and longevity of postfeminist ideology. Accordingly, I argue for the continuing importance of postfeminist scholarship as insight into the failures and potential of neoliberal politics.",If/When We Have Fun: Gender Subjectivities in Leisure,Feminist Scholarship

This includes a regional fiber optic ring designed to lower the end-user costs of connectivity and reduce dependence on American data infrastructure, leading commentators to suggest growing regional geopolitical autonomy. But improved connectivity is also fundamental to the modernization of transportation logistics. In economies based on primary production and extraction, informationalization of commodity chains facilitates capitalist insertion, and therefore ought to constitute a significant nexus of informational geopolitical struggle. However there is a notable absence of concern about these issues in South America. This paper contemplates this lack of attention, and then considers what it means for how we should think about the geopolitics of information.","Local and Regional Information, Infrastructure, Ideologies, and Ideas",Global Communication and Social Change

Particularly this paper, part of a larger project, will examine how subscription to cable or pay television has increased enormously in Brazil and Mexico in the last 6-7 years as effects of the substantial growth of the middle class in the last 10-15 years has begun to become very visible in media behavior. This is significant because cable television growth in Latin America had trailed far behind most other regions of the world (Reis 1999), where cable and satellite television grew explosively in the 1990s (Balio 1998). At the time, that was theorized as being due to the fact that Latin America was already covered by well resourced commercial television stations, which provided a great deal of entertainment, which was closely to tuned to national interests, gaining a great deal of advantage from cultural proximity (Straubhaar 1991). If Latin Americans are now turning to cable or pay television, is that largely because of increased affluence that permits them to afford it? Or is it more due to increased education that gives them the cultural capital that might lead them to want it? Or both? This study endeavors to use marketing data to conduct a deeper investigation of social stratification and media use in Latin American cities. By using a marketing study, this study uses existing tools used in the TV business to examine the role of class in multichannel TV adoption.","Local and Regional Information, Infrastructure, Ideologies, and Ideas",Global Communication and Social Change

Since the textual analysis becomes very important to understand how media texts might be used in order to make sense of the world we live in—meaning it is significant to contextualize it within our life and/or society, as Mckee (2001) point out, it investigates the ways in which the major themes developed in these two movies have developed and what their representations are. Given that ‘Arrow, The Ultimate Weapon’ was embedded in Buddhism as its major philosophical background, it especially analyzes the ways in which this Buddhist religious thought-driven local popular culture has utilized hybridity to make the unique conciliate between local forces and global forces to develop the third space. This eventually leads us to determine the major characteristics of hybrid Korean cinema and the possibility of the creation of local films developed by local forces and ideologies.","Local and Regional Information, Infrastructure, Ideologies, and Ideas",Global Communication and Social Change

Though SSE has been shown prevalent in interpersonal communication, research on its occurrence and communication structure in online social networks is lacking. Based on a content analysis of Live Journal blog posts (n = 540), we assess the occurrence and characterize different types of online SSE, and further present a theoretical model of online SSE. A large proportion of emotional expressions were found to conform to SSE, with negative emotional posts outnumbering bivalent and positive posts. Affective feedback predominated to cognitive, and was found to provide emotional support, empathy and admiration in congruence with the valence of the initiating SSE. These findings contribute to a conceptualization of a pro-social form of online emotional sharing, as opposed to a superficial view of emotion sharing in online social networks.",Social Support via Social Media #2,Communication and Technology

Using a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 50 or older from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we examined the relationship between older adults’ SNS use and social well-being associated with kin and non-kin relations and how these associations differ across relatively younger (52–69) and older (70+) age groups. Results of ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis suggest that SNS use was associated with increased non-kin relation-based social well-being—perceived support from friends and feelings of connectedness, but was not associated with kin relation-based social well-being. The disaggregated analysis further shows that the association between SNS use and perceived support from friends was significant for younger-old adults, whereas the link between SNS use and feelings of connectedness was significant for older-old adults only. As older people engage with an increasingly smaller and narrower network with a greater proportion of kin contacts, our results suggest that SNS use may help older adults’ access the differential social benefits associated with non-kin relations across later-life stages.",Social Support via Social Media #2,Communication and Technology

2015-0578,2015,Paper Session,The Rediscovery of Ideology Once More: A Tribute to Stuart Hall,1,"In 1982 Stuart Hall wrote a seminal essay in which he sketched out the theoretical framework of a resurgent critical paradigm in media studies (Hall 1982). It followed a long-standing pluralist paradigm sustained by a positivist approach to studying media influence that was rooted in behavioural science. This paper begins by unpicking the theoretical and empirical foundations of the critical paradigm before sketching out the contours of a new pluralism discourse that arguably regained ascendancy in media studies during the 1990s and early 2000s. But far from consigning the dominant ideological thesis to the annals of history, this renewal of liberal pluralist ideas has in its turn prompted new ways of thinking about – and studying – the media’s ‘ideological work’.

Then we consider communication technology scholars’ calls to address three aspects of communication technology: materiality, mediation, and affect. The result, we propose, is a way of theorizing about the qualities of communication media and technologies that moves beyond the dichotomy of social construction and technological determinism. This move captures a more interactive process of the ontological relationship between humans and technology. We offer the phrase “imagined affordance” as a theoretical construct for communication scholars that suggests that qualities of communication technologies and media are more complex, multidimensional and interactive than is currently suggested by “technological affordance.” We conclude by suggesting how other scholars might apply the theory of imagined affordance.",Legacies and Innovations in Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

However, the amount of time to which an individual can ascribe meaning beyond the mere conditions necessarily for survival varies across individuals, necessitating a perspective of time as an exchangeable resource that is differentiated according to one's relevant position within the social stratum. Such a conceptual framework, which I term temporal capital, considers the complexities of how temporality is felt and experienced on multiple levels, from the individual to the institutional, from the perpetual to the circumstantial. This paper seeks to expand an understanding of the relation between time and power, particularly with the ubiquity of the Internet and digital media, and the pervasiveness of mobile communication technologies, and demonstrate how temporal capital as a conceptual framework can be used in different contexts.",Legacies and Innovations in Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

This paper decouples the connection between humans and media systems through metaphors of music deployed by communications scholars. Too often, music is tied to human agency, either imposing rules or acting as a means of expression. In other contexts, it is an emergent system produced by the interrelation of objects and players. Both metaphors neglect to address the music system itself, free from actors. This paper posits looking at musical systems as an independent information and material structure which mediates forms of expression and reception through a collective acceptance of predictability. This new frame highlights not only what music could be outside of its human context, but also how it can be utilized by communications and media scholars in understanding the role of mediation in a multiplicity of human and nonhuman life spans.",Legacies and Innovations in Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The models include various conceptualizations of how stages of epidemic coverage evolve and change (e.g., Adelman & Verbrugge, 2000; Ungar, 2008; Wald, 2008). Moreover, most offer the vital consideration of how blame is ascribed, which is crucial in understanding how audiences may be able to allay some of their fear or distance themselves from the epidemic. In reviewing existing models, I suggest how closely related concepts included in each might be modified to develop a more parsimonious framework for examining media coverage of disease outbreaks.

This study investigated the processes of amplification and attenuation of risk attitudes toward genetically modified food. Perceptions about the consequence, uncertainty, and fairness and whether and how these perceptions were amplified or attenuated by efficacy beliefs were examined. Data based on reactions to video messages about genetically modified food indicated that perceived consequence, uncertainty, and fairness predicted attitudes toward genetically modified food. More importantly, the effects of perceived consequence and uncertainty were moderated by collective efficacy. High collective efficacy mitigated the effects of perceived consequence and uncertainty on attitudes toward genetically modified food, but low collective efficacy aggravated the effects of perceived consequence and uncertainty. Attitudes toward genetically modified food were more positive when collective efficacy was high and were more negative when collective efficacy was low. Together, the results suggest that collective efficacy attenuates public concern about the consequence and uncertainty associated with controversial health issues such as genetically modified food.",Risk Communication and Health,Health Communication

However, prior research has not examined individuals’ levels of engagement or transportation into the narrative information. We investigated how individuals of varying numeracy and transportability (the general tendency to be immersed into stories) perceived risk when exposed to both numeric and narrative information. Undergraduates (N = 218) read about a fictitious disease in a 2 (narrative quality: high or low) x 2 (risk: high or low) between subjects design. Greater transportation into the narrative world led to stronger emotional responses and intent to change. Furthermore, story quality interacted with subjective numeracy to influence risk judgments. Individuals with higher subjective numeracy more accurately assessed risk when compared with those with low subjective numeracy, but only when information is non-threatening and when they are not influenced by high quality narratives. This research suggests that the transportingness of a story is an important variable to consider in determining the effects of health risk information.",Risk Communication and Health,Health Communication

The findings of this meta-analysis indicated a small but positive effect of interpersonal communication on effectively inducing campaign-targeted outcomes, and showed that this effect was moderated by health topic addressed by the campaign, the type of outcome being targeted by the campaign, and with whom people conversed, along with several other study-relevant variables. The implications of these findings for future health campaign efforts are discussed.",Interpersonal Communication and Health: Impact of Relationships on Health and Health-Related Behaviors,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0592,2015,Paper Session,Appearance-Related Communication and Body Image Outcomes: Fat Talk and Old Talk Among Mothers and Daughters,2,"The current study sought to investigate mothers’ and daughters’ appearance-related communication. Participants included 199 mother-daughter dyads that completed online questionnaires including measures of fat talk, old talk, body dissatisfaction, body surveillance, drive for thinness, and bulimic tendencies. Actor partner interdependence models revealed that (a) mothers’ and daughters’ fat talk, but not old talk, were significantly related to one another, (b) mothers’ and daughters’ fat talk and old talk were significantly related to each of their own body image outcomes, (c) mothers’ fat talk was positively related to daughters’ bulimic tendencies, and (d) mothers’ old talk was positively related to daughters’ body dissatisfaction. These results suggest that engaging in appearance-related communication is problematic for the person making the comments and, to some extent, being exposed to another person’s appearance-related comments can be harmful to the individual as well – at least for the daughters in the current sample.",Interpersonal Communication and Health: Impact of Relationships on Health and Health-Related Behaviors,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0593,2015,Paper Session,Chewing the Fat: How Formerly Overweight and Obese Individuals Negotiate Disclosure of Their Weight Loss,5,"Research suggests that throughout their lifespan, overweight or obese individuals continue to experience weight-based stigma, even after they become a normal weight. Using Communication Privacy Management Theory (Petronio, 2002) as a framework, this study explored the experiences of 30 formerly overweight or obese individuals, finding that while some participants experienced or feared residual stigma, the vast majority perceived more benefits from disclosing their weight loss than risks, regardless of their weight-loss method. For the most part, participants revealed in order to inspire others, build relationships, or hold themselves accountable for maintaining their weight. Conversely, participants concealed when they sought to protect their thinner identity or did not want to come across as boastful. Participants were more concerned about the negative effect of disclosure on others than of their own disapproval. In contrast to previous studies, this investigation suggests confidants are typically encouraging and supportive of the discloser’s weight loss.",Interpersonal Communication and Health: Impact of Relationships on Health and Health-Related Behaviors,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0594,2015,Paper Session,"Enacting Social Control to Encourage Healthier Partner Diet and Exercise Behavior: Motives, Constraints, and Topic Avoidance",1,"This study examined topic avoidance and health salience in conjunction with primary and secondary goals for engaging in health-related social control in romantic relationships. Actor Partner Interdependence Models (APIMs) were used to examine the associations between couples’ use of positive and negative social control and their primary and secondary health-related social control goals and topic avoidance. Whereas people used more positive social control to encourage their partners to engage in healthier diet and exercise behaviors as their primary goals and increased, they used more negative social control in conjunction with greater secondary goals. Moreover, people’s use of positive social control and engagement in healthy behaviors increased as their partners’ topic avoidance decreased. With regard to enacting diet- and exercise-related social control in couples, it appears that the primary and secondary goals are an intrapersonal process and topic avoidance is an interpersonal process.",Interpersonal Communication and Health: Impact of Relationships on Health and Health-Related Behaviors,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0595,2015,Paper Session,Subjective Reality: How Perceived and Objective Conversational Valence Influence Binge Drinking Determinants,3,"Previous studies have shown that interpersonal communication, and particularly perceived conversational valence (i.e., the perceived negativity or positivity of conversations) about health topics, influences health determinants. Based on 43 dyads (N = 86) discussing the topic of alcohol consumption, this study is the first to show that whereas perceived and objective conversational valence are positively related, only perceived conversational valence is a significant predictor of binge drinking attitudes and intentions. Thus, subjective reality matters more than objective reality. Furthermore, only the perceived valence of the participants’ own contributions - and not of their conversation partners - influences binge drinking intentions, indicating that self-persuasion is more influential than persuasion by others. Thus, conversations in which discussants themselves express negative opinions about unhealthy behaviors can enhance public health.",Interpersonal Communication and Health: Impact of Relationships on Health and Health-Related Behaviors,Interpersonal Communication

Specifically, individual well-being (i.e., stress, rumination, positive and negative affect), taking conflict personally, and perceived resolvability of a serial argument, as well as the demand/withdraw pattern are compared between four ethnic groups in the United States: Asian-Americans (n = 172), African-Americans (n = 185), Caucasians (n = 224), and Hispanics (n =124). Results suggest several group differences based on group membership and within-group differences based on one’s strength of ethnic identity. Furthermore, results revealed several different variables predict the use of the demand/withdraw pattern in the case of each ethnic group.

2015-0599,2015,Paper Session,Offline Social Networks in Information-Gathering Processes Among Latina Migrants in New York and North Carolina,1,"This qualitative paper describes the role of offline social networks in the information-gathering processes among Latina migrants in New York and North Carolina. Thirty Latina migrants from four different countries were interviewed to understand how they gather relevant information (i.e., about jobs, health services, and education opportunities) and how they establish social networks. Even though most of the participants have access to technology, they heavily rely on family members and other migrants to acquire information. Some differences were found in the information-gathering patterns depending on level of education, but, for the most part, these migrants trust word of mouth and offline social networks, regardless of legal status in the United States, nationality, or level of access to technology. These results seem to support other scholars’ findings that offline communications and face-to-face community-building efforts have strong relevance among migrants, in this particular case, female Latino migrants, even in the Digital Age.",Intersections of Race and Ethnicity and Gender,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Cognitive responses include meaning perception, level of elaboration and thoughts generated. Findings indicate that visual arguments indeed had greater effects than verbal argument and there was an interesting interaction effect on level of thinking.

2015-0601,2015,Paper Session,Looking Left or Looking Right? Effects of Newspaper Layout on the Perception of Political News,3,"Clothes can make the man – and design can make the media. A two-factor online experiment with n = 533 participants investigated how newspaper articles’ layout style and text slant affect the perception of a newspapers’ political orientation on the left-right axis. The layout versions were based on a prior analysis of correlations between design and political direction of German quality newspapers. Results provide evidence for the existence of political layout effects: under certain conditions, not only text slant but also layout style can have considerable influence on how people perceive the political position of newspapers. Political layout effects were reinforced by high knowledge of quality newspapers and were diminished by self-reported attention/affinity to design. They emerged largely independent of other individual factors like political orientation, newspaper usage and age. Consequently, graphic design should be considered as capable of shaping or even biasing recipients’ perception of political media messages.","Researching Cognition, Perception, and Effects in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0602,2015,Paper Session,Surface and Substance: The Interaction of Color and Valence in Early Evaluative Processing,3,"Research on early cognitive processing indicates that color can influence the speed with which viewers are able to recognize objects within an image, and valence (positivity or negativity of content) can influence the speed with which viewers evaluate those objects. The present study examines the interaction of color and valence together on the speed of evaluation. We find evidence that color and valence interact in early visual processing. Viewers can evaluate positive color images more quickly than positive grayscale images, while negative images require more time to evaluate overall and the speeds do not differ as greatly between color and grayscale images. This indicates an interaction between the formal 'surface' features and the 'substantive' content features in early visual processing.","Researching Cognition, Perception, and Effects in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0603,2015,Paper Session,Visual Semiotics of Neotenic Logotypes,3,"A logotype, i.e., logo, is a graphical representation of brand identity. In a competitive marketplace, an iconic logo contributes to building a successful brand personality that is closely associated with the prompt recognition of the brand offerings. A brand is a system of signs and symbols; and the logo functions as a visual sign that consistently signifies the meaning of the brand (Oswald, 1996). However, not all those revised logotypes have been successful to renovate the brand image. Even though the important role of logo has been emphasized in brand communication, little empirical research has been done to link how we perceive the logo and how we value the branding. In this research, the context was investigated where the perceived aesthetics of a logo turned the value judgment on the brand to be negative.","Researching Cognition, Perception, and Effects in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies

As predicted, the graph format and interactivity influenced viewers’ comprehension. Participants were more accurate after viewing a dynamic bubble chart than after viewing a static area chart. The effects of format interacted with graph efficacy, such that bubble charts were more likely to enhance task performance for people with relatively high graph efficacy, compared to those with lower efficacy. Additionally, viewers were more likely to be confident in the quality of the data shown when it was attributed to a university than when it was attributed to a federal agency. Moreover, the effects of data source interacted with viewers’ preexisting attitudes toward university scientists and federal agencies as data providers. The implications for graph comprehension theory and science communication are discussed.","Researching Cognition, Perception, and Effects in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0605,2015,Paper Session,Understanding Narrative Persuasion: Exploring the Effects of Perceived Intended Audience and Outgroup Evaluation on Attitudes,2,"Researchers have recently been interested in understanding the effects of narrative persuasion on attitudes towards outgroups (Ortiz & Harwood, 2007; Schiappa, Gregg & Hewes, 2005). In these mediated interactions, audience members may experience reduced prejudices towards outgroup members after viewing a positive portrayal of an outgroup member on television. This reduction in prejudices demonstrates the incredible persuasive power of narratives and should be examined more closely. Specifically, this study examines the role that perceived intended audience of a television show and the outgroup evaluation of that portrayal have on audiences' attitudes toward outgroups. Our findings suggest that audience members report lower levels of prejudice when they believe that the narrative is aimed at ingroup members than when it is aimed at outgroup members. Additionally, the extent to which a portrayal is seen as accurate or inaccurate by outgroup members affects audience attitudes toward the outgroup.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication
2015-0606,2015,Paper Session,Escaping the Brown Shadows: Right-Wing Propaganda Motivates Dissociation From One's National Ingroup and Turning Towards Alternative Identities,3,"Prior research found the distancing from extremist propaganda to be dependent on (a) shared group identity of propagator and recipient; and (b) educational level. Students’ evaluated ingroup propaganda more negatively than outgroup videos, apprentices showed the reversed pattern. It has been suggested that this is due to different strategies students and apprentices use to defend against the identity-threat emerging from ingroup propaganda. Students were assumed to dissociate from the threatened group by turning towards their academic identity (individual-level strategy), meanwhile apprentices were claimed to change the perception of the whole group (group-level strategy). However, no study so far tested the effects of ingroup propaganda on social identity defenses directly.
Two experiments aimed at closing this gap by confronting German students with right-wing extremist propaganda videos. The results confirmed ingroup propaganda to motivate individual mobility towards alternative academic (Study 1) and superordinate (Study 2) identities. Results are discussed concerning their implications.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication
2015-0607,2015,Paper Session,When We Enjoy Bad News About Other Groups: A Social Identity Approach to Out-Group Schadenfreude,4,"A field study (N = 203) investigates schadenfreude (pleasure at the misfortune of others) as an emotional response to news about an out-group misfortune in an intergroup consumer context. More specifically, schadenfreude reactions of BlackBerry-users to fictitious, negative news reports about Apple’s iPhone are analyzed. Consistent with social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and intergroup emotion theory (Smith, 1993), the results demonstrate that affective in-group identification increases schadenfreude reactions to news about an out-group misfortune, provided that this misfortune occurs in a domain of interest to news recipients. Additional findings show that this interaction effect is (a) still observed when controlling for affective dispositions towards the out-group, and (b) is not obtained on emotional reactions shaped by empathic concerns (i.e., sympathy). Moreover, the results suggest that schadenfreude reactions strengthen subsequent intentions to share the news about the out-group’s misfortune with others or to engage in so-called negative Word-of-Mouth communication.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication

While there is research on judgments of offense, it involves comparing sensitivity to criticisms delivered by ingroup versus outgroup members. Researchers have not yet addressed why individual differences in offense judgments exist, and little attention has been directed at offense judgments that are generated by political correctness concerns. In an experiment testing the influence of the group membership and status of a speaker, the results of this study indicate that both group membership and status play a role in attributions of offense, meaning that finding comments offensive and sanctioning offenders is not purely motivated by morality, but may instead be a strategic reaction in order to gain status.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication

Additionally, multiple news exposures are tested to determine whether individuals can become emotionally inured to war coverage, even when images are more graphic. Key results find those who viewed graphic news visuals did not show evidence of desensitization after repeated viewing, and expressed higher levels of concern regarding drone use, but not reduced support for U.S. drone policy.",The Study of Media Violence and Graphic Content (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication

In a nationwide survey, 254 participants wrote essays describing memorable violent media content (movies and television programs) seen in the past. An analysis of the essays suggests that men’s and women’s situation models are equally complex, although men described more details about blood and body parts. Among men, the level of negative emotion at the time of initial exposure indirectly predicted situation model complexity as mediated by accessibility and memory vividness. The same was indirect effect was not found among women.

Published journal articles were collected and effect sizes were analyzed to examine if there were differences in the enjoyment of violent content. Through the lens of a fixed effects model, the results indicated that the morality of audiences and nature of visual media did not impact enjoyment of violence and the selected studies shared a statistically significant common effect size (d = 0.33). Although synthesized data signified a fairly homogenous effect of mediated violence on enjoyment, the studies employing morality and video games as moderators were heterogeneous.

Scandal also exists in an era saturated with rape culture through victim blaming and other myths reinforced by rape fantasies. This paper conducts a textual analysis of the hit series, tracing the ways in which the primary romantic entanglement perpetuates troubling, even alarming aspects of rape culture through the utilization of rape fantasy narratives. Drawing upon rape fantasy research in the field of Psychology, this study identifies recurring themes in the central relationship (female resistance and submission, male dominance, etc.), and traces their adaptation from trends in rape fantasies. Similarities between their common narratives and Scandal’s most prominent pairing ultimately serve to silence and erase the female protagonist’s protestations and justify the male lead’s use of force and manipulation.",The Study of Media Violence and Graphic Content (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication

The normative approach of the paper sheds light on the theoretical importance of Internet’s architecture and regulatory code and their impact on the realization of a public sphere as they influence the dynamics of discussion, participation, or deliberation. In a way to set the conceptual framework to discuss the possibility of a networked public sphere, this paper delineates the challenges and limitations of current network architecture that are discouraging the possibility of public deliberation. Approaching the normative possibility of a networked public sphere, end-to-end architecture, regulation by government (i.e., policy intervention), and multivalent approach to the marketplace of ideas are proposed and discussed in detail.",Policy Perspectives on the Creation of a Networked Society,Communication Law & Policy

South Korean statutory efforts for net neutrality were strongly motivated by those of the U.S. Especially, the Korean Communications Commissions’ (KCC) plans for 2011 is a version of the FCC’s ‘Open Internet Order.’ Based on this strong motivation, the main question the newspapers raised is whether the result will influence the net neutrality debate in South Korea. Also, they tried to account for different the values of net neutrality in the U.S and South Korea. The key finding of this study is that the South Korean newspapers framed the net neutrality debate in the U.S. as a positive example or negative example in order to support the net neutrality principle in South Korea. This is because South Korean newspapers tend to focus on the net neutrality debate in respect to public interest.",Policy Perspectives on the Creation of a Networked Society,Communication Law & Policy
2015-0615,2015,Paper Session,A Comparative Analysis of Net Neutrality,3,"This study compares and contrasts the U.S. and Korea in the context of network neutrality, focusing on debates among stakeholders and regulatory approaches. Similarities and differences are highlighted by comparisons within the broadband ecosystem framework: government functions, histories, people’s perceptions, regulatory approaches, legislative initiatives, and implementation. In Korea, a regulatory framework with suggested guidelines exists, and it can be used to address net neutrality in a case-by-case fashion. The U.S. follows a regulatory approach by creating enforceable non-discrimination rules. The findings in this study suggest that the issue is not only complicated because it is embedded contextually, but also because the respective parties’ diverse interests are multifaceted and vague. It is concluded, therefore, that a coherent and consistent approach is an effective way to govern neutrality.",Policy Perspectives on the Creation of a Networked Society,Communication Law & Policy
2015-0616,2015,Paper Session,Moral Goodness and Social Orderliness: An Analysis of the Official Discourse About Internet Governance in China,1,"The rapid expansion of Internet in China has seen a concomitant upgrade of state control over it. While most existing studies adopted the technical or institutional perspectives, few have examined how China’s official discourses legitimise its Internet governance. Based on a content analysis of 301 articles of the CCP’s central mouthpiece, People’s Daily (2000-2014), and a critical discourse analysis, this study explored and interpreted how Internet control is discursively constituted and practiced by the control regime. It was found that the official discourse consistently justified Internet governance on the basis of moral goodness, personal security and social stability. Over the years, China’s official discourse has changed from viewing Internet as a techno space of moral and security concerns to treating it as a destabilising field of contentions. Though new technologies have brought about challenges, the discursive framework of Internet governance in China has remained intact and coherent.",Policy Perspectives on the Creation of a Networked Society,Communication Law & Policy
2015-0617,2015,Paper Session,Multiphrenic Mages? Examining Assumptions of the Postmodern Self in an Online Gaming Context,2,"As communication technologies remove social constraints of space and time, postmodern perspectives broadly characterize the human self as fluid, fragmented, and distributed across digital and physical contexts. Despite considerable work engaging these notion, their underlying assumptions are rarely empirically tested. This study begins to address that gap by examining common assumptions underlying such perspectives – that multiple, conflicting identities collectively constitute the self in detrimental ways – in a computer-mediated context in which the user literally controls multiple digital personas: a massively multiplayer online game. Through semantic network analyses, player interviews are examined for the number, type, and signification of represented identities. Analyses demonstrate that users experience narrow or multi-dimensional and consistent or fragmented identities, depending on the user’s relationship with a digital face. An alternate approach to examining the distributed self is proposed, highlighting variations in identity consistency and complexity of discrete identities as key factors.",Codes and Referents in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-0618,2015,Paper Session,Predictors of Textisms and Communication Accommodation in Text Messaging,4,"Text messaging has become an increasingly ubiquitous form of mediated communication. Though some compose text messages with proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation, others integrate non-standardized textual and linguistic cues such as emoticons, intentional misspellings, exaggerated capitalizations, abbreviations, acronyms, and other digital cues. These indicators allow text message senders to convey meaning, personality, and emotion in more dynamic ways. This study follows other recent research and utilizes the label textisms to refer to this wide assortment of digitally stylized cues (Drouin & Driver, 2012; Kemp & Bushnell, 2011; Powell & Dixon, 2011). Though research has begun to examine textisms in a variety of context, few studies compare predictors of textism usage to examine the likelihood of communication accommodation. Therefore, the goal of this research is to fill this gap by examining sex and personality style as predictors of textism usage and texting communication accommodation.",Codes and Referents in Social Media,Communication and Technology

This study uses a 2 (low vs. high opinion congruency) x 2 (message civility vs. incivility) between-subject factorial experiment to examine the spiral of silence on participants’ likelihood to like, comment on, or share the link on Facebook, as well as comment offline in subsequent conversations. The experimental design was embedded in a web-based survey, in which 502 undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Results indicate that the fear of isolation increased the likelihood of commenting on Facebook posts. Moreover, a civil climate increased the likelihood of liking comments on Facebook posts. Findings also suggest that “click-speech” could be considered a form of opinion expression and could be compared to other forms of online opinion expression.",Codes and Referents in Social Media,Communication and Technology

A 2 (self vs. other) x 2 (avatar’s body size; fat vs. normal) between-subject experiment (N = 124) was conducted. This study found that participants with fat characters self-reported walking less closely to a virtual partner in a cyber dating scenario than participants with normal characters. In addition, participants with fat characters expressed more dissatisfaction with service than participants with normal characters, and the service dissatisfaction was more pronounced in a social service failure (e.g., the waiter’s unfriendly attitude) than in a nonsocial service failure (e.g., the desired dish’s unavailability).

The second aim was to assess social presence and perceived anonymity as two possible underlying mechanisms that may explain the relation between communication medium and interpersonal attraction. An experiment was conducted among 105 unacquainted cross-sex dyads with a 2 (visible/invisible) x 2 (physical co-present/physically not co-present) between-subjects design. The results revealed that communicators who were co-present felt more social presence which enhanced interpersonal attraction. Perceived anonymity was found to lower interpersonal attraction. In addition, being visible lowered feelings of perceived anonymity which enhanced interpersonal attraction. Post-hoc analyses revealed that communicators who were both visible and co-present were less attracted towards each other. In initial interactions, neither physical co-presence nor visibility on its own influenced interpersonal attraction.",Effects of Varying Forms of Presence in Communication Media,Communication and Technology

The study was based on a cross-European survey of 1,039 Internet users aged 60 and up from eight countries. Results indicated that older Internet users are significantly more inclined to use mass media than new social media and prefer synchronous to asynchronous mass media. This e-audience, however, is not homogeneous, as four subsegments were identified. These groups differed in their media practices, sociocultural background and leisure preferences. Overall, despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices, with only a minority making intense use of new practices. With very few cross-national differences, this tendency appears to be universal, suggesting general media-use conservatism and a second-level digital divide among the older media e-audience.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0626,2015,Paper Session,When Meaning Matters More: Media Preferences Across the Adult Life-Span,3,"Three studies considered the roles of emotion and meaning in adults’ media preferences. In study 1, US 18-86 year olds read descriptions of TV programs and rated their anticipated emotions (warmth, humor, fear or sadness) and viewing interest. In Study 2, US and German 18-82 year olds watched violent film trailers and rated their anticipated fear and interest. There were few age differences in relationships between emotion and meaning or emotion and interest. However, in both studies, anticipated meaningfulness was a stronger predictor of interest for older adults and age moderated the indirect path (emotion → meaning → interest). In Study 3, (American Time Use Survey, 15-85 year olds), older adults reported more meaning while viewing and the indirect path (age → meaningfulness → wellbeing) suppressed a negative association between age and wellbeing. The findings suggest stability in the meaningfulness of media-derived emotions, but increases in the importance of meaningfulness.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0627,2015,Paper Session,Age Differences in Recall and Liking of Arousing Television Commercials,3,"This paper examines whether there are differences between older and younger adults in recall and liking of arousing television commercials. As hypothesized, the experiment demonstrated that older adults remembered brands and products in calm commercials better than in arousing commercials, and they also liked calm commercials more. In contrast, younger adults remembered brands and products in arousing commercials better and they liked these commercials more. In addition, (curvi)linear relationships showed that for older adults arousal deteriorates their recall and liking, whereas for younger adults arousal -up till a certain point- is beneficial. These findings strongly suggest that advertising effects found in younger samples are unlikely to be the same for older target groups. An important practical implication is that it currently seems to be wise to make commercials targeted towards older adults calm instead of arousing when the aim is to generate brand recall and liking.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0628,2015,Paper Session,Media Generations and Their Advertising Attitudes and Avoidance: A Six-Country Comparison,4,"The present study, a cross-national survey (N = 5766), examined generational differences in media use, advertising attitudes and avoidance for five media (newspapers, television, websites, social media, and mobile devices) in six countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and France). The survey revealed that the Net Generation and the Newspaper Generation clearly distinguished themselves in terms of their media use, in all six countries. For advertising attitudes, the Net Generation was the most positive generation regarding advertising on social media (US, UK, and the Netherlands) and mobile (UK and the Netherlands). The Newspaper generation, in the UK, was the most positive generation regarding advertising in newspapers and on television, whereas they were the most negative group regarding advertising in the newer media. In the US, they were the most negative generation regarding advertising in all five media. For advertising avoidance, there were no generational differences.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions

Examining the Relationship Between Online Media and Online Community Using Intermedia Agenda-Setting Theory,4,"The Sewol ferry tragedy was a major obtrusive issues in South Korea in 2014, and the agenda in the Korean online community (Daum Agora) seemed to be different from the agenda of the online media (Naver). This study examined the relationship between the online media agenda and the online community agenda, and the influence of the online community on news reporting related to the Sewol tragedy, taking into consideration intermedia agenda setting theory. This study further attempted to examine agenda setting theory by incorporating the Situation Crisis Communication Theory to better understand the various substantive attributes regarding crisis cases. Findings showed two portals initially delivered a different crisis agenda regarding the ferry tragedy, however, these two became more alike over time especially in terms of attacking the accuser. Interestingly, Daum preoccupied the most agendas (attack the accuser, diminish, and rebuild). This study provides greater understanding of online news consumption regarding the crisis issue.",Analyses of News Coverage: Cases and Patterns,Journalism Studies
2015-0630,2015,Paper Session,Framing ‘Bad News’: Culpability and Innocence in News Coverage of Tragedies,1,"This study proposes a set of frames, the Blame Frame and the Explain Frame, to study how tragic events that interrupt the flow of everyday life are reconstructed by the news media to repair and maintain social reality. The Blame Frame affixes responsibility on human agents and foregrounds the pursuit of punishment and justice. The Explain Frame takes responsibility away from human agents and explains the tragedy in terms of natural or quasi-natural processes. The social identities of the ‘prospective’ agents, this study argues, predict the difference in framing: ‘deviants’ and ‘aliens’ are held culpable while ‘local’ executives are projected as innocent, although these identities are themselves social and hinge upon prevalent cultural beliefs. Ultimately, both frames serve to reproduce social boundaries and reinforce the political and ideological status quo. Empirical evidence comes from the textual analysis of the coverage of Boston bombings and the Waco blast in three newspapers.",Analyses of News Coverage: Cases and Patterns,Journalism Studies
2015-0631,2015,Paper Session,Patterns of Immediacy: News Diffusion Processes Among German Online News Sites,3,"Contributing to research on online news flows, this study explores the dynamics of the diffusion of news events among online news sites. We develop a structuration model of news diffusion processes among online news sites from diffusion of news research, the notion of immediacy in online news production, and intermedia co-orientation. Using an automated big data approach to content analysis (N = 480,727 news articles), we reconstructed 95 news diffusion processes among 28 German online news sites. We could identify three common temporal patterns of news diffusion processes, which systematically differ regarding speed and variety of news sites involved. Almost half of diffusion processes is characterized by abrupt rises of the diffusion rate directly after events have been published first and often arrive at saturation after 1.5 hours. Especially for these rapid diffusion processes, we typically found the same online news sites to be among the first to report events.",Analyses of News Coverage: Cases and Patterns,Journalism Studies

Mediatization Trends in German and Austrian Elite Newspapers (1949-2009),1,"The study investigates the long-term mediatization process in the campaign coverage of German and Austrian elite newspapers from 1949 to 2009. It is the first study taking a cross-national perspective of a 60 year time span focusing on media logic – the media’s way of formatting their content and driving force of mediatization – and its long-term development. First, it empirically identifies three dimensions of media logic in campaign coverage: audience orientation, interventionism and depoliticization. Second, it approves that these dimensions of media logic are largely invariant between the two countries, seven newspapers and four time intervals under investigation. This analysis confirms the controversial assumption of an overarching, transnational media logic. Third, the development of media logic in both countries shows that it has gained in significance over time, but not uniformly and unilinearly, which approves the multidimensionality of media logic and mediatization.",Analyses of News Coverage: Cases and Patterns,Journalism Studies

Studies have suggested that media depictions of suicide may also nurture stigma, but little research has empirically measured content concerning suicide. The present study considers the institutional frames for covering mental health and suicide and the potential for novel framing in the suicide of Robin Williams. Results of a content analysis of 20 U.S. newspapers reveal changing frames and sourcing in the week following the suicide, and elements of celebrity that seem to both aid and hinder responsible coverage.

Web metrics in the context of news items might complement, or even substitute, the journalistic indication of relevance online. Therefore, we conducted a factorial survey, combined with an experimental setting (N = 320 participants), and computed multi-level regressions in order to assess the impact of the aforementioned audience- and journalism–related relevance characteristics. Our results show that comment counts have at least a similar influence on the selection of news items as news factors do.

2015-0635,2015,Paper Session,Examining Audience Cultivation and Relationship-Building as a Function of Media Richness,3,"Does a media outlet’s richness affect audience perceptions? Using intercept surveys (N = 417), this study determines how people perceive their relationships with media outlets. Although “rich media” (i.e., media with high capacity for multimodal functionality) technically allow for more engagement and interaction than “poor media,” those effects were not seen here. On most outcomes, rich media (e.g., websites, social media) paralleled poor media (e.g., print publications). This study shows that media outlets have much work to do with regards to audience cultivation. However, structural equation modeling analysis found a significant link between stewardship strategies and relationship perceptions. Media organizations who engage in social responsibility experience greater trust, satisfaction, commitment, and control mutuality with their audiences. Theoretically, this adds to our understanding of media richness theory and its applications to the study of information communication technologies. Practically, it tests whether media companies are combating industry struggles by going digital.",The News Audience,Mass Communication
2015-0636,2015,Paper Session,News Selection Criteria in the Digital Age: Professional Norms Versus Real-Time Audience Metrics,5,"On newspaper websites journalists can observe the preferences of the audience for free and in unprecedented detail, based on the page views for specific news articles.
This enables journalists to cater to these preferences.
In this paper we discuss the implications of the use of page views for news selection, and analyze five national newspapers from the Netherlands according to whether and how they use this information.
Using a cross-lagged analysis, we found that story lines of the most-viewed articles were more likely to receive more attention in subsequent reporting.
This supports the hypothesis that journalists use this information in news selection.
However, interviews with editors of the newspapers suggest that journalists consider the use of this information for news selection to be a taboo.
We elaborate on the implications of this discrepancy in the norms and behaviors of journalists, and project directions for future studies.",The News Audience,Mass Communication

But the question of whether the typical individual engages in politically motivated selective exposure is still an unsettled issue because results tend to vary according to how each study operationalizes the concept. Relying on results from a Web-based survey administered to a representative sample of adults in Wisconsin, we take on the problem of politically motivated selective exposure. Results show a positive but small relationship between political predispositions and exposure to partisan news media. Moreover, results show a substantial audience for news media that would typically be categorized as “neutral.” We conclude that politically motivated selective exposure occurs in Wisconsin, particularly among those with extreme ideologies, but the prevalence of this behavior may be somewhat overstated in existing literature.",The News Audience,Mass Communication
2015-0638,2015,Paper Session,Eye Movement Patterns in Response to Antibinge Drinking Messages,3,"Health message design combines selected visual and textual components that are thought to work in concert to produce an intended effect. Most health message effects research assumes rather than determines that message recipients attend to all necessary components. In contrast, the present research mapped viewing patterns of 50 participants in response to a set of anti-binge drinking print messages using eye tracking methodology. Results showed that participants primarily viewed faces of persons portrayed in the messages as well as alcohol use cues and cryptic one-liners. Textual components, e.g., information about consequences of heavy drinking, were viewed infrequently and briefly. Men, for whom anti-binge drinking messages were self-relevant, viewed message components more often and longer than women. These findings suggest that when message recipients for whom a message is self-relevant view health messages, they may attend primarily to a subset of components that not necessarily convey the full message.",Antialcohol Messages,Health Communication

A 2 (beverage type) x 2 (brand familiarity) x 3 (message repetition) mixed factorial experiment (N = 143) investigated the effects of exposure to alcohol advertising messages on Facebook on attitudes toward the ad and the brand, as well as viral behavioral intentions, intentions to consume alcohol, and behavior (gift card choice: local bar vs. local coffee shop). The study showed that while those exposed to water ads reported more favorable attitudes toward the ad and the brand than those exposed to beer ads, those exposed to beer ads expressed greater intentions to consume alcohol and were twice as likely to select a bar than a coffee shop gift card. Findings are discussed within the framework of persuasion and priming theories, and practical and policy implications are outlined.",Antialcohol Messages,Health Communication
2015-0640,2015,Paper Session,The Effects of Textual Consequences and Instructions on Alcohol Warning Labels.,3,"Aims. One way of raising awareness of the risks of alcohol use is by means of alcohol warning labels. The main purpose of this study is to explore how the warning label should be designed and, specifically, the added value of including consequences and instructions on warning labels.
Methods. Two experimental studies in different contexts (‘drunk driving’ and ‘general health’) were conducted. In these studies, 254 young adults were exposed to a warning label and completed an online questionnaire.
Findings. We found a main effect, including the consequences of drinking and driving, on the intention not to drink and drive. In addition, communicating the consequences on the label positively affected the reliability of the warning labels. This finding was consistent in both studies.
Conclusions. Although our respondents were only confronted with a specific warning label once, effects of the design of the labels were observed. These findings indicate that (i) alcohol warning labels are effective, and (ii) it matters how the label is designed.",Antialcohol Messages,Health Communication
2015-0641,2015,Paper Session,"Linking Alcohol Advertising and Underage Drinking: Triangulating Content Analysis, Youth Survey, and Market Exposure Data",3,"Although youth exposure to television alcohol advertisements has been shown to influence youth drinking behaviors, the underlying relationship has remained uncertain. We tested the joint influence of exposure and primarily youthful content appeal (PYCA) on underage drinking, triangulating data from a content analysis, a survey of youth brand-specific consumption, and market exposure data. PYCA was positively associated with youth consumption, β = .15, p < .001, and negatively with adult consumption, β = -.15, p < .001. Within brands popular among youth, exposure was negatively associated with youth consumption, β = -.14, p < .001. Among less popular brands, exposure was positively associated with youth consumption, β = .39, p < .01, and there was an interaction effect such that PYCA strengthened the effect of exposure on consumption. The joint influence of content and exposure must be considered in order to reduce the influence of alcohol advertising on underage drinking.",Antialcohol Messages,Health Communication
2015-0642,2015,Paper Session,What Do Students Talk About When They Talk About Alcohol: Conversational Topics and Alcohol Consumption Predictors,2,"Interpersonal communication (e.g., whether and how positively people talk) about alcohol has been shown to affect alcohol consumption, yet evidence is scarce about the content and valence of alcohol-related conversations and how these concepts relate to alcohol consumption predictors. By employing a correlational design among students (N = 133), this study measured alcohol consumption predictors and conversational valence and occurrence regarding three topics (i.e., personal alcohol-related experiences, alcohol-related experiences of others, and alcohol-related media messages). Results showed that people talk more often about alcohol-related experiences than about alcohol-related media messages. Furthermore, personal alcohol-related experiences are more positively discussed than others' experiences or alcohol-related media messages. Whether and how positively people talk about alcohol-related experiences was related to several alcohol consumption determinants; however, talking about media messages was generally unrelated to alcohol consumption predictors. Thus, health promotion attempts should elicit negative conversations about alcohol-related experiences (and not necessarily about media messages).",Antialcohol Messages,Health Communication

Past research looking at the pros and cons of subtitling and dubbing has investigated issues of valid language translation, issues of cultural reference transference, and the benefits of subtitling for foreign language learning. Based on previous research (e.g., Wissmath, Weibel, & Groner, 2009), this study queried whether recall and enjoyment outcomes differ between subtitled and dubbed versions of the same moving image content. Results show no superiority of one version over the other in simple outcomes; however, several significant interactions demonstrate the moderating impact of intercultural experience constructs. Specifically, those spectators with family foreign language experience have higher visual and dialogue recall outcomes with subtitling, and those with greater overall intercultural exposure report greater enjoyment with subtitling.",Intercultural Communication and Media: Bridging the Research Divide,Intercultural Communication

2015-0645,2015,Paper Session,Model Minority Stereotypic Representations in South Asian Indian American Marital Newspaper Advertisements,1,"This paper critically examines discursive patterns South Asian Indian Americans (SAIA) use when searching for the ideal mate via matrimonial ads. I collected 278 ads published in 2014 in an online newspaper, India Abroad, and focused on 29 ads for my analysis. Six themes emerged from Fairclough’s (1992) critical textual analysis that demonstrate how these ads include and exclude particular groups and reproduce gendered hierarchies embedded in the model minority stereotype. These emergent categories represent the multiplicity of intersectional identities and a means through which social hierarchies are constructed in this mate seeking process. The content, producers, and consumers of the marital ads reproduce systems of elitism and classism within the SAIA community. The analysis shows how ad texts continue to marginalise SAIA minorities and other Asian American groups, especially those that do not fit the model minority stereotypes portrayed in India Abroad marital ads.",Intercultural Communication and Media: Bridging the Research Divide,Intercultural Communication

A survey of 7,525 people in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Lebanon, Bahrain, Jordan and the UAE was conducted via face-to-face interviews in all countries except Qatar, where phone interviews were completed, in 2013. The study assessed news and information use, particularly digital information use, and also examined levels of political efficacy, media trust, and attitudes toward free speech, among other cultural and political indicators. Despite the oft-referenced supposition that online activity in the Arab world is associated with political disaffection, results here suggest that online engagement in general—such as sharing photos online, participating in chat rooms, and reading others’ blogs—rather than sociopolitical indicators, is associated with blogging. In none of the countries, for example, was a sense that one’s country was not “on the right track” predictive of blogging. Also, distrust of mainstream news organizations hardly played a role.",Intercultural Communication and Media: Bridging the Research Divide,Intercultural Communication

It also proposes a model to test the mediation effect of interactivity on the linkage between public perception and public engagement. Data from survey questionnaires of 304 undergraduate students from a large southeast U.S. university were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Key findings resolved that positive effects of stakeholders’ perception in satisfaction and negative effects of stakeholders’ perception in trust on their actual online engagement. A strong positive linkage was also demonstrated between stakeholders’ satisfactory perception toward relationship management and their evaluation toward the level of an organization’s online interactive communication.

Previous research has shown that a strong indicator of the effectiveness of public relations is the relationship that exists between an organization and its publics. This study analyzes the different aspects of the relationship and the public relations activities and tactics used to promote and foster relationship development.
Using survey data collected from more than 300 local government officials from municipalities across the United States and over 300 citizens, this research examined the relationship dimensions of control mutuality, trust commitment, and satisfaction. Findings from this coorientation analysis illustrate that the two groups are in disagreement about the relationship.

The impact of the university’s communication strategy on perceptions of authenticity, likelihood of being staunch or hostile publics, reputation, and student publics’ communicative actions for or against the university were examined. Surveys conducted with 611 university students reveal that students are more likely to be staunch supporters of the university when the latter adopts a bridging strategy. These staunch publics were also more likely to evaluate the university’s reputation favorably, and to engage in positive communicative actions about the university. Conversely, hostile publics, those who evaluated their relationships with the university negatively, were more likely to evaluate the university’s reputation unfavorably, and to engage in negative communicative actions. Finally when students see their relationships with the university as exchange relationship, it is more likely for them to engage in negative communicative actions. Practical implications for public relations practitioners, including recommendations about communication practice to encourage more publics to become fans are discussed.",Relationship Management and Outcomes,Public Relations

Using the anthropological perspective on gift giving (Sherry, 2983), this paper developed a theoretical framework of understanding a gift-giving in public relations through: (1) the gift itself; (2) the consequences of gift giving and gift taking actions (or consequences for gift-givers and recipients); and (3) the actors’ own understanding of the gift, action structure, and motives (or the situational conditions). This study reported the results of 31 online surveys and 17 interviews with public relations managers in Vietnam about gift-giving practices in media relations to provide evidence of potential impact of the gift-giving culture on editorial decisions. Findings revealed that viewing gift-giving practices as cultural norms and bribery are two major conflicting approaches to gift giving among public relations practitioners in the country. This study offered theoretical and practical implications of gift-giving practices in public relations that may explain differences in media relations among countries.",Relationship Management and Outcomes,Public Relations
2015-0651,2015,Paper Session,Stakeholder Engagement and Conflict Resolution in the Global Environment: Strategies and Outcomes,4,"This study creates a theoretical model that links stakeholder engagement strategies to critical relational and conflict resolution outcomes. The model proposes that multinational companies’ (MNCs’) positive relationship cultivation and public relations strategies enhance local community members’ anxiety and uncertainty management (AUM) and the organization-public relationships (OPRs), which in turn, influence these community members’ conflict resolution strategies. A survey was conducted among 300 local community members in Cajamarca, Peru, where MNCs operate. Results indicate that among engagement strategies, assurance of legitimacy, symmetrical communication, and two-way communication were most essential in promoting OPRs. Assurance of legitimacy, openness, access, and symmetrical communication facilitated AUM. Among the proposed mediators, uncertainty reduction played a central role, enhancing OPRs and integrative conflict resolutions and decreasing distributive conflict resolutions; anxiety reduction decreased distributive resolutions; but OPRs were not significant mediators. Finally, interpersonal relationships promoted nonconfrontational resolutions, but the model explained little in the third-party conflict resolutions.",Relationship Management and Outcomes,Public Relations

In our research, we are interested in an experience-based model of digital labor and the nonmonetary benefits derived from such activities. Based on a survey of 701 laborers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we demonstrate that experiences during digital labor sequences generate flow-like states of immersion. We show that reaching flow-like states while performing microwork depends on certain work characteristics, such as the particular worker’s degree of autonomy, the extent to which worker’s skills are utilized, and the apparent significance of the task. The results both highlight the importance of flow-like immersion in explaining why individuals engage in digital labor projects and point to avenues that can lead to the design of better digital work experiences.",Digital Work Processes,Communication and Technology

Our study showed that mobile phones were a key communication tool in that company. Voice call was the most preferable way of mobile phone use because of its synchronous nature for instant communication and the rich verbal cues it carries. Text messaging was an unobtrusive way of business communication and it could be used as the formal documentation of business decisions.

Professional informational benefits are conceptualized as the (timely) access to relevant information and being referred to career opportunities. The effect of structure and content of the respective online network on professional informational benefits was examined on the general (users vs. non-users) and more fine-grained level (users of a specific platform). Overall, users of business networks and microblogging services reported higher informational benefits than non-users, whereas the Facebook users reported lower informational benefits.

This paper examines examples of crossing in which the speaker performs and quotes during crossing, seemingly enacting the identity of a person in that speech community (not only referencing a cultural style). Based on a discourse analysis of more than 35 hours of audio and video-recordings of naturally-occurring talk between friends and friendly acquaintances, the analysis proposes that this sort of crossing serves to construct cultural assumptions of personhood. By examining the interactional space where crossing and quoting intersects, this paper highlights some ways in which cultural “others” are constructed, categorized, differentiated, and assessed in ordinary conversation.","Constructing Identities in Online Interactions, Face-to-Face Encounters, and Music Lyrics",Language & Social Interaction

Some of these value-laden, provocative identity labels were initially perceived as vulgar, yet soon gained momentum online. Internet popularity of the identity labels was later translated to offline communication, whereby people use them in daily life. I conducted ten in-depth interviews with Chinese graduate students at Duke University to answer the following three questions. 1) How do they communicate using these new identity labels both online and offline? 2) How do they perceive the use of these newly created vocabularies contextualized in the changing society of China? The paper maintains that through communication, namely, the creation and dissemination of the identity labels from online to offline, younger Chinese generation buys into the domination of hegemonic consumerism social values, and accepts the perceived social injustice.","Constructing Identities in Online Interactions, Face-to-Face Encounters, and Music Lyrics",Language & Social Interaction

In this exploratory analysis, the codeswitching between Han varieties among Chinese popular music lyrics has been studied. This analysis examines the discourse functions of codeswitching and their interaction with the larger sociocultural context in Contemporary China. The dynamic relations between language choice, identity and linguistic ideology have also been shown in the analysis: Musicians use codeswitching to perform a collective multilingual identity, to reproduce a linguistic power relation in a story, and to make self-mockery on one’s own linguistic identity. Following previous studies on codeswitching in lyrics, this analysis further exposes the weakness of drawing simple causation from identity to language choice. Instead, the performance of a multilingual identity serves as a differentiation device (Irvine, 2001) opposing the Mandarin hegemony in popular culture, rather than as an authentication device of any single language.","Constructing Identities in Online Interactions, Face-to-Face Encounters, and Music Lyrics",Language & Social Interaction

2015-0660,2015,Paper Session,Toward a Historical Understanding of the Media Event,1,"The paper argues that the historical dimension of media events has been underestimated in the predominantly Anglo-American tradition of media event research. This tradition tends to concentrate on how the affordances of recent media technologies promote a sense of the eventful, the main case being televisual liveness. Its historical horizon is limited to the time of broadcasting and digital media. As recent research particularly from Germany has showed, however, the history of media events stretches much further back and vitally involves a host of media technologies prior to broadcasting. The paper outlines three ways a deeper understanding of media event history may advance research: Firstly, it expands our understanding of temporality in media events. Second, it enables a closer attention to key connections between mediated and interpersonal forms of communication.

The present paper critically engages with the concept of cosmopolitan memory and provides an empirical contribution to the relevant debate drawing upon a study of focus group discussions with Greek audiences talking about global disasters and their memories of them. The paper argues that these memories place audience members within a global community of viewers simultaneously witnessing the same events. However, it is only rarely that they express a self-reflective negotiation of the nation as a moral community and nation-transcending identifications with distant others. As such, the mediated experience of global disasters contributes to the construction of a global audience but lacks the moral dimension implicit in the concept of cosmopolitan memory.","Reconsidering Mediation and Media Events: Memory, Religion, and Social Drama","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0662,2015,Paper Session,The Implication of Technology in Mediatization and Mediation Approaches to Religious Studies,1,"This paper investigates the groundwork upon which the concepts of mediatization and mediation were erected, focusing on the very definition of what media-technology is. These concepts frame the conversation among scholars in the study of religion and media. However, despite the fact that the two keywords share the same root, media, they are understood as incompatible with one another. On the one hand, mediatization is broadly defined as a historical shift in which the logic of mass media transforms traditional forms of religion, subsuming them under the imperative of the modern marketplace. On the other hand, scholars studying the mediation of religion affirm that media have always shaped and transformed religious practices. This investigation argues that the controversy between the two modes of analysis does not consist of whether or to what extent media technology affects or transforms religion. Rather, the conflict arises from how media technology is defined.","Reconsidering Mediation and Media Events: Memory, Religion, and Social Drama","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0663,2015,Paper Session,Managing Conflicts Through Social Dramas in Unsettled Times and Media’s Construction of Injustice,1,"Social drama's ambiguous role of in conflict resolution makes it fascinating to study, particularly for societies going through unsettled times.
This article interrogates the dynamic tension between the informative (professional) and performative (populist) modes of media through furthering the concept of “mediated social drama.” This concept has been used to study a variety of social happenings, resulting in a conceptual mist that demands clarification. The article first summarizes the definition and the key composing elements of a mediated social drama. It then outlines a typology of social dramas, including “moral outrage/moral tale” and “social injustice/political showdown” discusses their relationship to a neighboring concept of “social problem”. Further, it discusses the problems and pitfalls when we apply the social drama concept in analyzing social conflicts (e.g. contentious crime dramas) in a society going through rapid changes, using China as a case. It draws particular attention to the likelihood of “populist social dramas,” in which news media compromise its informational function and are beholden to explicit performance, often as a result of capitulating to public opinion. It also discusses the implications of such populist social drama for redress institutions of a society.","Reconsidering Mediation and Media Events: Memory, Religion, and Social Drama","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0664,2015,Paper Session,Leading With the Head: How NBC’s Football Night America Framed Football’s Concussion Crisis,2,"The 2013 National Football League season opened with the sport’s concussion crisis high on the media agenda. The league had just settled a lawsuit with former players, changed on-field rules and pressured a broadcast partner to withdraw about the league’s actions related to brain damage suffered by former players. Yet most media outlets that focus on football also have financial arrangements with the NFL based on broadcast rights, shaping perceptions of the sport. This qualitative content analysis of NBC’s Football Night in America, primarily a highlight show, found that the broadcast framed head injuries episodically and largely ignored the issue. The broadcasts rarely highlighted repeated concussions in individual players, although emphasized when specific players repeatedly broke the rules. They also treated rule changes negatively, focusing on the ways they damaged the game. These framing practices protect the NFL’s reputation and cultural position, defining the parameters of discourse about football.",Sports Journalists and Sports Journalism: Producers and Content,Sports Communication

Conservation of Resource Theory tells us that workers will acquire and retain valued resources so they can tap into those reserves in times of stress, and continue to produce good work. (Hobfoll, 1989). In this study, job satisfaction and organizational support were in ample supply as sports journalists (n = 201) are experiencing only average rates of burnout.

An analysis of digital-only sports media reveals how the formation of a counter-public sphere created an opportunity for digital-only sports journalists to have a say in what is professional. Rather than dismissing journalistic boundaries of traditional sports journalists as archaic, digital-only sports journalists embraced the boundaries to show how their own journalistic authority exceeded that of traditional journalists.",Sports Journalists and Sports Journalism: Producers and Content,Sports Communication

First, it demonstrates how the history of ideas about communication are archived in the law, and thus attain an instrumental influence. Second, it shows how the history of thought about public opinion traced in film regulation was also a history of emotional norms, showing how the very objects and outcomes of communication study were related to changes in the normative conceptions of emotion and rationality. Two important legal decisions governing film regulation—in 1915, that film was not governed by free speech law and in 1952 that film— are analyzed. The decisions reveal much more than whether the Court thought that film was a form of political communication. They show how conceptions of public opinion shifted over this brief span and how these conceptions reflected different normative visions of communication and emotion.","Historicizing Feeling: Affect, Emotion, and the Making of Communication",Communication History

Utilizing the Payne Fund Papers at the Western Reserve Historical Society, I analyze the rhetoric of the PFMPS researchers. I argue the researchers of the PFMPS constructed both of their subjects, children and film, as metaphorically the same. This enabled the PFNPS to make a set of arguments: children and film are both problems to be solved; the future of the nation is at stake; and that regulation is a moral issue. These arguments are based off of a rhetorical mode I term the “biological sublime.”","Historicizing Feeling: Affect, Emotion, and the Making of Communication",Communication History

The general view holds that office interiors were modernized due to a societal shift to information work and changes in the exterior of office buildings. However, a close examination of two iconic designers, Florence Knoll and Robert Propst, illustrates the popularization of modern office interiors was not teleological - the designers had to expand considerable effort to convince clients accustomed to other designs that modernism was superior. To get clients to like their designs, they needed to transform a sales pitch into something visceral. Therefore, affective communicate techniques like showrooms, textile designs and information seminars were crucial to the uptake of modern office interiors. Furthermore, the difference in gender of the designers guided the different affective techniques used.","Historicizing Feeling: Affect, Emotion, and the Making of Communication",Communication History
2015-0670,2015,Paper Session,The Intimate Space of Written Words: The Paradox of Privacy and Publicity in Love Letters,1,"Love letters are often romanticized to be the most private and authentic genre of communication despite the artificiality of writing and the possibility of eavesdropping. The exposure of love letters to unintended eyes and the anticipation of unintended disclosure have been fairly common throughout the history. However, researchers and cultural critics have yet to fully grasp this aspect of love letters. This paper examines love letters as a space- and time-binding medium and investigates the relationship between the channel and the genre. It argues that letter writing entails the paradox of privacy and publicity, and that lovers have to cope with the paradox and with the consequences of information leakage especially when societies define love against their favor. The material conditions of letter writing and the social regulation of love interact to shape lovers’ experiences of letter writing and inform the generic features of love letters.","Historicizing Feeling: Affect, Emotion, and the Making of Communication",Communication History
2015-0671,2015,Paper Session,Dissolving Innovation in Meltwater: An Attack on Online Search,1,"With the exponential increases in online information, internet search engines have helped fill a substantial and growing need for the capacity to sort through and manage data. These search engines depend on leeway under copyright law to be able to provide these services; in the U.S., that has primarily been accommodated under the doctrine of fair use. A 2013 decision, Associated Press v. Meltwater, effectively limits this breathing room. Of particular concern, the court artificially constrains which services qualify as search engines, and the ruling provides undue protection for works with thin claims of expressive creativity. This paper offers a detailed critique of the Meltwater court’s fair use analysis and a discussion of the ruling’s broader context and significance.","Search, Use, and Compliance in Online Environments",Communication Law & Policy
2015-0672,2015,Paper Session,Who Should Speak? Twitter's User Policy Enforcement,2,"Scholarly debate around social media and free speech has evolved around two dominant themes: the role of social media platforms in enabling political speech and dissent; and the role of governments in blocking and censoring content on social media platforms. Decidedly less attention has been paid to the role that social media companies play in enabling or restricting free expression and global information flow by their user policies. To fill that gap, this paper studies how Twitter, a social media platform recognized as a mobilizing tool, enacts its user policy when censoring speech, and the economic and political implications of the censorship. Taking a case study approach, this paper analyzes a number of high profile censorship instances on Twitter, to find out to what extent the company follows its user policies and commitments to free expression when enforcing censorship. Findings of this study indicate that Twitter’s user policy is enacted in an inconsistent manner, and that often economic incentives and political pressure take precedence over values of free expression.","Search, Use, and Compliance in Online Environments",Communication Law & Policy

These provisions require bloggers to explicitly disclose any advertising or influences from advertisers in their blog posts. With a content analysis of 200 blog posts of the 40 most popular blogs in the US and the Netherlands, we systematically assessed the relevance of these regulations, and whether and how bloggers comply with them. Results showed that 65% of the blog posts mentioned brands and product names, suggesting that the disclosure regulations are relevant. The discrepancy between the mentioning of brands and the provision of disclosures (22% of branded blogs), revealed that compliance with the regulations is low. Additionally, the manner of disclosing advertising is often not as prescribed in the regulations. These findings have important implications for advertisers, bloggers and regulators, as well as for further research regarding the effectiveness of blog advertising disclosures.","Search, Use, and Compliance in Online Environments",Communication Law & Policy

In the U.S., Latino/a youth are at the highest sexual risks. The present study investigated the process of sexual decision-making among Latino/a couples who watched an entertainment-education intervention East Los High, addressing sexuality concerns among Latino/a youth. Fifteen Latino/a unmarried couples between ages 18-24 participated in this study.
Sexual encounters portrayed in ELH were analyzed from the viewpoint of female decision-making and male responsibility. Female agency, women’s negotiation skills and their mental resilience seemed to affect female sexual decision-making. Male responsibility manifested in using protection (or condoms), providing care and support for their female partner, and maintaining healthy interpersonal communication. Viewing ELH heightened a sense of vulnerability and efficacy among couples. The couples collectively generated creative ways to be sexually responsible by being playful in bed, delaying sexual activity, and using tricky turn offs.","Sexual Health, Choices, and Violence Prevention",Health Communication
2015-0676,2015,Paper Session,Modeling the Message-Processing Mechanisms of Tailoring in a Web-Based STD Screening Intervention,6,"Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of tailoring for promoting health behavior but few have examined how tailoring works.
Purpose: Explore the mechanisms of tailoring within the context of an intervention promoting sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing called RU@Risk.
Methods: College students (N=1300) completed a pre-test, were randomly assigned to explore a tailored or non-tailored website, and completed a post-test where they could order a free at-home STD test kit. Hypothesized mechanisms of tailoring (perceived personal relevance, attention, and elaboration) were examined using structural equation modeling.
Results: Exposure to the tailored (vs. non-tailored) website increased perceived relevance, attention to and elaboration of the message. These effects in turn resulted in greater perceived risk to STDs and intentions to get tested. Participants in the tailored condition were also more likely to order a test kit.
Conclusions: Findings provide insight into the mechanisms of tailoring with implications for optimizing message design.","Sexual Health, Choices, and Violence Prevention",Health Communication

Reaching audiences through bystander prevention campaigns is in particular challenging since health consequences do not refer to the self but to a third person involved in partner violence. In two experimental studies, type of argument used, type of violence and testimonial perspective are assessed to moderate testimonial-based persuasion effects, while transportation and reactance are tested as mediators. Results of both studies show that testimonials were effective in increasing relevance perceptions of bystanders, but only when transportation was experiences. Conditional regression analysis revealed perspective used and type of violence have a significant influence on relevance perception.","Sexual Health, Choices, and Violence Prevention",Health Communication

Due to the continued reliance on parents for support that is inherent with emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2004), emerging adults (EAs) may need to disclose an STI status to their parents. This study applies the relationships within the health disclosure decision-making model (DD-MM; Greene, 2009) to extend our understanding disclosing sensitive health information to parents. College students (N = 204) were asked about their relational quality with their parents, family communication patterns, willingness to disclose a hypothetical STI diagnosis, and the perceived stigma surrounding STIs. Structural equation modeling demonstrated some important mediation effects of family communication patterns with relational quality, illness assessment, and disclosure. Further explanation of these results and possible implications of the study are discussed.","Sexual Health, Choices, and Violence Prevention",Health Communication

However, there is limited empirical examination from the user perspective of the functions that social media play and the factors that explain such uses. In this study we examine Twitter use during and after Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines. The results showed that different stakeholders used social media mostly for dissemination of second-hand information, in coordinating relief efforts, and in memorializing those affected. We also explore how internal and external factors such as geography, time, type of user, and social media engagement predict the type of use during the crisis.

2015-0682,2015,Paper Session,In-Group Membership and the Linguistic Intergroup Bias: Exploring the Role of Ethnic Identification,1,"Previous studies found evidence for the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) between opposing binary groups characterized by ethnic, linguistic, geographic, and issue differences. This study conducted two experiments to examine the possibility that level of commitment to an ethnic identity within a homogenous group (i.e. citizens in Hong Kong) can also elicit LIB. Study 1 showed that high identifiers to a ‘Hongkonger’ identity will use more abstract expressions to describe the negative actions and concrete expressions to describe the positive actions of the Mainland Chinese; whereas identifiers to a ‘Chinese identity’ showed the reverse pattern. Moreover, study 2 showed that under conditions of out-group threat, high identifiers to a ‘Chinese’ identity were more likely to agree to abstract positive statements about the Mainland Chinese while high identifiers to a ‘Hong Kong’ identity agreed less. These findings suggest that LIB occurs not only in intergroup contexts, but also has an intragroup dimension, particularly in postcolonial societies like Hong Kong where ethnic identity has become a recurring issue since the reversion of sovereignty to China.",Race and Ethnicity Across Asia,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

One distinguishing characteristic of this matrilineal society is Zou Hun, translated as “walking marriage.” This ritualistic marriage practice generally indicates the Mosuo woman receiving her male lover at her residence in the evening and the man returning to his own house in the morning. Mosuo women are the ones who decide who may stay overnight. The Mosuo walking marriage ritual has become highly materialized and commercialized as a sexual and exotic attraction for tourists. Following by the rapid growth of Web 2.0 in China, the online discourses about walking marriage and Mosuo rituals have gained social interactions among the mass online users. By engaging critical theory of the bodies, we used critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine the vernacular discourses of Mosuo walking marriage on the Chinese micro-blog—Weibo. Weibo, also called Chinese micro-blog or twitter, gained popularity in 2009, which has more than 300 million users and became the leading media platform in China. Four major themes were identified among the posts (n=493): bodies as commodity, romanticization of indigenous culture, normalization of ritualistic bodies, and patriarchy reinforcement.

2015-0686,2015,Paper Session,Cultural Differences in Perception of Family Obligation and Request Compliance in China and the US,2,"Early theorists claimed perception of obligation as aversive is a pancultural universal. This study investigates whether obligation is seen as aversive or benevolent by participants in China (n = 205) and the U.S. (n = 164). Compared to Chinese, Americans showed greater benevolent and less aversive perception when the level of obligation is high. Benevolent obligation perception mediated the impact of gratitude and reciprocity on compliance, which are also negatively related to the aversive obligation perception. Participants who perceived obligation as aversive showed less compliance whereas those who saw obligation as benevolent showed more compliance. Both groups complied with the request for high obligation, but only Chinese showed more compliance in the low obligation condition compared to Americans. These results suggest that obligation is not seen as universally aversive.

Employing Hayes’ (2014) process for testing moderated mediation models using conditional process analysis, we found that femininity mediates the influence of sex on both emotional and instrumental coping and the mediation effects were significantly different between American participants and Chinese participants. We also found that national culture moderated the influence of sex on coping strategies when gender role orientation being held constant. In addition, we found that compared to American men, Chinese men score significantly lower on masculinity. This study adopts an integrated model of sex, gender role orientation, culture, and coping.

Taking an issues management perspective, I argue that one of the reasons that universities have struggled with addressing issues of like sexual assault is because conceptualizations of emotion and gender within issues management, as with public relations more broadly, are largely currently absent. Because of this, although the management function of public relations can be enacted at universities around rational issues, emotional, often gendered, issues are poorly conceived and haphazardly dealt with to avoid media scrutiny rather than appropriately managing the root causes. Using dialogue as a launching point, this essay offers suggestions of how to re-conceptualize issues management to more fully consider emotions and gendered issues within this approach as a way to add more flexibility and utility to the concept.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Based on considerations on processes of mediatization in organizational contexts we assume that media orientations within an organization may affect an organization’s communication strategies. More specifically, we discern communication strategies of bridging and buffering. A survey among 114 Dutch communication professionals working for for-profit and public organizations as well as NGOs was conducted. Strategies of bridging and buffering showed different relationships to dimensions of media orientation. While bridging strategies were guided by strategic media orientations, buffering strategies were more strongly related to media attention seeking and hostile media perceptions.

2015-0696,2015,Paper Session,Great Minds Think Alike: Proposed Model of Schema Resonance for Customer-Organization Information Inquiry e-Service Communication,1,"This study proposes a new customer-organization e-service communication strategy model—the Schema Resonance Model—to better understand how an organization representative can provide effective, efficient, and satisfactory e-service via the one-to-one online communication to respond to the customer’s information inquiries. The present study describes the theory and concepts applied in the model, and it explicates the cognition processes involved in the model. The Schema Resonance Model explains how schemas link the senseproducing process of the organization representative and the sensemaking process of the customer and explicates how schema resonance can be achieved. The occurrence of schema resonance in the customer-organization information inquiry e-service can have positive effects on the communication effectiveness, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2015-0700,2015,Paper Session,Cultural and Global Perspectives in International Public Relations: Stakeholder Management in the Sino Chilean Case Study,2,"There is still debate on the role played by culture on International Public Relations (PR), and whether a global model of may apply to any culture. This article aims to enrich this debate by presenting an empirical case study: Chilean firms´ Public Relations (PR) strategies towards their Chinese publics and the dual dimension -global and cultural- of their practice. Using a mixed methodology, this study presents interesting findings on the practice of international public relations, and specifically, stakeholder management. On the one hand, Chilean companies have mostly developed a global approach, insofar they lack tailored strategies towards their Chinese publics and, by doing so, assuming Chinese stakeholders as “global public”. On the other, the actual practice of stakeholder management -through their firm's executives- is carried out by placing culture as critical for successful stakeholder management. Specifically, Chilean executives use guanxi as the main driver of their relationship management.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The findings showed that mothers of children with temperamental problems and mothers who felt depressed were more likely to use television to soothe their children. Also, children with more temperamental problems watched more television. A significant two-way interaction indicated that children with temperamental problems whose mothers had mental distress watched more television than children with temperamental problems whose mothers did not have mental distress. This study emphasizes the importance of considering both child characteristics and maternal characteristics to understand why some children watch more television than others.",Media and the Family,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0702,2015,Paper Session,Television Exposure and Neuropsychological Function among Infants: The Role of Maternal Employment,2,"We examined whether various forms of television viewing were related to infants' executive function (EF) and their declarative pointing behaviors, two indicators of neuropsychological function. We also explored whether and how these relations varied according to whether mothers worked outside of the home or not. With a national sample of 405 mothers of 12-18-month-old children, we found that maternal employment was related to infants' increased television viewing time, with increased exposure to commercial television predicting EF difficulty. In addition, television viewing was related to more EF difficulty among infants of employed mothers. In some cases, the results only held when employed mothers also had less income or less education. Most analyses involving declarative pointing were not significant. We discuss the possibility that maternal employment is particularly potent in shaping infants' television habits and outcomes and encourage continued work in this area to understand why.",Media and the Family,Children Adolescents and the Media

Two-wave multi-group cross-lagged analyses provided evidence for reciprocal patterns that depend on the level of maternal stress. The findings indicated that mothers’ attitudes toward television predicted children’s subsequent television viewing among non-stressed mothers, but not among stressed mothers. Children’s television viewing predicted mothers’ subsequent negative attitudes toward television among stressed mothers, but not among non-stressed mothers. Implications for the role of parents’ attitudes regarding children’s television viewing are discussed.",Media and the Family,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-0704,2015,Paper Session,Media and the Modern Family: The Influence of Family Structure on Enjoyment and Use of Family Media Activities,3,"Media dependency theory suggests that societal structure and social relationships have a major influence on media use. Recent data suggest that 30% of all households with children are single-parent households (U.S. Census, 2012), yet much of the existing research on families looks solely at two-parent families and rarely is media use studied as a function of family type. This study utilized a nationally representative survey of 2,326 parents of children 0 to 8 years old to understand the impact of family structure (widowed/never married, divorced/separated, or married/living together) on enjoyment of media and family media activities. Results indicate that single parent households use media with children differently than two-person households. Further, widowed/never married parents differ from divorced/separated parents in the amount of background TV use and their enjoyment of watching TV together with their children. These results are discussed with regard to the effects they may have on child development.",Media and the Family,Children Adolescents and the Media

In particular, this papers seeks to understand how the development of a positive ingroup identity helps to form and shape a counterpublic as embodied through a grassroots organization. By understanding counterpublic theory through intergroup communication theories, greater depth can be added to understanding identity creation and how members of a counterpublic shape and understand that identity within a group, and what functions of social identity are salient. Practical implications are also discussed for thinking about how organizational structure can influence member involvement and identity, particularly for a women’s organization.","Identity and Identification in Groups, Organizations, and Professions",Organizational Communication

Here, we examine the role of inter-professional communication—communication between physicians and other healthcare providers—in fostering professional identification. Survey results from physicians showed the unique role that mutual support plays in strengthening healthcare providers’ professional identities. This study contributes to the current communicative-based identification literature by looking beyond formal socialization practices to show how day-to-day interactions influence physicians’ identity. In addition to expanding theory, this research also adds to practice by demonstrating the need to train physicians on the importance of communication with other healthcare providers.","Identity and Identification in Groups, Organizations, and Professions",Organizational Communication
2015-0707,2015,Paper Session,Who is This “We”? Examining the Development of Identification and Conflict in Global Teams Through Talk,4,"Constitutive views regard global teams as constituted through communication, but prior research has rarely examined actual communicative practices of team members and how they construct team processes such as identification and conflict. We draw on email communications of members of two global project teams over the duration of the project to examine the language used to construct team and subgroup identification and conflict over time. Using LIWC software, thematic analysis and in-context verification to analyze a corpus of 839 emails, we found that communication plays an important role in how team identification and conflict play out in global teams. Our findings reveal that communicative behaviors that build team identification help to manage conflict, while construction of subgroup identification enflames conflict. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications for conflict management in global teams.

2015-0708,2015,Paper Session,Yin and Yang of Team and Organizational Identity in Team Functioning: The Attachment Instrumentality Hypothesis,4,"The bonds employees form with their work teams and organizations have a profound effect on their experience of work. Although prior research supports the idea that team attachment is more impactful to team functioning than organizational attachment (due to the notion of multilevel homology), clearly the embedding context of a team within the organization plays an important role in shaping the experience of what individuals think, feel, and do as they work in teams. We advance and meta-analytically test an attachment instrumentality hypothesis that better explains the unique roles of team and organizational identity to team functioning than does the multilevel homology. The core idea is that whereas identification with the team is the dominant attachment foci reciprocating with experienced team states (e.g., efficacy and affect), that behavior and performance, because of their instrumentality to the organization, are uniquely affected by both identification with the team and the organization. We test this attachment instrumentality hypothesis using meta-analytic data obtained from 78 independent studies (total N = 25,063) on team and organizational identity, and find support for this hypothesis. Team identity explains the lion’s share of variance in team affect and efficacy perceptions, but both team and organizational identity uniquely affect extra-role behavior and team performance.","Identity and Identification in Groups, Organizations, and Professions",Organizational Communication

The current study found that consumers considered a review helpful if it offered prominent cues (e.g., identifiable sentences or paragraphs clearly labeled as “summary,” “conclusion,” and/or “pros and cons,” use of photo, video and bullet points). These cues help consumers determine, at a glance, what kinds of information are available in a review; they allow consumers to direct their attention to specific parts of the review pertinent to them, to save time and effort in locating product-related information. In determining whether a reviewer is providing helpful information, consumers also tend to view the review depth, such as how long the review is (e.g., word count), how many paragraphs comprise the review, and/or how many pros and cons are cited.",Effects of User-Generated Online Comments and Reviews,Communication and Technology

This paper examines how perceived reviewer credibility is influenced by textual errors in the online review. Experimental results indicate that consumers’ reaction to textual errors is moderated by their general trust in others. Low-trust consumers are relatively insensitive to textual errors in judging reviewer trustworthiness. However, high-trust consumers are less forgiving of typographical errors (which may signal carelessness) than spelling errors (which may indicate cognitive challenges).

User-generated comments were classified as either a top-rated reader comment or a collection of non-rated other comments. Results indicate the top-rated comment was not a significant influence despite being perceived as the most influential comment. Instead, the other comments significantly influenced online news readers’ opinions about the news article topic and perceived public opinion. Additionally, the study found that the influence of other comments was mediated via perceived public opinion climate. Backing up the spiral of silence theory, the findings suggest that the dynamics of online news environments attenuate the influence of opinion leaders, whereas the aggregate other comments became more significant information sources for readers to judge a given issue.",Effects of User-Generated Online Comments and Reviews,Communication and Technology
2015-0713,2015,Paper Session,Transgressing Trans Issues: Why Glee's Kurt Hummel is its True Transgendered Character,1,"Gay and lesbian TV characters have served numerous purposes and have fueled much research into popular culture, but trans representations are much more rare. This study attempts to fill a gap in LGBTQ scholarship by focusing on a substantive trans character in recent popular culture through a textual analysis of Glee, as well as responses to Wade “Unique” Adams. Literature under consideration here concerns “wrong body” discourses, binary gender, and increased representation. It is argued that, although trans representations are largely problematic, increased visibility of non-conforming gendered performances in popular culture is indicative of ideological developments within the television industry. That said, this research ultimately suggests that the gay lead (Kurt Hummel) is in fact more transgressive of normativity than the “trans” character; while both transgress normative gender roles, Unique reinforces gender as a binary, whereas Kurt demonstrates gender’s fluidity.","Cupcakes, Headphones, and Video Games: Explorations in Media Representations of Gender Roles, Sexual Identities, and Sexual Practices",Popular Communication
2015-0714,2015,Paper Session,“Even the Sex and the City Girls Eat Them!”: A Textual Analysis of DC Cupcakes and Cupcake Girls,1,"As food studies have become incorporated into media studies, discussions of gendered performances on cooking television shows have become popular. Although televised gendered food performances have been studied, limited scholarship exists on shows that combine food preparation with business ownership of restaurants or bakeries. My study, a comparative textual analysis of two seasons of DC Cupcakes and two seasons of Cupcake Girls, seeks to fill that gap, pointing to issues of gender representation that are complicated by taking on dual roles of chef/baker and business owner, as seen through cupcake television. I argue that portrayals of women on cupcake television, along with cupcakes as a cultural phenomenon more generally, promote female infantilization. Furthermore, such shows contribute to obsession with food consumption, and obsession with food preparation, signs of disordered eating typically linked to females. These programs exemplify food and prescriptive eating habits as forms of social control over women.","Cupcakes, Headphones, and Video Games: Explorations in Media Representations of Gender Roles, Sexual Identities, and Sexual Practices",Popular Communication

However, polyamory is currently constructed as a “white” practice. I engage with this contradiction, tracing how polyamory is simultaneously but differentially constructed as both white and non- white. Based on archival research and contemporary popular media, I suggest that the conceptualization of polyamory as white raises the possibility that 20th century forms of consensual non monogamy were created in an act of racialized boundary making with other, abjected forms of non- monogamy.","Cupcakes, Headphones, and Video Games: Explorations in Media Representations of Gender Roles, Sexual Identities, and Sexual Practices",Popular Communication

Also referred to as “jiggle physics” or “breast bounce,” breast physics refer to the animation of a female video game character’s breast in order for it to seem more realistic or more sexually appealing. Given the lack of theoretical and empirical research regarding breast physics, we felt exploratory analysis of breast physics was most beneficial. We chose to perform a textual analysis of video game websites as this allowed us to assess general attitudes toward breast physics and placed breast physics within the narrative of the video game landscape. Analysis reveals that attitudes toward breast physics reflect hypermasculinity, objectification and a patriarchal hierarchy.","Cupcakes, Headphones, and Video Games: Explorations in Media Representations of Gender Roles, Sexual Identities, and Sexual Practices",Popular Communication

After providing a brief overview of some of Barad’s ideas, rooted in empirical experimental physics, I will apply them to a critical reading of the website Headph0ne Phet1sh, a heterosexual fetish community for men devoted to mostly non-sexual images of women wearing headphones. In contrast to potential readings of this site using gendered perspectives from established media and technology theories, I will demonstrate the utility of agential realism as a feminist analytic of mutual interconnected being. In examining Headph0ne Phet1sh, I will argue it usefully focuses on the productiveness of gendering practices in technoculture, suggesting, not what male viewers do to feminine representations, but how femininity is crucially entangled in the becomings of the site’s masculinities.","Cupcakes, Headphones, and Video Games: Explorations in Media Representations of Gender Roles, Sexual Identities, and Sexual Practices",Popular Communication

The digital space of World Pulse, an online media network, was examined, focusing in on a recent digital action campaign aimed to collectively engage the online community around a problem of interest. The organizations’ campaign messages and the content and structure of submissions to phase one of the campaign were analyzed qualitatively using a thematic analysis. The analysis identified three salient affordances of World Pulse’s digital space for transnational feminist organizing, including connecting, voicing, and exchanging. Additionally, this study identified both material and socio-cultural constraints related to participants’ offline realities that shape their abilities to leverage these affordances, drawing attention to the ways members’ are multi-located. Understanding what actions these digital spaces of transnational feminist organizing enable has implications for organizations, activists, and practitioners turning to the web as a ‘space’ for collective organizing and activism.",The Politics of Women's Campaigns and Spaces,Feminist Scholarship

We are interested in the following questions: How is sexism on Twitter discussed? And which alternative publics are created by online feminist protest? Referring to theories of the public sphere which argue for a multiplicity of publics the article explores the role of online feminist protest movements in the construction of alternative meanings and counter-hegemonic voices. Subsequently, it presents findings from a content analysis of a sample of tweets on #aufschrei and of feminist blogs which have reported about #aufschrei. We elaborate that #aufschrei has been successful to raise social awareness in relation to a marginalized topic.

Two episodes of NDTV’s well-known woman journalist Barkha Dutt’s national public affairs television program ""We the People"" (2008 and 2013) tackle the growing problem of commodity colorism in India. My textual analysis of these two episodes of ""We the People"" examines the ways in which Barkha Dutt takes up colorism and creates a flawed but still credible feminist communicative space for debate on the incendiary issues of sexism, racism and colorism on her mainstream television show. I consider the agents, institutions, and social structures she holds accountable in these programs, and I explore the perspectives on anti-colorism and anti-racism that gain visibility or get marginalized in ""We the People""'s televised progressive feminist terrain of democracy and civil society.",The Politics of Women's Campaigns and Spaces,Feminist Scholarship

Examining organizers’ cultural production practices/tactics and the cultural forms they produce, I interrogate why and how the movement has been transformed and translated in relation to other fields, including the global SlutWalk movement, Korean progressive leftist, feminist movements, and mass media. I argue that SlutWalk Korea, or Jabnyon hangjin can be understood as a borderland placed between public and private, between public appeals, political adequacy, and artistic expressions, between global and local, and between sexual and class politics.

The IDEA model emphasizes the need for effective instructional messages during a public health crisis. Effective instructional communication is measured by receiver outcome achievement of affective (perceived value), cognitive (comprehension) and behavioral (performance) variables. This study employs message-testing, incorporating exemplars in tandem with technical instructional information in an experimental group (the exemplar being the case of Thomas Duncan, Liberian national who died as a result of Ebola in Dallas, TX) against an instructional message using only technical information to assess the effectiveness of exemplification with instructional messages, particularly as it taps into internalization (perceived value) and elicits the desired response from message receivers.

A multiple-message experimental design prompted participants (N = 669) to read a message about a CDC CGH initiative, and measured perceptions of agency reputation, support for a global public health mission, and intentions to share information. The narrative message design had indirect effects on the outcomes though perceptions of message features (i.e., story structure, understanding, personal relevance, information overload) and transportation, and narrative messages were more likely to be shared interpersonally and through social media. The study contributes to theory and practice by confirming the mediating role of transportation in the effects of narrative, building on a message features approach to the study of narrative persuasion, and speaking to the challenges of issues management in global public health.","Health Messages, Framing, and Public Behavior",Public Relations

In the context of the increasing association of QSR industry food to the obesity epidemic in the United States, several large fast-food chains have developed elaborate public relations strategies to address the health concerns of their foods. Our frame analysis reveals that the industry consistently draws on metaphors of “individual responsibility” and “personal choice” in choosing healthy food, while establishing the primary role of moderation and exercise in preventing obesity. This strategy echoes the legacies of big tobacco and its negation of responsibility for lung cancer. As a contribution to the field of PR, our emic frame analysis features an integrative approach that combines both message features in context with message intention.","Health Messages, Framing, and Public Behavior",Public Relations

Whether a healthier chain image makes any difference in their responses was studied. The experiment study using stakeholder samples found that a positively perceived CSR motive engendered favorable behavioral intentions. For an ordinal fast-food restaurant, generic social issue-related CSR programs elicited more positive perception of CSR motives, supportive word of mouth intent and investment intent.

This study considered social support and OPR as important factors affecting publics’ health behavior intentions such as revisiting health care providers, Word-Of-Mouth (WOM) behaviors, prevention behaviors, and treatment behaviors. Three research hypotheses guided this study. First, this study examined the direct influence of social support on health behavior intentions. Second, this study examined the direct influence of OPR on health behavior intentions. Lastly, this study examined whether OPR moderates the relationship between social support and publics’ health behavior intentions.
A survey of 301 students examined how they perceive their social support and relationship with their health care organization. By conducting an online survey with students at University of Florida, the study revalidated the influence of social support on publics’ health behavior intentions. This study also found that OPR positively impacts publics’ health behavior intentions. The strong association between OPR and health behavior intentions suggests that OPR may be an important variable that health communication practitioners and scholars should consider as potentially important in understanding patients’ health behavior intentions.

2015-0728,2015,Paper Session,An Empirical Test of the Academic Dependency Theory: Using the Field of Communication as an Example,1,"The inequality of academic development around the world calls for theoretical and empirical studies in this aspect. Based on the academic dependency theory, this study argues that international interaction is a key to understanding inequality between nations. Specifically, it elaborates on the asymmetric interaction implied by the theory, and predicts an unparalleled development and inequalization process of national productivity.
Using the field of communication as an example, the study tests the theory. In the communication field, the reliance on international collaboration, i.e., dependency, has different influences in academia in developed nations and academia in developing nations. For the former, the more a nation relies on international collaboration, the higher is its academic productivity. For the latter, the more a nation relies on international collaboration, the lower is its academic productivity. As a result, global communication research is undergoing a divergence of national research productivity.",Rethinking Development Communciation,Global Communication and Social Change

It brings together different communication approaches, identifying the confluences between global information flow perspectives, macro and micro-level perspectives on development — including development communication — and broader debates about the role of communication in society. To this end, the paper proposes that perspectives on global information flow are consistent with macro-level perspectives on development, and broader views on the role of communication in society.

Interpersonal communication sources trumped the mediated ones as the channels of choice, with case reports pointing to extension agents as women’s preferred information source. Radio was the most frequently mentioned preferred conventional mass medium. More types of information channels were accessed over time, with websites and other mediated sources registering the most dramatic upward shifts.",Rethinking Development Communciation,Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0732,2015,Paper Session,"Muslim Women, 9/11, and the Global World (Dis)Order: A Case Study of Four Malalais",1,"Since the events of 9/11 and the start of the “War on Terror”, debates pertaining to Afghan women’s rights have been reverberating globally. Particularly in the West, Afghan women have been put under the popular culture spotlight, evident in the proliferation of media such as fiction films, television programs, documentaries, books, and news that focus on their plight under repressive Islamic regimes. The resultant media attention has been critiqued by scholars from a variety of disciplines concerned with the overwhelming portrayal of women as victims, without accounting for their actual or potential agency, thereby perpetuating stereotypes of women under Islam that have gained new currency since 9/11.

Yet while this type of media continues to proliferate, little attention has been given to the cultural productions that constitute local gender subjectivities and how local institutions “talk back” to this discourse. In this presentation, I trace and contextualize the trajectory of iconic figures and their role in key historical and contemporary moments of activism and movements of reform in Afghanistan, the region, and beyond. By challenging colonial and neo-imperial interventions as well as local conservative groups, these heroes have been symbolically, literally, and often violently targeted by those same institutions. And yet despite these attempts at erasure including death, their mythic statures continue to be a force to contend with in the popular imagination as symbols of resistance, hope, and courage.",Rethinking Development Communciation,Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0733,2015,Paper Session,Facebook’s Privacy Perception Problem: Unpacking Motivations for Social Media Nonadoption,1,"Use of social network sites (SNSs) has become a part of everyday life for millions of people around the world. Often ignored in SNS research, however, is an analysis of those who choose to abstain from using these sites. This subset of the population is important to analyze to understand individuals’ motivations for (non)-adoption of new technologies and provides insights into theory and practice. The present study provides a multi-method analysis of data from three populations to develop a deeper understanding of individuals’ motivations for non-adoption; furthermore, it evaluates the role that privacy and security play in individuals’ decisions to leave or abstain from Facebook use. Findings include multivariate analyses addressing Facebook adoption and the role that privacy plays in non-adoption, a taxonomy of motivations for non-adoption, and a deeper textual analysis of the privacy-based factors associated with non-adoption.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0734,2015,Paper Session,Influencing Privacy on Social Network Sites: The Role of Contextual Cues and Primes on Privacy Behavior,2,"How do people decide when to disclose their sensitive information on Social Networking Sites (SNSs)? This study posits that information sensitivity, contextual cues, and surveillance primes (i.e., eye primes) that can increase pro-social or contextually appropriate behavior, all differentially affected disclosure behavior on a SNS. Study 1 revealed that participants disclosed less sensitive information, and did so less accurately than non-sensitive information. Participants also followed contextual cues indicating either low or high disclosure rates by others on the site, but eye primes acted to increase pro-social behavior rather than enhancing the influence of contextual cues. Study 2 explored how contextual cues and eye primes affect privacy-setting decisions, and found that contextual cues can increase how strictly participants set their privacy settings, but that eye primes had no effect. Consistent with the privacy paradox, selecting privacy settings before making disclosures on the profile page lead participants to disclose more inappropriate information than when selecting privacy settings after disclosures. This suggests that different kinds of cues can have a profound effect on disclosure behavior and privacy setting behavior on SNSs.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #1,Communication and Technology

However, looking back at the introduction of other technologies into society, the media attention and backlash Glass continues to receive is not surprising. The present study aims at exploring differences and commonalities in user- and media perspectives on Glass in regard to its use in every day (public) life and privacy issues surrounding it. It uses concepts of diffusion and media appropriation as a framework for its analysis. Media reports from three different media outlets (media perspective) and the internal discussion forums of the Google Glass Explorer community (user perspective) were collected and evaluated using qualitative content analysis. The results show extensive discrepancies between how the media reflects on Glass, especially in regard to privacy, and how users describe their personal experiences and concerns.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0736,2015,Paper Session,Lost in Information: Users Expect Collective Privacy Under Conditions of Information Density,3,"Online Social Network users need to have an adequate respresentation of their audience to be aware of the risks of online self-disclosures. We argue that in the absence of specific knowledge about their audiences, users’ own experiences with information overload might lead to specific expectations about their audiences: Under conditions of high information density and large audiences users might expect collective privacy. We conducted two experiments in which we systematically varied both cues, information density and audience size. We hypothesized that users would estimate the probability of a single audience member reading a specific post (Study 1; N = 124) and the proportion of people to read a specific tweet (Study 2; N = 121) lower in the presence of these cues. Results confirmed our hypothesis for information density but not for audience size.

2015-0737,2015,Paper Session,Digital Media and the Diversification of Professionalism: A U.S.-German Comparison of Journalism Cultures,1,"Social media adoption reveals two dynamics in journalism: 1) diversification of professionalism, which is accompanied by a media environment that is increasingly hybrid and 2) corroboration of professionalism, which is connected to tendencies in journalism of normalizing new technologies. This paper is based on ethnographic research on social media adoption and engagement of two groups of political reporters in the US and Germany. Aside from a similar sense of accelerated news cycles, the two press corps had very different adoption experiences. For US reporters, hybridity of traditional and digital journalisms did not only have practical implications but changed their professional self-conception. Even though German reporters use the same digital media (except blogs), they did not nearly have the same impact. This is explained by media systemic factors, particularly different states of the crisis of news media, and distinctive cultural commitments of journalism in Germany and the United States.",Journalistic Professionalism and Professional Roles,Journalism Studies
2015-0738,2015,Paper Session,Managing Conflict of Interest: Shifting Between Political PR and Journalism,1,"When a journalist returns to political reporting after working as a political media adviser it can trigger concern about conflict of interest. Despite this, there is little discussion in the journalism literature about how reporters should manage this type of conflict when it arises. This paper reports on a selection of findings from wider inductive, qualitative research into the under-explored career transition from journalism to political media advising and back again. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted with twenty-one journalists who had moved between the two roles revealed that the media advisers took four main routes back to journalism in an attempt to manage the issue of conflicts of interest: Escape; Being ‘laundered’; Going ‘straight back in’; and, ‘Cooling-off’. Based on these findings, this paper argues that a uniform approach to managing the transition from political advising to journalism could be useful in easing public concern about possible conflicts of interest.",Journalistic Professionalism and Professional Roles,Journalism Studies

Based on a nationwide probability sample of 1760 full-time online journalists from 209 Chinese news websites, the present study is devoted to exploring what constitutes the dimensions of journalistic role perceptions among Chinese online journalists, and how these role conceptions would be influenced by individual-level and aggregate-level factors. The results show that the dimensional structure of online Chinese journalists’ beliefs about the media’s role includes: (1) information disseminator, interpreter, and propagandist; (2) populist mobilizer; (3) entertainment provider and profit seeker.

2015-0740,2015,Paper Session,Journalists’ Professional Identity: A Resource to Cope With Uncertainty?,1,"The Internet, Social Media in particular, brought far-reaching change to journalism, asking journalists’ traditional role concepts into question. In this paper, we introduce Social Identity Theory as an alternative perspective to research journalistic role change, and propose a qualitative approach to study journalists’ professional identity and relate it to their interpretation of change in the newsroom. We interviewed 26 journalists of a daily newspaper and investigated their professional self-concept. We identified a group of elitist journalists who act on tradi-tional role scripts and feel threatened by online journalism and related principles. They see status and quality journalism endangered. A second group of service- and user-oriented jour-nalists strives for the improvement of online journalism but lacks shared values and adapted role scripts. The paper shows the reciprocal interaction between journalists’ activities and professional role concepts and affirms the question, if professional identity can serve as a re-source to cope with uncertainty.",Journalistic Professionalism and Professional Roles,Journalism Studies

How Reading Valenced News Articles Influences Positive Distinctiveness and Learning From News,3,"In a globalized world, news readers are confronted with a vast amount of news on international issues. Based on a study in Germany and the U.S., news readers’ evaluation of their own and the other nation as well as their learning processes while reading news articles were investigated. A 2 (country: U.S. vs. Germany) x 2 (article version: positive valence vs. negative valence) experiment was conducted (N = 364). For both countries, results showed that if participants had read positively valenced news articles they evaluated their own nation and its handling of societal issues better. The influence was stronger for the U. S. and was controlled for collective self-esteem. Also, if positively valenced news articles were read participants were able to remember the content of news articles better. The latter effect only occurred for the German but not for the U.S. American sample and was controlled for social comparison proneness.",News Media Effects,Mass Communication

Data from a survey among South Korean partisans (N = 634) were used for this investigation. Results show that exposure to political news predicts trust-in-media negatively and political discussion moderates the association such that supporters of Democratic Party who never have political discussions are more likely to show a negative association between exposure to political news and trust-in-media. More importantly, trust-in-media is indirectly linked to political efficacy, which, in turn, is linked to political participation, through trust-in-government.

The present experiment examined whether self-affirmation and group/user status interacted in influencing participants’ responses to a news article with identity-threatening information related to Apple sweatshops in China. Results revealed that for non-Apple users, self-affirmation influenced their appraisal of emotional responses, led them to perceive more news slant and more negative influence of the article on neutral Americans, and lowered their future purchase intentions. The effect of self-affirmation was nonsignificant among Apple users, which could have been thwarted by Apple users’ high defensiveness.

2015-0745,2015,Paper Session,Metaphors of Free Labor: A Typology of Unpaid Work in the Media Sector,3,"Over the last decade, free labor has emerged as a key analytical tool for understanding new or semi-new forms of labor in the contemporary digital economy. This paper critiques and develops this concept, with specific reference to work in the media industries, by presenting a historically grounded typology of free labor that also highlights some of the analytical problems with the current use of the concept. Our typology presents eight metaphors of free labor based on historical instances of roles people have taken on when performing unpaid labor: those of The Slave, The Carer, The Apprentice, The Prospector, The Hobbyist, The Volunteer, The Agent and The Patsy. A key conclusion is that free labor is performed by different actors at either end of increasingly complex and temporally stretched out value chains. This should motivate, or so we argue, a more fine-grained scholarly use of the concept of free labor.","Free, Passionate, and Liquid: Labor and New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0746,2015,Paper Session,New Media and the Category of Work: Between “Labor of Love” and Exploitation,1,"While research now covers a broad range of new media phenomena, it is still a contentious matter what people actually “do” when they engage on and with the internet and its platforms. The paper traces explicit and implicit concepts of user activity in new media research and compares divergent approaches. Whereas concepts such as participation, collaboration and sharing still dominate in describing user engagement, recently critical voices have emerged that perceive platforms like Facebook and other social media as new forms of exploitation. The proposed paper critically engages with these approaches, analyzes the fit of the category of work and finds that both perspectives, the dominant as well as the critical position, converge in the concept of knowledge as the main “product” of communication on the net.","Free, Passionate, and Liquid: Labor and New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0747,2015,Paper Session,Liquid Labor: Women and Informal Work in the Modern Informational City,1,"Through a two-year BTOP funded ethnographic study of the impact of broadband programs in Philadelphia, this paper utilizes a Marxist-Feminist theoretical foundation to examine informal digital labor in the modern informational city. While U.S. technology programs have focused on the role of broadband in stimulating the formal sector, many poor and working class participants utilize digital resources in an attempt to create opportunities outside the formal economy. These activities range from promoting services such as modeling or caricature drawing, to selling handmade goods or digital goods online. In some cases, street economies are merging with digital economies in unique and unanticipated ways. While these flexible labor options and online activities could be viewed as expanding economic possibilities for low income Philadelphians, what Fuchs (2010) calls “knowledge labour” is uniquely exploited by capital in the non-wage digital economy.","Free, Passionate, and Liquid: Labor and New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0748,2015,Paper Session,"Going With the Flow: Critically Engaging Fashion, Media, and Affect",1,"This paper discusses fashion modeling work as a form of glamour labor that stirs up affective connections that are profitable for capital. In line with the conference theme of “Communication Across the Life Span,” this paper focuses on “early adulthood” as a distinct phase in the human life cycle where according to developmental psychologists, “enterprise” is seen as a key principle of our endeavors to “go out into the world and make our mark.” Of course, “enterprise” takes on additional meaning in an era of post-feminism where self-branding activities are symptomatic of what Banet-Weiser (2012) describes as a “neoliberal moral framework.” In cotemporary capitalism, especially, the self-branding work neoliberal frameworks elicit call on bodily affectivity as a source of value. Taking an overview of my research on fashion models, this paper first seeks to redress some confusion about the concept of “affect” as it relates to bodies and media in the self-branding process. I then flesh out a conceptualization of how the affective body lends itself to forces of optimization and enhancement. In conclusion, I focus on how the pursuit of the fashionable body plays into larger forces that organize publics as either in or out of fashion, enticing them into behaviors that capitalize on the body’s malleability, a process that might either help or hinder a more inclusive version of what’s considered “fashionable.”","Free, Passionate, and Liquid: Labor and New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0749,2015,Paper Session,Finding Passion in Work,1,"Examining career guides, this essay seeks to understand how the notion of passionate work is presently framed as an injunction, a commonsensical good thing we should aspire to find. How does the discourse of passion respond to labor conditions after the crisis, and what are the possibilities it forecloses? This essay contains three overtures. First, I analyze how career guides change the pain of job loss to a space of empowerment. Directing readers to the optimistic proposal that their work can be better, career guides advise that the negative affect of the present needs only to be endured by the private individual so that a better future can be produced. Second, I consider what meanings passion produced by the instruments of career guides have, thinking about its relationship to neoliberal subjectivity. Last, I examine career guides that provide a counter-discourse of passion, looking into the values it cultivates in readers.","Free, Passionate, and Liquid: Labor and New Media","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

In addition, this study examined the differences between binge viewers and non-binge viewers on those key psychological variables. The extent to which each of the three psychological factors influenced binge watching behavior was also investigated. Findings from this study further revealed that loneliness, depression and self-regulation deficiency were positively related to binge watching. In particular, this study found that self-regulation deficiency is the most important factor to predict binge watching behavior among the three factors. Findings from this study should contribute to the understanding of factors related to binge watching behavior.

However, theoretical explanations of the association of media use and sleep are largely absent in the literature. This article presents a theoretical framework for investigating the sleep displacement effect of media use. We argue that media use is an unstructured, self-perpetuating activity, that depends on one’s level of self-control for it to end. As bedtime is a time point characterized by ego-depletion, media use is likely to threaten sleep time. These insights, combined with the observation that media use and sleep have gradually become almost consecutive activities, result in the displacement of sleep by evening media use.",Potential Health Concerns Associated With Media Engagement,Mass Communication

Harmful smartphone use was conceptualized as unregulated usage that goes along with negative consequences such as stress, poor school performance, or a decreased quality of social face-to-face interactions. The present survey (N = 1470) tests the contribution of media literacy (conceptualized as awareness of possible problems with one’s own smartphone use) as resilience factor and other predictors (personal dispositions, smartphone habit strength) to harmful smartphone use of children and adolescents between 13 and 16 years old. Harmful smartphone use was predicted by habitualization and a lack of self-regulation. Less pronounced, but still notable, a critical problem awareness was negatively related to harmful usage.

In 2004, China broke from the dominant model and launched the Confucius Institutes (CI), which are based on “cultural partnerships” between the foreign host CI and a Chinese partner. This study draws on intercultural communication scholarship, specifically Asiancentric and Chinesecentric research, to examine the CI partnerships. The analysis suggests that partnerships of the CI initiative represents a distinct model based on the Chinese relational elements that help build the guanxi relational network. The study outlines dimensions of the guanxi building approach, and the potential significance of China’s contribution of a new model of cultural diplomacy and relevance for applied macro-level analysis in intercultural communication.",Intercultural Communication in an Asian Context,Intercultural Communication

The analysis focuses on two key themes of the campaign: leadership and national unity, articulated through the promotion of a nonethnic collective Kenyan identity. Underlying the Uongozi conception of leadership is a commitment to a collective Kenyan identity and support for a unified Kenya. As such, the campaign deemphasizes ethnic differences in favor of focusing on commonalities among Kenyans. Uongozi contributes to a larger pre-election narrative promulgated through mass media efforts that encourages Kenyans to move beyond ethnicity in their voting and participate in a peaceful election.

Applying Goffman’s (1986) frame analysis to ethnographic data, this paper will deconstruct the meaning(s) of an insult in a community of practice where group members expressed different aspects of social identity in the talk. Focusing on an excerpt of the interaction provided understanding of a frame break, but expanding the analysis to talk during the entire two-hour meeting showed the complexity of multiple frames, and broadening the scope of the analysis to conversations during several meetings identified a pattern in the group interaction.

The study reported here explores interactions between two forms of message content job seekers receive: problem-focused and emotion-focused esteem support. Participants (N = 383) were assigned to rate one of 12 esteem support messages created by crossing the problem-focused and emotion-focused dimensions on the degree to which they perceived the message would enhance their job-search state self-esteem and job-search self-efficacy. Though no interaction between problem-focused and emotion-focused content emerged in an omnibus test, a more targeted test indicated that combining problem-focused content with high emotion-focused content diminishes the effectiveness of a high emotion-focused message.

How invisible, matched, and inadvertent advice influences recipient outcomes was quantitatively examined. Counter to predictions from IST, invisible advice had lower ratings of advisor helpfulness, advisor harmfulness, and conversational satisfaction than inadvertent and matched advice. Inadvertent and matched advice ratings did not vary on these dimensions, or advice outcomes (quality, facilitation of coping, or intention to implement). They also did not vary on most dimensions of advice content and politeness. A qualitative textual analysis of the invisible and inadvertent advice transcripts revealed six themes that were consistent across the two transcript groups: rejected advice; advisor experience; advice that is obvious, minimal, or impossible; confirming perspective; alternative perspective; and parallel problems.

2015-0767,2015,Paper Session,"The Effects of Advice Solicitation, Confidence, and Expertise on Advice Utilization",3,"Two studies examine the effects of solicited, guaranteed, and imposed advice on recipients who vary in expertise and confidence. Study 1 found that recipients’ likelihood of accepting advice and rating of advice quality was higher for guaranteed and solicited advice than imposed advice. In Study 2, participants receiving solicited advice changed more incorrect answers, but after controlling for initial answers, solicitation condition did not affect utilization. For participants receiving solicited and guaranteed advice, decreases in confidence were marginally related to advice utilization. Participants with lower confidence and participants receiving solicited advice had significantly higher positive emotions after receiving advice, and positive emotion mediated the effects of advice utilization for participants receiving solicited advice. Overall, results indicate that whether advice is unwanted (imposed) is a more important influence on outcomes than whether it has been requested, and suggest that recipient characteristics, like initial confidence, affect reactions to solicited advice.",Problematic Interactions in Close Relationships: Negotiating Issues Surrounding Identity and Advice,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0768,2015,Paper Session,Developing Communication Strategies for Mitigating Actions Against Global Warming: Linking Framing and a Dual Processing Model,1,"Global warming does not usually rank high on the list of environmental problems governments need to address and, even though people tend to be aware of global warming, there is a gap between such perception and relevant actions to combat the problem. In order to develop effective strategies for facilitating public actions, we draw upon framing theory and a dual processing model. Using an experiment of 261 participants in Taiwan, this study found that by framing global warming as a local issue, communication messages can trigger both analytic(issue relevance) and affective (negative emotions) appraisals, which, in turn, will increase people’s willingness to take actions.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

This important question has received surprisingly little attention from researchers, despite a growing recognition that the public’s reactions to climate change information is shaped by various factors beyond the relevant information itself. Drawing on emerging perspectives from psychology and communication, we report an experiment (N = 719) in which participants were randomly assigned to one of three emotional-induction treatments (guilt, anger, or control) before reading a news story about the negative consequences of climate change. Immediately after, participants reported on a variety of climate-related beliefs (e.g., attributions of blame) and policy preferences (e.g., support for taxing carbon polluters). Results revealed that number of significant effects—for example, guilt led to significantly increased support for climate-mitigation policy overall—including some that depended on personal background and message factors suggested by prior research (namely, political affiliation and social distance). Overall, research suggests that incidental emotional experiences may play an important role in guiding fundamental climate beliefs and consequential policy preferences.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

An experiment was conducted with 809 U.S. adults who either read a hope appeal, fear appeal, guilt appeal, or control message. Results indicate that evoking hope is the superior approach for increasing interest, communication intention, and information seeking intention. Evoking hope and guilt are equally effective for increasing self-efficacy and behavioral intention. Evoking fear is superior to evoking guilt, but not superior to hope, for increasing information seeking intention. Otherwise evoking fear is either ineffective or detrimental.

Yet, despite real and present impacts, for many, climate change remains an abstract risk – a low-salience issue surpassed by competing concerns like jobs and family. Using a survey with an embedded experimental manipulation, we assess how manipulating psychological distance in a message about future climate change impacts in four exemplar cities influences individuals’ willingness to engage in mitigation behavior and to support mitigation policy, as well as their perceptions of the degree to which distant others should do the same. Results suggest that with respect to mitigation behavior, close temporal distance led to less social distance perception than far temporal distance. In addition, the exemplar that portrayed both far temporal and spatial distance also significantly increased social distance perception. Theoretical and applied implications are presented, along with directions for future research.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

We extend this line of research using an experimental approach (n=1635) to examine a moderated-mediation model, which reveals that the valence of efficacy information in a climate news story impacted perceptions of hostile story bias, but only among partisans who supported action to address climate change. Perceptions of hostile story bias, in turn, had a positive association with both perceptions of hostile bias in media overall and discursive actions; general hostile media bias and discursive actions also were positively associated. Thus, the experimental manipulation influenced discursive actions indirectly through perceived hostile story bias and perceived hostile media bias.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

Evoking Salience and Self-Efficacy Through Visualization of Climate Change,5,"Although the media coverage of climate change has been given some attention in the last years, only very few studies deal with visual representations of climate change. As a study by O’Neill et al. (2013) for Australia, USA and the UK has shown, climate change imagery can shape people’s perceptions of the issue. Therefore we analyze the influence of climate change imagery on citizens’ perceptions in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. We focus on which images would increase the salience of climate change as an issue (‘this image makes me feel climate change is important’) and which images would enhance self-efficacy (‘this image makes me feel I can do something about climate change’). The data was gathered in Q-methodology sorting sessions which were held in the three countries. Results were quite consistent across countries. Imagery of climate change impacts promotes salience while imagery of renewable energies and mobility enhances self-efficacy. The findings are similar to the US, UK and Australia (O’Neill et al., 2013) and strengthen the cross-cultural consistency in perceptions of visual representations of climate change.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

In addition, the role of discrete emotions (guilt, fear, optimism) is tested for mediating the framing effects. A non-student quota sample of n = 365 persons was randomly assigned a text about climate change containing either a loss, gain-positive or gain-negative frame. The framing conditions did not yield any differences in awareness of climate change, acceptance of anthropogenic causes, action-outcome efficacy and willingness to act. However, the loss frame evoked most fear and guilt, while the gain-positive, followed by the gain-negative, frame evoked most optimism. All three emotions mediate effects, with fear and guilt strengthening them and optimism weakening them.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

These approaches, however, assume individuals form attitudes on the basis of preexisting values or beliefs and do not account for dynamic social interaction as a source of influence. This study introduces a network perspective that accounts for the social embeddedness of individuals, using key network variables to predict climate attitudes. Climate change attitudes were developed from an exploratory factor analysis, which identified climate change skepticism and belief strength as distinct attitudinal dimensions. Using nationally representative egocentric survey data from 2011 and hierarchical regression analyses, this study determined that homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, and network valence were significant predictors of skepticism (R2=4.8%), while centrality and network strength were predictive of belief strength (R2=8.9%).

Exploring the Role of Media in Enhancing Farmer’s Adaptive Capacity,2,"Agriculture is considered to be one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change impacts, with potential negative impacts on livelihood and food security of millions of people worldwide. Moreover, different crops are expected to be impacted differently due to climate change, and the choice of crop can be an important determinant of adaptation strategy. Although several studies indicate the potential role of media in increasing public as well as farmer’s awareness, understanding, and behaviors about climate change, few studies explore the impact of media on farmer’s specific crop choices. This exploratory study is based on survey data from three villages in a semi-arid region in south India collected as part of climate change adaptation project. We find that media channels through which farmers access weather information, and media consumption affects farmer’s crop choices, distinguishing between their intention to play sorghum, cotton, and pulses in the next season. Providing specific, localized, and differentiated information on weather patterns to farmers, as well as potential adaptation strategies, can potential increase their adaptive capacity.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication

While online social media is a promising platform for health promotion, it remains unclear what mechanisms are responsible for the persuasive effects. This study examined what features of social media – promotional messaging or peer networks – can increase physical activity levels. In a randomized controlled trial, 217 students at a northeastern university were randomized to three conditions: basic online program for enrolling in weekly fitness workshops for 13 weeks; media condition that supplemented the basic program with promotional media messages; and a social condition that replaced the media content with a network of anonymous peers. Promotional messages moderately increased fitness workshop enrollment, while social networks significantly increased both workshop enrollment and self-reported physical activity. Social influence from anonymous online peers was more successful than promotional messages for improving physical activity.

But what happens when different online media platforms such as blogs, online news sites or social networking sites take up the campaign, comment, re-contextualize, and evaluate it? What consequences does the debate have on affected and non-affected young people? Relating to preliminary findings of persuasion research we postulate that (1) source credibility perceptions vary across types of online media platforms and contextualization (reinforcing or impairing the original message of the message) of the message. Individual characteristics, in particular weight related factors are assumed to influence message effects (2). An experimental study with students (N = 749), aged between 13 and 18 years, was conducted. Students were randomly assigned to one out of three stimuli (blog, online news, Facebook), covering a provocative health related campaign against childhood obesity. Results show a two-sided effect of an online media embedded anti-childhood-obesity campaign as message characteristics significantly influence self-perceptions of weight.","Social Media, Exercise, and Obesity",Health Communication

This study investigates UK and US anniversary coverage of two key global events—the fall of Berlin Wall and the Tiananmen crackdown—as reported by prominent US and UK newspapers from 1990 to 2013, combining computerized network-based text analysis and critical discourse analysis. Findings suggest that their changing representations of these formative events have become central political-cultural symbols facilitating the emergence of a memory transcending national boundaries. Though their coverage is found to be increasingly subjected to common rhythms and periodizations, this study also testifies to the continued impact of the geopolitical priorities of elite-driven domestic opinions.

Drawing on German scholar Jürgen Habermas’s thesis of the public sphere, we argue that the digital revolution has the potential to create a kind of “virtual public sphere,” a realm relatively independent of both the state and dominant corporate economic institutions. However, the full exploration of the democratic function of this virtual public sphere depends upon its interplay with the real world and is conditioned by actual political and social structures.

A qualitative study of the way international newsworkers ‘imagine’ the public (and its implied boundaries) provides the empirical context for examining these questions. Interviews with newsworkers reveal a public characterised by a variety of participants and a plurality of sites of political allegiance that is at odds with spatial conceptions of the public sphere, which view publics as coextensive with territorially unified states. To address such conceptual problems, that arise under transnational conditions, I propose conceiving the public sphere as communicative processes of collective choice formation.

In this study, we use eye-tracking technology to precisely determine how much time people spend with social, news, and political posts, as well as the individual differences that predict content differences. Our results suggest that while political exposure is largely avoided, self-reports may under-represent attention to news content on Facebook.

This study explores ICTs’ influences on evacuation decision-making and traffic congestion. Drawing from both communication studies and transportation science, we develop a behaviorally defensible model that integrates people with their corresponding behavioral options. Our findings from the scenarios when there is widespread ICT use reveal a shift in the evacuation time-scale, resulting in traffic congestion early in the evacuation cycle. The effects of this congestion in life-threatening situations are significantly worse than traffic congestion in the non-life-threatening condition. Even under conditions where face-to-face communication is the only option, evacuations still occur, but at a slower rate, and there are virtually no traffic congestion issues.

Those excluded, either as speakers or audiences, are prevented from engaging in, and shaping the dialogic exchange. This study considers Bakhtin’s notion of dialogism in the context of poverty discourse. Dialogic frame analysis is employed to assess the exclusion of the people living in poverty from political news about poverty during the “Common Sense Revolution” in Ontario, Canada. Results point to a systematic relationship between the dialogic structure of news and the nature and tone of mainstream poverty discourse. Even when coverage is sympathetic to the low-income citizens and critical of government policies, exclusive texts tend to reproduce stigmatizing language and retain a negative thematic and emotional focus. Thus, the tenor of poverty news is not simply a function of ideology or partisanship.

The process of mediated reflexivity moves beyond previous conceptions of reflexivity to address the multimodal and cross-platform capabilities that are possible within historically contextualized media ecologies. This paper conducts a qualitative analysis of the ethnographic experience with and participatory media process of people living in poverty and homelessness through the organizations POOR Magazine and Sanctuary Women’s Development Center. This data is analyzed through a critical theoretical lens to help frame the concept of mediated reflexivity for a better understanding of the power and potential of poverty participatory media.,Media and Poverty,Mass Communication
2015-0800,2015,Paper Session,Access to Flexible Work Options As a Source of Feelings of Respect and Leader Endorsement,2,"Organizations are increasingly offering flexible work arrangements (FWA). Some employees view these FWA as negotiated perks for valued employees. However, at times supervisors deny their subordinates access to some or all FWA. This decision may affect employees’ a) feelings of being respected, and b) leader endorsement. Based on the social identity approach and its leadership model, leader in-group prototypicality (i.e., the supervisor’s representativeness of group identity) should moderate these relationships. Results from a large-sample survey at one organization show that indeed only in-group prototypical supervisors’ FWA use-related decisions influence employees’ feelings of respect. Further, prototypical leaders’ endorsement is less contingent upon the favorability of their decisions. The paper discusses implications of these findings.","Supporting Mobile Work: Technology, Policy, and Flexible Arrangements",Organizational Communication

A field survey of real estate agents in Hong Kong (N = 245) showed that respondents, heavy consumers of MIMs, used a variety of social media messengers and features to communicate with their work contacts such as coworkers, superiors, clients, and external agents. Their MIM use was positively associated with social capital and predicted job performance, job satisfaction, and work relationship satisfaction. Social capital exerted its own positive contribution to job satisfaction and relationship satisfaction, but not to job performance. Further theorizing can focus on the conditions under which social capital is convertible to tangible outcomes as opposed to psychological outcomes.","Supporting Mobile Work: Technology, Policy, and Flexible Arrangements",Organizational Communication

We focus on how mobile Sales Force Automation (SFA) applications affect the sales force’s balance between autonomy and control. We turn to theory on the imbrication of humans and technologies in practice (Leonardi, 2011) to investigate the affects of SFA in a multi-national beverage company based in The Netherlands. The findings of this research indicate that the introduction of mobile SFA devices impacted the autonomy of a dispersed sales force, but not in the direction that previous research suggests.

2015-0803,2015,Paper Session,Unintended Consequences of an Organization-Imposed Digital Divide: Mobile Device Use Policies at Work,2,"Not everyone around the globe has access to a mobile device, especially at work. This study examines a US company with an organizational policy restricting mobile device access for non-managerial workers; producing a localized digital divide. Our focus group data collection and subsequent constant comparative analysis, allowed us to uncover a multi-layered explanation of the organizational implications and unintended consequences of this mobile device policy. Both the managers and non-managerial workers agree the policy is problematic and strategically ambiguous. Furthermore, the varied policy interpretations resulted in a productivity paradox, supervisors burdened by Sisyphean tasks, decreased professional mobility, and ultimately, fleeting organizational identification. This study expands digital inequality research to an intra-organizational context, develops a theoretical model grounded in the data, and provides directions for future research.","Supporting Mobile Work: Technology, Policy, and Flexible Arrangements",Organizational Communication
2015-0804,2015,Paper Session,"Gatekeeping, Gatekeeping Forces, and Microdocumentary",2,"In an era when journalism is increasingly being practiced outside of traditional newsrooms, micro-documentaries represent a new entrant to the journalistic field. Many micro-documentarians worked as journalists and now embrace a format and approach that, they say, afford them more freedom. While they clearly contribute to the news ecology, they also practice a craft that not all of them want to call journalism. Nevertheless, having entered, even partially, the journalistic field, do micro-documentaries become subject to the same pressures from other social fields and from the same gatekeeping pressures as journalism? This study uses in-depth interviews with 16 micro-documentary producers-journalists to examine how they perceive the gatekeeping forces that shape the documentaries they produce.","Gatekeeping, News Decisions, and Media Logic",Journalism Studies
2015-0805,2015,Paper Session,Visceral or Discretional? Measuring Journalistic Judgments and Their Associations With Actual News Practices,2,"This paper explores not only how journalists evaluate their items, but also – for the first time – the associations between these evaluations and their news practices. Based on a series of reconstruction interviews with a sample of 108 Israeli reporters, who recreated their evaluations and practices in a random sample of 859 items, the paper yielded mixed evidence whether news judgment tends to be more ‘visceral’ or more ‘discretional’. On the one hand, both meta- evaluations of story importance and interest are implemented most of the time indistinctively. On the other hand, evaluations showed a quite systematic logic, with higher evaluations of importance, interest and sensitivity emerging in specific circumstances, involving significantly higher reporting efforts, lower working pressures and more exclusives and leaks. While these findings indicate that news judgment is part of a journalistic ‘economy of effort’, more research is needed to establish causality between evaluation and reporting.","Gatekeeping, News Decisions, and Media Logic",Journalism Studies
2015-0806,2015,Paper Session,Changing of the Guard: Has the Gatekeeping Role of Newspapers Changed in the Digital Age?,1,"Newspapers have traditionally served as powerful gatekeepers, gathering most of the news and acting as the flagships of professional journalism.
In effect, they often set the agenda of other news outlets.
We address the question whether this influence has diminished in the digital age.
We measured whether the stories covered on the front pages of newspapers were also covered in other news outlets, and if so who covered them first.
This analysis, covering 17 news outlets in the Netherlands, suggests that the influence of newspapers has indeed diminished.
To interpret these findings, we make a distinction between intermedia agenda-setting at the episodic and thematic level.
By using a finer granularity than commonly used to measure agenda-items in intermedia agenda-setting studies, we analyzed the episodic level.
We elaborate on the implications of using different levels of granularity, and argue for its importance to study gatekeeping in the digital age.","Gatekeeping, News Decisions, and Media Logic",Journalism Studies
2015-0807,2015,Paper Session,"Different News Platforms, Different Media Logics?",1,"In this paper we consider journalism as an institution. The quasi-natural rules and procedures that guide this institution is referred to as news media logic. Media logic is distinguished in three dimensions: professionalism, commercialism and media technology. We investigate whether news media logic differs between four Dutch news platforms: public television broadcasting news, national newspapers, regional newspapers and independent news websites. And if so, how the different dimensions of news media logic – professionalism and commercialism – are manifested. Data were collected by means of a series of reconstruction-interviews with 100 Dutch journalists of different news media platforms, in which they gave a detailed reconstruction of the choices they made in 318 news items that they produced. Results show that media logic of news websites is more strongly influenced by the commercial dimension than the media logic of the other news platforms.","Gatekeeping, News Decisions, and Media Logic",Journalism Studies
2015-0808,2015,Paper Session,Prototyping Big Data: Designer Algorithms and Data Rituals,2,"We have entered the era of Designer Algorithms; letting Big Data think and feel for us because it knows us better than we will ever know ourselves. Scrupulous in identifying our needs and precise in its predictions, the Designer Algorithm asks us to make its acquaintance, rely on its hunches, and eventually surrender wholly to it. In this paper, we use this conceptual prototype–Designer Algorithms (DA)–as a means by which to explore and expose Big Data, its affordances and limitations, and its movements to quantify the self. The prototype is a means of making a “possible future visible,” (Turner, 2014), raising questions about emerging phenomenon (Bleecker, 2009; DiSalvo, 2012; Dunne & Raby, 2013) and working out complex socio-technical arguments and ideas (Galey & Ruecker, 2010). This paper draws on theory from communication and media studies, science and technology studies, and design. Our role as scholar-designers is to extract and make sense of narratives and meanings embedded in data of all scale (Gibson-Graham, 2006), to account for what data ignores (Chun & Rhody, 2014), and to probe the underlying questions, experiences, and biases that lead to the design of particular algorithmic inquiries (Kitchin, 2014), infrastructures (Star, 1999), and ways of seeing (Sample, 2014) and being seen. Rather than understanding Big Data as the transmission of information, we draw on the ritual view of communications to prototype the ways in which it occupies the practices of everyday life (Carey, 1988). We seek to understand the kinds of individuals that emerge from the entanglements (Barad, 2003) between the Big Data and the self, the ways in which we delegate (Latour, 1992) aspects of our lives to algorithms, as well as the values embedded in socio-technical systems (Nissenbaum, 2001). We propose the term data rituals as a feminist critical intervention in theorizing Big Data and the Quantified Self (Snyder, 2014; Watson, 2014).",Different Ways of Valuing Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0809,2015,Paper Session,"Suspicion, Cognition, Automaticity Model (SCAM) of Phishing Susceptibility",3,"Social-psychological research on phishing has implicated ineffective cognitive processing as the key reason for individual victimization. Interventions have consequently focused on training individuals to better detect deceptive emails. Evidence, however, points to individuals sinking into patterns of email usage that within a short period of time results in an attenuation of the training effects. Thus, individual email habits appear to be another predictor of their phishing susceptibility. To comprehensively account for all these influences, the research built a model that accounts for the cognitive, preconscious, and automatic processes that potentially leads to phishing-based deception. The resultant Suspicion, Cognition, and Automaticity Model (SCAM) was tested using two experimental studies in which participants were subjected to different types of email-based phishing attacks.",Different Ways of Valuing Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0810,2015,Paper Session,Use and Perception of Mobile Phone Texting in Classrooms,1,"A mobile phone is proven to allow people to keep in steady contact with families and friends in the social networks. As one of the most popular functions of the mobile phone, texting offers the potential for interpersonal interactions as well as business communications. On campuses across this country, mobile phone texting is becoming the most popular channel of fundamental communication among young people. While there are sentiments against mobile phone texting in classrooms, mobile phone use as well as texting in classrooms can be positive. For example, mobile phone can be used for tutoring, accessing online information, connecting students, and coordinating school actives. This study examines college students’ use of mobile phone texting in classrooms. It uses a quantitative method to examine in what ways mobile phone texting is used in classes, student and faculty perceptions of it as a kind of distraction in learning, and attitudes about adopting policies of restricting it during class. The findings can offer empirical evidence for any formal academic policies toward this widespread communication challenge in classrooms.",Different Ways of Valuing Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

Object biographies are used to analyse the circulations and interactions between the spheres of the market, the commons and the state economy of cultural funding. The theoretical framework is tested on two ethnographies of open source 2D and 3D-animation feature film production. The research demonstrates how different regimes of value are appealed to in order to make the different values involved in the projects commensurable, but also how different regimes of value are appealed to in order to produce distinctions and differences. We suggest that open source cultural production should not be thought of as essentially commons-based or market-based, but as an ongoing negotiation process between different regimes of value.",Different Ways of Valuing Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

However, previous research indicates that spoilers can actually increase enjoyment. The present study tests mental model incorporation as a mechanism for how spoilers influence enjoyment of media content in a real-world context, using a two-part survey administered before and after the finale of a long-running television series. Fan theories about content are also offered as a related, but separate issue from spoiler exposure. Parasocial breakup distress is tested as a previously un-examined outcome of spoiler and fan theory exposure. Results suggest that exposure to both spoilers and fan theories increase enjoyment and decrease parasocial breakup distress after a television series finale, and this is mediated by mental model incorporation.",Parasocial Relationships,Mass Communication

This study examined what character traits associated with Gloria Pritchett contribute to audience likability foregrounding viewer-character dimensions related to ethnicity, gender, and social class, which are often not accounted for in quantitative approaches to media figures’ likeability. A snowball sample of Modern Family viewers (N = 221) concluded that despite her stereotypical ethno-gender and class connotations and viewers ingroup/outgroup statuses, there are other predictors that help explain their likability of Gloria Pritchett. More specifically, the more perceived Latina/o realism or ethno-complexity she exuded, the greater her likeability among sampled audiences. The analysis additionally revealed that the categorical treatment of social identities is not enough to moderate viewers’ likeability, but the combined strength of identification viewers had toward their ethnic, gender, and social class identity.",Parasocial Relationships,Mass Communication

The current paper contextualizes the role of nostalgia as a mixed emotion induced by recipients’ memory of their past into the framework of eudaimonic entertainment experiences.
The present study investigated whether media-induced nostalgia, induced by remembering past time’s media use, is similar to the nostalgic emotion induced by remembering meaningful past events. We further distinguished between different experiences of media-induced nostalgia (individual versus collective). Results demonstrate media-induced nostalgia to be a mixed state containing both affective and cognitive facets. Further, nostalgia was both triggered by parasocial relationships as a personal factor within the entertainment experience and the sheer amount of recognized media content from one’s past as collectively shared experience. Results are discussed in terms of their implications.",Parasocial Relationships,Mass Communication
2015-0816,2015,Paper Session,Selective Information Processing of Nonverbal Sexual Refusal Cues by Undergraduate Males,3,"Date rape, or acquaintance rape, is becoming increasingly prevalent on college campuses. Because date rape usually involves some form of communication prior to the rape, it is crucial to examine how this communication contributes to the action of rape. Most communication research conceptualizes rape as a result of a miscommunication of consent; assuming that females are not sufficiently communicating that they do not want to have sex. The current study challenges this assumption. By applying selective information processing theory to undergraduate males’ understanding of nonverbal sexual refusal cues, we seek to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how communicative factors contribute to date rape. We present the results of two studies. Study 1 is an experiment testing whether selective information processing is occurring. Study 2 consists of five online focus groups conducted with 24 undergraduate males. Together, findings from these studies indicate that information load plays a role in undergraduate males’ understanding of sexual refusal. However, undergraduate males have difficulty identifying nonverbal sexual refusal and processing that refusal when information load is high. The methods and results of this research offer innovative directions for research to challenge current beliefs, as well as critique and change the current definitions, interactions, and understandings of rape.",Sex Communication and Health,Health Communication
2015-0817,2015,Paper Session,Do As I Say: Efficacy of an Intervention to Promote Sexual Assertiveness,9,"Sexual risk reduction interventions are often ineffective for women who drink alcohol. The present study examines whether an alcohol-related sexual risk reduction intervention successfully trains women to increase assertive communication behaviors and simultaneously decrease aggressive communication behaviors. Women demonstrated their communication skills during interactive role plays. Young African American women (N = 238) reporting unprotected vaginal or anal sex and greater than 3 alcoholic drinks in the past 90 days were assigned to a control, a sexual risk reduction, or a sexual risk reduction + alcohol risk reduction (NLITEN) condition. NLITEN women significantly increased their assertive communication compared to control women yet use of aggressive communicative behaviors was unchanged. These data suggest assertive communication skills training is efficacious as part of a sexual risk reduction intervention that also includes an alcohol risk reduction session.",Sex Communication and Health,Health Communication

Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a guiding theoretical framework, the findings of the study revealed that the gay friendly, tropical, relaxing environments allowed for MSM to let their guard down and act differently from when they are in their hometown. Various barriers such as substance use and peer pressure affect MSM’s ability to engage in healthier behaviors, with condom negotiation and HIV status disclosure as additional issues that impact the sex practices of this particular population. Discussion of the applicability of HBM and other extant research on casual sexual experiences with traveling to this phenomenon provides insight on how MSM’s self-efficacy toward safer sex practices can be increased via interventions and outreach campaigns.",Sex Communication and Health,Health Communication

Following theoretical guidance from both the framing theory and the Elaborated Likelihood Model (ELM), the researcher conducts both qualitative and quantitative content analysis. Results indicate overall loose journalistic and editorial practices in presenting sexual-health related information to the public as well as low message efficacy. A lack of consistent frame and presence of confusing and self-contradictory messages are noted in the articles that mention the oral contraceptive pill, A regression analysis also reveals that the less the article is about contraception, and the fewer statistics, references, and research findings the article includes, the less likely that the oral contraceptive pill is represented in a positive light.

While I am mainly concerned with use of varying temporal structures to represent differing and heterogeneous conceptions of female subjectivity by particular transnational women filmmakers, my question contextualizes these “traveling” films presented at international film festivals within a larger feminist concern of reconciling universal feminism with difference. In the films Water, Women Without Men and Where Do We Go Now? each filmmaker presents a multidimensional narrative of women’s experience in various national and historical contexts. I draw on Bakhtin’s theory of the chronotope to analyze the narrative structures and various motifs in these films. I argue that temporality emerges as a central concern in understanding post-post modern identity and that as transnationally situated auteurs, Mehta, Neshat and Labaki are actively engaged in a form of discourse through self-representation.",Performative Research and Textual Analysis in Feminist Scholarship,Feminist Scholarship

Mohanty (1991) rebukes the universality of the theories of western feminists and the categorization of the “third world woman” as a monolithic subject. The attempts of first world women (subjects) attempting to explain third world women (objects) is viewed as a way of creating power hierarchies and cultural domination , and Mohanty calls this discursive colonialism. Surrogacy has been understood as a form of gift-giving, as exploitation, as labor, as caring, as an act of desperation, as a neoliberal practice, and as a form of reproductive choice (Kroløkke and Pant, 2012; Markens 2007; Pande 2009, 2010).

2015-0823,2015,Paper Session,Bridging the Disconnect Within Feminist Movements: Unveiling Muslim Feminism,1,"Women of color writers and feminists have fought structurally and used the transformative power of writing and theorizing through their bodies and lived experiences against the pervasive racist and sexist hierarchies in hegemonic culture that leave imprints on women of color’s selves. I extend this argument in the specific context of Muslim feminism that theorizes outside an Orientalist and patriarchal reference frames. I believe it is important to use revisionist models that rethink and rewrite the goals and strategies of feminist movements when new perspectives emerge. I argue that Muslim feminism could be seen as an extension of theories of the flesh, where Muslim feminists establish a middle space “inbetween” the binaries to produce alternate discourses to challenge and hegemonic structures and discourses. Building on Muslim feminism as an extension of theories of the flesh, where Muslim feminists theorize through their lived experiences and link the personal to the political, offers a metatheoretical framework to explore the close relationship between the role that voice, verbalization and embodied expression in constructing and challenging representation.",Performative Research and Textual Analysis in Feminist Scholarship,Feminist Scholarship

We consider it a new cultural formation coming out of a specific hegemonic negotiation, whereby politics of sexuality and of class have come together and class antagonism, something no longer allowed proper representations in public discourse yet ever more acute in postsocialist China, is channeled through and thus intensifies inter-gender friction. To account for such a hegemonic formation, we provide a conjunctural analysis involving a historical examination of gender, class, and their dynamics in the discursive terrains from the Mao era, and a detailed case study of contentions surrounding a local feminist play, “The Vagina’s Way/Say,” between emerging feminist activism and the anti-feminist backlash, whose actions and tendencies are conditioned by the trajectories of multiple historical forces.",Performative Research and Textual Analysis in Feminist Scholarship,Feminist Scholarship

Focusing on an indigenous cultural concept relationalism, I seek to develop a socio-cultural approach to understanding rhetorical performances in Asian contexts, paying particular attention to the interconnected self situated in social relationship networks that exists both as a constraint and a resource for individual’s rhetorical performance in Asian cultures.

This expansion is conveyed through Maathai’s use of narrative setting, events, and characters indicative of Kenya to bolster the coherence, fidelity, and rationality of her narratives to Western and non-Western audiences alike. This paper will be constructed around the narrative components of setting, events, and characters focusing on Maathai’s use of both Western and non-Western narrative aspects to connect to national and global audiences.

The existing studies tend to describe kagura as “a text in motion” and to explain it as a functional and purposive behavior, but without exploring the very act of “expressing.” In order to explore the expressive dimensions of kagura, we use a neo-Kantian Gebserian approach that focuses on different spatio-temporal dimensions.

This transcendence encourages audiences to think about the bigger picture and see their connection to one another and the planet. This paper will be constructed around the three major appeals to transcendence exemplified in Maathai’s rhetoric. The first section will focus on Maathai’s rhetorical use of holism as an appeal to transcendence. The second section will analyze spiritual appeals and the third section will explore transcendent appeals to community. In the end, this paper will demonstrate how the rhetorical use of transcendence engages multiple perspectives and considers various viewpoints to create an alternative approach that softens differences and creates conceptions focused on commonalities.",Intercultural Rhetoric,Intercultural Communication

A potential explanation is provided by the knowledge gap hypothesis which states that a lack of online privacy literacy prevents people from acting according to their concerns. To implement privacy literacy in future research, the online privacy literacy scale (OPLIS) was developed based on an extensive review of previous research in this field and a profound content analysis of different sources capturing a variety of aspects relevant to online privacy literacy. The scale encompasses five dimensions of online privacy literacy: Knowledge about (1) practices of organizations, institutions and online services providers; (2) technical aspects of online privacy and data protection; (3) laws and legal aspects of online data protection in Germany; and (4) European directives on privacy and data protection and (5) knowledge about user strategies for individual privacy regulation.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0831,2015,Paper Session,You Can Trust Me With Your Data! Service Cues Facilitating Self-Disclosure on Social Networking Sites,3,"On social networking sites (SNS), user self-disclosure is a precondition for the establishment of online ties and the participation in communities of interest. Self-disclosure is also a key element in the SNS business model, as it allows for targeted advertising. Therefore, SNS providers are eager to facilitate user self-disclosure. At the same time, privacy risks associated with SNS use may engender privacy concerns, inhibiting self-disclosure. Based on a survey of 294 German SNS users, we analyze two potential approaches for SNS providers to counter privacy concerns and encourage user self-disclosure: (1) SNS can employ cues to signal the trustworthiness of the service provider. (2) Applying the “privacy calculus” thesis, attractive service benefits may serve to moderate the inhibiting effect of privacy concerns on self-disclosure. Our analysis reveals that trust in the SNS provider mediates the effect of privacy concerns on self-disclosure, while service benefits does not exert a significant effect.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #3,Communication and Technology

Analysis of the design of “safety” phones reveals that these phones frame safety and privacy as mutually exclusive, emphasize that women should be responsible for their safety, and solidify safety and mobility as privileges of the economically advantaged. Although the mobile phone practices of participants aligned with these neoliberal ideas about safety, thus reinforcing discourses of mobile phones as “technologies of safety,” they rejected the constant surveillance advocated by the specialized phones, and advocated strategic surveillance by favoring texting, phone calls to those in social networks, and “missed calls.” This paper shows that technologies are embedded in gendered social relations by contrasting how the tensions between mobility, safety, and privacy manifest in design and how these tensions are negotiated “on the ground.”",Privacy Issues With Social Media #3,Communication and Technology

Impartiality is the cornerstone of principles of public service broadcasting at the BBC and other broadcasters modeled on it. However, the paper suggests that in the case of the BBC, it is principally put into practice through juxtaposing the positions of the two main political parties – Conservative and Labour. This is the case despite the news organization’s commitment to representing a broader range of opinion. These findings are explored through an examination of BBC coverage of three contentious issues - immigration, religion and Britain’s relationship to Europe.",Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies

Evidence of mediatization was stronger on the most commercially driven bulletins – far higher than typically found in first order elections – with an overwhelming emphasis on the game frame and a more interpretive approach in live and edited formats than the most public service orientated broadcaster (e.g. BBC). However, in more qualitative analysis we found the BBC – notably in its use of vox pops – pursued a more mediaitzed approach than at first glance. Developing a close-textual analysis of how broadcasters reported party campaign launches – representing what we call key “mediatized moments” – we argue a more qualitative approach to assessing the tug of war between media and political logics can complement comparative quantitative studies about mediatized politics.",Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies

This study aims to document these trends and consider their effects on news content and American politics. Using decades of archived television transcripts and print and online articles, two types of content analyses are performed identifying (1) aggregate polling references using computer-aided methods, and (2) the kinds of polls mentioned and their sponsors using a hand-coded subset of New York Times articles over three election years (1984, 1996, and 2012). In contrast to claims that news has become increasingly poll-driven, results indicate surprising consistency over time and a decline in pure horse-race polling relative to surveys about policy issues and approval ratings. Findings also indicate growing sophistication in the treatment of polls in The Times, although the generalizeability of these findings across news outlets is also considered.",Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies
2015-0836,2015,Paper Session,Issue Ownership Versus Issue Convergence: Predicting the 1998-2012 Dutch Elections Using Issue Saliency and Issue Positions,2,"Do parties win when journalists report on their owned issues or when parties converge on dominant campaign issues in the media? We examine this question for Dutch parliamentary election campaigns between 1998 and 2012 on the basis of content analysis and survey data. Convergence on dominant issues in the media increases a party's electoral support indeed, especially in combination with diverging issue positions. In line with issue ownership theory, a party wins at the elections if it succeeds in getting more media attention for its issue positions than its competitors on issues that receive more media attention than in the previous campaign. However, holding on to issue positions on owned issues may pay off less than when strategically altering issue positions to attract voters.",Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies
2015-0837,2015,Paper Session,Who Gets Covered? Ideological Extremity and News Coverage of Members of the U.S. Congress,2,Are ideological extremists covered more than moderates by the media? We combine a measure of members of Congress’ ideological extremity with a content analysis of how often lawmakers appear in the New York Times from the 103rd to the 112th Congresses. We show that ideologically extremity is positively related to political news coverage for members of the House of Representatives. Ideological extremity is not related to the likelihood of coverage for senators. We consider our findings’ implications in light of evidence that polarized political environments affect whether individuals respond to strong frames or to frames offered by their own party.,Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies

2015-0839,2015,Paper Session,20 Years of Constructing Public Diplomacy in Post-Communist Romania: The Neglected Internal Dimension of Country Promotion,1,"While most research on how countries promote their images abroad focuses on communication campaigns aimed at foreign audiences (external dimension), this paper proposes a constructivist approach for investigating the echoes and debates stirred by these initiatives within the countries and among internal audiences (internal dimension). It uses a case study from Romania, a post-communist country where this topic of country promotion was subject to recurrent internal debates among various social actors and, in time, was gradually turned into a public issue. Focusing on the institutional construction of country promotion within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a key actor in promoting Romania abroad, this paper aims to illustrate how a constructivist approach can be operationalized in order to investigate the internal dimension of country promotion.
This paper draws a 20-year historical reconstitution of evolutions in Romania’s diplomacy after 1989 within MAE, aiming to trace the main practices of country promotion, integrate them into a typology, identify the typification of these habitualized practices and how they have been defined and thus, revealing the entire process of institutionalizing these practices as public diplomacy within MAE. At the same time, the main initiatives and campaigns of MAE to promote Romania abroad after 1989 are analyzed, with a focus on the definitions about Romania that these campaigns projected and on the way they were publicly legitimized by MAE’s representatives. Although the perspective of MAE is privileged, it is always considered within the interactions with other institutional and social actors, so that the actions of MAE are placed in the socio-political context of the period.
Ultimately, this paper argues that there is a need for critical thinking about the complex phenomenon of country promotion to complement the dominant functionalist paradigm in the current literature. The constructivist perspective is but one of the approaches that can be followed and it brings forward the neglected aspect of internal dimension of country promotion: the historicity, typification and habitualization of country promotion practices in a country, within the network of constant interactions and negotiations of several social actors who end up by influencing the way governments conceive and institutionalize country promotion. Thus, this dynamic and social centered view of country promotion can advance the thinking about country promotion in literature in terms of exploring theories outside public relations, public diplomacy and nation branding, and consequently of employing new research designs and methodologies when investigating this topic.",Political/Government Public Relations,Public Relations

However, political parties do not operate in a vacuum and have to relate to meso and micro environmental factors as well. Nevertheless, there is little research that focuses on if and how party level and inter-party level factors influence the development of strategic political communication. The purpose of this paper is to explore the importance of party agency and inter-party influence for the development of strategic political communication in election campaigning.

Drawing on previous research that shows that the economic crisis is leading citizens to refer their judgments to government performance and independently from their ideological preferences, this paper explores whether this trend is consolidated in the aftermath of tough measures adopted by the government to address the economic crisis; it also examines how people make their judgments about legitimacy, and whether these legitimacy judgments have an impact on trust in governments. Results show a shift in 2014: people care less than before about government performance. They also show that, in trusting governments, people care more about the legitimacy of achievements than about the legitimacy of the process through which these achievements are provided. Implications of these findings for further research and practice of government Public Relations are discussed.",Political/Government Public Relations,Public Relations

The analysis of newspaper stories published in the five largest Latino markets shows that the salience of some sources —such as law enforcement personnel, or immigrants— predicted the presence of certain frames related to the DACA program, in both newspaper markets. Additionally, findings showed that for both groups of stories – no matter whether they originate in ethnic or general market newspapers— there was more positive than negative framing of the program, however negative coverage was more salient in general market newspapers.","Media, Latino/a Youth, and Immigration",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Based on 30 interviews conducted in Boston in Fall 2013 with Latino immigrant youth ages 15-20, this paper illustrates that - contrary to previous assumptions about the digital divide - low-income minority youth in the US are very plugged in. Yet, there is a different kind of digital divide in Latino immigrant families, where Internet-savvy youth have access to a timelier variety of news than their parents, many of whom have low levels of education and work in jobs that do not cultivate digital skills. In a reversal of typical parent-child roles, the youth in this study were “news translators” for their parents, explaining US news developments and their implications. In the process, they helped parents assimilate US values and norms. In seeking and verifying news, sports and celebrity information and in creating and sharing content online, the youth gained participatory and deliberative skills useful for civic engagement in a democracy. This is important, given that most of their families hailed from Central America and other Latin Americna countries with long histories of authoritarian rule and political repression.","Media, Latino/a Youth, and Immigration",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Findings from in-depth interviews with high- and low-identifier Latino students reveal that the students who strongly identify with their Latina/o heritage are more likely to believe that non-Latina/o students perceive them in terms of media representations, and to consciously change their behavior in the presence of non-Latina/o students. The study explains how Latina/o images created by the media influence the college experiences of high-identifier Latino students and proposes steps universities can take to enhance the college experiences of these students.","Media, Latino/a Youth, and Immigration",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

It includes a bilingual content analysis of six newspapers located in five different countries involved in the issue: El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and the United States. Framing and threat theories were useful to determine commonalities, differences and descriptive patterns disseminated by elite publications across those nations. The main findings are that most news outlets tend to focus on local issues even if they are dealing with a transnational problem, and that there are substantial descriptive differences related to how newspapers frame children, with U.S. based publications more prone to use “babies” and “toddlers” in their stories. The study also identified six different phases of coverage that developed a regional narrative.","Media, Latino/a Youth, and Immigration",Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2015-0847,2015,Paper Session,"Anger, Mood Management, and Attraction to Violent Video Games",1,"The motivations for playing violent video games are not well understood. People use media to regulate their moods, and they may be attracted to violent video games in order to manage angry moods. Participants were induced to feel a negatively-valenced or positively-valenced emotion: anger, tenseness/jitteriness, sadness, or happiness. Participants then read descriptions of eight fictitious games (four violent, four non-violent); they then rated how much they wanted to play each game on an 11-point Likert scale, chose one game to play, and indicated the reason for their selection.

A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of mood induction on attraction to violent games, and pairwise comparisons revealed that angry participants were more attracted to violent games. Angered participants were also more likely to select an anger-based mood management explanation for their game choice.

This research supports a mood management based explanation for the attraction of violent video games.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0848,2015,Paper Session,Gendered Self-Concept: What Does It Reveal About People’s Preference for Violent Video Games?,2,"There is a paucity of knowledge on the gender gap in preference for violent video games. Females have consistently been shown to report less of a preference in this regard than males. This study focuses on the gendered self-concept in a sample of gamers for the purpose of investigating their self-reported attraction to games of violence. We tested the assumptions that there is a link between negative attributes of the male gender role and violent game preference and, further, that this link is mediated by physical aggression. The results of an on-line study (N=335) largely confirmed these assumptions and further revealed that the mediating effect of physical aggression was moderated by gender. The present study gives support to the assertion that gaming motivation cannot be analyzed solely on the distinction between genders. Rather, the gendered self-concept has to be taken into account for elucidating the reasons for which people take a preference for violent video games.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies

In this study, massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) were used to assess arousal in high pressure, violent, group versus group settings. A total of 298 players of two popular MMORPGs were surveyed to determine the impact of their perceived level of arousal, among high-risk and low-risk games, on group attraction, negative affect, and altruism. High-risk games refer to games where participants risk losing their equipment, items, currency, and levels in player versus player scenarios, which are not at risk of loss in low-risk player versus player scenarios. The results indicate that high-risk games hold significant influence over a number of these factors, both positive and negative, and offer evidence contrary to popular claims of violent media which cite that they may inhibit pro-social action and positive outcomes.

2015-0850,2015,Paper Session,Interactive Experience and Identification as Predictors of Attributing Responsibility in Video Games,2,"This study examines whether the interactive nature of video games affects how players who portray a violent character attribute responsibility for the actions of their character. Through an experiment, we tested the hypothesis that identification with the main character in Grand Theft Auto IV mediates the effect of interactivity on attributions of responsibility for the main character’s anti-social behavior. Using the notion of the fundamental attribution error, we demonstrated that those who actually played the game, as opposed to those who simply watched someone else playing it, identified with the main character. In accordance with the fundamental attribution error, those who played the game interactively and came to identify with the main character attributed the responsibility for his actions to external factors such as “living in a violent society”. In contrast, those who did not interact with the game attributed responsibility for the character’s actions to his personality traits.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies

Psychologically, these situations are characterized by a threat to the moral value of nonviolence. In this paper we present two studies showing that value threat can motivate people to support political actions against violent video games. This effect is moderated by individual differences in pacifism, and partially mediated by selective exposure to scientific evidence for the harmfulness of violent video games. The findings of both studies are in line with the value protection model and shed light on how the motivation to protect sacred values can translate into political mandates. Implications of the present findings are discussed with regard to the psychological processes underlying value protection and add to a better understanding of the violent video games debate.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0852,2015,Paper Session,Depression Stigmas Through the Lens of News in Two Cultures: A Suggestion for Theoretical Approaches,3,"Several theoretical frameworks have guided stigma research to examine how and why people would activate stigma-related thoughts when contracting external stimuli, such as media content. However, little evidence has demonstrated how likely media content is to contribute to such a stigma activation process as external stimuli, especially for depression. A content analysis with news articles (N = 488) published in two major newspapers in the United States and South Korea explored (1) the likelihood of potential stigma-cued news production in the cases of two countries and (2) the comprehensiveness of the operationalizations of primary theories applied to stigma research. The findings suggest the superiority of the stigma communication model due to its comprehensive ability to diagnose the existence of stigma cues over the attribution and framing theories. The present study also raised a question about the mixed nature of operationalizations of the attribution and framing theories and the applicability of the two theories to media-content research for stigmatization.","Depression, Mental Illness, Mental Health Communication",Health Communication

The participants were recruited through convenient sampling and purposive sampling method in the Chinese communities. The data was collected by interviews and focus groups. Grounded theory method was employed to analyze data. Thematic analysis of the data developed five themes: (1) selective depression communication with parents, (2) different communication styles of mothers and fathers, (3) positive and negative feedback of parents influence depression communication, (4) childhood experiences influence depression communicative practices, (5) interdependence and conflicting expectations restrain depression communication. The results suggest that parents-young adults communication rooted in cultural contexts should be emphasized to address depression of Chinese international students. More importantly, the complex characteristic of interdependence between parents and Chinese young adults indicated that their expectations may conflict with each other, following both positive and negative communication practices.","Depression, Mental Illness, Mental Health Communication",Health Communication

This study examines the portrayal of mental illness in popular women’s and men’s magazines between 2009 and 2013 through a content analysis. It finds that while women’s magazines are more likely to present a more positive coverage of mental illness by citing patients, adopting the scientific discourse and using challenge cues such as personification and hope, the coverage in these two types of magazines are surprisingly similar in terms of the topics covered, causes and solution discussed, expert sources cited, and the stigma cues used.","Depression, Mental Illness, Mental Health Communication",Health Communication

Specifically, we investigate the relative persuasiveness of narrative vs. non-narrative messages, as well as the relative effectiveness of first-person vs. third-person narratives. Findings of a between-subjects experiment (N = 562) suggested that narratives were more effective than non-narratives in promoting favorable attitudes toward the mentally ill. While narratives led to greater transportation among the participants, reduced counterarguing seemed to be the underlying mechanism for enhanced persuasiveness of narratives. Moreover, we found an interaction between narrative perspective and participants’ gender, indicating that first-person narratives were particularly powerful among male participants. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","Depression, Mental Illness, Mental Health Communication",Health Communication

This study investigates whether two factors of media messages (controllability attributions, message format) can elicit sympathy, reduce stigmatizing attitudes, and increase helping intentions. A 2 x 2 between-subjects experimental study (N=243) was conducted, and results show that both framing the cause of depression as uncontrollable and using a narrative format are effective in reducing stigma and increasing the willingness to help people with depression. Although narrative formats affect emotional responses as well as cognitive judgments, controllability attributions may function differently, not influencing sympathy.

Interestingly, social-networking sites (SNSs) provide platforms in which users can view exchanges between their network and engage in social comparison. This study examines the resulting anger from perceived under-rewarded exchanges between Facebook users and their close friends, as well as traits that affect this outcome. Results from an online experiment (N = 95) found a moderated mediation model in which network awareness—a novel measure of attention paid to one’s social environment—mediated the relationship between intensity of Facebook use and anger, and understanding of other-based reciprocity (knowing the reciprocity beliefs of one’s network) moderated the direct effect of Facebook use intensity on anger and their indirect effect via network awareness.",Negative Socioemotional Performances in Social Media,Communication and Technology

However, scant attention has been paid to impression management in cultures where surveillance is the norm. This qualitative study of Azerbaijan, an honor culture with both of a norm of surveillance and severe repercussions for deviating from behavioral codes, explores how youth are managing their online impressions. We find that social media are an onerous place for Azerbaijanis. Paradoxically, social media are an additional space for young women to adhere to codes of modesty and chastity, which is in contrast to the norms of disclosure on these sites. For young men, social media can be a battlefield of status. Young Azerbaijanis use the same strategies previously identified in literature; but the ramifications of negative impressions are so severe that impression management is taken more seriously.",Negative Socioemotional Performances in Social Media,Communication and Technology

A Meta-Analysis of Factors Predicting Cyberbullying Perpetration and Victimization,3,"With the increasing popularity of information and communication technologies (ICT), cyberbullying has become a critical social issue, which severely threatens children and adolescents’ physical and psychological health. This study aims to systematically examine the risk factors of cyberbullying. Specifically, this study identified nine predictors of cyberbullying perpetration and victimization, and examined the magnitude of the effects of these predictors by meta-analyzing 54 empirical studies regarding cyberbullying, which represented a total sample of 94,504 participants and yielded a data of 156 independent correlations. The results revealed that risky ICT use, moral disengagement, social norms, traditional bullying perpetration, and victimization were the main predictors of cyberbullying perpetration, while risky ICT use, moral disengagement, depression, and traditional bullying victimization were the major contributors of cyberbullying victimization. According to moderator analysis, country of the sample is a significant moderator of depression and cyberbullying victimization.

The current study uses a 2 (celebrity gender: female vs. male) x 2 (attractiveness level: low vs. high) x 9 (message repetition) mixed factorial experiment to investigate the effectiveness of celebrity Facebook posts against cyberbullying. Participants (N = 313) read anti-cyberbullying Facebook posts and rated the posts and their viral, civic, and bystander behavioral intentions. Results showed that participants’ evaluations and behavioral intentions were highest when the Facebook status updates were posted by female celebrities who were high on attractiveness, while posts by male celebrities were more effective when they had low levels of attractiveness. The study also tested a moderated mediation model showing that effects of celebrity gender and attractiveness on bystander behavioral intentions were mediated through viral and civic behavioral intentions.

Participants watched two television comedy programs, one of which displayed a mock feed of positive social media comments. In addition, the presence of a confederate was randomly assigned who either exhibited positive or negative feedback during each clip. Participants who watched the program with a mirthful confederate were more likely to perceive that the other participant enjoyed the program than participants who watched with a confederate who exhibited negative program responses. In addition, our results suggest that the effects of social media sentiment on program enjoyment and bandwagon perception are moderated by 1) the valence of co-viewer response and 2) by viewers’ prior exposure to the attitude object.

It is based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and, more specifically, the Social Cognitive Model of Media Attendance by LaRose and Eastin (2004), additionally integrating parental and peer influences. In a survey with 1.477 adolescents aged 12 to 19, habit strength was shown to be the most consistent predictor for news consumption. Moreover, differences between media channels were found. While parental influence was related to TV and newspaper consumption, peers influenced online news attendance. However, the model explained only small to moderate portions of the variance in adolescents’ news exposure. This result might indicate the relevance of incidental, unintended news exposure not accounted for by SCT.

Today, however, citizens face more opportunities than ever to select media content according to their personal preferences and interests – leading to what previous research has identified as a polarization between news-seekers and news-avoiders. Given heightened concerns regarding growing shares of news-avoiders in particular, this study analyses the development, stability and family influences on Swedish adolescents’ news habits over time. The findings, based on panel survey data among adolescents and their parents, show that (1) news-avoidance is fairly permanent at the individual level, that (2) parents’ own news consumption is the most consistent predictor of adolescents’ development of news habits, and that (3) these family effects are distinct from adolescents’ personal motivations for seeking out news.",Social Influence on Media Use and Effects (TOP PAPER ENTRY),Mass Communication

After discussing ‘how’ and ‘to what extent’ can Goffman's concepts be re-contextualized in understanding the dynamics of the sport acts, I integrate them into a multidimensional analytic model, contributing thus to both a diversification of the analytical approaches of the sport ethos, as well as to a corollary operationalization process. The model of sport dramaturgy that I have built covers: the dramaturgical dimension, the strategic dimension and the ritual dimension of sport acts as complementary elements that can provide an integrative perspective upon the sport dynamics. Every dimension implies a specific definition for the competitive situation, for the sport actor and for his dispositional orientation when faced with a competitive situation.",Sport Communication Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The current study sought to advance both theory and application, by examining advice response theory (ART) to refine understanding of how parental advice might encourage or discourage children from engaging in healthy habits. While some ART propositions were supported, others were not. Children responded more favorably to advice when it was higher in politeness, and emotionally coped better when advice was more efficacious. Parent characteristics were both directly and indirectly influential on advice outcomes; specifically, the child’s rating of parent-child relational satisfaction colored all advice ratings (i.e., child with more satisfactory relationships reported the advice was higher in quality). Furthermore, children evaluations of parental persuasion success (i.e., change, novelty, confirmation) drove advice outcomes both in terms of emotional coping and problem solving.",Sport Communication Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This challenges the perception of commodification as a largely negative and passive process. By aligning itself with other professionalized sports, such as soccer, basketball and football, professional Ultimate Frisbee leagues are re-branding ultimate as part of an effort to expand its fan base. This study empirically evaluates how a historically marginalized sport seeks to remake its image, and how its internal conflicts impact its ability to create a cohesive external message. Fundamentally, media play a key role in structuring outside perception.

Psychological research has shown that people are generally averse to uncertainty and that uncertainty and ambiguity lead to fear and decreased confidence. The expectation that uncertainty in economic news fosters pessimism is confirmed in a time series analysis of Danish monthly aggregated newspaper data, consumer confidence data and economic indicators between 1996 and 2012. Uncertainty in Danish economic news negatively impacts consumer confidence, after controlling for real economic developments and the tone of the news. Uncertainty in economic news also increases asymmetry responses to information, makes the population more susceptible to negative economic news. The impact of uncertain information is particularly strong during periods of economic recession.",The Study of Business and Economic News,Mass Communication

In this research, I examine the conditions under which exposure to media content influence personal economic expectations for the proximate year. In addition, I investigate the effects of acquiring information via interpersonal communication and negative economic experiences on personal economic expectations. Results are based on an integration of a four-wave national panel survey and media content data of the same period. Findings show that all three sources of information have an impact on the changes of personal economic expectations over time. The media effect was significant when accounting for exposure to personal economic stories and negative economic news on tabloid outlets. In addition, the effect of negative economic experiences on personal economic expectations was higher for individuals who discussed frequently about the economy. Implications of these results are further discussed.",The Study of Business and Economic News,Mass Communication

Employing web-mining techniques on 35 leading news sites in the 10 most popular internet languages, we calculated the relative prominence of countries in the world’s economic news, and traced its trend over four years of economic recession from 2009-2012. Our findings suggest that major changes in GDP, even of relatively small economies, are no less important than the overall GDP, in explaining the prominence of countries in world economic news. Time-lag analysis of change in GDP and in news prominence identified three types of relation between news prominence and economic performance, reflecting the extent of world interest, press freedom, and the availability of reporting facilities. Network analysis of country co-mentions revealed three ripples when crisis hits non-core European countries: First, Europe’s leading economies, then global leading economies, and finally global developing economies. We discuss the implications of our findings to future research in the field.",The Study of Business and Economic News,Mass Communication

In line with previous theoretical and empirical work, the results of this study support the hypothesis that the civility of comments influences the extent to which individuals pay attention and contribute to online news discussions. Furthermore, the findings indicate that individuals who most frequently read and post news comments actually tend to be more moderate/independent in terms of ideology and political partisanship than others. Lastly, this study highlights avenues for future research in journalism and mass communication around factors exogenous to news production that promote civility and interactivity within online news comment communities.","Online Comments and the News: Interactivity, Perception, and Political Function",Journalism Studies

The results show that source expertise had a significant influence on perceptions of article credibility, as the individuals judged the article more credible when the public comments embedded in the story were from expert sources (e.g., scientists) than when they were from non-expert sources (e.g., Twitter users). This was found to be especially the case with high-frequency news users and regardless of whether the comments were for or against GMOs. The results suggest that Internet users mainly use peripheral or heuristic route of information processing in their evaluations of online news credibility.

Based on a sample of 517 undergraduate students, the results indicate that those who have a higher level of agreeableness and narcissism tend to feel more self-efficacious and motivated for posting comments on online news. External self-efficacy for commenting on online news also positively predicts the user motivations for posting comments. Moreover, among various motivations, helping/informing, getting feedback, and pass time/exhibitionism positively predict the frequency of posting on online news comments sections, while social connection serves as a major predictor of posting comments on an online news platform shared by one’ self or friends on social network sites.

The analysis elucidated expectations of how the media should report important political and social events and how commenters should effectively engage with one another in discourse. The analysis showed that American and French online commenters expect journalists to follow through with traditional journalistic norms of fully reporting information, setting the issue agenda, and refraining from sensationalizing. Commenters expect fellow participants in discourse to ascribe to traditional journalistic norms of being accurate and transparent with their sources, however, there was also an expectation that commenters should behave in accordance with traditional social norms of being respectful, tolerant, and engaging in intelligent commentary.","Online Comments and the News: Interactivity, Perception, and Political Function",Journalism Studies

Although there is the increased availability of mobile devices and health apps, little is known about motivational factors predicting health app adoption and use. The aim of this study was to identify motivational factors that predict the adoption and use of health apps (i.e., health app engagement). To identify the motivational factors, 391 college students were surveyed and survey questions considered the effects of media exposure to health information, interpersonal communication on health issues and psychological factors (e.g., attitude, usefulness, peer norm, and self-efficacy) on health app engagement.

By discussing the niche theory and media repertoire theory, this paper argues that the existing frameworks of media competition suffer from the unit level problem of defining user-gratification dimensions and miss the cross-activity effects of the media use harnessing various functions of the digital devices. Hence, the paper suggests an alternative approach to complement these limitations by setting the boundary of the dimensions and user-centric activity based research, instead of focusing on functions of the media devices. A case study examining the relationship between the use of smartphones and computer devices for information and communication activity is conducted to emphasize these points.

Through this reciprocal communication, government organizations and officials are increasingly leveraging ICTs to enable participation in politics and civic life. This paper focuses on the use of mobile technology to facilitate political participation by means of reporting local problems by engaging in 311 systems through telephone hotlines or mobile applications, and investigates its capacity to facilitate participation that is deeply democratic versus merely efficient. To explore this, we ask, what are the differences between traditional 311 hotlines and mobile apps? Can mobile versions of these traditionally telephone-based systems be said to increase civic behavior or disposition, or do they simply facilitate efficient transactions with government?",Mobile Motivations,Communication and Technology
2015-0882,2015,Paper Session,Suggestions for Tailored Interventions for Healthy Dietary Behaviors Based on Interaction Effects of Socioeconomic Status and Health Locus of Control Beliefs,2,"It has been suggested that healthy dietary behavior (HDB) is influenced by both socioeconomic factors and one’s control beliefs. Specifically, a higher socioeconomic level and an internal health locus of control (HLC) were perceived as strong predictors of HDB. However, few studies have investigated the way individuals’ control beliefs are influenced or shaped by differentiated dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES) so as to affect HDB. This study examines how the SES moderates the relationship between internal/external HLC beliefs and HDB. Using Annenberg National Health Communication Survey data collected from 2005 through 2012, this study found that both internal and external HLC beliefs predicted HDB. Moreover, the positive effect of the internal HLC on HDB was enhanced in respondents with a higher education and income level, whereas that of the external HLC was more significantly weakened as the respondents’ education level increased. Our results imply that the design and delivery of tailored communication messages according to different SES and HLC beliefs should be considered for effective public health interventions.","Diet, Exercise, Weight, and Health",Health Communication

A survey of U.S. adult females analyzed the relationship between perceived deception, social norms, individuals’ product use, and the perceptual and behavioral components of the third-person effect. Results of a structural equation model (SEM) revealed that perceived deception predicted both third-person perception and support for online advertising regulation. Individuals’ personal use of weight-loss products and their perceived injunctive norms were negatively correlated with third-person perceptions. Findings are discussed in the context of their theoretical contributions to third-person effect research and their implications for online product advertising regulation.","Diet, Exercise, Weight, and Health",Health Communication

However, overweight and obesity negatively influences one’s body image, which is further instigated by media’s thin-body ideal. While the prevalence of overweight/obesity is higher among non-Western ethnic minorities than among their Caucasian counterparts, their body image is understudied. Therefore, the current study examined the body image of Dutch children of non-Western ethnic minorities. Fifty non-Western ethnic minority children (aged 8-12) participated in this qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Actual BMI and perceptions of self and ideal body sizes were assessed prior to the interviews. Results revealed, among others, that these children generally underestimate their current body size while preferring thin and ‘normal’ body sizes. Results further revealed important insights into other key themes as related to media, peer, parent, and teacher preferences, nutritional habits, and children’s beliefs about school based-interventions. A primary task for future interventions is to address culturally sensitive awareness about actual body size and healthy body images.","Diet, Exercise, Weight, and Health",Health Communication

Previously, there was a common assumption that female politicians wishing to succeed had to adopt the male communication model, both verbally and nonverbally. This study aims to examine the communication patterns of women in the political sphere. Twenty-four speeches by 12 female politicians in senior political positions from five democratic Western countries were analysed. All speeches were delivered in the respective countries’ legislatures, between 2009-2012. This study presents a theoretical framework that maps the stereotypical gender patterns of verbal/nonverbal communication. The findings delineate an advanced communication model that indicates that female politicians’ communication consists of a combination of feminine nonverbal communication patterns and masculine verbal communicative expressions. The study expands the theoretical and analytical research on female politicians and develops a gender-communication approach to political communication.",Gender Discourses in Professional Practices,Feminist Scholarship

While much has been said about the exploitative potentials of big data, less has been written about the ways professions are demanded to change in accordance to the regime of calculation and prediction. My essay examines the gendered undertones of big data focusing on the human resource (HR) occupation. It asks the question of whether a big data epistemology produces unequal gender relevance in the corporate structure. Using both a historical study and a textual analysis, I tie the current challenge of ‘hard numbers’ in an occupation characterized by ‘soft skills’ to a broader struggle of femininity and patriarchal capitalism. The occupation’s historical challenge with its gendered assumption illuminates on the current big data struggle, and show how patriarchy continues to produce inequality in workplaces.",Gender Discourses in Professional Practices,Feminist Scholarship

This theoretical essay examines the pertinent literature in psychology, anthropology, and communication to observe that: (a) synchrony is a universal phenomenon rooted in both
biopsychological and sociocultural forces of entrainment; (b) differences in cultural synchronic systems render at least some level of stress-producing dyssynchrony in intercultural interactions; and (c) the challenge of dyssynchrony, in turn, presents an opportunity for individual communicators to initiate and facilitate synchrony in their intercultural interactions. Based on these observations, the author argues that a person’s ability to foster synchrony is a basic dimension of intercultural communication competence, and puts forth four theorems in which two categories of communication behaviors, individuation and consonance, and two identity orientations, inclusivity and security, are explained as key factors contributing to an individual’s ability to foster intercultural synchrony.",Top Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

In the end, we examined how the interactions with our campaign account on the social networking site affect PRC sojourners’ perceived discrimination and finally their stereotyping toward Singaporeans. The results showed that for our campaign audiences, imagined contact introduced by interactions on social media significantly reduces their perceived discrimination and stereotyping. Face-to-face encounters with host nationals, however, did not significantly affect perceived discrimination. In sum, our findings indicated that a well-designed and supervised social media campaign could be a powerful tool in reducing young sojourners’ bias and stereotyping towards the host society.",Top Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

A 14-item workplace ostracism scale (WOSP) was created to measure workers` likelihood of ostracizing coworkers. One-hundred and sixty-two undergraduate students with work experience involving interaction with coworkers completed the Big Five Inventory (including agreeableness), the WOSP, and other demographic and workplace background measures. An exploratory factor analysis yielded two different factors of the WOSP: inclusion and exclusion. Multiple regression analysis showed that agreeableness positively predicted workplace inclusion and negatively predicted workplace exclusion, as expected. Also, participants reported ostracizing coworkers more in workplaces with a norm that is tolerable of ostracism. This implies that by promoting an inclusive workplace norm, managers can reduce the prevalence of ostracism. The WOSP shows promise as a measurement tool to advance the understanding of dispositional and environmental factors on ostracizing others at work.","B.E.S.T.: The Dark Side of Organizations--Paranoia/Paradox, Risk/Disaster, Invisibility, Unemployment, Ostracizing and Beyond...",Organizational Communication

Furthermore, organizational dilemmas can create higher risk or concerns for safety of organizational members. This study examines the dilemma of paradox messages in high-risk, high-consequence organizations, such as an urban fire department. Communication dissemination among groups can either enhance or inhibit communication regarding organizational information. When disseminated messages contain paradox information, however, larger issues may arise. Therefore, this study first outlines barriers to group communication dissemination and then applies the framework of paradox of structure (i.e., paradox of design, adaptation, punctuation, and formalization) to provide a basis of understanding for these organizational barriers. Findings indicate that the paradox of structure component of design is the most prevalent paradox and that organizational culture plays an important role when examining the paradox of structure.","B.E.S.T.: The Dark Side of Organizations--Paranoia/Paradox, Risk/Disaster, Invisibility, Unemployment, Ostracizing and Beyond...",Organizational Communication

Applicants in this study used moral accounts to (re)frame their identity, which was problematic due to the social stigma of unemployment. Moral accounts gave applicants the discursive power to avoid accountability for problems that threatened their moral identity as workers: a history of unemployment, a current state of poverty, failure to pass a skills test, accepting illegal wages from a past employer, and criticizing a previous employer. Speaking in the name of figures of legitimacy–other persons, rules, procedures, situations, and ideologies–gave applicants the power to neutralize these problems and frame their identity as morally good.","B.E.S.T.: The Dark Side of Organizations--Paranoia/Paradox, Risk/Disaster, Invisibility, Unemployment, Ostracizing and Beyond...",Organizational Communication

The longer people grapple with unemployment the more likely they are to seek help from unemployment support organizations. This study takes a comparative, critical ethnographic approach to the study of unemployment support organizations across social class lines to uncover the way that the organizational cultures of these organizations are classed. The findings reveal that social class as an organizing principle is deeply embedded into the way that white-collar and blue-collar job seekers look for work. Ultimately, this study discovered the ways social class materially and discursively emerges in the cultures of unemployment organizations.

While other studies of stigmatization have demonstrated how individuals or groups are able to construct positive ways of coping with stigma, by contrast our data (from media, management and employees) suggests that stigmatization is reinforced in the interplay between media and management in vicious circles of paranoia that become defining for employees and organizational identity. Our findings reveal previously unreported aspects of stigmatization that demonstrate how paranoia itself becomes a coping mechanism and how organizational paranoia is produced and reproduced in self-fulfilling processes that seem to be irrecoverable.

Although brothels need to construct a legitimate corporate reputation in order to survive as a business, laws meant to contain their core-stigma threaten their ability to build or maintain widespread organizational legitimacy. Brothels address this legitimacy problem by adopting deviance management strategies in order to build moral, cognitive, and market legitimacy. However, the “appropriate” employment of these strategies is complicated by the realization that brothel workers experience a dialectical tension between normative dictates to “lay low in the sagebrush” and to increase transparency and visibility.","B.E.S.T.: The Dark Side of Organizations--Paranoia/Paradox, Risk/Disaster, Invisibility, Unemployment, Ostracizing and Beyond...",Organizational Communication

Assisi House is a Catholic Worker hospitality house run by self-identified anarchists, who care for the homeless as and alongside acts of protest and civil disobedience. Assisi House operates largely without government oversight, is not registered as a non-profit and does not accept funding from agencies that require transparency. This study uses 162 hours of participant observation and 15 interviews to examine how Assisi House navigated the need to operate autonomously and out of sight and the need to secure and maintain support through visibility within the community. The results have implications not only for the study of hidden organizations, but also offer an alternative to the increasing marketization of nonprofit organizing.","B.E.S.T.: The Dark Side of Organizations--Paranoia/Paradox, Risk/Disaster, Invisibility, Unemployment, Ostracizing and Beyond...",Organizational Communication

In particular, this study analyses the negotiation of intimate public self-disclosure among adults through different social media platforms: Badoo, CouchSurfing and Facebook, where users interact with both strangers and existing relationships. The research gathers user’s perspectives of their own concept of intimate information (visual and textual) in the context of social media. The combination of user profile analysis and interviews was useful to understand what kind of information participants considered intimate and why they decided to publish it or not.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #2,Communication and Technology

With data from a 2012 survey (N=622), the final well-fitting structural equation model revealed that teen online privacy concerns were primarily influenced by parental concerns about teens’ online privacy and parental interpersonal trust, whereas teen privacy protection behaviors were primarily predicted by teen cost-benefit appraisal of online interactions. In addition, teen online privacy concerns predicted increased privacy protection behaviors and lower teen information disclosure. Finally, restrictive and instructive parental mediation exerted differential influences on teens’ privacy protection behaviors and online information disclosure.",Privacy Issues With Social Media #2,Communication and Technology
2015-0907,2015,Paper Session,Actor Diversity and Viewpoint Diversity: Two of a Kind? A Study on the Content Diversity of News About Immigration in Flanders,2,"News content diversity is considered to be an essential precondition for the promotion of social pluralism. This content analysis of newspaper articles about immigration (2013-14) in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking community of Belgium, allowed for an in-depth evaluation of diversity. Firstly, we used Simpson’s standardised diversity index to measure the distribution of the different actors, issues and viewpoints in the news, and compared the results between newspapers. Overall, we found there to be differences in levels of content diversity between quality and popular newspapers. Secondly, our results show that a plurality of active (that is, quoted or paraphrased) actors in the news seems to go hand-in-hand with a diverse range of viewpoints. Finally, our findings indicate that allowing for individual immigrants to talk in a news article is fundamental to promoting a more positive representation of immigration in the news.",Diversity in the News,Journalism Studies
2015-0908,2015,Paper Session,Are Newspapers’ News Stories Becoming More Alike? A Study of Media Content Diversity in Flanders,5,"In recent years, communication scholars have expressed concerns about the diversity of the media content. While we are in an era of ‘media abundance’—the number of outlets and channels has increased enormously—the diversity of the news content seems to have decreased. However, longitudinal empirical evidence is lacking. That is the scientific gap this paper aims to fill. It studies whether newspapers in Flanders (Belgium), over time, have indeed become less diverse in terms of the news stories that they cover or not. Based on data from a content analysis of eight Flemish newspapers (2003-2013), it shows that 1) newspapers have indeed become more alike in terms of news stories; 2) newspapers with a similar profile (elite/popular) are more homogenous than newspapers with dissimilar profiles; and 3) newspapers belonging to the same owner (media concentration) are, and become even more, homogenous than newspapers belonging to different media groups.",Diversity in the News,Journalism Studies
2015-0909,2015,Paper Session,Why is There Diversity in the News? On the Explanatory Power of Structure and Practice,2,"This study offers the first multidimensional process-oriented account of news diversity by reconstructing the work dynamic behind hundreds of individual news items (N=848), across popular and elite press, and encompassing print, broadcast and online Israeli media, breaking with previous work which studied diversity on fewer media, on the basis of news content or by reference to fewer practices. A controversy can be detected in the literature regarding the rationales underlying diversity in news production. An institutional school argues that diversity levels change as a function of organizational dictates; a cultural view posits that it's all about widely held social values and ideologies; a pragmatic view explains diversity in terms of a practical necessity. Our findings suggest that institutional and pragmatic considerations are paramount in explaining diversity in the news, while the role of social and cultural values remains intractable. We discuss the deeper theoretical and methodological consequences of this finding.",Diversity in the News,Journalism Studies
2015-0910,2015,Paper Session,Journalistic Views on Gender and Ethnic Diversity in News Coverage: An Interview Study,3,"This study provides insight into the extent to which gender and ethnic diversity is deliberately taken into consideration in journalistic practice. Based on in-depth interviews with Flemish print journalists, four categories of journalist’s views could be derived. The first two categories consider diversity as relevant. Nevertheless, the Flemish press is not gender or ethnic diverse. The first category claims that the practice of news reporting does not make it possible to pursue a diverse source selection. The second category argues that reality is not gender or ethnic diverse: women and ethnic minorities play a less prominent role in society. The two other categories of journalists consider diversity in news as irrelevant. One argument is that diversity as a selection criterion conflicts with the news making process (category 3), another is that all individuals are equal (category 4), and consequently there should be no emphasis on the differences between people.",Diversity in the News,Journalism Studies
2015-0911,2015,Paper Session,"The Internal Communication Role of the Chief Executive Officer: Communication Channels, Style, and Effectiveness",1,"This study explores the internal communication role of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) by examining their communication channels, style, and quality, as well as their influence on employee–organization relational outcomes. Results of an online survey of 545 employees who work for a variety of organizations indicated that CEOs most frequently use email and face-to-face channels, such as employee meetings and management by walking around, to communicate with employees. The social media presence of CEOs positively and strongly correlates with their communication responsiveness and quality, as well as employee–organization relational outcomes. The responsive communication style of CEOs likewise positively influences the quality of CEO communication, which subsequently affects employee relational outcomes. The assertive communication style of CEOs demonstrates a small but significant positive effect on the quality of employee–organization relationships. The significant theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","Leadership, Employee Communication, and PR profession",Public Relations

The integrated model of excellent leadership in public relations (Meng & Berger, 2013) provides conceptual foundations for this paper. A survey of Latvian (n=111) and Russian (n=215) public relations professionals is used to address the following research questions: (1) what issues are important to public relations leaders in Latvia and Russia?, (2) what action strategies do Latvian and Russian public relations leaders use to deal with these issues?, (3) what leadership abilities in public relations are valued in Latvia and Russia?, and (4) what actions should be taken to facilitate the development of future leaders in public relations in Russia and Latvia?

Because of their credibility, employees’ can support PR to preserve or restore organizational reputation. In this research we explore the role of organizational identification and internal corporate communication (ICC) in the event of negative media coverage for employees’ assertive and defensive impression management behaviors. Results from an online survey among employed persons reveal that employees’ identification with their work organization positively influences their assertive as well as defensive reactions. ICC has a more differentiated influence on employees’ reactions: If ICC is evaluated well, employees’ assertive reactions increase; if evaluated poorly, employees’ exhibit more defensive reactions. These findings show that ICC can make a difference in winning employees as ambassadors for the organization in critical situations.","Leadership, Employee Communication, and PR profession",Public Relations

A model of authentic leadership, symmetrical and transparent communication, perceived authenticity, and employee engagement is proposed and tested in the Chinese context. Derived from surveying 406 participants in China online, the results confirm that perceived authenticity is the mediating variable between authentic leadership and symmetrical and transparent internal communication that in turn, leads to employee engagement. That is, authentic leaders’ engagement in symmetrical and transparent communication positively affects the organizational authenticity as perceived by employees that drives their engagement. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.","Leadership, Employee Communication, and PR profession",Public Relations
2015-0916,2015,Paper Session,Journalism and Embodied Vulnerability: Toward a Reparative Reading of Reportorial Practice,1,"Recent journalistic accounts of the so-called “border children” — unaccompanied minors crossing the US-Mexico border — are an example of journalism’s attention to children at risk, and in particular the representation of their embodied vulnerability. This reportorial practice has been interpreted by scholars as exploitative and voyeuristic, reflecting a critical stance that Ricoeur termed a “hermeneutics of suspicion.” By contrast, in this paper I turn to Sedgwick’s notion of “reparative reading” to reconsider journalism’s attention to embodied vulnerability. Drawing on the feminist moral theory of the ethics of care, I argue that journalistic themes of the embodied vulnerability of children have the potential to catalyze an engagement with suffering that can generate solidarity and healing alliances among audiences. By situating this journalistic practice in relation to the ethics of care as moral theory, I offer a “reparative reading” of journalism’s narratives of victimization, using the trope of embodied vulnerability to argue for journalism’s far-reaching epistemic value.","Marginality, Vulnerability, and Protest in Journalism and Media Practices","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0917,2015,Paper Session,Examining the Figure of the Digital Freelancer in the Global “War on Terror”,1,"This article examines the challenges faced by two freelance war reporters covering the ""war on terror,"" looking first at Kevin Sites' controversy in Iraq and then at Paul Wendle's nearly fatal experience in Afghanistan. The freelance correspondent’s role in the transnational production of political knowledge needs more scrutiny from critical communication scholars, not only because of this figure’s status as a socially-inscribed media producer, but also because of the freelancer’s potential circulation as a discursive figure—one that reinforces or troubles the transnational public’s understanding of war. Freelance reporters are not staff employees, and thus their journalistic authority can either be bolstered or disavowed by the organizations that selectively invoke or erase their involvement in the process of reporting on transnational conflict. Because they increasingly work across media platforms and without large crews, the freelancers of the 21st century are lucrative replacements for staff correspondents, especially since news organizations can opt out of paying for their insurance or safety training. Yet, freelancers can also be abused and discarded as soon as they begin to trouble accepted notions of journalistic authority—authority that is both a discursive and a political-economic construction.","Marginality, Vulnerability, and Protest in Journalism and Media Practices","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

This paper analyzes the political content and organizational processes to reveal different ideologies and conceptions of power in specific media activist theories and practices. Integrating several competing conceptions of alternative media theory, including subcultures (Hebdige 1979), radical media (Downing 2001), critical media (Fuchs 2010), and community media (Bailey, Cammaerts and Carpentier 2011), four distinct categories emerge—DIY media, community and citizen media, critical media, and autonomous or anarchist media. This synthesized taxonomy provides a better understanding of key differences among the political projects and theories of alternative media. Relationships among these distinct types of alternative media may then be examined, including how they participate in global media flows and produce specific affordances in contemporary media activism practices (Mattoni 2013).","Marginality, Vulnerability, and Protest in Journalism and Media Practices","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0919,2015,Paper Session,Regimes of Time: Media Practices of the Dispossessed,1,"Media technologies are structuring time and space in crucial ways. Especially the temporal aspect has been of interest lately, which is expressed in a growing commentary on media-related temporality in terms of speed, acceleration and the end of time. The article asks for the consequences of temporal structuring by media technologies for civic participation and more specifically protest movements. Using two case studies – the unemployed workers movements of the 1930s and the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011/2012 – it explores the changing regimes of time that are related to dominant media technologies. The main aim is to disentangle the relationship between temporal regimes suggested by dominant media technologies and their appropriation by protest movements that emerged in major economic crises. Combing archival materials with in-depth interviews the paper discusses the role of media practices for the two movements and uncovers a shift from mechanical speed to digital immediacy having crucial implications for democracy and civic participation.","Marginality, Vulnerability, and Protest in Journalism and Media Practices","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-0920,2015,Paper Session,Answering the Mobile Summons: Managing Multiple Communicative Activities Across Copresent and Mediated Modalities,3,"The mobile phone has become embedded into our everyday lives, allowing us to be in almost constant contact with colleagues, acquaintances, and those with whom we are closest (Ling, 2012; Ling & Campbell, 2009). As a result of their ubiquity, mobile phone use may occur (and thus become interactionally salient) during already in-progress face-to-face activities. Though research has examined how mobile telephony is managed during face-to-face social interactions (e.g., Aaltonen, Arminen, & Raudaskoski, 2014; Humphreys, 2005), virtually no research has examined how participants orient to the audible chimes or vibrations that indicate the receipt of a text (or SMS) message from another mobile user, what we deem the mobile text summons.

Not only are such encounters oriented towards quasi-immediate sexual gratification, but they are collaboratively done so as to preclude repeat encounters and relational development, with the protagonists supposedly left unaffected emotionally, relationally and socially by their meeting. This creates a rather special - and analytically interesting - interactional dilemma when Grindr users initiate a social contact with potential partners, usually through the chat function integrated into the mobile app. The paper describes the way Grindr users have developed a particular ‘linguistic ideology’ which casts ordinary conversation as an interactional activity which is performed between (potential) friends and enables relational development. As thus, it is unsuitable for anonymous sexual encounters, the production of which is a distinctive and accountable interactional accomplishment.",Using Affordances of Mobile Communication to Build Relationships and to Negotiate Social Actions,Language & Social Interaction

This paper examines how mobile phones support intimate personal and romantic relationships in digitally emergent places, particularly Nigeria and argues that texting is an active and effective medium of interpersonal communication for enabling and sustaining social and romantic relationships. Data for this study comprise 217 text messages obtained from texters at different levels of heterosexual relationships namely, formal personal friendship, courtship/dating and marriage relationships. Fifty couples were interviewed to find out specific essential roles of texting in their relationships and the tendency of such roles to continue across their life span.",Using Affordances of Mobile Communication to Build Relationships and to Negotiate Social Actions,Language & Social Interaction

Interview and survey data from adults were analyzed using contrapuntal analysis to consider the personal benefits and limitations of sexting. Results indicate four tensions illustrating the opportunities and risks associated with adult sexting. Specifically, adult sexters described two tensions with partners: one where novelty is appreciated but where crossing over to grotesque behaviors and suggestions is a possibility; and another where sexual fantasy was positively explored but where misunderstandings between fantasy and reality were possible. Participants also described a tension between the personal pleasure they found with sexting and the shame invoked by culture as well as the possibility that their private interactions could become public.",Using Affordances of Mobile Communication to Build Relationships and to Negotiate Social Actions,Language & Social Interaction

A study was conducted with 177 college students in the southeastern part of the United States. The results revealed that the alert about the crisis that the university sends through text message is perceived to be more serious than an alert sent through Facebook. Regardless the medium of alert and crisis type, the first person notified would be someone sitting nearby.

Within the theoretical framework of attribution and social identity theory, this study conducted an experiment to examine the influence of congruence between Facebook users’ comments and BP’s messages regarding the public’s perceived image of BP. The results suggest that Facebook may potentially be an effective crisis communication tool in affecting public perception of an organization in crisis; however, the effects are limited to congruence between Facebook users’ comments and the organization’s messages, publics’ pre-crisis attitudes toward the organization, and publics’ perceived social connection to Facebook users.

FGM is a human rights violation against women and a current problem in both the US and UK where many immigrant communities practice FGM despite laws against it. Discourse analysis sought to determine how much coverage FGM received in the newspapers, which issues were most salient, and whose voices were heard. The issues and voices most prominently featured in news coverage impact public opinion and perception of FGM. How this relates to anti-FGM activists’ ability to garner support is explored along with the implications for anti-FGM campaigns in the US and UK. Findings show a vast difference in the amount and type of coverage between the two papers and this disparity underscores the need for this comparative study.",Ethnicity and Race Concerns Across Europe,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

For example, the majority of London’s inhabitants are ethnic minorities. Following Massey, city dwellers negotiate an intense situation of “throwntogetherness” (2005), as they live in the proximity of ethnic, racial and religious others. Shifting the dominant focus of media and migration scholarship from transnational communication towards local everyday practices, I develop the notion of digital throwntogetherness to chart relationships between geographically situated digital identifications and the urban politics of cultural difference and encounter. The argument draws from in-depth interviews with 38 young people living in Haringey, one of the most diverse areas in London, and builds on digital methods for network visualizations. Two Facebook user experiences are considered: transnational networking with loved ones scattered around the world and engagement with geographically proximate diverse digital identifications.",Ethnicity and Race Concerns Across Europe,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

In the six weeks of intensive public debate following its publication, the “Sarrazin debate” morphed into an “integration debate.” The Sarrazin debate revealed biopolitical social logics that divide the population according to their supposed potential for integration, which is to say, their potential for productivity within German society. The book, and the public debate it triggered, constituted a contentious public event through which the boundaries and values of the nation were discussed and consolidated. This study of press coverage and reader responses critically examines patterns and themes of public discourse on culture and integration and its role in managing difference and constructing the normative national core.

The extent to which problematic beliefs of this minority group are reflected or reinforced by news media, has received only limited attention. Therefore, this study sets out to investigate the factors that account for variation in how European news media frame Roma diagnostically and prognostically. We content analyzed 825 news articles from newspapers in the Netherlands, Germany, Slovakia, Czech Republic and the United Kingdom in the timespan 2010 – 2012. Results show that attention for Roma is clustered around key-events and differs between countries. Our analyses of frame variation, based on multilevel modelling, indicate a duality in the use of frames, with Roma being both portrayed as victims and perpetrators. Variation in these portrayals could be ascribed to temporal, content-specific and country characteristics.

Then, I could have had students apply this material as they decided how best to communicate this information to their employee. Instead of just laughing the exercise off, students could have used different rhetorical tactics that were designed to change the employee's behavior while simultaneously allowing the employee to ""save face"" during the conversation.",GIFTS & RIFTS Extended Session: Great and (New this Year) Reprehensible Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2015-0944,2015,Paper Session,GIFTS: Test/Retest: A Two-Stage Exam for Deep Analysis in the Social Sciences and Humanities,1,"Two-stage group exams are generally structured so that a student first takes a test individually and immediately after, in a small group, retakes the same or nearly the same exam. Research has indicated that the collaborative learning offered by the small group setting, as well as a requirement that the group to reach a consensus on the second exam answers, shows a measurable increase in learning for students (see Gilley and Clarkston, 2014). The assignment I am presenting resulted from an effort to translate these benefits to a non-STEM context. In courses in communication and media, for example, testable responses do not necessarily result in a single response on which students can gain consensus and which can be assessed as “correct,” thus complicating the role and benefit of the second, group stage. Reversing the order of the two-stage exam, however, allows students to work in groups to consider alternative components to open-ended questions and then synthesize them into an individual response. The goal of this assignment is to increase the level of critical thinking and retention in a humanities/social science setting by asking students to communicate and debate their responses with one another and thus reach a deeper level of understanding and become better versed in the process of constructing an analytical argument.

The reverse two-stage exam that I will present was developed to replace an existing midterm exam aimed at testing the students on their ability to structure an argument that analyzed new content while applying information from previous lectures and the textbook. Though it was implemented in a course on Documentary Film analysis, its strategy for evaluation and critical thinking is applicable to a wide range of courses in the social sciences and humanities.

Our reverse two-stage exam was administered over two class meetings. In the first, students were given a worksheet with open-ended questions that asked them to consider concepts from readings and lectures, and apply them to a short documentary, which we screened in class. In groups of 4, students then worked together to consider the questions, refine and expand their initial responses, and articulate their own arguments to one another. Students used these notes to write individual short essays that synthesized each of the questions into a cohesive argument and reflected the depth of understanding in the group discussion. Next, students exchanged their essays with a student from a different group, were given a detailed rubric, and evaluated each other’s papers, which are returned to the author before being turned in to the instructor. At the end of the first stage of the exam, students have been exposed to questions that break down how to analyze a documentary film while incorporating different elements; a discussion that includes alternate perspectives to make their initial responses more complex and fully articulated; a model of the elements that comprise a full argument in an essay response; a rubric for how the essays are graded, and have read the argument of another essay and had their own evaluated.

The second stage of the exam, administered at the next class meeting, follows similar steps, but is entirely individual. Students receive the midterm, with the same open-ended questions, and are asked to apply them to a new documentary. Individually, students write essays and turn them in to be graded according to the same rubric. Their midterm exam grade is comprised 20% of their responses from the first, group analysis, and 80% from their second, individual analysis.

This particular assignment was designed to serve a number of purposes: it offers a concrete structure for the exam and its grading, via the initial group worksheet and rubric; it allows for students to develop, revise, and deepen their individual analysis of the material; and it provides the opportunity to assess a classmate’s work and receive feedback on their own, thus increasing their understanding of both the material and how their responses are interpreted. Perhaps the most significant benefit of the assignment, though, is its ability to model the process of analysis that the original exam was meant to test; with the scaffolding of the reverse-two stage exam, students learn the components of a complex argument of visual analysis, are shown how to incorporate elements from reading and lecture and where primary evidence from the test film would be beneficial, and are encouraged to articulate their own perspectives and confront differing ones early in the process so as to be able to revise and incorporate them into their argument. In short, the revised two-stage exam instructs students on how to do complex analysis of open-ended material.

The results of the reverse two-stage exam in Documentary Film were encouraging. Compared to a one-stage individual on the same material asking the same questions that was administered in previous semesters, students submitted exams with more thorough, cohesive arguments that displayed a deeper understanding of the material and more complex critical thinking. The responses displayed multiple perspectives on the material, showing evidence that students had communicated with one another and synthesized information from others in their small groups in a larger setting. Retention and application were likewise boosted: The reverse two-stage exam was administered as a midterm, and in the latter half of the semester, students appeared more comfortable communicating their perspective to one another and were more adept at applying material from the text and lectures to their work.

Benefits of a reverse two-stage exam could translate well to a variety of courses across communication, media, and related fields, and I believe the assignment itself and the methods that comprise it would contribute well to an ongoing discussion on applying existing teaching practices to discipline- and course-specific needs.",GIFTS & RIFTS Extended Session: Great and (New this Year) Reprehensible Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Answer Garden provides students with an anonymous, but visual representation of the institutions their peers hold closest to them. Knowing more about the audience, students can adapt their speeches to account for particular sensitivities that either bring audience members together and enhance the speaker’s ethos or divide them and reduce it. Students enjoy this activity because it helps them conceptualize and operationalize the uniqueness of their audience. When students learn their submissions are completely anonymous, almost always some students submit inappropriate comments, offensive language, or irrelevant statements.

Then, in class students use the classroom as a Likert scale and move to places on the scale as they respond to position statements on identity (i.e. “People have one true self that they need to discover.” ). Students must explain why they responded as such and use course vocabulary.

2015-0951,2015,Paper Session,Abu Ghraib Photography and 'Torture Porn' Cinema: Exploring the Visual Relationship and Influence,1,"This qualitative study examines the visual parallels between Abu Ghraib iconography and the popular and successful ‘torture porn’ subgenre of horror that emerged post-9/11. Despite the commercial success of such torture porn movies as Hostel (2006) and the Saw franchise (2004-2010), critics and moviegoers alike were quick to denigrate the subgenre as “low culture” and lacking in artistic value. However, these “low” movies incorporated Abu Ghraib iconography and presented characters in visually similar torture positions, subverting existing political structures and manifesting cultural discomfort with government sponsored torture. Previous research connecting the torture at Abu Ghraib with horror cinema has focused on either figurative or allegorical connections, but this study focuses strictly on how visual parallels between the two indirectly challenged ongoing political issues by triggering the American public’s visual memory of the Abu Ghraib photographs depicting U.S. military’s torture and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners.",Visual Communication in Crisis and Trauma,Visual Communication Studies

2015-0953,2015,Paper Session,Visuals and Mass-Mediated Peace: Analysis of War and Peace Journalism Frames of the Boko Haram Crisis Coverage in Nigeria,1,"While the media is known as an information and entertainment source, some scholars (e.g Galtung 2002, Lynch 2014) have also proposed ‘advocacy journalism’ in addition. This study provides an insightful account of a complex conflict- the Boko Haram conflict in Northern Nigeria. It considers conflict reporting strategies by adopting the revolutionary peace and war journalism model by a Norwegian scholar Johan Galtung in investigating national versus international media practices in the visual coverage of regional terrorism. Galtung looked at the dichotomy in conflict coverage and views war and peace journalism as two varying frames in the coverage of conflicts.
Through visual analysis this study concentrates on the coverage of the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria in Nigerian Vanguard, The Nation, US' New York Times and Washington Post from January 2012 to October 2014. It considers the extent to which the newspapers visually covered the crisis based on war and peace frames. This period covers the most recent events of the Boko Haram situation in Nigeria, as well as the kidnap of over two hundred teenage girls by the sect, a major issue that drew the most global attention to the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria.",Visual Communication in Crisis and Trauma,Visual Communication Studies

2015-0955,2015,Paper Session,A Theoretical Account for Mature Adults Reluctance to Register as Organ Donors,4,"Mature adults (age 50-64) make up a large proportion of organ transplant recipients and waiting list candidates, yet are underrepresented in terms of actual donors. Understanding the reasons why mature adults fail to register as deceased organ donors is critical in achieving the goal of increasing the actionable supply of organs available for transplant. Two theoretical models, the noncognitive model (Morgan, Stephenson, Harrison, Afifi, & Long, 2008) and vested interest theory (Sivacek & Crano, 1982), are employed in the current study in an attempt to understand intentions to donate in a sample of adults. Results indicate that after partitioning the variance explained by bodily integrity, ick, jinx, and medical mistrust, the age myth accounted for attitudes toward registering as an organ donor among non-registered adults. Similarly, the age myth accounted for additional variance than that accounted for by salience, self-efficacy, and stake.

We extend critical work on transparency by discussing a photographic essay of aged-care workers in rest homes which intended to make aged-care work more visible and valued. While the photographs were meant to enable viewers to look into the daily reality of aged-care work, we show the visual essay instead acted as a heterotopic hall of mirrors, obscuring labour value to those unfamiliar with it, distant from it, and without insight. We argue organizational transparency needs to be understood as a practice of looking in relation to spatial practices of power. In this case, the politics of space and place obscured the images which attempted to present an authentic and transparent account of the reality of care-giving work.",Aging and Health Communication,Health Communication

To address this gap, this study investigates the relationship between attention and recall of information among younger and older adults. Using eye tracking, younger (< 65 yrs.) and older (≥ 65 yrs.) participants were exposed to a webpage consisting of text-only information, text with cognitive illustrations, or text with affective illustrations. When attention to text increased, older adults recalled more information, whereas younger adults did not. Younger adults paid more attention to cognitive illustrations than older adults, and recalled more information. Our study reveals that younger and older adults’ recall of health-related information is predicted by attention to different parts of online health-related information. These findings can be used to develop effective online health materials for both younger and older health consumers.",Aging and Health Communication,Health Communication

We investigate the question: How is leadership performed and perceived through communicative acts in virtual worlds? To answer this we created custom-built quests in Second Life and World of Warcraft, recruited players, and assigned them to small groups of 3-5 people. All chat, movements, clicks, and avatar features were recorded. We also surveyed them before and after the quests on four measures of leadership. We find that for both game contexts those who report high leadership traits are less likely to be perceived as leaders. Those who self-report having engaged in leadership are more likely to exhibit behaviors traditionally associated with leadership. Results suggest that people adapt their communication behaviors by utilizing the affordances available to them, and that standard measures of leadership may be missing important facets.",Individual and Group Behaviors in Virtual Space,Communication and Technology

The pre-survey asked participants to identify the challenges they expected to face in the project as well as the media they expected to use for communication purposes. The post-survey asked participants to identify the challenges they faced working in virtual teams and the media they used to complete the project.

Findings suggest that well-coordinated teams appeared to have anticipated the usefulness of social networking and richer communication channels early in the project as compared to less well-coordinated teams.

In a virtual reality lab setting 160 participants heard one of several narratives and played an unsolvable puzzle. Afterwards, participants filled out a questionnaire measuring the amount of presence in the virtual environment, involvement with the game, and transportation into the narrative. As hypothesized, transportation into the narrative predicted involvement with the game, which in turn predicted feelings of presence. In addition, chronological narratives elicited more transportation than disrupted narratives. These results are of interest to virtual reality game developers, and may be applied to other applications of virtual realities, like virtual studies or simulations for instruction purposes.",Individual and Group Behaviors in Virtual Space,Communication and Technology

Through a survey of college students in the two countries, this study analyzes and compares second screening frequency, types, platforms and motivations between Brazilian and US youth. In addition, this paper assesses how the interactive affordances of social media influence second screening on Twitter and Facebook. We find that despite lower Internet penetration, Brazilians second screen significantly more than Americans, especially interpersonally. Results also reveal that those who already take advantage of the interactive affordances of social media are more likely to engage in second screening within those platforms in both countries. We posit that second screening is an extension of interactivity within computer-mediated communication and that this unique audience-driven act works to bridge web-connected devices and activities to television to create a converged atmosphere.",Adolescent and Youth Social Media Behaviors,Communication and Technology

The diffusion of mobile internet into teenagers’ everyday life leads to far-reaching consequences concerning personality development and socialization. To get a clearer picture of these changes the current study focuses on young mobile internet users using data from a survey of 2.200 German adolescents. The analysis shows that a considerable share of adolescents accessing the internet on the go are prototypical produsers that use the social web in an active way. Especially girls are able to act out their communicative needs with mobile use of the internet. Mobile internet enhances the scope for action resulting in an intensification of both self-enabling as well as risky online user behavior.

2015-0966,2015,Paper Session,Media Multitasking and Wellbeing of College Students,4,"This study examines potentially divergent impacts of media multitasking behaviors on university students’ social and psychological wellbeing (indicated by social success, normalcy, depression, and self-control measures). To address inconsistent findings in the literature, we specify media multitasking behaviors by whether they are motivated by different goals, with different characteristics, and in specific contexts. Particularly, we consider the motivation of the primary task and the synchronicity feature of the tasks that differentiate media multitasking behaviors. Highly synchronized social interaction activities are found to be significantly and positively associated with social success, the feeling of normalcy, and self-control, and negatively associated with depression. However, multitasking during social interaction of high-synchronicity is negatively related to social success. Interestingly, although increased tendency of media multitasking during cognitive activity is linked with decreased level of self-control, media multitasking during entertainment activity is perceived to be positively related with social and psychological wellbeing indicators, such as social success, normalcy, and self-control.",Adolescent and Youth Social Media Behaviors,Communication and Technology

Specifically, we examined the role of how restrictive (i.e., rule-setting) and active (i.e., discussing content) mediation strategies were communicated to the adolescent: in a controlling, inconsistent, or autonomy-supportive way. Using survey data from 1,017 adolescents (10-14 yrs), we found that inconsistent restriction was positively related to violent media use, and indirectly, positively, related to ADHD-related behaviors via violent media consumption. Autonomy-supportive restriction was negatively related to violent media use, and indirectly, negatively, related to ADHD-related behaviors. Controlling restriction was also negatively related to violent media use, but not indirectly related to ADHD-related behaviors. Lastly, controlling or autonomy-supportive active mediation did not moderate the relationship between violent media use and ADHD-related behaviors.

Additionally, we explored the moderating role of children’s sex in the aforementioned relationships. To address these aims, parents of 865 children (3-7 years) kept four-day television diaries and completed a measure of ADHD-related behaviors. We found that ADHD-related behaviors were associated with more overall viewing and violent and scary content viewing, but this association only applied to boys. ADHD-related behaviors were not related to educational content viewing. Additionally, ADHD-related behaviors were related to increased arousal when viewing television, no matter the content. Finally, ADHD-related behaviors were associated with reduced attention to television in general and to educational content, but these behaviors were not associated with reduced attention to violent or scary content.",Recent Discoveries on the Relationship Between Media Use and ADHD,Children Adolescents and the Media

2015-0971,2015,Paper Session,Immigrants' Negotiations of Career Inheritance: A (Dis)Placement Framework,1,"Although research has explored how career and work are understood as legacy or inheritance in particular social contexts, scholars have called for more nuanced approaches relevant to cultural minorities and immigrants, attuned to the intersections of race, class, and gender, and negotiations of individual agency vis-à-vis institutional structures. My paper addresses this call, by outlining a framework centered on the communicative processes of (dis)placement, whereby actors make meaningful work values, stemming from the various sites they occupy. I argue, every instance of displacement also always includes a process of placement, or embedding oneself somewhere, so that career inheritance is an ongoing movement of navigating work and life across place and time. While extant work on career inheritance has focused on localized, or single community-based negotiations, this paper thus urges a consideration of the transnational and transcontextual meaning-making that shapes contemporary careers.","Global Perspectives on Immigrants, Identity, and CSR",Organizational Communication

Our findings suggest: 1) a blend of different CSR models operating—ethical/religious, statist, neoliberal, and stakeholder-based understandings; 2) a rhetorical emphasis on creating a “culture of CSR,” corporate governance, and institutionalizing communicative practice; and 3) three dialectics characterizing the discursive practices surrounding the CSR mandate (i.e., local/global, developmental/economic, and mandatory/obligator). We close by discussing implications for CSR and development studies.","Global Perspectives on Immigrants, Identity, and CSR",Organizational Communication

Through an analysis of Miami Herald news coverage related to incorporation and annexation policies and practices over a period of three years, we make the case for a stronger implication of the press in coverage of local policy- and place-making. Using a quantitative content analysis of 437 articles from the Miami Herald about communities affected by incorporation and annexation and a qualitative textual analysis of 51 articles related to general coverage of geographic policy-making in Miami-Dade County over a three year period, we argue that this coverage reveals the press as being a central feature and function of policy-making when viewed through the lens of city-making.",Local and Regional Journalism,Journalism Studies

Similar to community weeklies, these sites focus on a small, geographically defined community and are usually created to fill a certain gap in news coverage. Few studies, however, reveal much about these sites, those who work for them and whether they are a harbinger of new forms journalism or simply reflections of traditional media. Within the theoretical framework of hierarchy of influences and gatekeeping, this study examined the social characteristics of those who work in these sites, the media routines they follow and their interaction with, and perception of, user generated content. Findings reveal that journalistic routines and behaviors of the respondents working in hyperlocal media are similar to those practiced by journalists in mainstream media. Implications and future studies are addressed.",Local and Regional Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0977,2015,Paper Session,It’s Time to Start Paying Attention to Local News,1,"Local news has been the most popular form of news consumption in America for some time. While other types of news outlets continue to lose advertisers, gut their staffs, and shed subscribers, local news outlets are expanding. So why has it been all but left out of the important conversation taking place around news audience preferences? This paper uses an ordinal logistic regression analysis of Pew Research Center survey data to illustrate, among other things, that an interest in local news drives news consumption. In doing so, this paper makes the case for an increase in content analysis of local news, so that scholars interested in news audiences and media effects can have a better idea of what the news so many Americans regularly receive actually looks like.",Local and Regional Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0978,2015,Paper Session,The Subnational Media Approach: The Case of Mexican Provinces,1,"The main thesis is that in new federal democracies press-state relations are better understood with subnational unit of analysis rather than thought the traditional media systems narratives. I argue that after the breakdown of the Mexican authoritarian regime in the decade of 1990, hybrid political systems (combining democratic and authoritarian elements) emerged at a subnational level. This type of regimes are not authoritarian, not yet democracies; they held free and fair elections but violated systematically democratic institutions and intended to control media. Contrary to some authors who claim that Mexican press had became more free and independent in the last two decades, journalists and media outlets in Mexican provinces suffer the systematic attempt to fall out under the power of local incumbents that performed media-control strategies in their local jurisdiction. Those strategies include press-state clientelist-relations, censor and libel laws, and direct aggressions and harassment against journalists.",Local and Regional Journalism,Journalism Studies
2015-0979,2015,Paper Session,Transborder Journalism in the Danish-Swedish Oresund Region: A Case of Horizontal Europeanization?,4,"This article examines news and news production in the Oresund Region of Scandinavia. Theoretically the focus is on regionalization and transborder journalism as part of a wider process of horizontal Europeanization. Most studies on Europeanization concern themselves with vertical Europeanization that can be defined as the communicative linkages in news content between the national level (often the national Parliament and national politicians) and the European level (the institutions and actors of the EU). Fewer studies focus on horizontal Europeanization that can be defined as the communicative linkages in news media content between different member states of the EU. Also many studies on Europeanization tend to downplay the importance of news media practice and journalistic culture in the process of Europeanization. In this article we take the wider perspectives of regionalization and Europeanization theory and balance them with theories on news production. As a result we conclude that Danish and Swedish newspapers coverage of the Oresund Region may be seen as an example of weak horizontal Europeanization. However, the newspapers also face a number of challenges (some ideological, some organizational), when it comes to covering news that crosses even the narrowest of borders. First of all news is still inherently national in its focus and its choice of sources and thus few news items focus on the Oresund Region. Secondly journalists have little knowledge both politically and practically of what goes on in ‘the other country’. Thirdly journalists have established little or no cooperation across borders even if this could save both time and money.",Local and Regional Journalism,Journalism Studies

I construct this argument using data from U.S. university procedures for reporting violence on campus, including those processes governed by Title IX and the Clery Act. I argue that communication insulates the university in my case study—dubbed Western University (WU)—from noticing the incompleteness of its own knowledge. By relying upon a transmissive model of communication, WU downplays the interpretive aspects of reportable events. Furthermore, my analysis shows that WU reporting procedures are driven by whiteness, masculinity, and heteronormativity. In other words, WU’s organizational knowledge reflects power and privilege. I highlight how communication reinforces that power and privilege. As a whole, this piece builds upon existing organizational knowledge scholarship by highlighting how knowledge exceeds organizational members and is instead connected to broad social and historical power dynamics.",Top Four Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

This paper examines how local Liberians organized to combat Ebola. The paper presents a case study of an Ebola awareness campaign initiated by the Peace Network, Liberian citizens who organized initially with the goal of promoting peace in post-war Liberia. When Ebola hit Liberia, the Peace Network re-focused its efforts on the fight against Ebola. In our study of the campaign, we apply a structurational approach to understand the interplay between structure and agency in their organizing efforts. We relied on interviews with the campaign volunteers and their daily reports. Results reveal that structurational dynamics foreground organizing for social transformation through a mobilization process of what we call unwavering resilience.",Top Four Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2015-0983,2015,Paper Session,Social Media Policies and Corporate Social Responsibility,4,"Three global trends situate the context of this investigation: the increasing use of social media by organizations and their employees, the burgeoning presence of social media policies, and the heightened focus on corporate social responsibility. In this paper, these global trends are examined through a content analysis of 101 publicly available social media policies from top global corporations. Specifically, the extent to which social media policies facilitate and/or constrain the communicative sensibilities and values associated with contemporary CSR are considered, as well as regional and sectorial differences in policy contents. Overall, findings suggest that policies inhibit several communicative tenets of CSR (i.e., free speech rights, collective information sharing, and stakeholder engagement/dialogue) and diminish employee engagement in and influence over CSR activities. Thus, the promising affordances of social media for the inclusion of various voices in the public negotiation of what constitutes CSR are called into question.",Top Four Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

I describe the genesis of the project -- which uses narrative, performance (auto) ethnography, and dialogue to explore the relational, ethical, and political implications of cultural assimilation in my U.S. family of Puerto Rican descent. I focus particularly on the how and why of my choice of methodology and methods, as I address the ethical and relational perils (experienced and foreseen) of engaging in this form of intimate ethnography (Waterston & Rylko-Bauer, 2006), as well as the exigency of employing a form of new ethnography (Saukko, 2002) as a dialogic methodology to help me connect personal/family narratives with larger social paradigms. There are indeed perils and joys in working closely with members of my family of origin as research participants and sometimes as co-researchers.

The borderlands that my body has had to cross, physically and figuratively, have left many heridas abiertas (open wounds) but have also provided me with knowledge. This acute awareness, what Anzaldúa (1987) terms facultad, and the use of these tools are what I term pedagogical border crossings. These familial, communal, and cultural knowledges made it possible for me to become a professor and to continually reflect upon what it means to be a Mexicana academic. The pain and struggles, what my body has endured, are constant reminders of the collisions that happen between el primer y tercer mundo and how these experiences leave open wounds. The inextricable relationship between Mexico and the US is deepened as Mexicanos like me are forced to come to el norte, whether by choice or brought by parents. At almost eleven years old my life changed—I crossed, with the help of a coyote, into Los Angeles, California. Macro/institutional change and systems of oppression with anti-immigrant laws such as Proposition 187 alerted me to the vulnerabilities of being undocumented in the educational system. Xenophobic spaces and actions have influenced and shaped my epistemologies and my awareness/conocimiento about navigating anti-immigrant spaces.

2015-0988,2015,Paper Session,Footnotes Poetry: Moving Family Into the Text,1,"With this collection of ethnographic poetry, I explore affective and dialogic ways to include family in the qualitative research process - from design and data collection to analysis and data presentation. I consider how my family members - living and dead - were part of my research on pregnancy and prenatal care interactions. In such interactions, family stories and their meaning-making intersections become part of health communication and practices in everyday ways - not as formal advice, but as a bid for belonging and care. Making stories' creative and connecting prowess as a part of the research design, I conducted this project as a story-telling one, explicitly including tales of my own family while interviewing, thinking through and analyzing others’ stories, and writing a research text that straddles prose and poetry. I moved my family into the text before the text was written, a pre-text that became poetry. Here, I perform and discuss possibilities and challenges of such an approach in the context of critical health communication and narrative medicine. I propose a model for the use of feminist methodologies, particularly scientificity and “getting lost” (Lather, 2012), in health communication research and practices. Inspired by transnational and critical feminists, such as Anzaldúa and Lorde, this project focuses on the challenges and possibilities of including the multiplicity of selves and histories in research. Furthermore, it explores the limitations of such an approach in a field (health care) that is, still, markedly dominated by post-positivistic and objectivistic orientations to research.",Family in/as Fieldwork: Challenges and Possibilities of Researching (With) One's Own Family,Feminist Scholarship
2015-0989,2015,Paper Session,"Conversations About the Transition to Coresidence, Commitment, and Plans to Marry Among Nonengaged Cohabitors",3,"The goal of this study was to extend previous theoretical connections between sliding versus deciding and relationship outcomes. Non-engaged cohabiting couples (N = 103; 206 individuals) reported the occurrence of a conversation about the transition to co-residence, the content of the conversation(s), and their current commitment level and plans to marry. For women, having a conversation about living together (deciders), was associated with less constraint and more dedication commitment, compared to those who did not engage in conversation (sliders). Men and women who discussed relational topics reported less constraint and more dedication commitment. Men who discussed logistical topics reported less constraint commitment, but also less dedication commitment. Plans to marry were only associated with the discussion of relational and logistical topics for women. The results suggest that conversations about living together prior to the transition may improve outcomes for non-engaged cohabitors, especially if the relationship is discussed.",Only Change is Constant: Negotiating Critical Moments in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

It was hypothesized that couple identity gaps would predict romantic partners’ a) perceptions of anxiety, stress, and negativity and b) their salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and salivary cortisol reactivity and recovery in response to a conflict-inducing discussion. One hundred eighteen couples participated in a laboratory study, in which they engaged in a discussion about conflict-inducing topic and provided saliva samples to assess biological stress markers. The results revealed that perceptions of couple identity gaps were associated with greater perceptions of conflict anxiety, stress, and negativity, as well as heightened cortisol and sAA reactivity. The current study extends the research on couple identity by introducing the concept of identity gaps (Hecht, 1993) into relational contexts as a way to explain why couples vary in their ability to manage stress.",Only Change is Constant: Negotiating Critical Moments in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

The overall fit of the SEM met the recommended criteria (χ2(206) = 345.65, p < .001, CFI = .92, RMSEA = .07). Of primary note was, as predicted, the significant influence of imagined interactions as a whole on forgiveness (β = .60) and relationship satisfaction (β = .64).

constituted in people’s everyday conversations with their romantic partner and how these discourses interplay within individuals’ voices. Through face-to-face interviews of 40 participants in romantic relationships, the investigation found that people navigated three cultural discourses: money as war, money as taboo, and money as success. While these discourses emerged as dominant, some participants countered these discourses by reframing money as a partnership, financial openness as necessary for economic and relational well-being, and money as secondary to interpersonal relationships. This investigation showcases the financial struggles with which people are faced and sheds light on how culture is manifested in people's financial mindsets and everyday interaction and conflict.",Only Change is Constant: Negotiating Critical Moments in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

One way people can manage their impressions is to give reasons (arguments) for their commitments. This appears to be the first study to focus on this reason for arguing. 461 undergraduates recalled an episode in which they had argued to display own identity. They filled out trait measures as well as instruments describing the episode. Identity display arguments do not require controversy, are not very emotional episodes, can partly serve many communication goals, and are polite. People who have high predilection to argue for identity display are both self- and other-oriented, although the correlations with self-oriented measures are stronger. This study not only describes episodes containing arguments for identity display, but also indicates the balance between self- and other-orientations that are involved.",Only Change is Constant: Negotiating Critical Moments in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication
2015-0994,2015,Paper Session,Enhancing Vitality: Physiological Evidence for the Recovery Potential of Entertaining Movies,6,"Research on recovery from stress and strain demonstrated that entertaining movies can lead to mood repair, psychological detachment and relaxation. Through these processes, entertainment consumption fosters well-being by increasing feelings of vitality. As work strain and stress have a strong physiological component, studies relying solely on self-reports cannot answer the question of psychological and somatic recovery. The current study therefore addressed this issue by assessing saliva cortisol levels in order to relate a physiological indicator to experiences of recovery and vitality. In an experiment (N = 60), participants were stressed before they either watched a hedonic movie, a eudaimonic movie, or a control movie. Results confirmed that media stimuli amplify recovery experiences when they convey a high entertainment experience. Further, cortisol levels influenced post-reception vitality by enhancing energetic arousal and affect. These results are discussed regarding the interpretation of physiological indicators to study stress and strain.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

2015-0996,2015,Paper Session,Social Media Advertising: Consumer Responses to Promoted Tweets Send by Brands and Political Parties,2,"Twitter has become an important platform for advertising for both brand and political parties. This study aims to understand how consumers respond to social media advertising (SMA) such as promoted tweets. By conducting two experiments, we seek to answer two questions: what are consumers’ responses to promoted tweets send by brands and political parties, and what role does persuasion knowledge play in processing this advertising format? Study 1 showed that consumers rarely notice the label denoting the fact that a tweet is promoted. When they did, promoted tweets increased the recognition of advertising and this lowered the perceived trustworthiness of the sender. Study 2 demonstrated that these effects are contingent on its source. Only when send by a political party, the recognition of a tweet being advertising reduces the likelihood consumers engage in eWOM, increases skepticism and negatively affects source trustworthiness and attitudes. These findings suggest that advertisers should be cautious in the use of social media advertising such as promoted tweets, as they are not beneficial for all advertisers.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

In Study 1 (N= 36), heavy and light multitaskers identified facial expressions in different multitasking situations. Identifying emotions while multitasking reduced accuracy and confidence, and increased recognition time. Heavy multitaskers recognized emotions more accurately and with more confidence than light multitaskers. Study 2 (N= 49) examined if primary task demand influenced heavy and light multitaskers’ accuracy and confidence in recognizing emotions. Once again, heavy multitaskers recognized emotions more accurately and with more confidence than light multitaskers. Overall, participants were more confident in their emotion recognition ability when emotion recognition was the primary task. These findings are meaningful as they (1) show that even ‘automatic responses’ such as emotion recognition are sensitive to cognitive load and (2) provide a more nuanced perspective on the implications of media multitasking.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

The total number of tweets analysed (N) is 1,500. 24 percent of the journalists’ tweets can be described as explicitly transparent. However, the findings indicate that while journalists on Twitter indeed discuss how the news are produced (disclosure transparency), they show less personal transparency, and hardly ever invite the audiences to interact or take part in the process of making news (participatory transparency).

We argue that social media's influence on journalistic practice can be illustrated by the different ways in which journalists use both social media sites to present themselves and their practice. Using in-depth interviews with professional mainstream journalists working across various platforms we seek to answer the research question: How do journalists present and negotiate their professional norms, practices, and personal self-conceptions in social media environments? While some journalists seamlessly fuse their personal and professional identities online through social media, other journalists feel much more conflicted about the identity they present to a social media audience. Stemming from the interview evidence presented in this paper, we identified three different forms of 'social media identity' that journalists negotiate online.",Twitter and Social Media as Journalistic Tools,Journalism Studies

Through a survey of 877 journalists, we found that frequency of social media use is directly related to reliability on online information, showing that journalists who are heavy users are more willing to share their gatekeeping roles with users other than reporters or politicians. Additionally, findings indicate Facebook is the most popular platform among Latin American journalists, but Twitter is the tool they use for daily newsgathering in their newsrooms.

Local media responded immediately with extensive coverage. Social media platforms, including Twitter, played a prominent role in coverage. This qualitative textual analysis of 470 tweets was designed to identify the frames used by eight local journalists, and to assess those frames for insights on journalistic roles in environmental crisis coverage. The analysis revealed seven frames along with evidence of four roles – interpretive, disseminator, adversarial, and populist mobilizer – as well as of journalists’ tendency to assume more than one role as pluralists. Examination of this content provides the opportunity to show how journalists use Twitter in crisis situations, and if certain journalistic roles are more important than others during such events.",Twitter and Social Media as Journalistic Tools,Journalism Studies

This paper responds to criticisms of Carey by Sue Curry Jansen and Michael Schudson, tracing influences on the framing of Lippmann and Dewey in the 1980s from biographers of both Dewey and Lippmann and from work by Schudson himself. Then the paper opens the terms of the debate by looking at the period from 1888 when Dewey first began writing about democracy until 1955 with Lippmann’s last displaced reply to him after Dewey’s death. Careful attention to Dewey’s work shows he articulated concerns about democracy, public opinion, and society long before Lippmann but for very different reasons.","Scrutinizing the Shoulders of Giants: Lippmann, Dewey, Lasswell, Carey, Schiller",Communication History
2015-1005,2015,Paper Session,For Want of a Canon to Call Our Own: The Challenge of Herbert Schiller,1,"This paper argues that the selection of canons to form the core of our communication discipline would benefit from a reconceptualization, moving away for the traditional view of a canon as a durable authoritative text that new scholars should memorize. Instead, our canons should also include material that help to better understand the origins of the discipline, its current theoretical and methodological framework and controversies, and how to take the field forward. In a field as new and fluctuating as communication, our canons should be equally as fluid, able to respond to the changing context of both academics and reality beyond the campus, allowing us to create and depose our ‘heroes’ but also to rehabilitate ones we have cast aside.

This study in particular explores the consumption of ethnic media by Korean diaspora in the U.S. Using in-depth, ethnographic interviews, I explore the significance of ethnic media consumption in relation to identity construction. In doing so, I employ both a cultural studies approach and a theoretical discussion of identity. My goal is to flesh out how and why people who live in a different culture consume media from their own homelands and learn their native languages. Specifically, this research asks: 1) What kind of pleasure do Korean diaspora get from the cultural products of their ethnic homeland? 2) Are different meanings and pleasures experienced due to advances in digital media? 3) How do ethnic cultural practices, such as consuming ethnic media and learning ethnic languages, influence identity construction? 4) How do diaspora negotiate their identities in mediated space, the U.S. and the South Korea?",Ethnicity and Race With Regard to Identity,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2015-1007,2015,Paper Session,Contesting “Equity” in a Public Sphere: The Negotiation of Collective Identity Where Racial Disparities Prevail,2,": Calling on a framework of public sphere theory regarding collective identity combined with textual analysis and in-depth interviews, this research documents the process of one city -- Madison, WI -- to reconcile the vision of itself as Progressive utopia of social justice with startling realities of intense racial disparities. Through contradictions in value systems, assertions and challenges to privilege with expressions of institutional trust, this discourse reveals the negotiation of identity construction for the mid-sized community. This work also offers a glimpse of how typically marginalized communities can subvert dominant storylines in the public sphere through their own articulations of values, privilege and (dis)trust. The article also offers an investigation into how journalists contribute to collective identity formation through their routines, their maintenance of the status quo, and their inertia to change born in part from a wariness of exacerbating tensions.",Ethnicity and Race With Regard to Identity,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2015-1008,2015,Paper Session,Caribbean Multiracial Ethnic Identity and Social Networking Sites,2,"Persons of mixed race are often framed as the ‘other,’ forced to construct and affirm identities based on larger societal norms where monoracial is the norm. However, being multiracial in the Caribbean is the norm and in some cases, the majority. This study investigates the ethnic history of the Caribbean, with a focus on the Anglophone Caribbean, and its role in the national and personal identities of multiracial individuals. In-depth interviews with nine Caribbean respondents reveal how social media allows them to present both their Caribbean ethnicity and their multiracial selves online and demonstrate the importance of constructing and performing ethnicity. Nationality was salient in both online and offline interactions. Alternatively, those who migrated out of the Caribbean used social media in other ways to articulate their multiracial identity when mixed race was no longer the norm, thus demonstrating the importance of visibility and representation. A cohesive mixed identity is built on the history of the Caribbean, and this in turn can help mixed individuals cope with external stereotypes, social struggles, and microaggressions given the cultural dominance of monoethnic racial discourse.",Ethnicity and Race With Regard to Identity,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

2015-1010,2015,Paper Session,Anchoring and Representativeness Bias Mitigation Through a Digital Game: Effectiveness and Delivery Format,15,"Heuristics are mental shortcuts that can facilitate fast decision making but over-relying on heuristics can also lead people to overlook important information and make biased decisions. Heuristics are difficult to change since many people are not aware of their own biases and heuristic processing is so natural to our everyday decision-making. In order to change heuristics, people must become aware of the biases and also have sufficient decision-making practice in avoiding bias. This study examines the effectiveness of using a digital game to mitigate anchoring and three types of representativeness bias (gambler’s fallacy, insufficient data, and base-rate fallacy). The study also examined delivery methods, comparing the digital game against a traditional slideshow lecture and a combination of slideshow and digital game. Results showed that the digital game alone was not effective in mitigating the biases. The slideshow lecture had immediate effects that declined after four weeks. The combined condition of introducing bias knowledge through the slideshow which then allowed players to practice bias mitigation through the game was most effective immediately and after four weeks.",Learning From (and With) Video Games I,Game Studies

Studies have shown that both the player’s avatar (as a self avatar) and the presence of a virtual trainer (as an other avatar) can influence the player’s atittudes and behaviors within an exergame. The study aims to establish an exergame motivation model using Social Cognitive Theory as a foundation. A 2 (Self Avatar: Absent versus Present) X 2 (Coach Avatar: Absent versus Present) between-subjects experiment was conducted with 137 high school students. Results showed a good model fit for the proposed exergame motivation model, with enjoyment acting as a mediator between identification and in-game competence as the antecedents, and exergame attitudes as the outcome.

2015-1012,2015,Paper Session,How to Become a Race Driver at Home: The Effects of Authentic Input Devices and Simulation Accuracy on Motor Skill Learning and Real World Transfer,3,"Simulation games provide an attractive option to train various real world skills. While prior research almost exclusively focused on intellectual tasks, no work has been presented so far, which investigates effects of simulation games on motor skill learning and true skill transfer to real situations. Addressing this issue, we conducted a training study using a racing simulation game within a 9-week training curriculum. In the last session, we assessed performance measures in various learning domains at a local go-kart track. To investigate the influence of technological game features, we additionally manipulated input authenticity (steering wheel vs. gamepad) and simulation accuracy (go-kart vs. sports car). Analyses showed significant training effects for cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes (r = .28-.40) compared to the control group, but no effects of technological features. Thus, we provide evidence that already medium-sized exercise curricula with a commercial simulation game can facilitate learning of complex motor activities.",Learning From (and With) Video Games I,Game Studies
2015-1013,2015,Paper Session,Video Games and Positive Health Behaviors: Testing the Effectiveness of Wii Physical Activity Games on Children’s Enjoyment and Exertion,6,"Although previous studies have found that exercise and sporting video games increase physical activity and physical exertion in children compared to sedentary games, limited empirical evidence exists examining energy expenditure based on the type of game played. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence exists documenting the relationship between energy expenditure and enjoyment of fitness and sports games using devices such as the Wii. The present pilot study investigated children and adolescents’ perceived enjoyment, perceived exertion, and actual exertion while playing three Wii fitness/sports games. Results indicate that all Wii games significantly increased participants’ energy expenditure. Heart rate change in the running game was positively correlated with self-reported enjoyment, and enjoyment in real-world exercise was positively correlated with enjoyment in running. Findings from the study also have practical application in that schools and families can look to gaming devices like the Wii to help children become more physically active. With decreases in funding in physical education, gaming devices like the Wii could be one solution to help keep schoolchildren active.",Learning From (and With) Video Games I,Game Studies
2015-1014,2015,Paper Session,Why Do People Play Human Computation Games? An Aesthetic Perspective,2,"Human computation games (HCGs) are information systems that use video games to harnesses human intelligence to solve large-scale problems that are out of reach of the capacity of artificial intelligence. The reasons that people play HCGs are important for system success. However, a systematic investigation of the driving factors behind player’s adoption behavior based on a sound theoretical framework is lacking. This study applies the technology acceptance model that incorporates aesthetic experience and output quality to predict player acceptance of HCGs. The proposed model was assessed with data collected from 124 participants using structural equation modelling. Results show that perceived aesthetic experience is the strongest predictor of HCGs adoption. Perceived usefulness has a significant impact on individuals’ attitudes towards HCGs. Perceived ease of use influences attitude as well as intention to play indirectly. Perceived output quality is a salient predictor of perceived usefulness. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Learning From (and With) Video Games I,Game Studies
2015-1015,2015,Paper Session,Digital Curation and Young People’s Engagement in Daily Life Online,1,"Despite the increased role of digital curation tools and platforms in the daily life of social network users, little research has focused on the competencies and dispositions that young people develop to effectively curate content online. This paper details the results of a mixed method study exploring the curation competencies of young people in digital culture. Forty-seven college students used the social curation platform Storify to curate essays on the topic of income inequality. Their curated stories were coded to explore for narrative development, consistency, sourcing, analysis, and content type. Regression models were used to assess clarity and balance of the curated stories, and a detailed questionnaire explored dispositions towards curation as a relevant and effective mode for engagement in digital culture. The paper argues that curation can enhance core media analysis and storytelling skills, and an understanding about the role of peer-to-peer platforms and collaborative spaces in digital culture.","Youth Engagement With Media: Sharing, Synthesis, and Social Capital",Children Adolescents and the Media

Using the paradigm of participatory action research, with the goal of creating usable evidence that improves practice, we looked at 544 high school students from 38 U.S. schools who participated in Student Reporting Labs, a media literacy initiative developed by PBS News Hour, where students work collaboratively to understand and analyze journalistic conventions, supported by a teacher and a mentor from the local public broadcasting station. Results of a pre-post online questionnaire show that students differentially engage in different types of media production activities in the classroom. The practice of gathering, evaluating and synthesizing information is associated increased intellectual curiosity, confidence in giving and receiving feedback, greater levels of news analysis skills and increased intent to engage in civic action.","Youth Engagement With Media: Sharing, Synthesis, and Social Capital",Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-1017,2015,Paper Session,Sharing Cultural Capital on Social Media: Social Background and Young People’s Online Sharing of Cultural Consumption,5,"As amply demonstrated, social media play an important role in building and maintaining social capital. As such, social media support flows of socially embedded and novel information within their networked structures. This is especially the case for taste performances, hence potentially supporting the grass roots acquisition of cultural capital. In this study, we focus on the prerequisite of youths’ online sharing of cultural event attendance, exploring the explanatory potential of both socio-ethnic and economic background and psychological factors. This is important given the ample evidence of class attributes as distinctive in the access to and awareness of cultural consumption. The results indicate youngsters from disadvantaged background to share relatively more text messages, photos, and videos on their cultural consumption. Moreover, expected outcomes, habit, and social normative behaviour concerning sharing behaviour are identified as key explanatory factors, especially for sharing rich (audio)-visual materials. These findings imply important venues for further grasping the emancipatory potential of social media.","Youth Engagement With Media: Sharing, Synthesis, and Social Capital",Children Adolescents and the Media

We explore: 1) the role of demographics in creating a home environment supportive of news use 2) the importance of parental device modeling on youth news adoption – and whether this relationship is complicated by the shift from shared to individualized media consumption in the home, and 3) the impact of other socialization agents, such as peers and schools, in encouraging youth news consumption above and beyond characteristics of the home. We employ a national survey of parent-child dyads to explore these questions. We find greatest support for parental “matched modeling” of news consumption behaviors for their children, which is particularly important as news and technology continue to evolve.","Youth Engagement With Media: Sharing, Synthesis, and Social Capital",Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-1019,2015,Paper Session,International Copyright and Access to Scientific Knowledge,1,"The Berne Convention, founded in 1886, provides the foundation stone of international copyright law. First, the Berne Convention defined scientific and medical works as subject to copyright regulation. Second, strong exceptions were carved out in the Berne Convention for scientific and medical works at its founding. This was done at the instigation of one of the least powerful states involved in the establishment of the convention: Haiti. Third, despite such initial recognition of scientific and medical exceptions, a long-term tendency to reduce these exceptions has been apparent in the development of international copyright norms since 1886. The recent Access to Knowledge and Open Access movements have not strongly altered the ideology of increasingly strong copyright protection in scientific works at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which is now the secretariat of the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaties.",Policy Approaches to Access and Use of Information,Communication Law & Policy

Then, I look at open access initiatives and other strategies in response to shifts in policy within two overlapping yet distinct fields of academic book publishing, (1) scholarly books and (2) higher education textbooks, and find unintended consequences potentially resulting in less openness and equitable access to knowledge production and consumption. Ultimately, I will contend, the open access movement in the UK risks further concentrating control of academic book publishing within a few powerful institutions.",Policy Approaches to Access and Use of Information,Communication Law & Policy

Using several legal decisions in fair use cases, I focus on the transformative nature of fan fiction and describe how this element of transformation can negate a copyright holder’s authority and ownership over how his or her characters and worlds are altered. Authors and media corporations that maintain copyrights on creative work are constantly navigating how to encourage artistic expression to generate attention, additional profits and further the fandoms’ passion, while also maintaining ownership and control when disapproving or offensive creations arise. This tension of ownership and control rarely brings fan fiction into the courtroom, but when it does, examining the transformative nature of fan works can embolden fans to explore and experiment with their favorite characters in ways the original author never intended.",Policy Approaches to Access and Use of Information,Communication Law & Policy

2015-1023,2015,Paper Session,What Do We Fear Of? Expected Sanctions for Expressing Minority Opinions in Offline and Online Communication,1,"The current research investigates the expectation of sanctions as a promising construct for explaining why people’s willingness to express a minority opinion varies between face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. Drawing on the spiral of silence theory, we propose that confronted with a hostile opinion climate, individuals develop expectations about how their social surrounding would punish them, should they express a minority opinion. People’s willingness to pronounce a minority opinion is suggested to be a function of contextual factors such as the communication channel (e.g., face-to-face vs. computer-mediated communication) and the corresponding expected sanctions. Based on qualitative interviews (N = 12), we first identified seven different sanctions individuals expect from other people in various social situations. A subsequent experimental study (N = 365) showed that the expectation of being personally attacked, for instance, can explain why people are more willing to voice a deviant opinion in offline rather than in online environments.",Top 4 Student Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

The current study aims to explain what motivat Internet users to enact protection against email phishing, and how their protection enactment is related to the way they cognitively process phishing emails. Specifically, this study proposes an integrated theoretical framework to link Protection Motivation Theory to Heuristic-Systematic Processing in email phishing attacks. Findings show that protection enactment against email phishing is predicted by a high degree of perceived severity and vulnerability towards cybersecurity risks, self-efficacy in protecting Internet security and response efficacy in Internet security tools. The perceived severity, along with the elevated level of protection enactment, predicts systematic processing of phishing emails.

Person perception processes are especially relevant, e.g. when it comes to gender stereotypes and equality issues, e.g. the goal of higher ratios of women in management positions. However, while numerous studies investigated the evaluation of private SNS profiles, Business Networking Sites have largely been ignored. By applying a 3 (low vs. medium vs. high career level) x 2 (male vs. female profile person) between-subject-design in an online experiment with N = 541 (n = 311 female) we investigated attributions in line with the Stereotype-Content-Model (Fiske et al., 2002). Main effects of career level show that with rising level higher levels of competence and status and lower levels of warmth were attributed, while no effects were shown for perceived competitive interdependence. Main effects for gender showed that female profiles are attributed more warmth and lower degrees of competitive interdependence, as well as higher levels of competence, while no effects emerged for attributed economic status.

Many studies have found cross-sectional evidence of such behavior, but very few have been able to directly measure longitudinal changes in the diversity of social media users’ information-seeking habits. This is due in part to a lack of appropriate tools and methods. In a step toward remedying this, we propose, justify, and measure a partial method of measuring network homophily in Twitter over time. Drawing on the complete historical record of public retweets posted between January 2011 and August 2013, we demonstrate that Twitter network communities focused on Syria are in general highly fragmented.

A sample of 253,188 tweets related to the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum were collected in the days leading up to and following the vote. Results provide evidence of BIRG processes on the part of anti-independence tweeters, and CORF responses by those favoring independence.

Four hundred twenty subjects participated in an online experiment and read 10 news stories, modified as Twitter newsfeed. The results show that news negativity had a significant effect on the discrete emotions, but not on recall. The impacts of news negativity on emotions and recall were moderated by age. Younger subjects tended to feel more angry, fearful, and disgusted and had better recall of news stories with high negativity than older subjects. The study found significant links between negative news on Twitter and intentions of seeking and sharing news. The pattern of the impact of news negativity on behavior intentions varied depending on age.

Questions of home and belonging, and the implicated politics of dislocation and marginalization, have plagued two visible groups: the Chinese Mainlanders whose personal and cultural fortunes have been transformed by opportunities presented by the permeability of the city-border, and the foreign domestic helpers whose right of belonging has been caught in the discrimination of immigration laws. My argument is that their fates are conjoined by what I call the state of being “included-out,” something augmented by nebulous doctrines of citizenship rights as well as by legalized and informal forms of cultural racialism. Working through a few landmark human rights cases, I hope to outline the biopolitical continuum of the “included-out,” and draw wider implications for the question of bare life in outside belongings.","New Global Mediated of Publics, Citizenship(s), and Cosmopolitanism","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

As uncertainty looms about their detrimental health effects, mobile tower antennas have become an unstable technology, with adversely affected stakeholders—scientists, cellular operators, oncologists, cancer patients, and journalists—coming together to form a technoscience public. These stakeholders use media to influence public opinion and I introduce the concept of mediated technoscience publics to conceptualize media’s constitutive role in creation, expansion, and contraction of technoscience publics. Drawing on site visits and interviews, I track reconfigurations of mediated technoscience publics across scientific representations, vernacular newspapers and lifestyle shows as the controversy unfolds. My approach borrows from media anthropology, political theory, and science studies and closely examines media practices (Rao 2010) and materiality of publics (Bennett 2010) in order to theorize performative mediations of socio-technical knowledge production (Barad 2007; Kember and Zylinska 2012).","New Global Mediated of Publics, Citizenship(s), and Cosmopolitanism","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-1033,2015,Paper Session,Cosmopolitanizing Cosmopolitanism: Toward an Inclusive Theoretical Framework of Cosmopolitanism,1,"Recent literature on cosmopolitanism is rife with competing conceptual definitions of the term. I suggest that working toward a single conceptual definition would be counterproductive, and instead, propose a framework capable of accommodating various conceptualizations. According to this model, the first property of cosmopolitanism is an open orientation toward Others, which consists of two dimensions: receptivity toward difference and reflexivity. The second property is intercultural mobility, which consists of two dimensions: cultural diversity of one’s social network and level of social and economic capital. I suggest that the wide range of conceptual definitions for cosmopolitanism arises from the intersection of the dimensions of these two properties, and that this model illuminates the relationships between them. I then briefly review the way cosmopolitanism has been operationalized in some empirical studies, finding that the manner in which these authors discuss cosmopolitanism fits snuggly with the conceptual framework proposed herein.","New Global Mediated of Publics, Citizenship(s), and Cosmopolitanism","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The current study tested whether the relationship is that of a reinforcing spiral (Slater, 2007), in which television exposure has an effect on children’s body mass index (BMI), and at the same time BMI influences choices about time spent with television. The study also examined parental mediation in the form of household rules restricting television viewing plays a protective role, thus dampening the relationship between viewing and obesity. The relationships were tested in a large national longitudinal study of children in the U.S. (N = 21,260) followed from kindergarten to 8th grade. Using multilevel and lagged modeling, the results support that TV effects on children’s obesity can be conceptualized as a spiral; and that interventions could target time-based rules and physical activity to reduce viewing time.","Youth, Media, Food Choice, and Obesity",Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-1036,2015,Paper Session,Assessing the Longitudinal Relationship Between Peruvian Children’s TV Exposure and Unhealthy Food Consumption,3,"Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental studies have shown that heavy television exposure is a risk factor for childhood overweight and obesity. This relationship is most typically attributed to the influence of food advertising. Despite this growing array of studies, one limitation is that these studies have focused almost exclusively on high income countries. It is unclear whether such findings hold true in low or middle countries. To address this gap, this study investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between television exposure and unhealthy snack consumption (a risk factor for childhood overweight/obesity) in a sample of Peruvian children aged 6-13 years old (n = 265). Moreover, given that high socioeconomic status (SES) is also a risk factor for overweight in Peru, this study asked whether SES moderated study outcomes. Results indicate that television exposure is indeed cross-sectionally and longitudinally related with unhealthy snack consumption – for each hour of television exposure at baseline, the odds of consuming one or more unhealthy snack per day at follow-up increased by 15%. For children from high SES families, this relationship is even more pronounced with the odds of unhealthy snacking increasing by 44%. These findings justify efforts to help parents manage their children’s television viewing as well as efforts to regulate food advertising in Peru.","Youth, Media, Food Choice, and Obesity",Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-1037,2015,Paper Session,Food Choice in Children: Television Commercials and Fading Behavioral Effects,6,"Previous research demonstrates that commercials can influence food choice in children but little is known about the duration of this effect. We conducted an experiment (N=134) where seven- to eleven-year-old children watched a cartoon with an embedded advertising block. Half of the children saw a commercial for a specific brand of chocolate candies. After watching, we measured actual food choice. We found that children watching the target commercial chose the advertised brand significantly more often compared to children not watching the target commercial. The primary contribution of the present study is the examination of how temporal delay influences this effect. We show that commercials’ impact on behavior is dependent on the temporal delay between exposure and food choice, as the effect faded quickly. This represents a boundary condition for the behavioral effect: Although the behavioral effect exists, it is only evident immediately after exposure and does not persist over time.","Youth, Media, Food Choice, and Obesity",Children Adolescents and the Media

However, these companies’ expenditures on online advertising has increased in recent years. In this context, the authors aimed to better understand the scope of food marketing to children online, which website features (e.g., games) food companies use to promote their products, and the relationship between marketing features and the nutritional quality of advertised foods. The authors therefore conducted a content analysis of approximately 100 food and beverage brand websites. Results indicate that few brands actually maintain child-friendly websites today, but the brands that do have child-friendly websites include a large number of games that promote particularly unhealthy food products. Somewhat surprisingly, games with many brand identifiers are paired with slightly healthier foods. These findings present a mixed picture about food companies’ role in the fight to end childhood obesity.","Youth, Media, Food Choice, and Obesity",Children Adolescents and the Media

Findings, based on an original non-probability survey administered to 1,621 newspaper readers in the Philadelphia area, suggest that over half of newspaper readers read the letters section at least once a week, with letter readers tending to be older, more educated males. The majority of people reading the letters section do so because it allows them to “hear” people’s political discussions. These findings are contextualized in relation to the uses and gratifications approach.",News Audiences: New Findings,Journalism Studies
2015-1040,2015,Paper Session,"Channel Surfing: The Ties Between Twitter, Traditional Media, Parasocial Relationships, and Self-Perceived Knowledge on Current Events",2,"A survey asked news consumers about their opinions regarding self-perceived knowledge and parasocial interaction between online print websites, broadcast news outlets, and Twitter. Results of this study suggest consuming news from online print news websites and following national news generate the strongest feelings of self-perceived knowledge about current events. Contrary to the increasing call for “multimedia journalists,” this study finds the benefits of having parasocial relationships with readers on one medium won’t get carried over to other media. In addition, Twitter followers tend to react similarly to news organizations and individual journalists in terms of re-tweeting, commenting on, replying to tweets, sending messages, and clicking on links. This indicates users are accustomed to viewing news organizations and individuals as a whole package rather than two separate parties. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",News Audiences: New Findings,Journalism Studies
2015-1041,2015,Paper Session,Newspapers’ Online Discussion Boards: Democratic Tools Or Conspiracy Theories’ Engines? Readers’ Perspectives on an Eastern European “Media War”,1,"This paper analyses quantitatively and qualitatively 1,583 comments by national newspapers’ online readers in Bulgaria. It investigates readers’ reactions to articles discussing the media war between the biggest press groups – one owned by an MP known as “the Murdoch of the East”. The study explores how these stories influence the relationship between newspapers and their readers and whether they enhance the democratic potential of online discussion. The results show a higher level of reader engagement than in established democracies or non-democracies. The online space provides an arena for democratic deliberation but it is also used as an engine for conspiracy theories.",News Audiences: New Findings,Journalism Studies
2015-1042,2015,Paper Session,Positive News Makes Readers Feel Good: A “Silver-Lining” Approach to Negative News Can Attract Audiences,2,"After decades of criticism that the media publish too much negative news and during a time of declining news audiences, some media outlets have dedicated themselves to publishing only happy, upbeat stories. The current experiment examined the positive news industry by testing the effects of three types of story valence – positive, negative, and silver lining – on readers’ affect, story enjoyment, perceived well-being, knowledge acquisition, and sharing intentions. The authors additionally looked at hard vs. soft news stories. Results suggest that, among all types of stories, valence plays a significant role in readers’ affect, in that positive news makes readers feel good. In addition, findings suggest that the silver-lining story – one that highlights a positive outcome of a negative event – may present a practical way for media outlets to maintain the time-honored surveillance function of negative news yet also reap the affective benefits of positive news.",News Audiences: New Findings,Journalism Studies
2015-1043,2015,Paper Session,The Negative Effect of Flaming on Learning From Political News,1,"The present study investigated how flaming in online news environments affects learning through elaboration. More specifically, two online experiments (n=312) were used to assess whether individuals who have been exposed to hostile comments beneath political news online acquire more or less knowledge from the content they encounter. OLS regression models and t-tests were used to determine the nature of the effects of flaming, credibility and political ideology on elaboration. Overall, the present data show that flaming had a negative effect on perceptions of news credibility and elaboration, and that elaboration predicts two of the three tested dimensions of learning. Together the results of the present study shed light on the benefits and drawbacks of online comments and further emphasize the importance of finding new ways to keep online discussions civil.",News Audiences: New Findings,Journalism Studies
2015-1044,2015,Paper Session,Who Loves Consent?: An Analysis of Responses to the Culture Jamming of Victoria's Secret,3,"The lack of engagement with sexual assault in public relations scholarship, along with the privileging of organizational reputation and brand over individual experience, contributes to the perpetuation of rape culture. One way to begin further introducing these topics into public relations scholarship is to explore how activists work to directly confront organizations believed to be contributing to rape culture. This study explores responses to the culture jamming of Victoria’s Secret’s brand by a feminist activist organization called FORCE. Through the use of creative social media tactics, FORCE spurred an online conversation about creating a consent-based culture that received an overwhelming positive response from social media users, but that Victoria’s Secret tried to shut down. Findings of this study highlight the need of public relations professionals to be continually aware of the interactive nature of social media, brand identity, and activist work.","Activism, Advocacy, and Civil Society",Public Relations
2015-1045,2015,Paper Session,How Public Relations Practitioners Who Also Are Activists Use Social Media for Their Activism,1,"In mainstream public relations, the word “activist” has a predominantly negative connotation – one of a trouble-maker, who disrupts the financial well-being of an organization. This is because mainstream public relations takes a modernist, organization-centric stance that valorizes the interests of organizations above all else. In recent times, however, critics of mainstream PR have adopted alternate approaches to public relations where the interests of stakeholders are accorded equal – if not more – importance than those of organizations. Postmodern scholars such as Holtzhausen (2012), urge public relations practitioners to take up an activist stance if they are confronted with unethical behavior from their organization. Holtzhausen (2012) especially points out new media as tools with which public relations practitioners can democratize the discursive space between stakeholders and organizations. Adopting the postmodern standpoint, this study in particular will examine how public relations practitioners who also engage in organizational activism use social media in their activism.","Activism, Advocacy, and Civil Society",Public Relations
2015-1046,2015,Paper Session,#AdvocatingForChange: The Strategic Use of Hashtags in Social Media Advocacy,4,"Social media continues to change how advocacy organizations mobilize, educate, and connect with their constituents. One of the most unique yet understudied tools available on social media platforms is the hashtag. Little research exists on how social work and advocacy organizations use hashtags, much less on how such use can be effective. This study examines the hashtag use by 105 constituent members of the National Health Council, a national US-based patient/health advocacy coalition. The study presents an inductive coding scheme of the types of hashtags employed, analyzes inter-sectoral differences in hashtag usage, and examines the relationship between hashtag use and measures of the effectiveness of social media messages.","Activism, Advocacy, and Civil Society",Public Relations

Traditional theorization of media in civil society is challenged and outlaw discourse is further conceptualized in this study.","Activism, Advocacy, and Civil Society",Public Relations
2015-1048,2015,Paper Session,Collective Action Frames in a Nonprofit Organization’s Strategic Communication,2,"This study investigated how collective action frames are used in non-profit communication materials. Methods included observations, interpretive coding, and statistical tests. Preliminary results from a review of formal internal and external action-oriented documents of one politically-oriented grassroots based non-profit organization showed that collective action frames are used differently for different target audiences. Diagnostic frames, which identify problems, were found to be the most frequently utilized type of collective action frame. Prognostic frames, which outline an action plan, were significantly more prevalent in communication intended for legislators than that intended for organization members. Observations and interviews revealed intentional consistency of message and partial targeting of audiences, as well as important organizational features. Recommendations for the organization include increased understanding of target audience characteristics.","Activism, Advocacy, and Civil Society",Public Relations
2015-1049,2015,Paper Session,"Cognitive, Attraction, Attachment, and Love Type Differences Among Friends With Benefits",3,"With the popularity of “friends with benefits” (FWB) relationships rising not only within the general population, the aim of this study is to examine this type of relationship with friends. FWBs involve friends who have repeated sexual encounters, but lack romantic intent or expectations (Mongeau, Knight, Williams, Eden, & Shaw, 2013). We examined cognitive scripts for friendship development, the use of imagined interactions to psychologically maintain the relationship, attraction, attachment styles and Sternberg’s (1997) triangular theory of love in friendships and FWB relationships. A series of research questions and hypotheses were posed examining friends and FWB in these areas. Results reveal similarities between these friendships in terms of cognitive scripts for friendship development. However, physical attraction was higher in ratings of FWB while social and task attraction was higher in friendship ratings as well as attachment style differences and the use of imagined interactions to maintain the relationship","Sex, Sexuality, and Sexialization: A Hot Topic In Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

This study explored how they operate together in a specific context: the role of alcohol (ab)use in understanding sexual victimization in Latino-American adults. Hypotheses tests using a sample of 267 self-identified Latino-Americans (M= 20.68 years) revealed that sexual communication expectations of alcohol use predicted incidence of sexual victimization. Additionally, communicative expectations of alcohol use, discomfort with safer sex communication, age, and sex were explored.

2015-1051,2015,Paper Session,Parent-Adolescent Communication About Sex in Chinese Families,1,"In the present study, one-on-one interviews were conducted with Chinese adolescents (N=37) about their parents’ communication about sex and dating. Analysis of the interview data was based on principles of grounded theory. Eight themes were identified with respect to Chinese parents’ communication about dating and sex, and in addition, four themes regarding Chinese adolescents’ attitudes towards such communication were apparent. Overall, Chinese parents managed to transmit values, standards and expectations about dating and sexual activities indirectly, implicitly and/or nonverbally. Adolescents in the present study, however, also demonstrated tendencies to avoid sex-related communication with parents, and some preferred indirect and implicit ways of communication more than direct, open communication. The role of cultural and social norms and the implication of indirect communication and communication avoidance about sex in Chinese families were discussed.","Sex, Sexuality, and Sexialization: A Hot Topic In Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication
2015-1052,2015,Paper Session,Perceptions of Infidelity Across Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual Perceptions of Same-Sex Cheating in Exclusive Relationships,2,"For individuals in exclusive romantic relationships, the dynamic of sexual experimentation are complex. Sexual behavior outside of a relationship (i.e., extradyadic activity) may be perceived as cheating or infidelity, with much of those perceptions derived from the biological sex of that perceiver. The current study extends seminal research by Kruger et al. (2013) on perceptions of cheating with third-party friends, focusing significant modifications in order to further nuance an evolutionary threat-based model, and to understand the associated perceptions of cheating by individuals in heterosexual relationships with their same-sex cross-orientation friends. Results indicate that perceptions of infidelity vary widely depending on the nature of the behaviors, with decreasing attribution given to sexual behaviors, intimate behaviors, and instrumental behaviors accordingly. The specific impact of religiosity and gender are reported and discussed.","Sex, Sexuality, and Sexialization: A Hot Topic In Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication
2015-1053,2015,Paper Session,The Nature and Impact of Gendered Patterns of Peer Sexual Communications Among Emerging Adults,2,"Do communications about sex and romantic relationships vary according to who is speaking to whom? The current study examined 517 college students’ reports of male and female peers’ communications of four sexual scripts and the associations between reports of such communications and participants’ sexual attitudes and sexual experience level. Results suggest that peer messages about sex and relationships vary by the gender of the recipient and the gender of the communicator. Women reported more frequent communication of all sexual scripts from female peers than did men. In terms of male peers’ sexual communications, only one gender difference emerged: men reported receiving significantly more messages about the hookup script than women. Compared to same-sex peer communications, there were more associations between other-sex peer communications and undergraduates’ sexual attitudes and experiences. Implications for the role of same- and other-sex peers in sexual socialization are discussed.","Sex, Sexuality, and Sexialization: A Hot Topic In Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

More specifically, this study investigates the relationship between individuals’ baseline testosterone levels and their communication after sexual activity. Two-hundred and fifty-three participants completed an online diary after each time they engaged in sexual activity over a two-week period. Prior to the diary portion of the study, participants provided saliva samples, which were assayed for baseline testosterone levels. Results revealed that as individuals’ testosterone levels increase, their assessments of the benefits of disclosing decrease and their assessments of the risks of disclosing increase. Additionally, the higher the individuals’ testosterone levels, the less intentional and more positively valenced were their post sex disclosures, and these associations were mediated by risk-benefit assessments. Lastly, results revealed an interaction between testosterone and orgasm, such that a negative association emerged between testosterone and valence for those who did not orgasm, but not for those who orgasmed. These results and their implications for research on post sex behavior and communication theory are discussed.","Sex, Sexuality, and Sexialization: A Hot Topic In Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

Participants selectively browsed online messages featuring opposing viewpoints and either exemplars or statistics, resulting in a 2 (supporting vs. opposing technology) x 2 (exemplar vs. statistics) x 4 (topic: fracking, biofuels, GMOs, nanotechnology) within-subjects design. Participants’ attitudes towards science topics were measured before and after selective exposure. Participants preferred messages aligned with preexisting attitudes. Exemplar messages fostered longer reading among individuals with high interpersonal reactivity but less exposure among high-numeracy individuals. Finally, selective exposure to attitude-consistent statistics messages shifted attitudes.",Public Understanding and Perceptions of Environmental Issues,Environmental Communication

Relatively little research to date has explored the social dimensions (e.g., public perceptions) of hydraulic fracturing. This study examines public interpretation of hydraulic fracturing media content (news images) presenting either an economic benefit or environmental risk frame and whether individuals’ support for hydraulic fracturing influences perceptions and evaluations of the mediated content. Moreover, this study identifies predictors of hydraulic fracturing support, economic perspectives of hydraulic fracturing and environmental perspectives of the issue. Results indicate that visual framing choices in images and individuals’ level of support or opposition of hydraulic fracturing interact to determine how images are interpreted.",Public Understanding and Perceptions of Environmental Issues,Environmental Communication
2015-1057,2015,Paper Session,"Worldviews, Issue Knowledge, and the Pollution of a Local Science Information Environment",3,"The idea that increased science knowledge will predict increased support for pro-science public policies is on its face a common-sense proposition, but empirical research results paint a much more complicated picture. The simple “knowledge deficit model” has not been wholly useful in explaining or predicting the impacts of science communications. Socio-political orientation has been identified as a significant moderator, sometimes exacerbating and sometimes attenuating the impact of knowledge on attitudes and opinions. However, differing conceptualizations of key variables have led to inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results. 964 adults participated in an online survey-experiment to further refine our understanding of the utility of the knowledge deficit model. Results show that while issue knowledge is found to predict increased pro-science public policy support, “polluting” the information environment with already politicized message frames activates socio-political orientation as a moderator and, among certain groups, reverses the direction of the relationship.",Public Understanding and Perceptions of Environmental Issues,Environmental Communication
2015-1058,2015,Paper Session,Mapping the Boundary of Media Effects on Environmental Concerns: Evidence from 37 Societies,2,"The present study discusses the extent to which news media use leads to environmental concern and a willingness to engage in environmentally protective actions across 37 societies and tackles whether the effects of news media use are contingent on two macro-level factors: namely, the level of press freedom and real-world environmental conditions. Multilevel mixed models were conducted based on the latest iteration of the World Values Survey (n=44,142). Our results indicate that using newspapers, TVs, and the Internet to follow the news increases people’s awareness of local and global environmental hazards, while reading newspapers boosts people’s willingness to protect the environment. Press freedom and real-world environmental situations moderate the impacts of news media use on environmental outcomes in distinct patterns. We also discuss the role of news media in promoting an informed and active environmental citizenship in different political and environmental contexts.",Public Understanding and Perceptions of Environmental Issues,Environmental Communication
2015-1059,2015,Paper Session,Inward or Outward Attention: The Effects of Working Memory Capacity and Gaming Expertise on Player Approach to a Persuasive Game,1,"Digital games as a persuasive medium are believed to facilitate deep understanding of complex problems and systems through the player’s interactive problem-solving experiences. However, digital games can also impose high cognitive demands from the players to process the controls, understand and mechanics, rules, and narratives, while constructing a mental representation of the problem. Few studies have examined the effect of working memory capacity and gaming expertise on player attention and comprehension. A previous study found that while working memory facilitated gaming experts’ attention, the experts’ attention did not predict more comprehension. Instead, non-gaming expert attention did predict comprehension. This study replicated the previous study but further examined player in-game behaviors using server-captured behavioral data to investigate how working memory capacity and gaming expertise influenced players’ different approach to the game, amount of mistakes, and whether players paid attention to formative feedback after they made mistakes. Theoretical implications for information processing of interactive media messages are discussed. The study also has practical implications for designing persuasive digital games.",Learning From (and With) Video Games II,Game Studies
2015-1060,2015,Paper Session,Mitigating Bias Blind Spot via a Serious Videogame,12,"This study employed a serious videogame to train participants on bias blind spot (BBS), capturing the effects of the game on BBS knowledge and mitigation at three points in time (pretest, posttest after playing the videogame, and after 8 weeks). In Experiment 1 (N = 703) we compared the effects of hybrid training (a combination of implicit and explicit training) to implicit training; in Experiment 2 (N = 620) we tested the effects of just-in-time feedback and delayed feedback; and in Experiment 3 (N = 626) we examined the effects of singleplayer and multiplayer versions of the game. In addition, we tested differences in game duration and repetition. Overall, the results indicated that playing the training videogame, regardless of experimental condition, resulted in a linear decrease in BBS scores over time, and an increase in BBS knowledge at posttest; the effects on knowledge, however, decayed at 8 weeks.",Learning From (and With) Video Games II,Game Studies
2015-1061,2015,Paper Session,Positive Relations: Action Video Games and STEM Disciplines,2,"Existing research suggests training on challenging action video games (AVG) improves cognitive skills crucial for achievement in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. The intersection between these domains suggests a possible natural relationship between the two, particularly in the so-called “hard” sciences such physics, computer science, engineering, and math. To investigate, we conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the extent to which action video gaming might predict the selection of a hard STEM academic major. We additionally considered the influence of math ability and gender. Study results highlighted a robust positive relationship between action video gaming and selecting a hard STEM major, irrespective of gender. Since results are correlational, discussions focus on shared characteristics between AVG players and STEM professionals, such as the personality trait Openness; possible explanations for gender’s lack of influence in the results; and recommendations for exploring causality between AVG playing and STEM involvement.",Learning From (and With) Video Games II,Game Studies

This project draws from a longitudinal dataset which captures – amongst other server logs – eight years of membership changes between game teams. In particular, we look at the impact that large popular teams and the strategies they adopt have on player trajectory. Study 1 demonstrates that players who begin in a team that promotes a learning strategy based around mentorship and structured instruction are less likely to quit the game than members who join a team that promotes a more ad hoc approach. Study 2 examines logged in-game friendship networks – to examine the underlying factors behind the findings of the first study – showing that contrary to expectations teams based around mentorship promote less information brokerage and clustering. Results from the second study run against the current theoretical understand of teams and social networks and may offer a new avenue of research into the intersection between these two topics.",Learning From (and With) Video Games II,Game Studies

We designed and developed two 60-minute educational games with and without a range of reward features and examined learning outcomes among 242 participants in university laboratories. Although both games improved learning, analyses suggest that the quantity of in-game rewards did not have an impact on biased behavior avoidance or knowledge about biases. To further illuminate these findings, we examined perceptions of feeling rewarded and found that those who felt more rewarded had more favorable views of the gameplay experience, but they did not demonstrate different learning outcomes.",Learning From (and With) Video Games II,Game Studies
2015-1064,2015,Paper Session,Collective Remembering of Organizations: Coconstruction of Organizational Pasts in Wikipedia,1,"For public relations it is crucial how publics make sense of organizations’ past behaviors, because it shapes corporate reputations. Memory studies conceptualize the past as socially constructed and configured by the frames of references from various social sources. This article fruitfully intersects both fields and investigates the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a global memory place, where the past is communicatively constructed by actors of a loosely connected community. The analysis of 905 changes of Wikipedia articles for 10 organizations shows, how the continuous co-construction of the collective memory bridges past formal corporate communication, news media, and other sources with the present, exposing and suppressing relevant information concerning corporate reputation for large audiences. An analysis of 115 press releases detects that current frames provided by formal corporate communication have very little influence on the ongoing remembering process in Wikipedia.

By focusing on the fact that there are still many researchers who refute the variable of ‘direct experience’ in cultivation effects, this study sought to elucidate the concept of resonance, as well as verify if cognitive dimension, not direct experience, can be an important variable in recognizing the TV world as reality. Therefore, this study focused on China, where the Korean Wave is consistently increasing compared to other countries, and conducted analysis on 212 Chinese residents in urban areas who watched Korean dramas.",Reputation and Image Management,Public Relations

This study explored the possible reasons for these mixed findings from a measurement perspective. It compared different measurements of media favorability of corporate news at the specific corporate reputation attribute level, instead of overall reputation level. The comparison was based on the content analysis of 2,817 news articles from both elite newspapers and local newspapers.

By means of semantic network analyses as well as Vector Autoregression analyses this study investigates the interrelation of implicit frames present in press releases by the two largest German banks (Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank) and the German financial media from 2007 until the end of 2013. Findings show that an increase of the salience for a particular frame in press releases by the banks led to a decrease of that same frame in the financial media the subsequent months. Moreover, press releases by banks adopted frames that were present in the media in the previous month. These results can be considered as a reflection of critical financial journalism. Furthermore, the findings give evidence that banks orient their press releases on the news making style.",Reputation and Image Management,Public Relations

A claim analysis is conducted of the Belgian and Dutch National Competition Authorities’ (hereafter: NCAs’) formal decisions on eight selected cases of proposed media mergers (hereafter: ‘merger reviews’). It builds on insights from media economy, media policy, competition policy and regulation studies. The findings showed that a majority (92.3%) of claims in merger reviews exclusively reflected economic welfare in their topics (e.g. definition of relevant market, competition and market power). A minor share (0.7%) of the claims contained exclusively political and socio-cultural welfare topics (e.g. consumer choice, editorial control, opinion power). These non-economic welfare topics occurred mostly in combination with economic welfare topics (7.1%) and tended to argue more often against than in favour of a merger case. While this observation concurred with NCAs’ remit, showing they are ‘doing their job’, the limited presence of non-economic topics in their decisions warrants the question whether media merger reviews sufficiently address the media’s political and socio-cultural value and supports the need for an approach that incorporate this perspective.",Changing Audiovisual Media Markets and Regulation,Communication Law & Policy

While the press has repeatedly covered this unprecedented restructuring of British broadcasting, scholarship has not been so prolific. I rectify this paucity through a critical discourse analysis of the policies and regulations for the L-DTPS from 2009-2014. Drawing from the tradition of critical political economy, I argue that despite the rhetorical commitment to local television for the purposes of bringing power, accountability and community to the citizens of the UK, the L-DTPS represents a clear commitment to the principles of neoliberalism and to the Conservative party’s “Big Society” plan. This is demonstrated through a lack of commitment to local news, ownership restrictions, and spectrum management.

Ofcom sided with BBC Worldwide and Channel Flip Media by ruling that their online content was not sufficiently ‘tv-like’ to fall within the existing scope of the British television on demand regulation. While at first glance this may seem like another case of media deregulation, it would be wrong to dismiss it as such. The following paper argues instead that Ofcom currently finds itself at a critical juncture. Through a critical discourse analysis of Ofcom’s three precedent-setting decision reports, commissioned research surveys and other relevant Ofcom and EU policy documents combined with personal observation and interviews this paper analyzes a) the processes Ofcom adopted to formulate policies for the regulation of audiovisual content online and b) the broader socio-economic and cultural implications of these policies.",Changing Audiovisual Media Markets and Regulation,Communication Law & Policy

A Study of Tweet Styles on Mobile and Web-Based Platforms,4,"Most social media scholarship does not specifically distinguish between content from mobile versus web in analyses of sentiment, word frequency, and other methods. This paper hypothesizes that social media content that is produced on mobile versus web platforms may be qualitatively different and uses Twitter as a case study. As we increasingly tweet from our smartphones, this could be encouraging us to ‘report’ on our immediate thoughts, feelings, physical self, and surroundings. This paper seeks to understand whether these presentations of self tend to be more egocentric, negative/positive, gendered, or communal depending on whether they were tweeted from mobile devices or web platforms. Using 6 weeks of Twitter data, we found that mobile tweets do tend to use more egocentric language then web-based tweets. We found that negative language is used more frequently by mobile users, suggesting that social media reporting of our lives may be skewed towards negative portrayals.",Mobile Compared to Immobile Communication,Communication and Technology
2015-1074,2015,Paper Session,"Media Competition for Time and Gratification in a Multimedia Environment: An Analysis of the Audience’s Gratification Niche among Mobile Media, Personal Computer, and Television",1,"This study has attempted to examine competition among mobile media, the PC, and TV. To develop the research questions, this study performed literature analysis of the niche gratification theory on previous literature. Three key factors, the cognitive factor, gratification opportunities factor, and affective factor, were drawn as specific gratifications for using various types of media devices. These three factors fit best with the cognitive and affective gratifications from Uses and Gratifications research.
The results showed that, overall, the smartphone provided the highest level of gratification, while TV had the narrowest niche breadth. This means that the smartphone is a generalist medium that may satisfy the needs of users in almost all dimensions, while TV is a specialist platform with a niche breadth score closer to 0 than 1. The smartphone and tablet devices have a strong gratification overlap and many common functions. It seems likely that continued innovation of these devices will go hand-in-hand with their ongoing mutual competition. For competitive superiority, the smartphone was the most superior medium, but not for the cognitive factor. This means that media users preferred the PC when they searched for information. PC technology is more mature than that of the smartphone and tablet. Thus, the PC has a more powerful ability to work on complex and sophisticated tasks than does the smartphone or tablet device. The results of this current study reflect the perspective of uses and gratifications theory and current trends in convergence of various media platforms. This study shows that although the usage of mobile media is increasing, individuals still use mobile media, personal computer, and TV together. Thus, these results demonstrate the converging trend of various media platform rather than displacement.",Mobile Compared to Immobile Communication,Communication and Technology
2015-1075,2015,Paper Session,Mobile as Lived-Experience Across the Generations,2,"While younger adults use more mobile social media than older adults, both groups anchor daily social interactions across time and geography. A four-year qualitative study of younger and older adults’ social media and mobile use is presented based on 190 interviews from a grounded theory analysis. This study explores social media across two generational categories: Millennials or young adults (ages 19 to 34) and older adults (ages 35 to 64). The latter category encompasses Gen Xers 34-45; Young Boomers 46-55; and Older Boomers 56-64. A major theme is hyper-mobility “I check-in; therefore, I am” that offers an ontological shift for Millennials. Subordinate themes are for Millennials are geo-tagging and ubiquitous use of mobile devices.
For older adults, mobile connections are more task oriented, restricted in time or place, and do not represent an ontological shift.",Mobile Compared to Immobile Communication,Communication and Technology
2015-1076,2015,Paper Session,Sharing “Moments” on Snapchat for Affective Well-Being,4,"Little research has studied Snapchat, a relatively new mobile social media application that enables users to share image-based content that expires after a few seconds. In the current study, we draw on qualitative and quantitative data collected from a random sample of college students (N=154) who participated in a two-week experience sampling method (ESM) study that produced 11,215 surveys. A subset (N=28) of these participants were also interviewed. Study 1 findings showed that Snapchat interactions were perceived as significantly more socially enjoyable than other channels (e.g., calling, texting, emailing, Facebook). However, Snapchat interactions were viewed as less socially supportive than other technology-mediated and face-to-face interactions. Study 2 findings suggest that the distinctive social and emotional experiences of Snapchat stem from sharing mundane experiences, humorous moments, and unfiltered self-presentational content with close ties in ways that served to maintain social connections throughout the day.",Mobile Compared to Immobile Communication,Communication and Technology
2015-1077,2015,Paper Session,Children Talking Television: The Salience and Functions of Media Content in Child Peer Interactions,2,"The study aims at exploring the salience and functions of media and television contents in children's lives (ages 4-7) by focusing on their uses as a discursive resource in naturally occurring peer talk. We observed and recorded Israeli children talk in everyday, natural settings in two separate studies, in 1999-2002, and in 2012-2013. Detailed discourse analysis of television based interactions from an ethnographic, child-centered perspective reveals the enduring centrality of television as an enjoyable, available and shared cultural resource with valuable social, cognitive and discursive affordances: it is frequently mentioned during everyday adults-free interactions; utilized as the basis for drawing and negotiating boundaries and hierarchies within the peer community; and facilitates experiencing a variety of discursive literacy skills, ranging between practicing adherence to original texts and creativity and distancing from them. These findings provide further evidence for the mediatization of everyday life, and may have educational implications, which are discussed.","Social Interaction and Media: Television, Networked Radio, and the Web",Language & Social Interaction

In Ghana, old and new media intersect in ways that reveal broader changes to public discourse, particularly on issues of citizenship and class. Through an analysis of an urban English-speaking station’s interactions both on air and online, this paper shows why radio remains a significant social and cultural institution in the country, and how convergence underscores broader cultural shifts, not just technological change.","Social Interaction and Media: Television, Networked Radio, and the Web",Language & Social Interaction
2015-1079,2015,Paper Session,Statements on a Cold Case,1,"In this case study, we want to gain insight into how residents of three municipalities communicate about the new murder scenario of the cold case of Marianne Vaatstra and the possibility of a large-scale DNA familial searching. We investigate how stakeholders shape their arguments in conversation with each other and with the police. We analyze the statements that participants use to achieve certain effects in their interactions with others in three focus groups. The results show that the analyzed statements are strong normative orientated. We see two aspects emerge that affect the support for large-scale DNA familial searching. These are:
1. Cautious formulations: respondents showed restraint in making personal judgments and often formulated these on behalf of others. Participants would not fully express themselves, but adjusted to what seemed the socially desirable course.
2. Collective identity: respondents focused on the similarities between themselves and the needs, interests, and goals of other participants. Participants also tried in a discursive way to convince each other to participate in the large-scale familial searching.
These two major discursive activities offered the communication discipline guidance for interventions into the subsequent communication strategy.","Social Interaction and Media: Television, Networked Radio, and the Web",Language & Social Interaction

SEM was used to test a mediational path model of PO communication style (conversation vs. conformity) on women’s self-reported reactance, self-efficacy to avoid substance use, restoration, and subsequent substance use and official records of substance-use violations. Results demonstrate that perceptions of PO conversational communication style were negatively associated with reactance, but positively associated with self-efficacy to avoid drugs and alcohol. Conversely, women who perceived their POs to have a conformity communication style were more likely to report higher levels of reactance and lower self-efficacy to avoid drugs and alcohol. Reactance led to desire to restore freedom, while self efficacy to avoid drugs and alcohol did not. Desire to restore freedom led to reports of using drugs and alcohol and violations by POs for using drugs and alcohol.",Communication About Drugs and Medication,Health Communication
2015-1082,2015,Paper Session,Does Personality Predict Information Seeking About Drugs? Using the Big 5 to Profile Personality Traits of College Students Who Actively Seek Information About Marijuana,4,"Previous research identifies demographic and psychosocial variables of college students who engage in drug-related information seeking, a significant and positive correlate of intention to use drugs nonmedically. The present study adds to this body of work by exploring how personality traits shape information seeking related to marijuana. Participants ages 18-25 (N=632) and enrolled in a large US university participated in an online survey conducted between October 2012 and December 2013. Personality traits were assessed using a validated abbreviated measure of the Big 5. The Big 5 is a widely used framework measuring personality across five dimensions: Conscientiousness, openness to experience, neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness. Agreeableness and neuroticism were positively associated with information seeking about marijuana, accounting for a range of other covariates. The estimated odds of seeking information about marijuana were 1.2 times as high among participants scoring highly in agreeableness [OR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.01-1.54)]. Similarly, the odds of seeking information about marijuana were 1.2 times as high among participants scoring highly in neuroticism [OR = 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04-1.43)]. Neuroticism moderated the effect of agreeableness on likelihood of seeking marijuana-related information. Among respondents low in agreeableness, with increased levels of neuroticism the predicted likelihood of seeking marijuana-related information increased from 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.15) to 0.36 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.43). Future interventions may consider tailoring materials to reflect the personality profile of information seekers, particularly those who experience high levels of anxiety, or are motivated to appear agreeable to others.",Communication About Drugs and Medication,Health Communication

A Framing Analysis of Cannabis for Therapeutic Purposes (CTP) in Israeli Newspaper Coverage",3,"Cannabis for Therapeutic Purposes (CTP) has become a topic of increasing public interest and debate worldwide, particularly in Israel, where demand for, and provision of licenses for CTP has increased substantially since 2007. News media framing of CTP may influence public perceptions and public opinion regarding CTP policy. We conducted a content analysis of all news items related to CTP (N=208) published in three Israeli national news sources from January 2007 through June 2013 to examine how this issue is framed in Israeli news coverage. This study examines three principal frames for CTP: a medical frame, a policy frame, and a law enforcement frame. Each frame was associated with a distinct pattern of textual elements, including sources cited, portrayal of patients, and whether cannabis was described as a drug or as a medicine. The most common frame for CTP in news coverage during this period was the policy frame.",Communication About Drugs and Medication,Health Communication
2015-1084,2015,Paper Session,"Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, Information Seeking, and Medication Consumption",3,"Direct-to-consumer advertising exerts strong influence on the way of medical information seeking and medication consumption. Previous studies have mostly focused on the effects of DTCA on physician-involved information seeking. However, medical information has become more available and accessible to consumers with advance of information technology. The purpose of this study is to understand how people seek information as a response to DTCA and how information seeking style influences consumption behavior (e.g., consumption of prescription or non-prescription drugs and preference for brand medication). With a sample drawn from a large, nationally representative survey of health attitudes, behaviors and consumption, this identifies two types of information seeking: self-directed information seeking and physician-involved information seeking. The results show that while DTCA is positively related to consumption of medication, its impact is moderated by information seeking styles. Brand medication preference is positively related to DTCA and self-directed information seeking, whereas physician-involved information seeking has a negative relation with it.",Communication About Drugs and Medication,Health Communication
2015-1085,2015,Paper Session,The American Medicine Chest Challenge: Evaluation of a Drug Take-Back and Disposal Campaign,1,"Prescription drug abuse poses a unique challenge to public health campaigns because the need to balance prevention, education, and enforcement competes with the need for secure and legitimate access to controlled substances and prescription drugs. Therefore, the Partnership for a Drug-Free New Jersey (PDFNJ) created and implemented the American Medicine Chest Challenge (AMCC) as the first large-scale organized effort to promote the disposal of unused, unwanted or expired medications to a national audience. Our study systematically evaluated the efficacy of the drug take-back program and generated evidence for assessing its impact on members of the community in terms of attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. Methods include data collected by public interest polling surveys before and after the national disposal periods. Overall, the study found significant campaign exposure to the target audience, a greater public awareness of prescription drug abuse as a growing problem, and an increase in influence and practice of the campaign’s behavioral recommendations.",Communication About Drugs and Medication,Health Communication

The results show that both factors played a significant role, but that the performance explanation, measured as perception of news media corruption, was slightly more powerful than the cultural explanation, measured as generalized trust, or trust in people that we don’t know personally. The results also showed that more than 20 years after the fall of Communism in Serbia, the levels of trust in news media and generalized trust remain low, while the perceptions of news media corruption reached extremely high levels. Before testing cultural and performance theories, the meanings of three main variables were explored, by conducting 20 in-depth interviews on a separate sample of the Serbian population.",Global/Regional Media Flows and Citizen Health and Identity,Global Communication and Social Change

Aid to Audiovisual Industries Abroad,1,"Since the 1970s, international organizations – particularly UNESCO and the EU – have increasingly directed funding and resources to audiovisual industries in the Global South. Programs such as UNESCO’s Fund for the Promotion of Culture or the EU’s ACP-Films and Euromed Audiovisual fund technical training for audiovisual professionals, global and regional film distribution, and occasionally the production of films and TV shows. In this paper, I trace the emergence of EU audiovisual aid programs, situating them within postwar practices and discourses of international development, media globalization, and international institutions. While small in scale compared to other development aid programs, I argue that these transnational interventions in cultural production are nevertheless representative of larger post WWII trends in the institutionalization of culture as a panacea for the symptoms of globalization.",Global/Regional Media Flows and Citizen Health and Identity,Global Communication and Social Change

This study includes 210 nations and estimates of Tweet mentions of each nation derived from full fire hose access to Twitter in 2013. Findings of this study identify key trends that push the boundaries of world system theory and global information flows. The results also suggest a new era of international communication via social networks. Though core and semi-periphery countries still are more mentioned on balance than are periphery countries, other factors--namely mobile phone penetration and sociopolitical instability--are reshaping the contours of country image. Nearly unthinkable from legacy media perspective, just 28% of the fifty most-mentioned countries on Twitter were core nations.

Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behavior (TRA/TPB), this study used both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess variables likely to influence intended and actual positive interactions on part of the medical staff with the Roma. For HBM, results indicated that those who believed the Roma have changed their behaviors positively had a greater intention to interact positively with the Roma. For TRA/TPB, greater perceived behavioral control over the provision of medical service as well as more positive attitude to the behavior. Thus attitudes about the Roma and about their own control over the medical system, and particularly attitude about benefits of good medical care emerged as predictors of behavioral intention and behavior.

The Politics of the “Garbage Dump of History” Trope in Arab Media,1,"This paper explores the meanings of the trope of the “garbage dump of history” and its use in Arab media. During the 2011 Arab uprisings, an often overlooked aspect of media activism is how “history” is deployed as a future-oriented call for action. In fact, in the Arab case, the trope of “history” was used to communicate political projects, attack adversaries, and express deep-rooted anxieties in political culture. Initially, history was summoned as an urgent call for participation in revolutions of historic significance. However, following the struggle for power in many Arab countries, history became a violent trope for the rejection of political opponents. Using literature on history, modernity, and trash as a cultural category, I analyze the garbage dump of history trope, as a communicative act within the current context of revolution and civil strife in the Arab world.",Rhetorical Filters and Politics of the State,Popular Communication

I argue that the very visibility of ASL translation—the manual signs, incorporation of the body, and presence alongside speakers—poses a challenge to the ways in which media access for linguistic minorities and people with disabilities has been regularly rendered invisible. However, visibility may not be a solution; the spectacularization of ASL translation for a hearing audience allows it to remain exoticized even as it is briefly made part of public discourse.",Rhetorical Filters and Politics of the State,Popular Communication

This paper examines a specific popular modality of these - ethnocentric consumption- and argues that it needs to be nuanced as a buy national campaign; firstly, it is an alternative vehicle for political parties. Secondly, it is tied around a normative and mythological narrative of economic recovery. Thirdly, its overall target is maximizing competitiveness on a global scale and, finally, it demonstrates a close and dangerous relationship with economic nationalism. In doing so, it questions the relationship between nationalism and consumption in Eurozone countries which have been adopting austerity policies.",Rhetorical Filters and Politics of the State,Popular Communication
2015-1094,2015,Paper Session,Creating the Social-Critical Telenovela in Brazil: How Television Drama by Left-Wing Writers Came to Dominate the National Agenda Under Military Dictatorship in Brazil,2,"This paper intends to re-examine a case that was crucial in the original debate between cultural imperialism and what was then emerging in the 1980s in cultural industry analysis and cultural studies that contributed to the globalization paradigm. At the time the case of Brazilian television showed that national production was rising, not being diminished by an overwhelming wave of U.S. imports (Nordenstreng and Varis 1974), contradicting somewhat the predictions of both media imperialism and cultural imperialism theories (Straubhaar 1981, 1984). It led to a counter theory of cultural proximity, which posited that the aggregate cultural agency of the Brazilian public’s preference for national production created a space for that production, when industry had the resources to meet it (Straubhaar 1991). We want to bring in some useful perspectives from the new emerging paradigm of critical media industry studies, but also to critique that paradigm somewhat in light of the continuing importance of classic political economy in explaining aspects of this case.
The case in point here is the initial rise to rapid dominance in Brazil of TV Globo, in a complex interaction between Globo’s joint venture partner Time-Life, the Brazilian military government, the managers of TV Globo (who were delegated remarkable authority for that situation, time and place), and the writers, directors, and others they hired. Many of the latter were communists, exactly the people the military had sworn to repress and drive out of political power. So there seems to be an intense contradiction here. What were missing in earlier accounts, including my own (1981, 1984, 1991), were two critical things: First, an appreciation of these internal contradictions and the use of agency by all of the participants that they represented. To better understand this theoretically, aspects of current media industries theory (Havens, et al) are quite useful. Second, however, is an appreciation of the continuing predictive value of the political economy espoused at the time by Herb Schiller, and further developed by Brazilian political economists themselves (Bolano). While current media industry theorists bring a crucial understanding of the agency involved by actors within media industries, they sometimes miss the continuing importance of the overall political economic structures of those industries within their national and global context.",Rhetorical Filters and Politics of the State,Popular Communication
2015-1095,2015,Paper Session,Popular Articulations of the Network in Conflict: Circulating Threats in the Red Scare and the War on Terror,1,"This paper examines the historical and contemporary mobilization of the concept of the “network” vis-à-vis conflict in America during the Red Scare and the War on Terror. In each period, a threat is thought to have seeped into America – via popular communication technologies – taking on multiple, shifting forms making the enemy indistinguishable from the citizen and stoking fears of infiltration and radicalization, respectively. Using government hearings and criminal trials of each period, this paper retraces how various nodes (objects and spaces of popular culture) and ties have been articulated in efforts to identify the enemy. This paper argues that the network is mobilized in ways (overlaying material, social and ideological nodes and ties) that facilitate an easier placement of particular individuals into the category of enemy while simultaneously formulating a threat that is amorphous, mobile, and ubiquitous, effectively turning every citizen into a potential enemy. These two functions reinforce one another, a relation dependent on particular popular articulations of the “network.”",Rhetorical Filters and Politics of the State,Popular Communication
2015-1096,2015,Paper Session,Disentangling Location Based Mobile Advertising: The Effects of Location Congruence and Medium on Buying Behavior,6,"An emerging body of research focuses on location-based advertising (LBA). This literature suggests that the merits of LBA rely on the fact that consumers can be targeted with location-congruent ads on their personal mobile devices. However, it has not yet been taken into account that LBA consists of two underlying constructs: location congruence (congruent vs. incongruent) and medium type (mobile vs. stationary). The present study aims to disentangle these underlying constructs and to show that they affect ad efficacy in different ways. Using a virtual reality lab experiment, this study shows that location-congruent ads affect buying behaviour more than location incongruent ads, and that medium type does not render any differences on buying behaviour. However, in location incongruent situations, mobile ads are more effective than stationary ads as they facilitate consumers’ recall of the ads. Contrary to suggestions from earlier research, the advantages of mobile ads do not lie in location-congruent situations, but rather in enhancing consumers’ attention towards the ad in situations that are location incongruent.",Locative Mobile Issues,Communication and Technology

This paper presents two experimental studies that address these concerns. In a first study we examined the impact of phubbing on the impression that people form of the phubber’s politeness, attentiveness and popularity. The findings of the experiment revealed a significant negative impact of phubbing on each of these attributes. Whether the phubbing behavior was self-initiated or occurred in response to a notification did not moderate these relationships. In a second study we examined the impact of phubbing on the conversation partner’s perceived conversation quality, social attraction and relationship quality. Perceived conversation quality was negatively affected by phubbing behavior, while perceived social attraction and relationship quality were not. Whether conversation partners were acquainted or not, did not moderate the impact of phubbing on these relational outcomes.",Locative Mobile Issues,Communication and Technology

This paper replicates this method using an alternative health behavior (pro-organ-donation) and set of related participant-level variables in order to elucidate how the dynamics of health-message processing are specific to topic versus general to the task of media-message processing. Using mathematical cognitive modeling, we predict the trajectory of self-reported persuasion effects in response to multi-argument “testimonials.” Self-reported responses were recorded continuously during message receipt. Preliminary data suggest a recency effect where messages were rated as more persuasive toward the end of the message when the strongest information was presented last, suggesting that the recency effect is a feature of the message-processing task. We also find that behavior-relevant attitudes impact the argument evaluation and integration.

Overcoming misinformation is rendered more difficult both because processed deception lays down a memory trace that is difficult to dislodge and, when misinformation is corrected, repetition of the original content included in the correction reinforces the original memory trace. Our research uses an inductive model that reframes by raising a question to be answered by viewers as deceptive content is played. During exposure, the deceptive content is distanced in a boxed labeled screen, question marks on screen, aversive audio cues and a cracking screen reminding viewers that the content is suspect. Corrective print appears at the end. In this experiment, viewers are exposed to three instances, each including the same deceptive inference. In two of four conditions viewers see the corrective structure.

2015-1102,2015,Paper Session,Message Framing Tailored to the Patients’ Regulatory Focus as a Tool to Promote Medication Adherence,2,"We propose that gain or loss framed messages matching patients’ regulatory focus is an effective communication strategy to address beliefs about medication adherence, thus promote compliance. Regulatory focus theory distinguish promotion (supports eager strategy) and prevention focused (implies vigilant strategy) orientation. Data from in-depth interviews indicate that chronic patients’ decision making and self-reported behavioral pattern regarding medication adherence is explicable by the regulatory focus theory, particularly judgment strategy preferences. As far as decision-making about medication adherence is concerned, one group of patients apply vigilant judgment strategies choosing the perceived safest solution in order to avoid losses, meanwhile patients who prefer eager judgment strategies are trying all the alternatives hoping for possible gains. In summary, regulatory focus theory is a suitable approach explaining patients’ health-related decision making and compliance. Thus, framing messages matching patients’ regulatory focus might be a useful tool to address patients’ beliefs about medication adherence.",Media and Message Effects: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication

PSAs that run counter to teens’ peer norms can trigger biased processing, which may increase the attractiveness of cigarette uptake. The experiment reported here found that teens with a less accessible anti-smoking peer norm were more likely to report reactance to anti-smoking PSAs than those with a more accessible anti-smoking norm. In turn, reactance predicted smoking intention three months later. The results indicate that having an accessible anti-smoking norm is a protective factor: Cigarette uptake may be less appealing to teens who can easily bring to mind the idea that their good friends disapprove of smoking.",Media and Message Effects: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication
2015-1104,2015,Paper Session,Reducing the Negative Effects of Cultivation: Evaluation of a Digital Media Intervention for HIV/AIDS Stigma,3,"Background: While hysteria-fueled media coverage of Ebola increasingly dominates the airwaves, a more common infectious disease continues to pose a severe threat to public health. Around the globe, approximately 35 million people are currently living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (WHO, 2014). Whether informational or entertainment-oriented, television content related to HIV has the potential to negatively impact the health of infected individuals by cultivating myths that lead to fear, stigma, and discrimination (Bryant & Oliver, 2008; Gerbner & Gross, 1976). The first aim of this study is to examine cultivation effects on HIV prevalence estimates, transmission risk estimates, and interpersonal comfort with HIV-infected individuals. We hypothesize that medical-oriented TV viewing (i.e., genre-specific cultivation) will be a better predictor than overall TV viewing (i.e., traditional cultivation). We then turn to an evaluation of a digital media intervention designed to reduce HIV stigma and discrimination among the general population. We predict that reductions in transmission risk estimates will mediate the intervention’s positive effect on interpersonal comfort. Method: Participants (N = 1306) were recruited in October 2014 from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online participant pool. All were United States residents at least 18 years of age (M = 36, SD = 12; range = 18 to 75). The majority were Caucasian (77%), female (54%), unmarried (59%), and identified as hetereosexual (87%). Approximately 34% reported knowing someone with HIV. Participants reported overall television viewing in addition to genre-specific viewing of medical dramas, talk shows, reality shows, and comedies (adapted from Shrum, 2001). They were then randomly assigned to a control condition or to a treatment condition in which they viewed an anti-stigma digital media intervention. In this one-minute PSA-style YouTube campaign, an animated physician attempted to increase interpersonal comfort by debunking transmission myths commonly perpetuated by popular media (www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA4fkO6Vz98). Participants in both groups then estimated HIV prevalence in the United States. This was followed by a 6-item measure of transmission risk estimates (e.g., using public toilets; sharing eating utensils; alpha = .89) and a measure of interpersonal comfort across eight situations (e.g., taking care of someone who is infected; working with someone who is infected; alpha = .93). Results: Age, education, sex, social conservatism, and knowing someone with HIV/AIDS were included as covariates in each analysis. All hypotheses were supported. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that medical-oriented (but not overall) TV viewing was associated with increased prevalence estimates (b = .10, p < .05), heightened transmission risk estimates (b = .09, p < .05), and decreased interpersonal comfort (b = -.08, p < .05). Intervention effectiveness was examined with Hayes’ (2013) PROCESS macro for SPSS. Controlling for demographics and medical-oriented TV viewing, a total of 5000 bootstrap samples were generated, producing bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals for assessing the significance of the indirect effect. The total effect of intervention exposure on interpersonal comfort was positive and significant (B = .21, p < .001). The hypothesised indirect effect was also positive and significant (B = .24; 95% BCa CI = .18 to .30). Intervention exposure led to decreased transmission risk estimates (B = -.55, p < .001). This in turn led to increased interpersonal comfort (B = -.43, p < .001). Controlling for all other variables, the direct effect was non-significant (B = -.03, p > .50). Discussion: Findings support the genre-specific cultivation perspective. Variance accounted for was small, but in line with similar effect sizes reported in the cultivation literature. Although our digital media intervention successfully corrected misconceptions and increased interpersonal comfort, it remains unclear how persuasiveness might be moderated by relevant health and media constructs. Future work should extend these findings to other stigmatized health conditions such as obesity and mental illness.",Media and Message Effects: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication
2015-1105,2015,Paper Session,The Role of Media Use in Genderizing Disease,4,"On average, men die seven years earlier and suffer from more serious diseases than women do. Sensible health behaviors, such as help-seeking, are often antithetical to masculinity. Moreover, when diseases are associated with a specific gender, it is likely to affect health behavior. The media’s influence on the public health gender divide is at least two-fold: it contributes to gender socialization, by perpetuating gender stereotypes and provides audiences with copious amounts of health-related information. Establishing how variations in media use may affect gendered susceptibility to diseases was the main aim of the present study. By means of a survey, 764 college students were questioned about their gender perceptions of 48 diseases as well as the amount of attention they paid to news, entertainment and medical-related media. Preliminary hierarchical regression analyses show that medical-related media and general entertainment media are significant predictors of gender-based perceptions of disease typicality.",Media and Message Effects: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication

Behind the so-called “Iron Curtain” under the control of President Nicolae Ceaucescu, an IREX-funded research study on the influences of American film and television on Romanian adolescents was begun.The research strategy in Romania involved a multiple operational approach which combined both quantitative and qualitative components with anonymity in the field. The research began with a month in Bucharest researching the media (television, cinema, radio, and, to a lesser extent, publishing) gatekeepers’ philosophies, strategies, and methods for deciding what could be used in the Romanian media and the resulting permitted materials decisions. Followed by five months in the small industrial town of Busteni, located in the Carpathian mountains between the ancient regions of Transylvania and Walachia, the focus of the research was on adolescents (identified as students between 12 and 18 years of age) for several reasons: 1) they were the most accessible population, since they were not too young to meet and work on materials, nor already tied up with work and family, 2) they were the most open to discussion with “foreigners”, and 3) their ideas and eventual life choices were considered by both Romanian and American academics to be an indicator of the future success of the Socialist agenda. Fast forward 35 years to a new political system, new life-styles and choices, freedom of speech for the population. Using the same research multiple operational research methodology (slightly adapted for the new circumstances), the researcher explore whether the influences which existed in the previous generation are still affecting the current adolescent generation.",Innovative International Media Research,Intercultural Communication

This study explores how members contribute to a social movement through a Facebook group, centered on policy and societal changes for hijab-laws in Iran. Two Facebook groups, “Unveil Women’s Rights to Unveil” and “My Stealthy Freedom” encourage Iranian women to share photographs of themselves taking off their traditional and legally required head coverings as a form of collective protest. Using an analysis of text and visuals on the pages, this study explores how individuals understand themselves as a part of these collective movements through the notions of risk, locality, and narratives. This study offers contributions for those studying social movements, digital identity, and social media use under repressive cultural environments.",Innovative International Media Research,Intercultural Communication
2015-1108,2015,Paper Session,The Emergence of a Resistant Discourse: The Case of Ultra-Orthodox Media in Israel,2,"In an attempt to examine how alternative discourses are constructed in a conservative society, this article presents four discursive strategies used by an Israeli ultra-orthodox Jewish magazine to subvert hegemonic rabbinical authority and to speak in an alternative voice within a highly conservative society. These strategies are: cushioning, discursive hybrids, explicit provocation and trivializing. Based on the qualitative content analysis of 229 articles published in the weekly magazine, Mishpacha (Family), the study seeks to contribute to the existing literature on alternative media by exposing the complex and heterogeneous nature of discursive resistance and practices. Furthermore, the paper offers a glimpse into the ways that a social group within a religious society resists authority though without shattering its ideological basis.",Innovative International Media Research,Intercultural Communication
2015-1109,2015,Paper Session,Third-Person Perception for Foreign Media Influence and its Implications for National Culture Policy Support,2,"As the media market becomes more globalized, it is easier for local audiences to be exposed to foreign media content. Because media content is a cultural product, there has been active controversy over the negative cultural influence of foreign media. Although empirical findings had generally discredited the foreign media’s cultural influence on local audiences, concern about foreign media’s ‘cultural invasion’ continues in recent popular discourse. Based on the ‘third-person effect theory,’ which has never been tested in the cross-border media effect literature, this study finds irregular viewers of foreign TV dramas, but not regular viewers, believe that foreign dramas negatively affect others cultural identities but not its own. Also, this study finds that third-person perception is positively related with stronger support for national culture policy aimed at protecting local identity. This study’s findings theoretically explain (1) why negative cultural influence of foreign media, which has been discredited in most empirical studies, continues in popular discourses; and (2) how such third-person perception is related to public opinion about national culture policy. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.",Innovative International Media Research,Intercultural Communication
2015-1110,2015,Paper Session,An Examination of Consumer-Company Identification as a Key Predictor of Consumer Responses in Corporate Crisis,2,"Through an experiment, this study examined how varying degrees of consumer-company identification affected consumers’ perception of and reaction to corporate crisis and the crisis-affected company. Results suggested that compared with weak identifiers, strong identifiers’ identification level had a larger decrease in a high severity condition but not in a low severity condition. Furthermore, two-sided response messages were more effective in reducing the attribution of crisis responsibility than one-sided positive response messages for weak identifiers, while one-sided positive response messages were more effective than two-sided response messages for strong identifiers. But this message effect was only found in low but not high severity crisis. Findings of the study indicated that consumer-company identification may serve as a key variable in predicting consumer responses to crisis and that crisis severity may serve as a boundary condition determining the effectiveness of crisis response messages.",Stakeholder Response to Crisis,Public Relations
2015-1111,2015,Paper Session,Measuring Public Response to Crisis Communication Strategies: A Crisis Case of Two Chinese Herbal Tea Companies,1,"In crisis, the perceptions of organizational responsibility and culpability are sometimes greater than what the reality is. The most vital thing is not whether an organization in fact should shoulder the responsibility for a crisis or not, but whether it is thought to be responsible for crisis (Benoit, 1997). Today, with the booming of Internet and social media, crisis managers are facing even more challenges (Coombs, 2012). The purpose of this paper is to test the theoretical models that organizations utilize to manage and handle crisis. Four kinds of crisis strategies are taken into consideration: deny, diminish, rebuild and reinforce. This article also compares three kinds of crisis information resources, namely traditional media, new social media and offline work-of-mouth communication, and their effects on crisis response strategies. A famous lawsuit between two Chinese herbal tea companies is used in this research to test the crisis strategies and crisis information resources in public’s mind. The results show that the “diminish” crisis response was more acceptable for study participants. Additionally, traditional media are regarded as a more reliable source of information about the crisis for participants. The implications for crisis research and information channels are explored.",Stakeholder Response to Crisis,Public Relations
2015-1112,2015,Paper Session,When No One Else Listens: A Community Response to an Environmental Crisis,1,"Crises can limit the ability to spread essential information to those directly affected. This contention is especially true in crises that include physical harm. As specific guidelines must be met for governmental agencies to respond to a disaster area, there are times when the best communicators are those already a part of the community. Thus, this there is a need to examine communication messages from community groups to the public during times of crisis. This case study examines one community organization’s response, the LEAD Agency, on the Tar Creek Superfund site that emerged when other responding agencies were unable to assist. Specifically, it helps to explain how one community organization aided in the sensemaking process during clean-up process. Further, this study outlines the application of sensemaking in a slow-developing and toxic disaster environment.

The study moves beyond initial crisis response and uses Situational Crisis Communication Theory to explore (1) participants’ reaction to an organization’s second crisis response after having been exposed to the organization’s initial crisis response (within-group comparison), and (2) participants reaction to the same crisis response depending on whether the response was the organization’s initial response or its second response (between-group comparison).

2015-1114,2015,Paper Session,Communication in Times of Crisis: The Stakeholder-Organization Relationship Under Pressure,4,"This paper studies the interplay between organizations and their stakeholders during organizational crises. During a crisis, the stakeholder-organization relationships are likely to be under pressure, and therewith the organization’s reputation and the crisis intensity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how, during a crisis, pressure from both internal stakeholders (i.e., management and employees) and external stakeholders (i.e., news media and general public) influences communicative relationships between organizations and these stakeholders. 444 European public-relations professionals, who experienced a crisis, were surveyed about crisis and routine times. Special focus was on the mediation role of time pressure and uncertainty. Structural-equation models revealed that, in crisis, the increased pressure from news media, the public, and employees negatively affects the organizations’ communicative relationship with these stakeholders, whereas management pressure was found to have a positive effect. This observation might point to organizational isolation on a managerial level in the initial crisis phase.",Stakeholder Response to Crisis,Public Relations

It argues that attempts by British media and elites to construct extremism as a problem for all of Britain was undermined by rhetoric that consistently differentiated British Muslims from the larger British national community. It begins by examining the way in which the media constructs meaning around critical ethnic events. Next, three broad themes extracted from the coverage are discussed, including the narrow definition of extremism as Islamic, the contextualization of policy responses as applying to only certain citizens, and the consistent Othering of the individual suspects specifically and the Islamic community more generally. Finally, it considers the broader implications such constructions can have for the spread of radical Islam and the development of ideologically conservative political responses.","Race, Nationality, and the News",Journalism Studies

Using a dual method approach, we conducted a content analysis of the local evening news broadcasts, along with in-depth interviews with the reporters working at those stations to better understand not only how race is portrayed, but how it informs the journalists' decisions when covering TV news stories. Results suggest that racial representation remains problematic, but local television news journalists appear to be actively considering race when covering a news story.","Race, Nationality, and the News",Journalism Studies

A year of (often vitriolic) debate ensued in mainstream news organizations and social media. Using critical discourse analysis, this research seeks to document the legitimation strategies of those people – school officials, youth and civil rights activists, parents, journalists, and others – who authored this public conversation. Buoyed by textual analysis and in-depth interviews, the evidence demonstrated that even as journalists reified the White establishment and officials worked to reinforce the status quo through their legitimation techniques, the narrative strategies of Blacks and other supporters of the charter school forced an alternative discourse to develop. The piece also uses the interviews to understand how objective journalist practices and organizational constraints stymie well-meaning reporters when trying to story tell about marginalized communities and issues of race.","Race, Nationality, and the News",Journalism Studies

A discourse analysis of news, features, and columns identified thematic clusters, rhetorical constructions, and referential strategies through which journalists: 1) give visibility and voice to immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean; 2) inscribe identity onto social groups by constructing boundaries of inclusion and exclusion, and 3) construct common cultural and historical referents for members of the African diaspora. A central argument here is that newspapers produced for U.S.-born African Americans as well as African, Jamaican, Haitian, and other immigrant communities from the Caribbean in the United States contribute to the enduring legacy of the black transnational cultural formation known as the Black Atlantic.","Race, Nationality, and the News",Journalism Studies

This paper offers an empirical exploration of the tension between the ideal of clinical democracy and the entrenched reality of medical dominance. Based on an ethnography of the communicative practices of acute care teams in a Canadian hospital, it describes how authority and power are enacted in the collective accomplishment of a particular interprofessional collaborative practice: the IP patient case review. The patient case review is a discursive practice wherein team members more or less collectively locate the patient’s current situation on the patient care trajectory and circumscribe the most salient concerns, a practice of collective sensemaking.

2015-1121,2015,Paper Session,Eating Their Young: Understanding Nurses’ Intergenerational Communicative Experiences in the Workplace,2,"The demographic landscape of the modern workforce has fundamentally changed as it now contains four distinct generations (Tolbize, 2008; Toosi, 2004, 2012). With that said, intergenerational interactions in the workplace are becoming more common, even though the interlocutors consistently describe communication between age-groups negatively (Coupland, Coupland, Giles, Henwood, & Wieman, 1988; Giles & Gasiorek, 2011). This study, designed to explore intergenerational communication in this increasingly diverse workforce, is informed by Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT), Specifically, nurses were interviewed in order to understand how people from three age-groups experience and describe intergenerational communication in healthcare settings. Results show that the nurses characterize colleagues from other age groups negatively and express dissatisfaction and frustration concerning intergenerational interactions. These experiences extend past the over-accommodating, under-accommodating, and avoiding forms of communication detailed by CAT as they maintain and perpetuate a larger narrative in which older nurses “eat their young.” Theoretical and practical implications are developed from the findings and center on ways to perturb the divisive narrative and enhance intergenerational communication in the workplace.",Health and Organizing: Diagnosing (Un)Healthy Workplaces,Organizational Communication

By examining prospective members of organizations at their anticipatory socialization phase, the current study developed a model that highlighted the importance of interactional justice, a communication aspect of organizational justice. The findings showed that if management communicated sufficient information and conveyed interpersonal sensitivity, organizational members were more likely to comply with the policy and more attracted to the organization. Analogous to the fair process effect, perceived interactional justice mitigated organizational members’ reactions to negative outcomes. This effect may be labeled fair interaction or fair communication effect. The findings suggested that organizations need to develop an effective communication strategy to attract the most qualified job applicants and secure future compliance.",Health and Organizing: Diagnosing (Un)Healthy Workplaces,Organizational Communication

Once thought to be separate spheres, “religion” and “the media” have come to occupy many of the same spaces as the systems, technologies, and practices of media have come to determine widening circles of social and cultural life. Other social institutions, including the state, education, politics and the domestic sphere, have confronted new realities as the media have grown in importance. Relatively little attention has been given to the specific implications of this for religious institutions, practices, doctrines and communities, but the implications are profound and far-reaching. This paper looks specifically at how religious authority is challenged in a range of ways by media and practices of mediation. Religious institutions and leaders have been slow to recognize the subtle, nuanced, and layered ways that their prospects are today framed and determined by media and of mediation.",Investigating Mediated Authority: Theories and Methods,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Actors construct themselves and other in different ways, refer to different systems of knowledge and practices, and use different types of texts and different rhetoric or argumentative devices. Most importantly, contributions can imply various understandings of what type of discourse is to realized, and they can be analyzed at varying levels, implying different theoretical concepts on “discourses.” We apply this perspective (the discursive construction of a discourse’s structure and multiple theoretical descriptions as “discourse”) to the discussion on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), a debate on the regulation of the Internet that has largely been lead on the Internet.

Specifically, the content analysis examines the issue of age compression: the ""adultification"" of girls and ""youthification"" of women, in which girls are ""dressed up"" to look like women, and women are ""dressed down"" to look like girls. Examining a total of 540 images, results showed that adultification of young girls is much more prevalent than youthification of adult women. Moreover, young female models who were adultified were more likely to be provocatively dressed and to exhibit a sexy facial expression; these results suggest that the adultification is utilized to cast young girls into objects of sexual desire. No statistically significant differences were found between magazine types. Results are discussed in light of objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) and the 2007 American Psychological Association Task Force Report on the Sexualization of Girls.","The Media, the Body, and the Self",Children Adolescents and the Media

However, little is known about the causal direction of this effect, the mechanisms underlying this effect, and whether this effect also occurs among boys to the same extent as among girls. The present two-wave panel study among 604 Dutch adolescents (aged 11-18; 50.7% female; 97.7% native Dutch) aimed to fill these gaps in knowledge. Structural equation modeling showed that social network site use predicted increased body dissatisfaction and increased appearance training over time. Appearance training did not predict body dissatisfaction and did not mediate the effect of social network site use on body dissatisfaction. Social network sites impacted the body image of boys and girls to the same extent. These results show that social network sites can play an adverse role in the body image of both adolescent boys and girls.","The Media, the Body, and the Self",Children Adolescents and the Media

In the wake of the media panic that ensued, this paper draws on 6 focus groups, conducted with teenage girls aged 15-18 in July 2013, to explore how girls – participants, lurkers and other members of contemporary culture – discuss their visual social media practices, articulate their do's and don'ts in this context, and consider the consequences of girls' participation in this both explicit and metaphoric site of expression and oppression. We suggest that ironically, the very explicitness of the economy of visibility in the ranking groups crystalizes for the girls the price tag for each choice that they make, the double standard that underlies this economy – as well as their ability to tease and to challenge it.","The Media, the Body, and the Self",Children Adolescents and the Media

The study also examines celebrity involvement as a predictor of the outcome variables. Data was collected through a survey of 1,060 adolescents in Singapore. Regression analyses indicate that social media use was related to adolescents’ body image dissatisfaction. Specifically, social comparison with friends on social media was significantly associated with adolescents’ body image dissatisfaction and drive for thinness or muscularity. Gender differences were also observed – social comparison with celebrities was significantly associated with body image dissatisfaction and drive for thinness among female adolescents. Celebrity involvement significantly predicted male body image dissatisfaction. The study contributes a non-Western perspective to existing media effects and body image research.

Participants consisted of 240 preschool age children (51% female) from three different sites, who were tested at two different time points (approximately one year apart). Reporters consisted of parents and teachers, in addition to an observation of each child in a toy preference task. Cross-sectional results revealed that Disney Princess engagement was associated concurrently with greater adherence to female gender-stereotypical behavior for both boys and girls, better body image for girls, and higher levels of prosocial behavior for girls only. Longitudinal results revealed that Disney Princess engagement was associated with more female gender-stereotypical behavior one year later for girls only, even after controlling for initial levels of gender-stereotypical behavior. There were no significant longitudinal effects on body image or prosocial behavior. Parental mediation did not negate any long-term effects for girls and instead appeared to strengthen associations with body image and prosocial behavior for boys only. Results are discussed in terms of the social cognitive theory of gender development.","The Media, the Body, and the Self",Children Adolescents and the Media

It was found that in the United States, the first Amendment barred the government from protecting religious groups from sacrilegious attacks against their belief, while in Russia, despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press, the government goes out of its way to protect the Russian Orthodox Church from criticism and satire. This is due to the fact that there is a symbiotic politico-cultural relationship between the Russian state and the Russian Orthodox Church. This relationship is detrimental for freedom of expression. The United States and the Russian Federation conceptualize and regulate blasphemy differently due to their different establishmentalities, their conceptualizations of the role of religion in public life and the relationship between church and state.",Moral and Legal Dilemmas in Communication Law and Policy,Communication Law & Policy
2015-1133,2015,Paper Session,"Max Hardcore and the ""Law of the Horse"": Community Standards in Cyberspace",2,"In Miller v. California (1973), the United States Supreme Court set out a standard for assessing obscene speech that required “the average person, applying contemporary community standards” to determine whether “the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.” At the time, this test was appropriate because physical communities were clearly defined and the options for distributing sexually explicit speech were limited to adult bookstores and movie theaters. While Miller remains good law, new communication technology challenges the traditional notion of a community. At the same time, viewers can now access all manner of sexually explicit speech without leaving the privacy of their own homes.

This paper investigates the decisions site administrator Dread Pirate Roberts made to protect buyers and sellers from each other − limiting the items for sale, the escrow system, the commission structure and the reputation mechanism − and both of them from the state via anonymizing technologies. Silk Road may have appealed to users’ cyberlibertarian political beliefs by defying state power, but its success is inseparable from the way its institutional framework counteracted the libertarian ideals of its founders. The example of Silk Road reveals a problem unique to “cryptomarkets:” that the solutions to the twin problems of protecting users from each other and the entire community from the state − embeddedness and anonymity – work against each other.",Moral and Legal Dilemmas in Communication Law and Policy,Communication Law & Policy
2015-1135,2015,Paper Session,Can an Algorithm be Unethical?,4,"In Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), computer algorithms now control the display of content across a wide range of industries and applications, from search results to social media (Gillespie, 2013). Abuses of power by Internet platforms have led to calls for “algorithm transparency” and regulation (Pasquale, 2014). This paper responds by asking what an analyst needs to know about algorithms in order to determine if an ICT is acting improperly, unethically or illegally. It further asks whether “the algorithm” is a useful object for ethical investigation. The paper briefly reviews the technical history of the term, then performs an ethical analysis of a hypothetical surveillance system to investigate the question of whether it is useful to consider an algorithm “unethical” in itself. It finds that law and policy researchers can in fact employ technical expertise about algorithms and that such expertise might be crucial to make judgments about future ICTs.",Moral and Legal Dilemmas in Communication Law and Policy,Communication Law & Policy
2015-1136,2015,Paper Session,Exploring the Nature and Outcomes of Adoption Entrance Narratives Told in Open Adoptive Families,4,"Open adoptions – or those wherein adoptive families know and interact with the birth family – have become increasingly prevalent. With open adoptions come complex identity work and relationships between the birth family, adoptive family, and adoptee. One way adoptive parents help their children to make sense of their adoptive experience is by creating adoption entrance narratives (AENs) that weave together the stories of how the child was born, placed for adoption, and integrated into their family. Thus, in the current study, we content analyzed 201 AENs told by open adoptive parent(s) to their child. Three themes emerged from the data: chosen, birth parents as family, and forever. Structural equation modeling revealed that relational satisfaction between the adoptive parent(s) and birth parent(s), the role of the birth parents in the AEN, and birth parents as family theme directly predicted child well-being, but relational satisfaction did not indirectly affect child outcomes through AENs.",Family Communication: Dynamics and Effects on (Adult) Children,Interpersonal Communication
2015-1137,2015,Paper Session,Family Communication Patterns That Predict Perceptions of Upheaval and Psychological Well-Being for Adult Children of Late-Life Divorce,2,"This study examined the experiences of adult children following their parents’ divorce in later life. Drawing on family communication patterns theory, we examined each parent’s conformity orientation and conversation orientation as predictors of adult children’s perceptions of turbulence and feeling caught, which in turn predicted depressive symptoms and resilience. Adult children (N = 173) who were over the age of 18 at the time of their parents’ divorce completed surveys about their family communication patterns and their perceptions of individual and family outcomes following the divorce. Our findings point to differing conformity and conversation orientations enacted by each parent. Mothers’ and fathers’ conformity orientations predicted perceptions of turbulence and feeling caught, but only fathers’ conversation orientation was associated with feeling caught. Perceptions of turbulence were positively associated with depressive symptoms and negatively associated with resilience for adult children, but feeling caught was only positively associated with depressive symptoms.",Family Communication: Dynamics and Effects on (Adult) Children,Interpersonal Communication
2015-1138,2015,Paper Session,Family Communication and Body Satisfaction Among Young Adult Children: Mediating Effects of Social Competence,2,"Although the link between family-of-origin environment and body dissatisfaction among daughters is well-documented, the mechanism through which family factors may impact daughters' appearance concerns has been relatively unexplored. This study aimed to fill this gap by examining whether or not the association between family factors and daughters’ body satisfaction is mediated by social competence. Female college students (N = 375; M age = 20.19) participated in an online survey which asked them to assess their perception of their mothers’ and fathers’ family communication patterns (FCPs; Fitzpatrick & Ritchie, 1994; Ritchie & Fitzpatrick, 1990). The results showed that only fathers’ conversation orientation was positively related to participants’ social competence and also positively associated with body satisfaction. Possible explanations for the relative importance of fathers over mothers and conversation orientation over conformity orientation will be discussed. Practical implications of the results underscoring the importance of fathers’ conversation orientation will be provided.",Family Communication: Dynamics and Effects on (Adult) Children,Interpersonal Communication
2015-1139,2015,Paper Session,Parental Response to Child’s Incongruence: Verbal Versus Nonverbal Primacy in Parent-Child Interactions,1,"While the question of verbal versus nonverbal primacy has gained intensive interest, considerably less attention has been devoted to parental response to child’s verbal/nonverbal incongruence. This study comprehensively analyzed parental responses to child’s incongruence during mutual interactions. Parent–child interactions (n=160) in structured joint game sequences were filmed in their homes and analyzed using a mixed multi-variant design. Unexpectedly, parents related almost equally to verbal and nonverbal channels. The analysis of a wide-range of social and situational contexts – including child’s gender, parent’s gender, SES, and task difficulty – highlighted their significant effects and delineated the contexts for verbal primacy, nonverbal primacy, and incongruent responses. The study provides a composite theoretical framework for the relative dominance of verbal versus nonverbal communication.",Family Communication: Dynamics and Effects on (Adult) Children,Interpersonal Communication

2015-1141,2015,Paper Session,"The Impact of Maternal and Paternal Communication Dominance on Offspring’s Negative Self-Talk, Depression, and Suicidality",3,"General family functioning has been implicated in suicidality and a variety of adolescent suicide risk factors, such as depression. While some evidence exists that general family processes influence self-harm risk, much of this research focuses on family history of suicide or general family functioning constructs such as cohesion, conflict, or attachment with a paucity of research examining specific parent-offspring communicative interaction that facilitates this functioning. Parent-child communicative interaction is implicated in suicide risk, but often in very general terms such as ""poor” or “unsatisfying” communication. More recently however, more specific parent-offspring interaction patterns such as parental psychological control and dominant-submissive parent-child communication have independently documented associations with depression and suicidality with different models for mothers and fathers. This study examines the impact of maternal and paternal communication dominance on offspring's suicidality, negative self-talk, and depression in a college sample (N = 252). The findings suggest that communication dominance of mothers and fathers increases the likelihood that individuals will suffer depression and engage in negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is the construct through which other factors affect suicidality. Depression did not directly predict suicidality when parental communication dominance is modeled as an exogenous construct.",Family Communication: Dynamics and Effects on (Adult) Children,Interpersonal Communication
2015-1142,2015,Paper Session,(Un)Familiar Spaces of Television Production,1,"The sharing of expertise and know-how was an important practice in the early days of television production; delegations from national broadcasters visited each other to negotiate bilateral agreements concerning co-production and programme exchange. On one such occasion, in spring 1956, the BBC visited Soviet Central Television. Using that visit as vantage point, this paper examines production values and professional ideologies in relation to the material spaces of television production. The paper argues that the British delegation’s encounter with (un)familiar spaces of television production forced them to articulate their own production values. The final discussion suggests that the tensions provoked by the discrepancy between production values at Soviet Central Television and at the BBC may inform the main currents of television studies and television history. The analysis relies upon documents from BBC Written Archives, ranging from initial contacts and preparations for the visit to the official report and follow-up discussions after.",Production Cultures and Cultural Production,Communication History

While the circulation of newspapers as cultural objects cannot be reduced to the circulation figure, their function as mass media can neither escape that reduction. Newspaper technologies beyond the page must be accountable and accounted for in a media history of the structures of reading—the problem is how to avoid the determinist reduction of people and practices to markets and profits. Our answer is to conceive of a subscription as a technology of reading, an act of citizenship, and an adoption of the subjectivity of mass, popular culture.",Production Cultures and Cultural Production,Communication History

This period saw a radical reshaping of the identity of the photographer, and the presence of photography in human life: photography went from taking place largely in the studio at the hands of professionals to being an enormously popular leisure activity that occurred in public spaces and the domestic sphere. With the new mobility of the camera, and its adoption by a suddenly vast class of amateurs, the photographic style of the snapshot emerged, introducing a casual, extemporaneous aesthetic to photography. This paper looks at the marketing strategies that Eastman Kodak employed as it promoted its mass-market cameras with great success, and it also examines the divided public response to the sudden ubiquity of cameras in everyday life.",Production Cultures and Cultural Production,Communication History

A Q-Sort Study of the Perceived Authenticity of Self-Photographs and Selfies,2,"Digital self-representations, for example selfies, are pervasive elements of current digital visual cultures. This paper centers on subjective audience perceptions of expressive authenticity in the field of vernacular self-photography. It reviews research into visual identity work on SNS and visual authenticity in the digital environment. Q methodology, a qualitative-quantitative approach to the study of subjectivity in human behavior, is applied to assess the perceived authenticity of self-representations. Therefore, Q-sorts of 33 different self-photographs were obtained from 29 participants and combined with open interviews in the tradition of visual elicitation. The study provides new insights into the perception of authenticity, as Q factor analysis yielded four groups of participants, who differ regarding their evaluation of the authenticity of self-photographs. The analysis reveals essential differences among the factors as regards the meaning of various features, for example, poses, visual styles, and photographic setting, for the authenticity of self-images.",Authenticity and Iconicity Across Visual Media Genres,Visual Communication Studies

Specifically the paper looks into four oral-history documentaries in which the survived 'comfort women' (or the female sexual slaves that underwent sexual violence during the Second World War in the Asian battlefields) articulate their traumatic/un-representable life-experiences through somatic ways of embodiment instead of semantic languages. Basing on that, this paper argues that the production on the oral testimony of the television station is resulted from the change of publicity strategies of the state-owned media towards marketization and international communication since the early 1990s.",Authenticity and Iconicity Across Visual Media Genres,Visual Communication Studies
2015-1149,2015,Paper Session,Visual Motifs in Islamist Terrorism: Applying Conceptual Metaphor Theory,1,"This paper examines visual motifs in Islamist terrorism based on Conceptual Metaphor Theory, a theory using three key categories of metaphors (structural, orientational, and ontological metaphors). These metaphors are applied to three case studies to show how visual motifs can be used by Islamists to manipulate their audiences. The case studies are the symbols of (1) the waterfall, (2) the hand, and (3) the color black. Overall, in this analysis, an essential deduction from Islamist visual motifs is that metaphors are a principal conceptual system for Islamists. Metaphors are their main conduit for categorizing what they see in their universe and how they perceive both their in-group members and outside groups (e.g., infidels)",Authenticity and Iconicity Across Visual Media Genres,Visual Communication Studies

Unlike other iconic images of human history, conflict and suffering, these images have been credited not with socio-cultural metonymy but with cosmic epiphany; near religious realizations about life, death and eternity. They serve as useful examples for the larger theoretical discussion of iconicity, epiphany, and the public’s relationship with science, and include: the 1945 mushroom cloud from Hiroshima; the floating fetus photographed by Lennart Nilsson published in 1965, and the “Whole Earth” photographed from space in 1972. Their enduring significance obscures their debut to the audience. By returning to their earliest contexts it becomes possible to understand how such images do their cultural work. Our increasingly frenetic media environment demands that we learn more about how any artifact could prompt the audience to pause and ponder about the cosmos.",Authenticity and Iconicity Across Visual Media Genres,Visual Communication Studies
2015-1151,2015,Paper Session,Frames in the Convergent Multimodal Discourse on the John/Ivan Demjanjuk Trial: Methodical Framework and Analytical Process,4,"The paper develops a methodical approach and explains analytical procedures to reconstruct frames in discourses formed by multimodal texts in convergent media. It is applied to the discourse on the trial of John/Ivan Demjanjuk, a Ukraine-born U.S. citizen accused of holocaust-related war crimes. The paper thus examines discourses where written messages and images from mass media as well as comments and visuals spread through social media relate to each other in framing public issues. To establish a viable perspective that caters to the interactive communicative organisation and the multimodal semiotic constitution of such convergent discourse, the paper joins approaches from frame semantics and social semiotics in a framework of recursive sampling and coding. Using the discourse on the Demjanjuk trial as its case, the application of the discourse analytical procedures to reconstruct framings of the accused as either responsible culprit or victim of circumstances is explained.",Advances in Framing Research: Content Analyses,Mass Communication
2015-1152,2015,Paper Session,Framing Responsibility for Depression: How U.S. News Media Attribute Causal and Problem-Solving Responsibilities When Covering a Major Public Health Issue,3,"This paper analyzes how U.S. print and broadcast news media covered depression over the past three decades: specifically, how six national and local newspapers, five broadcast and cable TV networks and a public media network framed depression and attributed causal and problem-solving responsibilities at individual and societal levels. The study also explored how cultural values and organizational constraints may have influenced the frame building process. Findings indicate that U.S. news media placed more causal and problem-solving responsibilities on the individual than on the society. However, references to societal solutions increased slightly over time. Organizational differences emerged in news framing as print media presented more individual-level causes while broadcast media focused more on solutions at both individual and societal levels. Additionally, local newspapers placed more problem-solving responsibilities on the individual than national newspapers, while cable news channels assigned more time to the discussion of depression responsibilities than broadcast TV networks.",Advances in Framing Research: Content Analyses,Mass Communication
2015-1153,2015,Paper Session,Coverage of Holiday Philanthropy: Media and Social Responsibility,2,"The mass media play a significant role during celebrations of both secular and religious holidays by promoting shared cultural and national experiences. This study offers for the first time an innovative framework for analysis of mass media as an independent social and philanthropic actor during holidays. The paper integrates theories and concepts from the fields of both communication and philanthropy, which yielded new types of frames and linkages between them and types of media. The philanthropy models include donor, donation and beneficiary. The communication theories include social responsibility, mobilization, framing and types of media: elite popular, financial, religious and new. The framework was tested on coverage of philanthropy in the Israeli media from 2006 to 2009, during two major Jewish national holidays: New-Year and Passover. The media acted as an independent actor and conducted social philanthropic campaigns. The media outlets created frames in line with their ideological or professional orientation.",Advances in Framing Research: Content Analyses,Mass Communication

2015-1155,2015,Paper Session,Explaining the Relationship Between Reality Television and UV Exposure: The Role of Sun Tan Ideals,1,"UV exposure has been identified as an important risk factor in the development of skin cancer among young women. The current cross-sectional study among 444 young women (Mage = 20.08; SD = .9) explored (a) whether reality television was related to UV exposure and (b) whether the internalization of sun tan ideals and self-objectification could explain this association. As such, this study introduced feminist psychological perspectives into health research. A structural equation model revealed that watching reality television was related to the internalization of sun tan ideals and self-objectification. In turn, the internalization of sun tan ideals and self-objectification predicted exposure to harmful UV radiation. This study therefore provides evidence for the explanatory value of both mechanisms in the relationship between reality television and UV exposure. Implications for skin cancer prevention campaigns are discussed.",Gender Issues in Media Research,Mass Communication
2015-1156,2015,Paper Session,Measuring Extremes: A Quantitative Content Analysis of Primetime TV Depictions of Body Type,3,"The current quantitative content analysis examined portrayals of body type on television. To this end, a composite week of primetime TV was randomly sampled from September to December 2013, yielding 1,254 unique characters in 89 television programs. Results suggest that women have become increasingly thin on TV, compared with findings from previous research. Moreover, thinner characters were found to be more attractive than overweight characters. The few obese and overweight characters appearing on primetime were less articulate and less intelligent than their thinner counterparts on TV and were more likely to be ridiculed. Although effects cannot be determined from content analytic results, effects studies have found that exposure to such media representations of body types can be associated with increased body dissatisfaction and endorsement of the thin-ideal as well as the stigmatization of overweight/obese individuals. Results and implications are discussed in terms of cultivation and social cognitive theory.",Gender Issues in Media Research,Mass Communication
2015-1157,2015,Paper Session,The ‘Golden Age’ of Women on Primetime Television? A Quantitative Content Analysis,2,"To determine how portrayals of men and women differ on primetime television, a quantitative content analysis was conducted. A one-week composite of primetime television programming across nine broadcast and cable networks was randomly sampled, yielding 89 programs and 1,254 characters. Consistent with prior findings, women were significantly underrepresented on primetime TV when compared to men. Statistical analyses were run examining gender differences in the realms of occupation, aggression, sexualization, and esteem, with comparisons drawn across different age groups. Overall, findings suggest that contrary to popular belief, the current state of primetime television does not represent a “golden age” for women. Though it appears some gender stereotypes have declined when compared to previous decades, others (e.g., dominant men, sexually provocative women) have persisted. Both cultivation and social cognitive theories are considered as frameworks for understanding how television images can act as a socializing force in the development of gender roles.",Gender Issues in Media Research,Mass Communication

Participants chose from beauty, career, homemaking, and current affairs magazines and generally preferred beauty magazines. This choice pattern was influenced by current self-facets (current romantic relationship status, working hours, and BMI) and their possible future selves regarding career. Current self regarding romantic status and greater focus on possible future romantic self affected self-improvement motivation in social comparisons with beauty magazine portrayals, which in turn positively influenced self-related affect pertaining to own life satisfaction, happiness, and success.",Gender Issues in Media Research,Mass Communication
2015-1159,2015,Paper Session,Digital Divide and Individuals' Online Interaction With Government,1,"Digital divide researchers have called for a shift towards a focus on uses and skills. However, access in the global south does not reach yet the levels of the developed world. In less developed countries it is relevant to talk about autonomy of use. Researchers also argue for a distinction between recreational and capital enhancing activities online. However, use might also be related with positive outcomes beyond the individual. This study expands digital divide research by integrating access quality, type of Internet use and positive outcomes in a developing country context. Results of a representative sample of Colombia’s urban adult population show that autonomy of use increases the probability of online interaction with government and that online interaction with government increases individuals’ trust in government and decreases their perceptions of corruption in local and national governments bringing about institutional benefits.",Digital Divide,Communication and Technology
2015-1160,2015,Paper Session,Changing Inequalities in Online Engagement,2,"We investigate types of Internet activities among a representative sample of the Dutch population from 2010 to 2013. We examined usage patterns of seven types of Internet activities (i.e., information, news, personal development, commercial transaction, social interaction, leisure, and gaming) and related these patterns with gender, age, education, and income. Activities related to news, personal development, commercial transaction, and social interaction increased in popularity. For most capital enhancing activities, men, younger people, higher educated people, and people with higher than average incomes were prominent. These observations, however, are subject to change. The Internet seems to provide increasingly more capital-enhancing opportunities for those with higher education and income, which would accordingly reinforce their already strong positions in society.",Digital Divide,Communication and Technology
2015-1161,2015,Paper Session,Digital Inclusion in Rural Areas: A Qualitative Exploration of Challenges Faced by People From Isolated Communities,2,"This study qualitatively investigated the interplay between contextual and individual factors related to the adoption and use of the Internet in isolated rural communities. By investigating the digital experiences of people from 10 remote rural villages located in northern, central and southern Chile that received Internet access infrastructure for the first time in 2010-2011, we identified five challenges faced by individuals from isolated contexts to get online once access infrastructure has been provided. Three factors were contextual –(1) geographic isolation (2) ageing of the population, and (3) needs of the community—and two were individual --(4) isolated mentality and (5) attitudes toward technologies. This study revealed that people’s possibilities and decisions to engage with the Internet in rural communities are bounded by the isolated context in which they live. Thus, in times when the Internet has reached the majority of the population, there are still communities digitally and socially excluded that confront very specific challenges we need to consider.",Digital Divide,Communication and Technology
2015-1162,2015,Paper Session,Modeling the Second-Level Digital Divide: A Five-Country Study of Social Differences in Internet Use,3,"Based on representative surveys on Internet use this paper advances comparative research on the second-level digital divide by modeling Internet usage disparities for five countries with narrowing access gaps. Four core Internet usage types are constructed and predicted by sociodemographic variables in a structural model. Overall, the findings confirm the shift in the digital divide from access to usage, recently identified for the Netherlands (Van Deursen & Van Dijk, 2014), in five further countries. Results show that sociodemographics alone account for up to half of the variance in usage in these high-penetration countries, with age being the strongest predictor. Measurement invariance tests indicate that a direct comparison is only valid between three of the five countries explored. Methodologically, this points to the indispensability of such tests for unbiased comparative digital inequality research based on latent constructs.",Digital Divide,Communication and Technology

Specifically, MIM usage, its importance in relationships, stress of, and satisfaction of using MIMs were examined in relation to loneliness. Analyses of an online survey data (N = 495) revealed that loneliness was negatively related to MIM use as a combination of use time and network size. Also, loneliness was positively related to the relational importance of MIMs and the stress, while negatively to the satisfaction of using MIMs. Further, this study found that loneliness moderated the relationship between relational importance and stress such that the importance was more strongly related to stress for more-lonely people than less-lonely people. These findings indicate that lonely people used MIMs in more stressful ways partly due to their perceived importance of MIMs in relationships.",Antecedent and Consequent Negative Psychological Profiles in Social Media Use,Communication and Technology
2015-1164,2015,Paper Session,Predictors of Mobilizing Online Coping Versus Offline Coping Resources After Negative Life Events,2,"This study used optimal matching theory to predict what kind of people supplement offline coping resources with online coping resources more than others. Using a large, representative survey the authors found that distrusting, low self-esteem, lonely, isolated, and physically restricted individuals add more online resources to their mix of preferred coping strategies than their counterparts. These groups benefit from the fact that online coping resources are not as strongly en-tangled with online social ties as are offline coping resources with offline ties, and from the fact that online coping resources can sometimes be mobilized without any social interactions. In contrast to offline coping, the researchers found that online coping resources are mobilized by men and women to the same extent.",Antecedent and Consequent Negative Psychological Profiles in Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

The current study explored the potential contributions of preference for online social interaction (POSI) and mood regulation as maladaptive push factors that mediate the association between loneliness and Internet addiction by evaluating two separate serial mediation models reflecting the relationships implied by Caplan’s (2005) social skills account and LaRose et al.’s (2003) social cognitive account. Overall, our findings supported the conceptualization of POSI and mood regulation as mediators of the association between loneliness and Internet addiction. Importantly, our data suggest a sequential order through which POSI and mood regulation in this sequence mediate the association between loneliness and Internet addiction, consistent with the social skills account.",Antecedent and Consequent Negative Psychological Profiles in Social Media Use,Communication and Technology
2015-1166,2015,Paper Session,A Time Well Wasted? Online Procrastination in Times of Unemployment,4,"This paper examines the argument that social exclusion perceived during unemployment leads to an escapist usage of online media, which in turn lowers job search efforts. Based on data from 386 unemployed heavy Internet users, the paper shows that online procrastination plays an important role in the lives of the unemployed, but not in a negative manner as to decrease their job search effort. The amount of motivational control the unemployed can muster exerts a strong effect on their job search effort, particularly for individuals with low self-efficacy and/or low job importance. Generally, heavy Internet users with low motivational control struggle more with their job search efforts. Low self-efficacy and/or low job importance increases this tendency additionally. Thus, for increasing the integration of this demographic, online media are not a detriment to reemployment, rather, skill-building and motivational support prove to be key antecedents to overcoming unemployment and should be fostered.",Antecedent and Consequent Negative Psychological Profiles in Social Media Use,Communication and Technology
2015-1167,2015,Paper Session,Have You Found What You're Looking For? On the Experience of Music Tourism,2,"Music tourism is on the rise, both in numbers of tourists and in academic interest. Surprisingly enough, not much empirical research has been done to explore this phenomenon. Results are presented from fieldwork and 15 in-depth interviews concerning Abba’s Stockholm, U2’s Dublin and Wagner’s Bayreuth, crossing the distinction between popular and classical music for the first time in music tourism research. This paper contributes to existing music tourism studies by using insights from music sociology to show how music matters in the touristic experience of place. As music is a building material of identity, three processes of identity-work are analyzed: music tourism as an experience that marks and enriches personal identity; music tourism as a bodily practice of immersing into musicscapes; and music tourism as a way to establish connections between personal and cultural identities, inciting music-inspired topophilia and nostalgic remembering in which music becomes a pars pro toto.",Communities of Sound: Affect and Aesthetics in the Sonic Domain,Popular Communication

For activities of production seize upon potential affective valences present within a group’s demo or live performance, then elaborate, channel, and direct them so as to produce emotional relevancies. To demonstrate, I use The Pretenders eponymous first post-punk album (produced by Chris Thomas for Sire/Real 1979). Given formal observations afforded by the album taken together with insights Thomas has offered regarding his particular ways of producing, I illustrate the additional layer of meaning that production imparts and then argue that The Pretenders experiments with recording techniques, such as the layering of sounds, in a way that—counterintuitively—foregrounds the idea of absence.",Communities of Sound: Affect and Aesthetics in the Sonic Domain,Popular Communication

Based on a survey conducted among the members of the youth wings of five major political parties in Norway, this study demonstrates marked oppositions in musical taste and aesthetic sensibilities, which systematically follow the ideological left-right axis of Norwegian party politics. Moreover, this study makes evident that music to a significantly higher degree is invested with political significance among politicians of the left than among politicians of the right. Starting from Bourdieu’s cultural sociology, the article discusses the findings in light of socio-economic background factors and further highlights distinct resonances between aesthetics and ideological orientation.",Communities of Sound: Affect and Aesthetics in the Sonic Domain,Popular Communication

The 12th Man’s characteristically disruptive sound fashions an intensely affective space specific to Seattle’s CenturyLink Field. The NFL and its media partners now use this unique din to advertise the singular thrills that come with high-priced stadium seats and to enhance television audiences’ viewing experiences. This article uses the 12th Man’s signature noise to theorize how fans, sound, space, the NFL, and sports media have recently mediated and amplified one another. It specifically employs the 12th Man’s sonic relations to fandom, space, games, and television to demonstrate how the NFL has shifted from regulating fan noise as an unwelcome interruption to cultivating it as a resource that enhances games, in stadia and on TV.",Communities of Sound: Affect and Aesthetics in the Sonic Domain,Popular Communication

By drawing on interviews from several cases in which crowdsourcing was used in professional journalism, the paper shows that the primary motivation factors are intrinsic, altruistic and ideological and that they resemble the intrinsic motivations in commons-based peer production, namely in Wikipedia-creation. The crowd participates in crowdsourced journalism because people want to contribute to social change and to mitigate power and knowledge asymmetries. Peer learning and a possibility for deliberation also drive participation. Participants don’t expect monetary compensation or other tangible rewards for their participation; instead, they want to affect the betterment of society. Crowdsourced journalism thus becomes a tool for social change and grassroots advocacy. The motivation factors of crowdsourced journalism differ from those of crowdsourcing in other contexts and in open source software production and are similar to those of open knowledge creation.","Citizens and the News: Participants, Sources, Journalists?",Journalism Studies
2015-1173,2015,Paper Session,Reciprocation and Participation: The Role of Reciprocity in Participatory Journalism,3,"Given the well-documented reluctance that journalists have for participatory journalism at the professional and organizational levels of analysis, this study seeks to clarify the matter by looking at journalists’ individual-level attitudes toward audiences and interaction in connection with structural and organizational factors as well. We address this matter through a study of journalists’ perceptions about and approaches to reciprocity, a norm that is crucial for trust and cooperation in relationships and communities, and one that may serve as an attitudinal pathway leading to participatory behavior in journalism. A nationally representative survey of U.S. newspaper journalists finds that, while some demographic and structural factors may play a role in audience engagement, reciprocal beliefs and behaviors are significantly associated with journalists’ levels of engagement with audiences. Reciprocity, therefore, may have a meaningful role to play as an individual-level variable explaining how participation with audiences takes place within a professional journalistic context.","Citizens and the News: Participants, Sources, Journalists?",Journalism Studies

Through Q, categories of people are generated which are operant, revealing entirely new effects in ways that traditional questionnaires cannot (Smith, 2001). The factor analysis revealed three types of citizen journalists: The Nonchalant, Self-Fulfillment Seeker, The Watchdog’s Watchdog, and the Passionate Pro-Hopeful. Q-method proved valuable in identifying new ways of thinking about citizen journalism, confirming some traditional knowledge about citizen journalism, and offering new insights.","Citizens and the News: Participants, Sources, Journalists?",Journalism Studies

To explore why this is so, a model is proposed according to which journalists’ reliance on citizens is hindered by three factors: circumstantial (situations calling for input from citizens arise ad hoc), logistical (using them requires greater journalistic effort) and evaluative (journalists appreciate their contributions less). A broad comparison of contacts with ordinary citizens against contacts with other source types (N=2381) in Israel, strongly validates this model. To enhance their access, citizens may need not only a technological revolution, but also a social, cultural and epistemic revolution.","Citizens and the News: Participants, Sources, Journalists?",Journalism Studies
2015-1176,2015,Paper Session,Citizen Sources in the News: Above and Beyond the Vox Pop?,3,"Both within journalism and academia it has been argued that citizen voices should have a greater prominence in news to counterbalance the virtual monopoly of elite sources. Although studies show that citizen sources are being used more often than before, it remains unclear whether there has been a change in both the prominence relative to elite and civil society sources, and in the capacity in which citizens have been present in the past two decades. This study presents a content analysis of 1251 Dutch television news stories broadcast between 1990 and 2012 (N = 2111 sources). Results show that citizen sources became more prominent in news stories over the years, but that they do not get a more substantive, relevant voice. Instead, citizens are increasingly used as vox pops, being nothing more than mere illustrations. Thus elite sources remain the primary definers in mediated public debate.","Citizens and the News: Participants, Sources, Journalists?",Journalism Studies

This study contributes to a growing body of research on the effects of political uses of social media (e.g. Hendricks & Schill, 2015) by deploying structural equation modeling to test nonrecursive relationships between political uses of Twitter, political information efficacy (PIE), and partisan affect through a longitudinal multi-group experiment. Findings suggest that individuals who are high in PIE are much more likely to increase their political uses of Twitter over time, though using Twitter for political purposes is not associated with increases in PIE or polarized partisan affect.

The study was conducted through the prism of the public sphere and the connected concept of public affairs journalism that invigorates the sphere. Overall, this study found that commercial television stations were dominating Facebook, both in terms of number of followers as well as amount of content, largely replicating their brand of news that focused on violence, traffic accidents, and weather. Newspapers in the study, which remain the main providers of public affairs information, largely ignored Facebook, including the community with a local daily newspaper. This requires the concept of “media deficit” to include not just whether specific outlets exist but through which channels news is being delivered.

By examining the Sunflower social movement in Taiwan and targeting a particular subgroup—Taiwanese citizens abroad, this study examines what factors influence citizens abroad to engage in social media use for social movements, and how different activities on social media contribute to political participation. The findings show that individuals’ personal attitude (i.e., personal attitude importance), and civic attitude (i.e., civic identity) exert positive influence on political participation through opinion expression and activism on social media. Similarly, negative emotions towards government’s handling of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) also promote political participation through expressing opinion and joining movement-related groups on social media.

Research was conducted with a community of patients who frequent the most renowned public hospital of Bangladesh. Being socially marginalized, the voices of this community are primarily absent from the dominant discourses on health. Theoretically and methodologically grounded in the culture-centered approach to health communication, this research focused on foregrounding the voices of the community participants by listening to their narratives and stories of their experiences.

Using constant comparative analysis, we analyze 15 narratives and found that participants were strategically framed diabetes as a life experience and life resource. According to participants, illness generates a space for them to reflect and live the life principles that guide their everyday life. Diabetes provides resources for Javanese women to (a) normalize suffering, (b) resist social control, (c) accept fate, and (d) validate faith. Moving beyond the social construction of illness experience (P. Conrad & K. Barker, 2010), we explored how Javanese women’s everyday life can be shaped by their illness experiences.

In spite of the widespread acknowlegement of racial health disparities, the voices of African Americans, their articulations of health and local etiologies of health disparities are limited. In this article, we highlight the important role of Communication scholarship to understand the everyday enactment of health disparities. We used the culture-centered approach to co-construct narratives of health with African Americans residents of Lake County, Indiana, a region characterized by the poor health status and poverty of its African American population. Our participants’ co-constructed narratives implicate the omnipresence of stress and its impact on their health. These narratives identified social and structural sources of stress, and articulated resistive coping strategies.

This article presents findings from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded project, “Let’s Talk About Sex: Digital Storytelling for Puerto Rican Latina Youth,” a culturally centered, narrative-based approach for analyzing participants’ own specifications of sexual values and practices. The strength of digital storytelling lies in its utility as an innovative tool for community-based and culturally situated research, as well as in its capacity to open up new spaces for health communication.

Expanding Jenkins’ Participatory Politics Framework With Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR),1,"This paper argues that Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) work is raising new questions regarding what Henry Jenkins and others have termed participatory politics. The paper considers the ways that ideas of participation and non-participation have been framed in relation to Jenkins’ work and in the context of YPAR projects informed by participatory democratic theory. It argues that by working with those in communities of structured inequities as they identify and research common problems and then seek to address them, YPAR enables scholars to listen to young people as they think about their publics and about how those publics might be constituted and addressed through visionary storytelling. New questions for participatory politics emerge, including: how might young people be encouraged to think about the publics that are key to the changes they wish to see? And how might those publics be (or become) “audiences” for such visionary storytelling?","Theorizing, Soliciting, and Commodifying Fan Participation",Popular Communication

Our analysis is based on ethnographic research within the ombudsman at a regulatory institution in Israel, on content analysis of 2,142 complaints regarding perceived inappropriate broadcasted content between the years 2005 and 2010, and on an examination of public discourse surrounding controversial programs in Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis indicates that successful complaints share three conditions that collectively lead media organizations to amend broadcasted contents: the complaints name a socially sensitive identity within a specific broadcasting culture; complaints are numerous and represent diversified public sectors; and the complaints are accompanied by a heated public debate around the perceived offence. We elaborate on each of these conditions and conclude by discussing the effectiveness of public complaints as a discursive device in participatory culture.","Theorizing, Soliciting, and Commodifying Fan Participation",Popular Communication

The results of a national survey (N=862) indicate that the PSI is a salient direct and indirect antecedent of the endorsement effects. The match-up of celebrity/product is also a significant predictor of the endorsement effects. The source characteristics of celebrity serve as an integral mediator of the PSI.

While scholars in the ‘engaged youth’ paradigm are encouraged by new, creative modes of young people’s participation, scholars in the ‘disengaged youth’ paradigm bemoan the disconnect from more traditional forms of participation. This article bridges these paradigms by combining an investigation of creative sites of participation with an examination of both conventional and emerging forms of participation. Based on an ethnographic examination of the “Nerdfighters,” an informal online community encouraging civic action, the article discusses the mechanisms of translation through which practices of cultural participation can be extended toward civic and political outcomes. The article discusses three mechanisms: tapping content worlds and communities, creative production, and informal discussion. Through these mechanisms, the group successfully scaffolds young people towards some forms of participation (civic, consensual participation) but struggles with the translation towards contentious politics.","Theorizing, Soliciting, and Commodifying Fan Participation",Popular Communication

Using in-depth interviews of Veronica Mars Kickstarter backers, this study explores the expectations of influence that Veronica Mars backers brought to the campaign experience and the ways in which the campaign met and failed those expectations. My informants’ disappointments in the final film text were mitigated by existing normative beliefs about authorship and the appropriate role of fans. These normative beliefs were reinforced by producers’ communication style during the campaign. I argue that the social dynamics created by this crowdfunding campaign are not contingent on financial contributions, and that the results of the campaign provide insights into larger questions about what fans really want from their relationships with official texts, producers, and productions, suggesting that some fans desire an engagement role that resembles traditional patronage.","Theorizing, Soliciting, and Commodifying Fan Participation",Popular Communication
2015-1190,2015,Paper Session,Consumers of Debt: Digital Subaltern 2.0 Through ICT4D 2.0,1,"The question of the “subaltern” and their representation raised by the postcolonial scholars revisits us in Web 2.0 space in present times. While the original question coming from subaltern studies collective was more about academic representation and “writing in reverse” (Beverley, 1999) of histories and her-stories, in Web 2.0 space these questions resurface in other ways through non-profit and corporate social responsibility. As we continue to research issues of digital divide and ICTs for development (ICT4D), we see the difference of any kind represented in online spaces while we continue to celebrate the unproblematic and top-down diffusion of innovation from the Global North to the Global South.

However, there is a darker side to what is happening through these online formats in the name of women’s empowerment. The inclusion of subaltern populations into global space is happening through their consumption of debt via microfinance portals that connect women from the Global North to women from the Global South in a transaction of lending and borrowing that is mediated by global financial institutions. As Federici (2014) notes, debt is increasingly used as a form of accumulation by the state and by financial institutions. In addition, in the case of microfinance, it is also being used as a means of control over women. I examine these issues through visual and textual analysis of sites, such as micrograam.com, kiva.org and novica.com. I observe that while this individualized so-called empowerment of women and subaltern citizens is offered up through a process of NGO-ization and IT-ization of the global, there is a simultaneous retraction of protections from the public sector as the care services previously considered the responsibility of the state and of employers “unbundle”. Thus, there is financialization of reproduction through “micro” monetizing of particular kinds of micro-work as more women and subaltern citizens are drawn into consuming debt globally without protection from the state or their place of work.",Technologies of Becoming in the Gendered Spaces of Consumerism,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1191,2015,Paper Session,Becoming a Mother Through the Looking Glass of YouTube,2,"This presentation is a part of research on women’s do-it-yourself communities on Youtube who produce video blogs to share their advice, practices, and world outlook. Specifically, we examine video narratives and comments around the videos of two new mothers who record the episodes of their everyday life related to the new babies and themselves. As audience members, we observe how the women take care of their infants, feed and comfort them, take them for doctor’s check ups, and go shopping. The mothers explain their practices and rationalize the choices of products and actions regarding their babies and themselves in the motherhood.

The observations of the production of motherhood through the looking glass of YouTube allow two types of criticism. First, we examine the representation of motherhood to argue that mothering is presented in a glamorized and edited form, whereby the happy moments of pregnancy and childcare are celebrated and promoted and the difficult moments of motherhood are erased or ridiculed. Second, we consider the technology of Youtube video blogging in the context of other platforms and tools employed by the women. We discover that corporate sponsors guide such representations of motherhood by the Youtube celebrities. The products, brands, and practices chosen by sponsors are seamlessly incorporated into the video narratives and position the choices as natural and worry free. These narratives allow to observe how motherhood driven by consumer protocols is unfolding in front of the camera and the characters are gliding through the role of mothers.",Technologies of Becoming in the Gendered Spaces of Consumerism,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1192,2015,Paper Session,Fashioning the Gendered Self Through Social Media: Personal Branding and Productive Consumption Among Aspiring Creative Professionals.,1,"In an effort to stand out among the overinflated supply of creative workers, legions of young people—college students and newly minted graduates alike—are flocking to social media platforms to brand themselves as employable professionals. While the self-branding initiatives of individuals transitioning into adulthood can take many forms, this paper focuses on the social media activities of young women who engage in what I call “aspirational labor.” A highly gendered form of amateur cultural production, aspirational labor involves (mostly) unpaid work that 1) participants believe has the potential to pay off in terms of future economic capital; and 2) ensures that female content creators remain immersed in the public circulation of commodities.

Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 30+ female college students and recent graduates aspiring to work in the so-called “glamour industries” (i.e., fashion, media, and advertising), I explore their participation in various modes of online self-branding: fashion and lifestyle blogging; web design and portfolio building; and calculated self-presentation across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I argue that although these young women articulate their socially mediated promotional activities as productive tools to “get discovered,” these activities often rely upon the (traditionally gendered) consumption and promotion of branded goods. I close by tying this merging of production/consumption and public/private to what Banet-Weiser (2012) calls the “post-feminist self brand” which encourages entrepreneurialism, visibility, and consumerism under the guise of female empowerment.",Technologies of Becoming in the Gendered Spaces of Consumerism,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1193,2015,Paper Session,Technologized Gender Becoming: An American Girl (Doll) Story,1,"Drawing from DeCerteau’s concept of experience of everyday life, this paper analyzes several notable and successful American Girl products, concepts, and campaigns and discusses a radical change in levels of the gendered agency, social interaction, and buyer responsibility embedded in the American Girl “experience”: If the original American Girl featured premade historical characters coupled with drab period dress and books depicting diverse issues such as women’s suffrage or classism and attempted to introduce young girls to history and different viewpoints, the modern American Girl has customized its message: buy and become you -- by “follow[ing] your inner star” (the company’s slogan).

Analyzing the search for “inner star,” the author draws parallels between the selectivity of consumerist gender identity of the purchaser and Foucault’s idea of technology of the self, which serves as a mechanism employed by individuals and society that perpetuates the public consumption of and regulation of individuality. Now resembling the owner in every way, from hairstyles to real life social functions, like Facebook and dental checkups, the American Girl offers a relationship that extends beyond silly doll play and playing house in the bedroom. Sold as an intricate pallet of gender roles, social norms, and social responsibilities, the American Girl “experience” no longer invites the owners to project their identity on a fictional or historic character to understand real-world experiences outside their own, but, rather, calls to use the reality-rooted doll to join, partially create, and live a self-centered fantasy, woven with social becoming and consumerism.",Technologies of Becoming in the Gendered Spaces of Consumerism,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1194,2015,Paper Session,"My Hair is “Layed” like Cyberqueer: Video Blogging, Computer Cross-Dressing, and the Curious Case of Funky Dineva",3,"Social media can be seen as a form of digital body for queers, where individuals can establish and even alter gendered identities. One prominent example of such popularized, queer expression on social media is computer cross-dressing. It has been largely imagined as an “attempt by male subject to produce a fantastic female identity” that is “aimed at convincing the onlooker that they are seeing a ‘real’ woman” (Ferreday & Lock, 2007, p. 164). Computer cross-dressers have found a forum for dialogue and acceptance through the self-publishing possibilities of social media, establishing populous followership and connections with major media outlets.

Indicative of the powerful coupling of social media and computer cross-dressing is Funky Dineva, a video blogger who is known for her My Hair is Layed YouTube Series. In this series, Quentin Latham, an openly gay, Black male, performs the identity of Funky Dineva, an Black female known for her “divalicious coverage of the hottest and latest media news” (Funky Dineva, 2014, January 30). The current research, using critical discourse analysis, investigated Quintin Latham’s use of social media to conceptualize the identity of Funky Dineva in cyberspace and investigate the performance of Funky Dineva in the contexts of historic Black male cross-dressing performances and the queer virtual world. The research discusses the commodification process and political economy that undergird racialized, queer, identity performance on social media. Ultimately, the analysis revealed that commodification was at the heart of My Hair is Layed, as it evolved from a simple confessional call and outlet to ultimately becoming a production that increased Black queer representation in popular culture and social media.",Technologies of Becoming in the Gendered Spaces of Consumerism,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1195,2015,Paper Session,The Impact of Audience Interpretations of Mixed Messages of Crisis Apologia,2,"Crisis communication research has successfully identified several factors predicting the magnitude of the threat imposed on an organization by a crisis, and suggested some effective response strategies. However, theories like the situational crisis communication theory focus on the effect of a single-stance strategy, failing to provide answers for why and how organizations make seemingly contradictory responses to a crisis. This experimental study investigates the impact of crisis response strategy by comparing two single-message strategies (i.e., apology and denial) and two mixed-message strategies (i.e., CA(corporate ability)-apology/CSR(corporate social responsibility)-denial and CA-denial/CSR-apology) across two types of crises (i.e., the crises of CA-core and CSR-core businesses). Findings suggest that when mixed messages are employed, the perceived primary tone of the message is the best indicator of stakeholders’ response, however, individual factors may influence how mixed messages are interpreted.",Crisis Communication Effects and Strategies,Public Relations
2015-1196,2015,Paper Session,Effects of Crisis Efficacy on Intentions to Follow Directives During Crisis,2,"Self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977), or the perceived ability to perform a desired behavior, has consistently been a useful predictor of behavioral intentions as a construct in many different theories. Yet, the role of self-efficacy in a crisis context, specifically understanding audience intentions to follow instructing information, is relatively unexplored. Thus, a national survey (n= 507) examines the role of self-efficacy in public response to crisis directives and positions a new concept of crisis efficacy as an important area for future research. In three crisis contexts (food recall, weather emergency, and illness), crisis efficacy significantly predicted public response to instructing information. Marital status, income, and children in the home also predicted levels of crisis efficacy. Overall, results position crisis efficacy as a useful predictor of audience motivation to comply with crisis directives and offer important recommendations for strategic message design to bolster crisis efficacy.",Crisis Communication Effects and Strategies,Public Relations

In general, we found that the participants with negative prior attitude perceive an accidental crisis to have higher locus (i.e., internal cause) and stability (i.e., permanent issue for the organization) than those with positive prior attitude. As for effects of response messages, a base and bolstering response was more likely to increase the latitude of acceptance and to reduce the latitude of rejection than a bolstering-only response. However, the bolstering-only response was more likely to increase trust among those with prior negative attitude than the base and bolstering response.

2015-1199,2015,Paper Session,Toward a More Robust Conceptualization of Crisis Communication Ethics in Public Relations: Life Span Critiques,1,"Public relations literature demonstrates a decades-long movement toward emphasis on relationships. Privileging relationships, contexts, and care for vulnerable others, ethic of care is a normative framework that uniquely fits modern public relations – especially crisis communication/management, which inherently entails organization-public relationship violations and vulnerable publics. This essay demonstrates that dominant approaches to public relations and crisis communication ethics have exhibited a masculine-thought bias based on classical philosophies such as deontology and utilitarianism that privilege logic and rationality. Indeed, traditionally masculine thought and classical ethics are valuable, even integral to conceptualizing and applying public ethics; however, this focus creates ethical weaknesses in existing scholarship that traditionally feminine thought is positioned to strengthen. Namely, ethic of care, at one time confined to the private domain, should also be brought to light through public actions and practices, and attention to other feminist frameworks in public relations and crisis communication ethics scholarship is warranted as well.",Crisis Communication Effects and Strategies,Public Relations

We cultivate a constitutive viewpoint for organizational rhetoric that foregrounds the iterative practices of constitution as delineated in CCO and layers in historical and transhistorical perspectives from rhetorical theories of constitution (Charland, 1987). Our theorizing is built through exercises of comparison and application. Comparative exercises first trace points of convergence and divergence in CCO and rhetorical treatments of the constitutive, then use these findings for application to extant empirical exemplars.

In particular, I put forward that while we have been showing that communication constitutes organization – and thus studying organizations – we have not been as careful at studying communication and the way our interest for organizations may contribute to its understanding. I give the example of Simondon’s notion of transduction as a candidate theory of communication that is genuinely based on the equation between communication and organization in a constitutive view, i.e. it supposes that communicating and organizing are a single “ontogenetic” process. I conclude by inviting many more perspectives to be formulated, so that we, CCO researchers, explicate the sort of theories that inform our work and the way we may contribute to discussions about communication theory from a truly organizational perspective.",Constituting Organizations: Scholarship on CCO,Organizational Communication

However, theoretical frameworks that help us to understand this relationship are still under development. This paper is aimed as a contribution to this strand of theorising. It considers communication as constitutive of collective action and outlines six propositions that help us think of collective action as a phenomenon emerging in communication. To achieve this, I draw from the CCO strand of organizational communication and particularly from the work of Taylor and van Every, and their conceptualization of text and conversation. The paper demonstrates the explanatory value of this approach by illustrating the theoretical analysis with examples emerging from my ongoing research on the role of digital media in the Occupy movement in the USA and the UK.",Constituting Organizations: Scholarship on CCO,Organizational Communication

In this paper, I propose the metaphor of the “author” to refer to those agents who make a difference within organizations regardless whether or not they have a formal status. In so doing, the usual perspective is reversed: It is not the line of authority that would authenticate action but action itself that guarantees legitimacy. The definition of the “organizational author” encompasses the capacity of initiatives in interaction that results in various forms of inscriptions. Applied to the field of organizational communication, the disappearance of the author (Barthes, 1968; Foucault, 1969) is eventually interpreted as the necessary step to ensure organizational identity.",Constituting Organizations: Scholarship on CCO,Organizational Communication

Hierarchy, Status, and the Ascendency of Financial Reporting at the Reuters Newswire",1,"This paper explores a dramatic shift in news practices at the Reuters newswire, as it moved from an emphasis on general “hard news” reporting to become a leading provider of business news/information. This transition is analyzed through an ethnography of one newsroom: the Reuters East Africa bureau in Nairobi. The paper asks how- and through what mechanisms- did change happen so swiftly in the bureau? It identifies a number of “top down” management strategies that incentivized journalists to change their reporting practices, and that altered the status of different news beats at the wire. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of “cultural capital”, it shows how economic journalists became higher status in the newsroom and, from this position, reinforced the new reporting priorities. The paper argues that more attention should be paid to the ‘powered’ and hierarchical nature of newsrooms and newsbeats – particularly during times of change.",News Ethnographies in the 21st Century,Journalism Studies
2015-1205,2015,Paper Session,Beyond Newsroom Ethnography: Finding Field Sites for Deviant Journalisms,1,"Journalism is a contested concept, consisting of blurred genres produced in scattered sites. This challenges journalism studies, generally, and newsroom studies, specifically. Taking as an example an on-going study - which includes qualitative interviews, texts and participant-observation - of the genre ‘ethnographic journalism’, this paper suggest that these challenges can be an opportunity to revise established notions of journalism and to shape our work in accordance with its necessities rather than received ideas as to what we ought to be doing. Discussing how innovative genres like ethnographic journalism are hard to categorize, this paper suggests that we adopt Max Weber’s notion of ‘ideal types’ when framing our studies to precisely investigate the slippage between theory and practice. Furthermore, giving concrete examples from fieldwork conducted by the author, it suggests that me might exchange the newsroom with the j-school classroom when doing participant-observation with scattered journalists.",News Ethnographies in the 21st Century,Journalism Studies
2015-1206,2015,Paper Session,Crafting a Community: Staff Members’ Conceptions of Audience at a City Magazine (Top Student Paper),2,"In a changing media ecology that legitimizes content based on its ability to increase revenues, news organizations have found ways to develop content that serves the interests of advertisers as well as audiences. Although scholarship has addressed the implications of this shift among traditional news media, the magazine industry has undergone similar changes. City and regional magazines, which cater to affluent readers while also aiming to reflect their communities, provide an important site of analysis. To understand how these magazines use the relationship of editorial content and advertising to increase profits and serve readers and advertisers, the researchers conducted an ethnography and interviews (N = 4) at a Midwest city magazine. The findings address how members of the organization discursively constructed their audience, commodified that audience as a product to sell to advertisers, and created an understanding of the community they serve and their function within it.",News Ethnographies in the 21st Century,Journalism Studies
2015-1207,2015,Paper Session,Operating the Truth-O-Meter: Institutional Facts and the Epistemology of Fact-Checking,1,"How do professional fact-checkers reach factual conclusions in thorny political debates? Using a case study from ethnographic fieldwork with a major fact-checking outlet, this paper offers an in-depth examination of the newswork routines of journalists who specialize in testing the truth of political claims. Fact-checkers have been faulted for a ""naïve” epistemology that fails to distinguish between matters of fact and of political opinion or ideology. I suggest an alternative view grounded in the notion of “institutional facts,” arguing that such facts are much less stable than we usually suppose -- and that this helps to account for fact-checking practices and for the controversy this emergent news genre invites. Drawing on studies of investigative journalism and of scientific work, I argue that objective practice among fact-checkers similarly highlights the role of tacit knowledge and trust in certifying facts, and thus the “intimate interdependence” of fact and value.",News Ethnographies in the 21st Century,Journalism Studies
2015-1208,2015,Paper Session,New Times for Chinese Newspapers? A Case Study of Beijing News’s Investigative Reporting in the New Media Age,2,"Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork in the investigative reporting unit of Beijing News, this paper examines how new dynamics, represented by emerging economic pressure facing newspapers, the increasingly draconian political climate under the new leadership, and the development of new media, pose fresh challenges to the activities of Chinese investigative journalists. In order to keep the newspaper competitive, the investigative reporting unit of Beijing News has reshuffled its organizational structure and readjusted its reporting strategy. The paper concentrates upon the interplay between political and economic factors in defining the broad context that Chinese investigative journalism operates within. As a consequence it calls for a reconsideration of the primacy of political analysis that has dominated studies of Chinese journalism. The paper demonstrates that the political analysis of Chinese newspapers needs to be supplemented by increasing attention to the impact of other factors, notably technological developments and economic pressures.",News Ethnographies in the 21st Century,Journalism Studies

Additionally, the preponderance of research in organizational uses students to recruit participants, which some have questioned as a weak sampling method. Data from workers in 23 businesses, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies (N = 542) revealed that organizational membership explained very small amounts of variance in dissent audience, messages, and conversational outcomes. While solution presentation was an effective dissent strategy, that effectiveness was partially mediated by appropriateness, indicating that being appropriate is an important part of being effective. While there was no interaction between dissent audiences and messages regarding conversational appropriateness, several messages were more likely to be effective with specific audiences. Finally, participants general tendencies to express upward dissent mediated the relationship between solution presentation and effectiveness.",Talk About Not Getting Along: Dissent and Conflict in Organizations,Organizational Communication
2015-1210,2015,Paper Session,Predicting Employee Dissent Expression in Organizations: A Cost and Benefit Approach,2,"Employee dissent behaviors are understood as resulting from unsatisfying organizational states (Kassing, 1998). Dissatisfaction can be felt but not expressed; dissent is the actual performance of disagreement with immediate circumstances. Constructive expression of dissent can have positive consequences, and therefore much scholarly attention has been drawn to the phenomenon. In this paper, we build on previous scholarly work and theorize that argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness influence employee dissent behavior, including the extent to which people are willing to express their disagreement. Our particular contribution is that we hypothesize that these effects are mediated by people’s assessments of the costs and benefits of dissent. We test whether the previously reported direct effects of argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness are in fact mediated by this cost/benefit analysis. A survey was conducted with student participants (N=457), most of whom had work experience. Structural equation modeling showed that the apparent direct effects of verbal aggressiveness and argumentativeness became insignificant after the mediators were included in the model. We conclude that cost and benefit analysis mediates the main effects.",Talk About Not Getting Along: Dissent and Conflict in Organizations,Organizational Communication
2015-1211,2015,Paper Session,Simulating Dissent: Mapping the Life Span of Organizational Dissent Using Agent-Based Modeling,1,"Organizational dissent is a process that begins long before any disagreement is spoken and continues long after a dissent conversation ends. Previous scholarship has examined parts of this process, but there has been little work tying elements from the whole process together. Such a study would require extensive data collection across multiple levels of analysis. The present study used agent-based modeling to simulate organizational dissent and demonstrated potential connections between various elements of the dissent process. Goal-directed behaviors at the individual level shaped the dissent process at the interaction level and those interactions shaped macro level dialectics. These results suggest avenues for further research and demonstrate the utility of this approach in refining hypotheses and designing studies.",Talk About Not Getting Along: Dissent and Conflict in Organizations,Organizational Communication

WFCs, tensions that occur when the demands of work and family conflict, have often been measured unidimensionally not accounting for the directions (work interference with family and family interference with work) and types of conflict (time-, strain-, behavior-based conflicts). The present study fills this gap and explored positive and negative emotions and the experience of WFC directions and types as well as two important outcomes (burnout and life stress). Hierarchical regressions revealed WFCs elicit specific emotions and outcomes depending on the type and direction of the WFC. These results point to the importance of exploring WFCs from a more nuanced perspective.

2015-1213,2015,Paper Session,Criticising Surveillance and Surveillance Critique: Why Privacy and Humanism are Necessary but Insufficient,1,"I argue that current research on surveillance, as both academic enterprise and contributor to public debate, must distinguish between (1) ‘negative’ criticism of surveillance and (2) ‘positive’ critique which seeks alternative ways of understanding and even undertaking surveillance. Positive critique warns against a default to condemnation, and seeks to subvert surveillance’s knowledge-regime – that is, what is admissible as ‘true’ or ‘efficient’. The objective is an open debate not only about ‘surveillance or not’, but the normalised truth-claims which prefigure that debate. It asks whether ‘another surveillance’ might be possible.

I examine two existing tools of criticism, and then point to two ‘openings’ towards another surveillance. Privacy and humanism (appeal to human freedoms and decency) are necessary but insufficient for positive critique. They accept surveillance’s bargain of cost-efficiency – the benefit of security ‘measured’ against the cost of rights. The openings consist of alternative readings of the notions of risk and security.","Disrupting Discourses of State, Security, and Surveillance","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

I take surveillance as a practice necessary for the maintenance of state power, confounded by the neoliberal rendering of the state as enabler of market logic applying to citizen governmentality. Surveillance becomes ordinary in the orderly renderings of data presented by the city to be legible for capital investment. This long surveillance is an internal logic that is like that of the internal logic of the disciplinary subject and the entrepreneur of the self or homo economicus, but spatialized to the city.","Disrupting Discourses of State, Security, and Surveillance","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-1215,2015,Paper Session,Nomad Rhetoric: Migrant Flows and State Control,1,"The presence of alien bodies in landscapes of U.S statehood creates a conundrum: how do techniques of citizenship control, based in constitution by the state, account for the waves of migrants entering the U.S.? This essay addresses the ways in which movement by migrants is surveilled and modulated through apparatuses like border patrol check-points, immigrant detention centers, and “show-me-your-papers” laws. Through restrictive legislation and harsh enforcement of that legislation, federal and state governments critically alter the landscapes of citizenship, and thus, the relationships of those bodies within the landscape—citizens and migrants. This essay draws attention to the ways migration is framed as a flow, flood, or wave, and how these flows are controlled to preserve U.S. American statehood. I also justify why a reading post-structural process philosophy on movement might interrupt constitutive citizenship apparatuses, thus intervening into the exploitation and violence against migrant nomads.","Disrupting Discourses of State, Security, and Surveillance","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

It presents the “cycle of surveillance rupture” as a framework for understanding the processes and responses initiated when critical events like Benghazi unsettle surveillance and security regimes. The concepts of surveillance imaginary, surveillance rupture, and surveillance repair are used to discuss the constructed nature of security, the role critical events play in jarring these constructs into reality, and the performative, bureaucratic processes needed to restore it (respectively). The Benghazi attack is used as a case study for examining how the cycle of surveillance operates, and each step of the process is critically evaluated in the context of Benghazi. The paper concludes by considering what is at stake for the surveillance structure in a post-Benghazi world, and why the U.S. should treat the repair process as more than just a performance.","Disrupting Discourses of State, Security, and Surveillance","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2015-1217,2015,Paper Session,Children’s Media Use and Sociocognitive Development: A Matter of Social Disparities?,3,"In this paper, we are interested in determining whether differential media behaviors between children can contribute to disparities in their socio-cognitive development. Since media use of children is likely to depend on their social context, we examine how these behaviors are impacted by the family’s socio-economic status. We apply SEM to test a theoretical mediation model. The data come from a cross-sectional survey with 844 elementary school children and their parents in Switzerland. Our results show that children’s media use does not negatively impact children’s socio-cognitive development per se but does so when personal media is frequently used for entertainment purposes. Children tend to use the media frequently as a form of entertainment when they have more media devices at their disposal. This finding is particularly evident in children from families with lower socio-economic background who have access to more media devices either in their bedroom or for mobile use.",Issues of Settings and Disparities in Youth Media Research,Children Adolescents and the Media

In our study, we coded purchase-related interactions of parent-child dyads in stores in the US, collected questionnaire data from them and collected questionnaire data from parents visiting stores without their children in order to assess the external validity. Overall, parents who bring children to the store are younger, with lower incomes, more likely to bring their children to the store overall and report enjoying shopping with children more than parents who do not shop with children. We also found a negative relationship between children’s age and purchase-related requests and coercive behavior. Furthermore, parent television viewing and child initiated purchase interactions were positively related and control-orientation was negatively related to child product requests. Lastly, when considered simultaneously, lower income, less parental viewing, more control orientation, and less communication orientation were all related to more extensive back-and-forth interactions about products.",Issues of Settings and Disparities in Youth Media Research,Children Adolescents and the Media

In addition, parents reported on indicators of sleep quality prior to sleeptime, during sleep, and after sleep. We found that heavier nighttime MED use and daily MED use were related to poorer sleep quality. In addition, we found that playing games, viewing television programs and, to a lesser extent, reading on MEDs at bedtime were related to poorer sleep quality.

I investigated whether preexisting romantic beliefs prior to viewing one of three types of movie content (ideal romantic comedy, challenge romantic comedy, control film) played a role in the effect on romantic beliefs, enjoyment, and mood among 358 undergraduate students. I also looked at whether the motivations to view these content made a difference in terms of effects on those outcomes. In general, the results demonstrate that whereas different motivations to view have different implications for effects, preexisting romantic beliefs do not make a difference except that they predict greater enjoyment of ideal romantic comedies. Thus, future research on the effects of romantic comedies and other films should focus on why individuals choose to watch certain types of content and how those motivations influence effects, rather than investigating the preexisting conditions viewers bring with them to the media encounter.",Advances in Entertainment Media Research,Mass Communication

Fifty viewers of each of these series completed the same scales both for themselves and as they thought the characters would have completed them. They then completed parasocial relationship and identification scales with respect to the same character. Perceived and actual similarity scores were computed for each viewer-character pair. These similarity scores were then correlated and used to predict both parasocial relationship strength and the degree of identification. Results show that perceived and actual similarity are mostly unrelated and that perceived similarity, but not actual similarity, is related to parasocial relationships and identification.

Yet, the media environment brings along specific factors that need to be integrated in order to understand how comparisons in the media environment take place and what effects they have on the recipients. In this context, the present study investigates everyday comparisons with television personae (media social comparisons) and the role of perceived realism for such comparisons.

Using a topic related questionnaire of viewing frequency and creating special motives for viewing (with respect to the critical debate about reality TV), an instrument was developed to evaluate specific aspects of learning (e.g., affirmation of the supported neoliberal values; learning about competition and pressure to perform). This relational model was tested with a structural equation modelling approach. Results indicate that motivation and viewing frequency explain why users perceive a learning effect. Viewers who watch reality TV out of social- and self-related motivations perceived more self- and action-related as well as environment- and value-oriented learning effects. Apart from providing insight into the reality TV phenomenon, this research helps to more clearly articulate motivations and viewing frequency as predictors of perceived learning.",Advances in Entertainment Media Research,Mass Communication

Utilizing the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as the basis, this study developed a conceptual framework to predict and explain alcohol consumption intentions among college students. As perceived subjective norms was found to be a non-significant or inconsistent predictor of college students’ drinking intention, the study adopted the yet to be fully tested perceived descriptive norms as a predictor instead. The concept of controlled-drinking intentions, which has not been widely explicated, was also developed for model testing. Overall, 899 college students from a large northeastern university participated in the study via an online survey. Regression results indicated that a more positive alcohol-use attitude, a stronger perceived friends’ drinking norm and a lower perceived behavior-control level significantly predicted a lower controlled-drinking intention.

The study conducted a two-wave online survey with predictors and the drinking behavior measured separately at two different time points within two weeks. In the Wave 1 (Time 1) survey, 275 undergraduate students at a large public university answered questions assessing key predictors and individual characteristics. In the Wave 2 (Time 2) survey, 173 participants returned and answered their drinking behavior since Time 1. Findings from logistic regressions suggest that more favorable attitudes toward and more positive subjective norms of drinking increase the likelihood to binge drink; perceived ease of drinking less reduces the likelihood to binge drink, while perceived controllability does not; students with higher stress are more likely to binge drink, but those with higher loneliness are not.

2015-1228,2015,Paper Session,Exploration of the Interplay Between Drinking Motives and Social Norms Among Korean College Students,3,"Social norms are considered the strongest predictors to collegiate drinking. Therefore, recent studies have explored the factors that moderate the effect of social norms, such as social motives of drinking. While conformity motives of drinking also concern one's need for social interaction, it has been the most neglected dimension of drinking motives. To this regard, the present study attempts to explore the interplay between two types of social norms (i.e., injunctive and descriptive norms) and two types of drinking motives (i.e., social motives and conformity motives) among Korean college students. The analysis of a survey of Korean college students (N=567) revealed significant interaction effects of descriptive norms with social motives and conformity motives on personal norms and drinking behaviors. A significant interaction effect between injunctive norms and conformity motives on personal norms was also found. The findings suggest that social norm messages could be personalized by considering individuals’ conformity motives, not just social motives of drinking.",Alcohol Use Among College Students,Health Communication
2015-1229,2015,Paper Session,The Influence of Social Norms on College Drinking: Considering the Role of Regulatory Mode,2,"This study explored how college students’ regulatory mode influences their responses to university descriptive drinking norms and university injunctive drinking norms. The moderating effect of regulatory mode was examined both on the influence of chronic college drinking norms and on the influence of the descriptive and injunctive normative appeals. Results of an experimental study provided partial support for the hypotheses. People with a strong (vs. weak) assessment orientation reported greater descriptive norm influence on their drinking behaviors. Predominant locomotors were more influenced by descriptive (vs. injunctive) norms to drink. People’s regulatory mode influenced their responses to the normative appeals in a different pattern. Inconsistent with our hypotheses, people with a strong locomotion orientation were more persuaded by the injunctive (vs. descriptive) norm message. People with differing level of assessment orientation didn’t respond differently to different types of normative messages.

Framing effects have been amply demonstrated, but how long do these effects last? A growing number of studies investigate the duration of news framing effects. This article presents a systematic review of these studies to help us make sense of their findings. We offer a review of the theoretical premises and designs of these (experimental) studies. Our results suggest that most studies report framing effects on opinions that persist beyond initial exposure and that may be influential for subsequent decision-making, but that durability of effects heavily depends on whether individuals are exposed to competitive frames also. We also find that little is known about duration of news framing effects on behavior and emotional responses.

2015-1232,2015,Paper Session,Surprise! Surprise!

Until now, however, less is known about the possibility that these effects may unfold in a serial fashion whereby one emotion triggers another before influencing a person’s behavioral intentions. In this survey experiment (N=201), we shed light on these questions by testing (1) whether the effects of two emotional news frames on behavioral intentions are serially mediated via surprise and anger. In addition, we investigate (2) in how far framing effects on surprise are moderated by temporal distance or proximity. Results support the idea that framing effects are serially mediated via surprise and anger. The effects of news framing on surprise, however, were only apparent when the policy was temporally proximal.

2015-1233,2015,Paper Session,Unpacking Visuals: Images Enhance but Do Not Direct Framing Effects,4,"Visuals in news media help define, or frame issues, but less is known about how they influence public opinion. This is important considering that powerful images evoke emotional responses which in turn can affect our judgments. Furthermore, only few studies have addressed the individual contribution of images and text when presented side by side, as they are in a typical news report. We use an experiment (N = 1082) to present images and text frames from war and conflict news in isolation and in image-text congruent and incongruent pairs. We find effects of our manipulations on participants’ emotional responses and support for a policy of military intervention. Results show that images alone generate stronger framing effects than text alone, and the effects of images are mediated by participants’ emotional response. When images and text are presented together, the frame carried by the text drives framing effects irrespective of the accompanying image. Inclusion of an image enhances the frame carried by the text, which affects participants’ support for military intervention via their emotional response. This study positions visuals within broader framing effects theory. The findings are instructive for those in the newsroom and can inform public and policymakers alike about the power of visuals to influence opinions.",Advances in Framing Research: Experimentation,Mass Communication

Married adults (N = 361) from the U.S. who had been tested for AATD or BRCA genetic mutations or were married to someone who had been tested participated in an online survey. We examined math anxiety, stigma, and genetic essentialism for their roles in predicting negative affect associated with genetic testing, stigma and negative affect for their roles in secrecy about genetic testing, and essentialist beliefs and negative affect for their roles on talk with a spouse about genetic testing. Results indicated that the conceptual model fit the data well, and was consistent for both genetic conditions. Communication about genetic testing must be based in efforts to promote understanding of the roles of personal behaviors and their social and physical environments in predicting the course of genes for disease.","Interpersonal Provider, Patient, and Partner Talk About Health",Health Communication

The present research examined factors that are associated with passengers’ intentions to communicate no texting with a texting driver in a scenario where the driver is their friend. Based on survey data collected from 546 college students, results showed that students’ attitudes toward communication about no texting while driving was predicted by their utilitarian (i.e., safety), value-expressive, and ego-defensive motivations, in addition to being predicted by self-efficacy and norms. Additional results revealed that empathic concern was correlated with the value-expressive motivation and anticipated guilt. Anticipated guilt, together with attitudes, norms, and efficacy, predicted communication intentions. Results revealed that including attitude functions (motivations) in the reasoned action model could help propose and test theory-based predictions in interpersonal communication and health behaviors.","Interpersonal Provider, Patient, and Partner Talk About Health",Health Communication

This project examines physicians’ written reflections that offer insight into their interpretation of both the stated and the tacit aspects of their observations about communication, their resulting responses, and their intended actions. Tufts University Family medicine residents (N= 33) of the Tufts Family Medicine Cambridge Health Alliance completed three reflective exercises each week over the course of one year (N=756 reflective entries). An interdisciplinary research team identified communication-related concepts within the reflections. Identified themes include 1) physicians recognizing and discovering mutual interplay of their communication with and patient disclosure, 2) physicians paying attention to subtleties of patient behavior as indicative of a fuller picture of patients’ lives and their coping with illness, and 3) physician images of growth and awareness about communication indicative of their potential for growth/improvement.","Interpersonal Provider, Patient, and Partner Talk About Health",Health Communication

Methods: A total of 1093 PLHIV answered the questions related to disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners/spouses. Descriptive statistics were first reported on the prevalence of HIV status disclosure to spouses/partners and demographic variables, motivations for disclosure and nondisclosure, HIV-related stigma, and relational factors. Second, a series of t-tests were conducted to investigate the differences in the above variables between females and males. Lastly, logistic regression was employed to determine the factors of whether or not the participants disclosed their HIV status to spouses/partners for the male, the female and the combined samples.
Results: Fear of rejection was a significant predictor of HIV nondisclosure for the male, the female and the combined samples. Concern about privacy was a significant factor in not disclosing to sexual partners/spouses only in the male sample. The endorsement of duty to inform/educate was the only motivation factor that was significantly related to HIV disclosure for the three samples. The motivation to establish a close/supportive relationship with intimate partners/spouses was found to be associated with HIV disclosure for the combined and male samples.
Conclusion: The current study has theoretical and practical implications for HIV interventions that focus on the factors associated with disclosure decision-making to facilitate PLHIV to cope with the disease.","Interpersonal Provider, Patient, and Partner Talk About Health",Health Communication
2015-1239,2015,Paper Session,Digital Skills and Social Media: How Skills Relate to Frequency and Types of Facebook Use Among “Digital Natives”,1,"Based on the idea that Internet use can be conceptualized in terms of depth (frequency) and width (differentiated) uses of the Web, this study explored how sociodemographics and digital skills were related to frequency and types of Facebook use among young adults. Using a face-to-face representative survey conducted in the three main urban areas of Chile among a sample of 18-to 29-year olds, it found that men and more educated people had higher levels of skills, confirming that “digital natives” are not a monolithic group. It also revealed that digital skills did not predict frequency of Facebook use, and lower educated people tended to use Facebook more frequently. Although these results go against the long-established digital divide research, the traditional gaps emerged when types of uses were analyzed. While more educated and skillful individuals tended to use Facebook for informational and mobilizing purposes, sociodemographic factors and skills did not make a difference in Facebook use for social purposes.",Digital Skills Divide,Communication and Technology
2015-1240,2015,Paper Session,Mapping the Two Levels of Digital Divide: Internet and Social Network Site Adoption Among Older Adults,4,"Older adults have increasingly adopted Internet and SNSs, but little communication scholarship has addressed the digital divide in this population. Using a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 50 years or older from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we examine Internet and SNS adoption patterns across younger (52–69) and older (70+) cohorts. Findings show differential patterns of Internet and SNS adoption across these groups. For Internet adoption, being older, less educated, racial/ethnic minority, and having more functional limitations decreased the likelihood of Internet use for the older cohort, but not for the younger cohort. For SNS adoption, being female, engaging in more diverse Internet activities, and contacting children and other family more frequently predicted SNS adoption for the younger cohort, whereas being older, unmarried, and unemployed increased the chance of SNS use for the older cohort. Implications for digital inequality initiatives and future research are discussed.",Digital Skills Divide,Communication and Technology
2015-1241,2015,Paper Session,"Mobilizing Beneficial Coping Resources Online: The Role of Education, Digital Skills, and Capital-Enhancing Internet Use for Digital Inequality",2,"Research on the digital divide points to inequalities with respect to digital skills and to differences in forms of Internet use that have the potential to enhance the users’ social, human, and financial capital. However, we do not know to what extent these inequalities translate into inequalities in outcomes of Internet use. Using a large scale sample of Dutch Internet users, we analyze educational inequalities in the successful mobilization of online coping resources after stressful life events, such as a loss of a job, serious health issues, psychological problems, and loss or death of a partner or family member. We find that some educational differences in successful mobilization of resources exist. These are to some, although limited, extent mediated by differences in digital skills and differences in spending time on capital-enhancing forms of Internet use, such as using discussion fora or utilizing social networking services. Stronger digital skills predict more time spent on capital-enhancing forms of Internet use which, in turn, predict mobilization of coping resources. The educational inequalities in mobilization of resources online are somewhat smaller than educational inequalities in offline mobilization of resources. The implications for further research on the digital divide and inequality are discussed.",Digital Skills Divide,Communication and Technology
2015-1242,2015,Paper Session,"Internet Skill Levels Increase, But Gaps Widen",2,"We investigated how (1) the levels of operational, formal, information, and strategic internet skills changed between 2010 and 2013, and how (2) the observed skill patterns differ across gender, age, and education. All internet skills are measured among representative samples of the Dutch population in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. The levels of operational and formal internet skills increased most. Information internet skill remained more or less consistent, and strategic internet skills revealed a very small increase. As age increases, internet skill levels decrease. Information internet skills only increased for people aged over 65. The skills gap between the higher educated on the one hand, and lower and middle educated on the other hand increased, while the gap between low and middle educated decreased. We expect that a particular share of inequality concerning information and strategic internet skills will remain and that these inequalities are long lasting.",Digital Skills Divide,Communication and Technology

This paper aims to explore the emotional outcomes of after reading a post on Facebook and examine the role of tie strength in predicting happiness and envy. This is also the first paper that distinctively measured benign and malicious envy in the SNS context. Two studies-one exploratory, based on a sample of 207 American participants and the other experimental, based on a sample of 194 German participants-were conducted in 2014. Based on a multi-method approach, the results showed that positive emotions are more pervasive and salient than negative emotions while browsing Facebook. In addition, tie strength is positively associated with the feeling of happiness and benign envy, whereas malicious envy is independent of tie strength after reading a positive and envy-inducing post on Facebook.",Behavioral and Perceptual Outcomes of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

By using a self-report survey, this study looks at how the use of social media is related to college students’ psychological well-being, including anxiety, depression, loneliness and life satisfaction, and how individuals’ personality traits moderate this relationship. A survey with 538 college students shows that the longer being a member of Facebook, and the longer a user stays on Facebook, the higher level of anxiety and loneliness the respondents reported. However, no correlation was found between mobile phone use frequency and the negative emotions. Different types and motivations of use of SNS have different relationship with psychological well-being. Moreover, personal traits moderate the relationship between SNS use and psychological well-being.",Behavioral and Perceptual Outcomes of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

One example is Google Glass, worn similar to a pair of eyeglasses but with a persistent digital display which can provide the wearer with extra-dyadic cues – such as social information (culled from social media programs) – about one’s conversation partners. The current study simulated a fictitious “Looking Glass” program that (a) auto-detects (via facial recognition) one’s partner and (b) displays that person’s last 12 social media posts on Glass. In a randomized case/control experiment, non-wearers were more likely to perceive Glass-wearers as physically attractive and socio-emotionally close, while feeling lower self-esteem and having higher mental and physical demand with the conversation. Open-ended data suggested Glass wearers to be less attentive to the conversation, and Glass-present conversations were less on-topic. These data hold implications for future application and research on cyborgic face-to-face interactions.",Behavioral and Perceptual Outcomes of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

This assumes however that virtual behaviors in the lab, will predict to similar everyday real-life behaviors. To examine whether this is true, 267 men who had sex with men (MSM) filled out initial and post measures of their sexual risk-taking and went on a “virtual date” that allowed them to make the same contextually driven choices just as in everyday life (e.g., use of alcohol, drugs, sexual acts).

However, few studies explore how organized publics use communication technologies to organize and resist against emerging technologies. Based on an ongoing ethnography that includes in-depth interviews and focus groups, this paper assesses how a community of poor women farmers in a semi-arid region in south India use community media to organize and resist the media-academic-industry nexus to promote agricultural technologies, specifically Bt cotton.

Khadar is formed through the violence of the state in conjunction with elite middle-class interests. I draw from critical-cultural and feminist scholarship to understand complex aspirations and new subjectivities produced by new development initiatives in “Emerging India.” My ethnographic interviews and observations with subaltern youth highlight transformation narratives of producing the modern, “hygienic” worker and emergent, unsettled subjectivities. The youth form critical mediators of popular policy discourses in asking for an “education” versus “training.” Further, they redefine their imaginations of “successful” work that contradict popular, global discourses of the desirable worker in the knowledge economy.",ICTs and Marginalized Populations,Global Communication and Social Change

Web-Based Digital Literacy Measurement Tools for Arabic Speaking Internet Users,2,"Many governments have embarked on ambitious programs to make information technology available to their citizens in attempts to decrease the global digital divide. For this strategy to succeed, it is not sufficient to simply make Internet connectivity available, as searchers must have some level of digital literacy to use Web resources. Measuring Web-based digital literacy is thus necessary to plan educational interventions. No such tools exist in Arabic, although Arabic speakers are the 4th largest group of Web users (Internet World Stats, 2014). Accordingly the main goal of this study was to adapt and test existing tools, which are in English. We observed native Arabic speaker’s Web searches, measured their Internet knowledge and their self-reported digital skill level. Regression analysis revealed that Internet knowledge is the best predictor of successful searches, although self-reported skill also predicts search success.

The funeral industry is currently a sixteen billion dollars a year business in the United States (IBIS World, 2014) and a number of online commercial death services are entering this industry. However, as Tero Karppi (2013) and Tama Leaver (2013) have recently posited, the role of commercial production and consumption and the economies of online memorialization are yet to be substantially accounted for. We begin with a review of scholarship around death and the Internet before outlining the scope of the current funeral industry. We then explore a selection of representative commercial afterlife services - Dead Man’s Switch, Everplans and Legacy – and consider these new services in relation to this wider commercial and historical context. This analysis of online materials forms a preliminary stage of our ongoing research into digital entrepreneurs and providers within the funeral industry.","Life (and Death) Online: Identities, Communities, and Commodities",Popular Communication

However, beyond that aphorism lies important truths about the shifting nature of celebrity, community, and commodification in an increasingly digital, networked world. Animal celebrities walk the line between anthropomorphized characters we identify with and marketable objects we can buy and sell. This paper explores what is at stake when we turn pets into celebrities, and when those celebrities are made famous by the Internet. Using four case studies – Boo, Maru, Tardar Sauce and Lil Bub – I analyze the many roles Internet animal celebrities can fill. By using these characters as a lens through which to examine consumption and community-building practices online, I find that fans use these animals for multiple, sometimes conflicting, purposes: as commodities that substitute for personality traits, as symbols for sharing feelings, or as centers around which to build communities.","Life (and Death) Online: Identities, Communities, and Commodities",Popular Communication

These mechanisms—known as share ratio enforcement—exist so that file sharers upload as much data as they download. File sharing is an arena in which we can see the metaphor of ‘sharing’ at work and enquire into its modus operandi there, both by looking at the ways in which the word is used, as well as the ways it is explicitly highlighted as a resource in attempts to shape the moral contours of the file sharing endeavor. Analysis of forum discussions about share ratios reveals a number of counter-intuitive findings, for instance, that sometimes the way to contribute to a file-sharing community is by not sharing. The deployment of the word ‘sharing’ as a rhetorical strategy is discussed.","Life (and Death) Online: Identities, Communities, and Commodities",Popular Communication

The paper argues that the workplace level functions as a link between the macro level of external pressures and the micro level of perceived influences on newswork. Using principal component analysis we explore the dimensionality of workplace autonomy based on a set of 20 survey questions. Regression analysis is then used on the dimensions found in order to determine what affects perception of autonomy in the different dimensions. The most salient explanatory variables are found on the country and organizational levels, whereas the variables age, experience, gender, managerial role and medium have no or limited effects. The results show the organizational and country levels being integrated and that and that media system/journalistic culture is the most salient factor explaining perception of autonomy.",Journalistic Autonomy and Perceived Influences,Journalism Studies

Yet such forms of journalism are still often denigrated in scholarly discussions, as they often deviate from normative ideals. This is particularly true for the field of lifestyle journalism, where few studies have examined the impact of commercial influences. Through in-depth interviews with 89 Australian and German lifestyle journalists, this paper explores the ways in which the lifestyle industries try to shape the work of journalists, and how these journalists deal with advertising and public relations influences in their daily practice. We find that journalists in this field are in a constant struggle over the control of editorial content, and their responses to increasing commercial pressures vary broadly between resistance and resignation.

The effects of advertiser pressure on journalism, however, have seldom been subject to systematic empirical research. Content analyses on the subject are particularly rare. This study for the first time scrutinizes on how the representation of firms by the leading German political weeklies DER SPIEGEL und FOCUS correlates with the amount of advertising by those firms.

For instance, if people believe in strong media influences on others, they are more likely to increase their communication activities or support demands for restrictions on media. A standardized online survey among German journalists (n = 960) revealed that the stronger the journalists perceive the political online influence on the public to be, the more frequently they contradict unwanted political views in their articles. Moreover, even journalists are more likely to approve of restrictions on the Internet’s political influence, the stronger they believe the effects of online media to be.

The journalists’ assessments were collected in a quantitative survey (N = 284) using equivalent measures. Two forms of influence are distinguished: influence on political coverage and influence flowing from the exigency of having political orientations in line with political sources for successful interaction. The study probed several hypotheses pertaining to determinants of perceived influence. Journalists’ individual characteristics and the national context were relevant for explaining the perceptions. The most interesting findings are, first, that contact with PR staff rather than with elected politicians inspires the journalists’ feelings of being influenced. Second, the French context, which was expected to foster perceived political influence, did so only with respect to perceived influence on the coverage but reduced such perceptions as regards interactions.

We propose a multimodal approach by integrating theories of communication public goods, media multiplexity, and social networks to examine the dynamics of voluntary group participation embedded in multimodal communication systems. Specifically, this study investigates whether and how patterns of voluntary participation facilitate community involvement, taking into account structural factors such as affiliation bridging ties. Analyzing a 2013 random sample survey of 400 residents in the Greater Cleveland area in the United States, results suggest that multimodal participation in voluntary associations helps generate public goods at the group level, which then contributes to community involvement beyond the influences of binary membership or a count of group memberships. Moreover, individuals who occupy bridging affiliation positions are not necessarily more advantageous than those without such positions in adopting multimodal group participation.

Method: A qualitative study was undertaken. Thirteen maternity carers (8 midwives, 1 obstetrician, 3 general practitioners, 1 child health nurse) from three locations (rural and remote, regional and metropolitan) delivering two models of care (midwife continuum model or shared care ) participated in semi- structured interviews. Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).
Results: Active listening and open questions were used to understand the woman’s perspective and situation and to check her understanding. Participants used self-disclosure, reassurance, personal reflection and communication of professional competence to build rapport with women. Directive communication, tailored communication, emphasis of open line of communication and partner engagement were used to support patient well-being.","Adolescents, Family, Aging: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

Thus, there is a need for specialised support (Davis, et al., 2003), which nurses are best positioned to provide. Evidence suggests supportive nurse communication enables mothers to assume responsibility for caring for their infant, assisting in the transition to parenthood, as well as reducing depression and anxiety. There has been a move to single family room nurseries, however, research has not examined how nursery design affects nurse parent communication. This study surveyed and interviewed both parents and nurses about their perceptions of nurse parent communication in 2 different designs of nurseries, open bay (OB) and single family rooms (SFR). While the SFR design was beneficial for parenting the negative impact on nurse-parent communication found in this study needs to be addressed.","Adolescents, Family, Aging: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

Relying on data collected from children (n=289), and within the context of the Reasoned Action Approach, we found that attitudes, but not injunctive or descriptive norms, mediated the association between television exposure and intentions to eat unhealthy snacks. Further, intentions were associated with unhealthy food habits. Interestingly, we found a positive association between television exposure and injunctive norms, which deserves particular attention from practitioners interested in designing public health interventions. These results have policy implications, because the Peruvian government will soon regulate the food advertising landscape targeted at children and adolescents.","Adolescents, Family, Aging: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

This study will present the results of the first video efficacy study of the Rural Cancer Prevention Center's ""Protect Their Future” intervention. The intervention was designed to improve adherence to age-appropriate adolescent vaccination outcomes in a medically underserved community. The intervention was delivered by video by iPads to parents of adolescents.

99 parents in the intervention completed pre- and post-test surveys via custom-developed audio-assisted iPad interview software. Evaluation of the video’s strong perceived message effectiveness was evaluated with high reliability (alpha = .93). After watching the video, parents who had at least one adolescent child who had not been vaccinated with HPV, were 6.25 times more likely to intend to have their adolescent male child receive HPV vaccination, compared to parents who did not (p <.001). Similarly, parents who had at least one adolescent child who had not been vaccinated against HPV, were 1.38 times more likely to intend to have their adolescent female child receive HPV vaccination (p <.001). Parents’ beliefs in the vaccine’s efficacy also improved after viewing the video (t = 1.88, p = .06). Parents of adolescents were also significantly more likely to intend to have their adolescents immunized for influenza (t = 2.516, p = .014) after watching the video. The “Protect their Future” video intervention demonstrates an approach to improving adolescent immunization education that can be appropriately scaled and culturally-tailored to improve intention to complete all age appropriate vaccinations in other populations.","Adolescents, Family, Aging: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

This study analyzed 2009 Korean General Social Survey data (KGSS, www.kossda.or.kr). The 2009 KGSS was a nationwide survey conducted on 769 males and 830 females. Through the secondary analysis, we examined the effect of social capital in light of five factors: interpersonal trust, trust on society, size of network, importance of network and reciprocity. Results of the hierarchical regression showed the significant effects of importance of network and interpersonal trust, after controlling for demographics, religious faith, depressive symptoms, issue involvement, and media exposure.","Adolescents, Family, Aging: High Density Panel in Health Communication",Health Communication

2015-1274,2015,Paper Session,Mouthpiece or Corrective: How Financial Media Responded to the Cultural Change Promulgated by Deutsche Bank,1,"This study develops a new approach to qualitatively analyze the responsiveness of German financial media to frames of the ‘cultural change’ proclaimed in the banking industry after the financial crisis, exemplified on Deutsche Bank. Based on framing theory and first-order and second-order agenda building theory, a systematic analysis of the salience and attributes of messages conveyed in press releases by DB dealing with the ‘cultural change’ is carried out. Findings suggest that there is a strong difference between the two major German financial media outlets in the extent to which the salience and attributes of press releases by DB are adopted. While Handelsblatt preliminary resonates the messages by DB in a neutral tone and therefore appears to be rather a ‘mouthpiece’ of DB, Börsen-Zeitung presents a corrective counterpart that develops a more critical and differentiated viewpoint towards the ‘cultural change’ communicated by DB.","Organizational Perspectives on Public Relations, Corporate Communication, and Branding",Organizational Communication

While brands and branding have historically been the domain of marketing and consumer studies researchers, I argue that a focus on the intersection of branding and organizing enables critical researchers to more effectively address the ways in which neoliberal capitalism and post-Fordist organizational forms mediate processes of meaning construction and human identity formation. Developing the notion of “communicative capitalism” (Dean, 2009), I argue that branding can be explored as a particular case of “organizing beyond organization.” The essay develops four elements of the branding and organizing relationship as an instantiation of communicative capitalism: 1) Floating signifiers and nodal points; 2) Communicative labor; 3) Communication and affect; and 4) Power, politics, and resistance.","Organizational Perspectives on Public Relations, Corporate Communication, and Branding",Organizational Communication

2015-1277,2015,Paper Session,"Rape, Mediated Geospace, and the Possibility of Transnational Feminist Praxis",1,"The 2012 rape and murder of Jyoti Singh Pandey on a New Delhi bus became a media spectacle, flooding the mediascape worldwide with stories, images, and video, especially of the street protests in India that ensued in the wake of the incident. In this paper, I examine the news’ deployment of space and place as signifiers of gender and sexuality, and I reflect on its implications for collective feminist activism. Via a critical feminist textual analysis of US news media coverage of the rape/murder I found pervasive depictions of the Indian subcontinent as a primitive and undisciplined place populated by savage males and subordinate women, where state authority is complicit in violence against women, and where rape culture flourishes. These representations reinscribed social geographies of power between the global North and South. In reasserting these geospatial hierarchies, US news coverage obscured the incidence of sexual violence in the First World, countering the possibility of transnational “feminism without borders,” where solidarities and alliances might be fostered to combat the worldwide problem of sexual violence against women. In this panel presentation, I will further explore how the media intervene in transborder feminist activism. Do the media have the potential to support or catalyze forms of coalitional agency? Or must feminist praxis always work against their disenabling impulses?",Narrations of Rape in Postcolonial India and Beyond: Rape Discourse in Global Contests of Power,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1278,2015,Paper Session,Narrating Rape as India’s Ruptured Modernity,1,"Global media representation of sexual violence in India is accompanied by a distinct register of condescension accompanied by horror. The media is quick to pathologize Indian men as predisposed to violence and showcase the incredible shame of India. After the gang rape in India, major publications around the world made the easy slide from the crime to accusing the nation of its regressive mindset, chaotic infrastructure and repressed male citizenry. The global media black listed India as a tourist destination and social media sites list particular dangers Western women traveling in India might face. No doubt, the tragedy of the gang rapes has brought the serious issue about safety and equality to center stage. However, the violence has also set into motion a discursive machinery warning India about its ruptured pathways to modernity. Rape is evoked the ultimate disqualification in terms of India cultivating its global image. Global media narrations of gendered violence in India have erected a divided nation--one mired in the past and whose presence forever thwarts the possibility of the other India gazing at its global futures. How do these media narratives from the West speak to the enduring optics used to both represent and discipline Indian public culture and modernity.",Narrations of Rape in Postcolonial India and Beyond: Rape Discourse in Global Contests of Power,Feminist Scholarship
2015-1279,2015,Paper Session,News Coverage of Rape as a Site for Global Contests of Power,1,"In this paper I will analyze the coverage of rape in multiple locations, including U.S. coverage of inter-caste rape in India and Al Jazeera’s coverage of campus rape in the U.S. Through my examination of coverage of rape in multiple locations, I will broach the question of how rape becomes the ground for contestation between different interpretations of modernity and progress or the lack of it. The paper will point to the epistemic harm that is done when rape becomes the ground for global contests for hegemonic positioning between older and newer powers and between different regions of the world. There is a long history of the symbolic deployment of women’s issues for global projects, including colonial and neocolonial projects. The selective appropriation of feminist and gender issues by capitalist projects, especially advertising and marketing, has also been documented in the literature on commodity feminism. It becomes important to look at the continuing exploitation of women’s and gender issues by the mainstream media in an age when transnational feminisms advance on the uneven terrain of neoliberal hegemony. This creates the contradiction of the appropriation of feminist-inspired rhetoric in the service of global contests of power, used to position particular regions globally but also to resist challenges to hegemony. I will attempt to identify some of these contradictions through my analysis of rape coverage in multiple locations.",Narrations of Rape in Postcolonial India and Beyond: Rape Discourse in Global Contests of Power,Feminist Scholarship

AIB’s pungent video parody, which is part of a longer trajectory of feminist activism against rape and sexual assault in India, tackles a patriarchal culture of victim blaming that heaps shame and stigma on Indian women. How does this parody’s compact narrative encapsulate the discourses of victim blaming that emerge in the aftermath of sexual violence? What does the reception of this video in prominent news media outlets and in the online commentary of ordinary citizens reveal about the efficacy of such new media genres of protest? Does the video produce a hegemonic and racist construct of “barbaric” Indian masculinity that circulates in the west? Drawing on the concept of “gender jamming” and Bakhtin’s notion of “carnival,” my paper analyzes the cultural politics and progressive potential of this video parody’s critique of patriarchal norms that police female sexuality in India.",Narrations of Rape in Postcolonial India and Beyond: Rape Discourse in Global Contests of Power,Feminist Scholarship

The study cross-examined 242 articles published in two daily, national newspapers with largest circulations and 200 corporate websites to identify prominent issues and topics. The findings showed that while Indian news media and corporations frame CSR/SD as an environmental issue, they both define environmental priorities differently. Also, while corporate CSR/SD communication is mostly geared towards shareholders, the news media prioritizes communities in their CSR/SD content. The larger, state-owned companies provide most CSR/SD information while no significant differences were found between the two newspapers’ CSR/SD coverage.","CSR, Communication, and Public Perceptions",Public Relations
2015-1282,2015,Paper Session,Framing CSR-Fit: How CSR Activities Are Covered by News Media,3,"This research provides a basis for understanding how the contents of media coverage about CSR activities relates to the fit between these CSR activities and the organizations’ core activities.
In two studies 513 news articles about organizations’ CSR activities were analyzed. First, by means of an expert review the internal fit between the CSR initiatives presented in the news articles and the core business of the organizations pursuing these initiatives were determined. Second, a quantitative content analysis measured tone of voice and framing of the news articles.
The results reveal that while internal CSR fit does not influence tone of voice, it partly impacts the framing of the media coverage as internal CSR fit leads to a positive framing of organizations and their CSR activities. However, vice versa internal CSR misfit does not necessarily lead to negative representation of organizations and their CSR in the media coverage.
In order to maximally benefit from its CSR activities and achieve optimal media coverage, organizations are advised to not only engage in CSR but seek to implement initiatives well integrated into their core business.","CSR, Communication, and Public Perceptions",Public Relations

A 3 X 2 (CSR brand concept: luxury brand CSR vs. nonluxury brand CSR versus no CSR; emotion priming: guilt vs. neutral) between subjects randomized experiment was conducted among 138 American consumers. The results indicated a significant interaction effect among emotions and brands on a participant’s perceived CSR, as hypothesized. Specifically, participants in the neutral condition that received nonluxury brand’s CSR report yielded higher perceptions of CSR. However, in the guilt-primed condition, no significant difference between the two brands was found.

In-depth interviews with CSR/Sustainability professionals suggest that public relations practitioners could be a major driver of organizational reform required to advance responsibility- and sustainability-thinking. Recommendations are offered for empowering public relations practitioners to support ethical policy making and programming for CSR/Sustainability – as well as critique of public relations’ enduring attachment to one-way asymmetric publicity models and use of philanthropy as greenwash. While the insider-activist role for transforming organizations into more just and moral places may be an aspirational goal for public relations at present, it is a campaign worth waging. Fulfilling the insider-activist role could empower practitioners to navigate organizations toward more ethical behaviors and improve public relations’ reputation at the same time.","CSR, Communication, and Public Perceptions",Public Relations

Consumer responses were tested through attitudes toward, supportive communication intent regarding, and purchasing intent toward the given company.
The study found that corporate association strategies (CA strategy, CSR strategy) effectively facilitate consumers’ corporate associations across different industries. Generally, CA associations showed a relatively stronger impact on consumer responses for the consumable goods industry, while CSR associations were relatively more important for the durable goods industry. In the case of stigmatized industry, CSR associations showed significant importance for consumer attitudes toward, supportive communication intentions regarding, and purchasing intentions toward the given companies.","CSR, Communication, and Public Perceptions",Public Relations

The most prevalent conflict style participants reported was validating, followed by volatile, avoiding, and hostile. Relational satisfaction significantly predicted all conflict styles, except for volatile conflict style. Attachment frustration and secure and dismissive attachment styles were significant predictors of volatile conflict style. Avoiding conflict style was significantly predicted by attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety. Hostile conflict style was significantly predicted by secure and preoccupied attachment style, and attachment closeness and avoidance.

The Personal Impact of Brand Journalism (Top Faculty Paper),2,"Researchers have explored the role of organizational and personal branding in journalism, paying particular attention to digital media and social network sites. While these studies have observed a rise in the incorporation of branding practices among journalists, they have largely avoided questions about the implications such shifts in practice may have on the personal identities of journalists. This study addresses that gap, drawing on interviews with more than 40 journalists and editors from U.S. newspapers. The findings suggest that as journalists incorporate branding into their routines, they may be sacrificing the ability to simultaneously maintain a personal identity online. For their part, editors seem to sympathize with journalists’ loss of personal identity but defer to organizational policies.

This paper explores the current role of women in the television news industry. Women now present more stories than men in this historically male-dominated career. But does inclusion mean equality? Through in-depth interviews with female newscasters, this study explores the challenges facing women in the television news industry. Using a feminist lens, the study identifies themes common among these women, including: pressure to meet unattainable beauty standards, being placed in secondary or sexualized roles in the newsroom and in the field, and balancing credibility and intelligence with attractiveness and sexuality to build audience rapport. Data indicates female broadcasters take their roles as public servants seriously, but still negotiate through gender-biased challenges each and every day. These are challenges not faced by male newscasters, thus adding to the social power imbalance in the industry.

This paper surveys internships at 17 mainstream English-language newspapers and magazines in Canada. Through the term precarity, it examines how these organizations devalue the labour-power of youth interns by extracting surplus value from them and, thus, exploit their working time. Although many interns are not unionized, others are, and labour unions can be complicit in sustaining these conditions. Some collective agreements demonstrate, however, best practices to counter this internship system. This paper draws on labour union documents, correspondence with journalism organizations, internship advertisements, and media coverage to categorize the pay rates and collective representation of interns as (1) unpaid/low paid and nonunionized; (2) unpaid/low paid and unionized; (3) paid at intern rates and nonunionized; (4) paid at intern rates and unionized; and (5) paid at entry-level employee rates and unionized.",Pressures of Journalistic Work: Critical Perspectives,Journalism Studies

2015-1299,2015,Paper Session,The Longitudinal Relationship Between Media Violence and Empathy: Was it Sympathy All Along?,3,"Research with adolescents has reported a negative relation between media violence exposure and empathy. There are, however, two conceptual issues in this earlier literature that deserve attention. First, studies often treat empathy as one-dimensional while it consists of both an affective and cognitive component. Second, while aiming to measure empathy, several studies have measured sympathy instead. The present study investigates the longitudinal relationship between media violence, affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and sympathy. Using two-wave data from 943 adolescents, we tested whether media violence exposure negatively influenced empathy and sympathy (desensitization hypothesis) or whether empathy and sympathy negatively influenced media violence exposure (selection hypothesis). The results support the desensitization hypothesis and suggest that media violence exposure does not lead to a decrease in empathy, as previous studies have found, but instead to a decrease in sympathy. These findings provide important clarification to existing work and offer both methodological and practical implications.",Critical Discoveries About Violence and Conflict in Media,Children Adolescents and the Media

This study tested whether violent television viewing would indirectly increase fear of violent crime, whereas violent video game play would indirectly decrease fear of violent crime. Perceived ability to control violent crime was expected to mediate both relationships. These hypotheses were based on the cultivation theory, which explains television effects, and the self-determination theory and the theory of planned behavior, which explain video game effects. A multiple mediation model of data involving over 3000 adolescents showed that violent crime drama viewing was negatively related to perceived control whereas violent video game play was positively related to perceived control. Perceived control, in turn, was negatively related to fear of crime. Perceived control mediated the associations that were found.

Consistent with previous research (Lewis & Mitchell, 2014), we found that, across all age groups, most conflict representations in children’s media positioned altruistic and egoistic motivations against one another rather than against themselves. Extending this research, we found that (a) portrayal patterns stressed the importance of electing altruistic motivations over egoistic motivations, and (b) the focus on altruistic motivations diminished in programming for older children. The findings were interpreted in line with logic underlying the model of intuitive morality and exemplars (MIME; Tamborini, 2012) suggesting that media representations favor the portrayal of values consistent with cultural norms.",Critical Discoveries About Violence and Conflict in Media,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-1302,2015,Paper Session,The Role of Perceived Peer Norms in the Relationship Between Media Violence Exposure and Aggression,4,"Media violence and perceived peer norms have both been studied as predictors of adolescents’ aggression, but never in combination. Yet, theoretical models indicate multiple ways in which peer norms may affect the relationship between media violence and aggression. This study tested three such ways: peer norms as moderator, as mediator, and as both moderator and mediator. A two-wave longitudinal survey measured media violence exposure, perceived descriptive and injunctive norms, and aggressive behavior among 943 adolescents (aged 10 to 14, 50.4% girls). Results provided support for the moderated-mediation model. The indirect effect of media violence on aggression via perceived peer approval of aggression (i.e., injunctive norms) was moderated by perceived prevalence of peer aggression (i.e., descriptive norms). Specifically, media violence indirectly increased aggressive behavior for adolescents who perceived more peer aggression, but decreased aggression for adolescents who perceived less peer aggression.

Conversely, the current study examines longitudinal associations between viewing relational aggression in the media and subsequent aggressive behavior. Participants included 500 adolescents who completed a number of different questionnaires involving media and aggression at three different time points. Results revealed that viewing relational aggression in the media is longitudinally associated with future relational aggression. However, early levels of relational aggression did not predict future exposure to media relational aggression. A crossover effect of media was also examined and found to support a bidirectional relationship between media relational aggression and physical aggression over time. These results support both the General Aggression Model (GAM) and downward spiral model and suggest that viewing relational aggression in the media can have a long-term effect on aggressive behavior during adolescence.",Critical Discoveries About Violence and Conflict in Media,Children Adolescents and the Media
2015-1304,2015,Paper Session,Design Effectiveness Analysis of an Intervention to Reduce Violent Attitudes and Video Games Consumption Among Adolescents Based on Relational Lifestyles Segmentation,4,"Violence is an obstacle to positive youth development. One common solution to help prevent violence is to develop communication campaigns aimed at eradicating it. These campaigns have been shown to be sometimes ineffective or even counter-productive. Specifying when or for whom these adverse effects might be more likely to occur is a critical factor in determining the future success of these campaigns. The present research tested the effectiveness of an anti-violence program by taking lifestyles into account. Lifestyles seemed to be a relevant factor in determining the effectiveness of a program aimed at a youth population (aged 12-19). The results indicated that the program was effective in changing the attitudes of adolescents toward violence; however, the translation of these attitudes into behaviours was moderated by lifestyles. In relation to communicative adolescents, the attitude-behaviour link was consistent, resulting in fewer intentions to consume violent videogames, whereas for fractured adolescents, the opposite was found.

Based on theories of destigmatization, empathy, and reactance, we predicted that higher levels of personal involvement elicited by a personalized prosocial media message would lead to higher levels of empathy and lower levels of reactance, both of which were assumed to mediate prosocial outcomes. An online experiment was conducted using a personalized and an non-personalized version of a viral advertisement for a campaign soliciting donations of winter coats for homeless people. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed a positive indirect effect of personal involvement on prosocial outcomes (attitudes and behavioral intentions toward homeless people, and willingness to support the campaign) that was mediated by empathy and reduced reactance. However, in addition to promoting personal involvement, personalization also lead to heightened reactance, which partly offset its positive effects.",The Study of Persuasion in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

An Experimental Study of the Persuasive Effects of Emotional Tone in Online Advocacy Videos,3,"Abstract: Using experimental design (N=152), this study investigated the persuasive effects of emotional tone used in online advocacy videos (fear, humor, control). Findings indicate both fear and humor positively affect behavioral intention to engage in environmentally conscious behaviors. Mediation analysis of the antecedent variables in the theory of planned behavior model revealed significant, though different, indirect effects of each form of emotional appeal through one or more of these potential mediators on behavioral intention.",The Study of Persuasion in Mass Communication,Mass Communication
2015-1307,2015,Paper Session,The Impact of Moral Emotions and Self-Construal on Generating Help for Children in Need,1,"Many charity organizations face ongoing challenges to promote monetary donations and other helping behaviors. It is important to unravel what drives the effectiveness of fundraising messages, and to understand people’s decision-making process of engaging in altruistic behaviors. Integrating the literature on the role of emotion in persuasive communication and intercultural communication, two studies were conducted to explore the impact of moral emotions and self-construal in charity advertising. A survey investigated the extent to which moral emotions operated differently among individuals with varying self-construal in affecting the intent to donate. An experiment examined the impact of ego- versus other-focused emotional appeals in the processing of charity advertising. Results indicated that moral emotions significantly influenced participants’ purchase intention towards social-cause products. In addition, self-construal moderated the influence of moral emotions on purchase intention, as well as the influence of emotional appeal on the intent to donate. These two studies expanded the knowledge on the effects of emotions on communication and persuasion, and provided relevant implications for practitioners in creating effective messages to promote social causes.",The Study of Persuasion in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

We distinguish message engagement from topic involvement (the way involvement is usually treated in classic persuasion research) and argue that other factors affect the degree of involvement with messages. Borrowing conceptually from research on narrative persuasion and its focus on transportation, we offer a measure of non-narrative engagement (NNME) that examines the experience of exposure. Results show that NNME has a direct effect on post-exposure that is sequentially mediated through reactance and counterarguing.",The Study of Persuasion in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

Drawing upon social media governance discourse and research on the dynamics of how social media platforms are being used in the dissemination and consumption of news and information, this paper argues that a restrictive and individualist model of the public interest characterizes the social media space. This paper then considers the broader implications of this emergent model of the public interest in social media governance.","Governance, Discourse, and Public Interest Issues in Media",Communication Law & Policy

Overall, this examination revealed that the majority of sites do allow the formation of a public sphere in which matters of public interest are debated and discussed. This was found in four primary ways: rhetorical invitations to take part, demands for “civility,” fodder for discussion, and opportunities for dialogue. Yet, the policies also reveal barriers to inclusion and robust debate. This was found in three primary ways: threats of banishment and referral to authorities for violating policies, a trend toward named comment, and, in some cases, strident demands for “on-topic” comments. This study points out the vital issues at stake between the legacy media and their relationship with viewers as news increasingly becomes, as Pew research notes, a “participatory activity.”","Governance, Discourse, and Public Interest Issues in Media",Communication Law & Policy

Through analyses of C-SPAN records, themes spanning micro-macro processes across several decades of deliberations provided insight into how women were underrepresented and how their experiences were missing from STEM initiatives and interventions. Our analysis makes two key contributions regarding the ways in which policymakers perpetuate simplistic solutions that rely on numbers and singular educational interventions. These solutions belie the power of difference and neglect the contexts in which women (and men) engage in labor force activities and careers.","Governance, Discourse, and Public Interest Issues in Media",Communication Law & Policy
2015-1312,2015,Paper Session,Another Leap Forward? A Critical Analysis of China's National Broadband Plan,1,"There is now strong interest among governments in promoting the development of the next generation broadband network and some 134 national broadband plans are now in place around the world. China is of no exception. On August 1, 2013, China's State Council officially announced the ambitious Broadband China Plan, aiming to build a ubiquitous, fast and advanced national broadband network before 2020. Will the Broadband China Plan lead to another leap forward? This paper aims to critically evaluate China's Broadband Plan and identify lessons for other countries. We argue that China's Plan marks a major paradigm shift of China’s information policy. For the first time, broadband network is formally recognized as a strategic public facility and is now considered as a necessity instead of an optional value-added telecommunications service. However, it remains a conventional supply-side industrial policy and its effectiveness is highly uncertain.","Governance, Discourse, and Public Interest Issues in Media",Communication Law & Policy

Through collaborative, community-based transmedia storytelling, these initiatives foster new critical media literacies and active digital citizenship. This paper uses two case studies to construct a multi-layered, multi-sited narrative that illustrates the larger context of transmedia projects that challenge dominant cultural representation of racial/ethnic minorities and create alternative forms of mediated storytelling that are more inclusive and participatory. It examines community-oriented, grassroots initiatives that use digital new media to amplify their voices and redefine their identities in a multicultural, transmedia context. Specifically, it analyses how a fictional web-based drama series (East Los High) and a transmedia participatory art initiative (Question Bridge) achieve inclusive digital participation and critical new media literacies in a spreadable convergence culture.",Latino/a and Latin American Representations and Discourses,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

The concept of pleasure/enjoyment seems present in much of rhetorical thought, but it is almost always relegated as a guilty undercurrent rather than a dominant principle. I contend that Aristotle’s enthymeme is one rhetorical concept out of many that can improve our understanding of appeals to enjoyment. In order to support my claims, I present a case study of the 2010 indie video game LIMBO as an example of how an enthymematic analysis can explain, to some extent, how the game creates pleasure. As a disclaimer, my purpose is not to argue that Aristotle intended the enthymeme to be used for aesthetic analysis. Instead, I wish to repurpose the enthymeme as a means of describing artistic phenomena in addition to its well-founded use as a persuasive tool.","Designing, Selling and Shaping Video Games (and Gamers)",Game Studies
2015-1318,2015,Paper Session,Moral License in Video Games: When Being Right Can Mean Doing Wrong,4,"Research on video game violence has found largely consistent evidence that it tends to be associated with an increase in antisocial behavior. However, this work has mostly ignored one prominent feature of many violent games: moral decision-making. It is possible that the influence of video game violence could change when moral decisions are brought into the context. The present experiment asks participants to make moral choices in a video game, and then measures their behavior on two subsequent tasks. Results indicate that taking what participants perceive to be the more moral mindset in the video game predicts more anti-social behavior on the first task, but more pro-social behavior on the next task. These results indicate that there may be greater complexity in video game violence effects than previously understood.","Designing, Selling and Shaping Video Games (and Gamers)",Game Studies
2015-1319,2015,Paper Session,Playing With History: Historiographic Gameplay and Design,1,"This paper explores historical representation in video games and argues that two types perpetuate: 1) a semantic approach that engages players with the past via visual expressions; and 2) a cause and effect simulation approach that positions players in the context of historically situated possibilities. However, the expressive power of gameworlds and gameplay afford deeper potentials for historical engagements. This paper pursues a video game analysis and design approach that takes seriously representations of the past and places player inquiry at the forefront of the experience. The author concludes with a discussion of her prototype, Resurrection Man, in which players assume the role of a 19th century grave robber. The alpha and beta versions of the game concept are discussed to explain iterative design choices that demonstrate how video games function as historiographic media that invite players’ consideration of a particular micro-history.","Designing, Selling and Shaping Video Games (and Gamers)",Game Studies

There are more games on the market and larger variety of ways in which to play those games. Yet, despite these market shifts, authors such as Shaw (2012) demonstrate that there are still tensions surrounding gamer identification. Even as next-generation systems (such as the Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, and the Wii U) and casual gaming take hold of the market, there is a constant tension between the perceptions of who is playing versus the reality of actual players. In our study, we perform a content analysis of video game commercials in 2013 to explore questions of diversity – particularly in terms of portrayals of they player’s sex and ethnicity – to consider how the gamer is represented in terms of physical and behavioral attributes.","Designing, Selling and Shaping Video Games (and Gamers)",Game Studies
2015-1322,2015,Paper Session,Paradoxical Effects of Green Communication Frames,4,"Research into green advertising mainly investigates whether green advertising is effective and in what circumstances it is especially effective. What happens after people have purchased a green product has, in contrast, been hardly investigated. In two experiments, we show that green framing may have paradoxical post-purchase effects, such that purchasing a green product may lead to environmentally unfriendly behavior (a so-called licensing effect). Our results show that these post-purchase effects of green framing are moderated by green identity: only people with a weak green identity show these paradoxical post-purchase licensing effects, people with a strong green identity are unlikely to show these effects. Furthermore, we show that the shades of green framing do not affect the magnitude of the licensing effect. Products emphasizing their environmental nature heavily (“dark green”) do not lead to bigger licensing effects than products emphasizing their environmental nature only a little bit (“light green”).",Proenvironmental Behaviour and Attitudes,Environmental Communication

A quota sample of 456 consumers was exposed to one of three print ads: a functional ad, a nature ad featuring both a pleasant nature image and functional attributes, and a non-green ad. The results indicate that the functional ad increased perceptions of utilitarian environmental brand benefits and, consequently, positively affected purchase intention, which was partially mediated by attitudes toward the brand. The combined nature ad increased perceptions of both utilitarian environmental brand benefits and the virtual experience of nature. Perceived virtual nature experience had an additional positive influence on consumers’ brand attitudes and purchase intention. These effects of the combined nature ad were even stronger on highly involved consumers. The implications of these results for researchers and marketers are discussed.",Proenvironmental Behaviour and Attitudes,Environmental Communication

No study has tested whether the stimulus of animal victims could elicit the same level of reaction as human victims. The current study tests the identifiable victim effect with both human and animal stimulus messages focused on the consequences of littering. 198 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to view one of three messages, with the animal message eliciting greater distress and empathy than the human message, and the three messages not differing on behavioral intention outcomes.

2015-1325,2015,Paper Session,The Relationships Between Innovativeness and Adoption of Energy-Saving Behavior,1,"This study attempts to understand the relationships between innovativeness and adoption of energy-saving behavior. The understanding of global warming involves adoption of new knowledge and new behavior. This study proposes that in the social media context, innovators will be more likely to adopt energy-saving behavior than will adaptors. The relationship will be mediated by a number of factors, including perceptions of global warming, energy saving and issue involvement. An online survey was conducted, and the results showed significant relationships among innovativeness, perceptions and adoption behavior. However, the relationships between innovativeness and adoption behavior became nonexistent after intervening variables were taken into consideration. Intrinsic motivation and personal interest in the issue were the strongest predictors of adoption behavior. Older women were more likely to adopt energy-saving behavior, suggesting that they could be potential opinion leaders of promoting understanding of global warming to other users of social media.",Proenvironmental Behaviour and Attitudes,Environmental Communication

The issue under study, water conservation, is one that has significant consequences for animal, environmental, and human health. The study used a 3 (priming: independent vs. interdependent vs. control) X 2 (descriptive norms: high vs. low) X 2 (similarity: high vs. low) factorial design. The findings indicate direct effects for similarity and descriptive norms on behavioral intention and self-efficacy to take action to conserve water. Evidence is presented for the moderating effects of similarity and primed group orientation on the descriptive norm-behavior relationship. A moderated mediation model emerges suggesting that the relationship between descriptive norms and behavioral intent is mediated by self-efficacy and the effect was stronger among participants perceiving similarity with the referent group. Implications for theory-building about social norms and communication about water conservation behaviors are addressed.",Proenvironmental Behaviour and Attitudes,Environmental Communication

A factorial experiment (N = 112) was conducted to examine the roles of the social distance and domain relevance in the effects of viewing Instagram photos. Specifically, the effects of social comparison processes, including mood, self-perceptions, and domain-specific life satisfaction were examined in the context of romantic relationships. Findings indicated neither social distance nor domain relevance significantly affected self-perceptions or life satisfaction related to romantic relationships. However, an interaction between the factors that was revealed suggests an “ideal” target for social comparison exists when social distance is low and the photo features domain-relevant subjects.

The link between individuals’ feelings of connectedness to Facebook (Facebook intensity) and their self-concept clarity, i.e., individuals’ perception of a clear and internally consistent self-concept content, is examined. Two cross-sectional studies (N1 = 244; N2 = 166) revealed a negative relationship between Facebook intensity and self-concept clarity for samples of adolescents and adults. Moreover, a longitudinal study (N3 = 101) showed that Facebook intensity predicted changes in self-concept clarity over time whereas self-concept clarity had no effect on Facebook intensity.

Also investigated was the mediating role of the experience of flow (intense engagement in and enjoyment of an activity) in the relationships between perceptions about credibility and features and reported knowledge gains from social networking sites. The findings revealed a negative relationship between privacy concerns and perceptions about credibility and features. Additionally, the mediating role of flow was confirmed. Favorable perceptions about credibility and features facilitated flow which, in turn, predicted learning from social networking sites. The test of the bivariate relationship between privacy concerns and flow revealed a weak negative relationship which disappeared when added to the model. Thus, privacy concerns potentially impede involvement with and learning from social networking sites because of the impact on perceptions about credibility and features.",Social Media Effects,Mass Communication

We apply this model to Facebook and use a sample of 381 Dutch adolescents, given the importance of friendships and social connectedness to this age group (Moore, 1987). Social presence and social awareness are related to one another; both are positively related to social connectedness. Additionally, usage frequency is related to social connectedness. Further, usage frequency moderated the relationship between social presence and social connectedness. Practically, social presence, social awareness, and social connectedness are important concepts that adolescents learn during development; online spaces may serve as an area for adolescents to learn and practice these skills. Theoretically, these results suggest potential differences in the outcomes of network size based on social networking site.",Social Media Effects,Mass Communication

This study proposes that moral judgments of media content are not only related to baseline moral domain salience and exemplars, but also to the immediate cognitive environment of the individual at the moment of exposure. An experiment manipulating construal-level orientation prior to exposure to a mediated narrative was conducted to test this proposal. The results suggest that evaluations of moral violations are indeed modulated by current cognitive processing state. The findings indicate the need for an adjustment to the MIME model to allow for general cognitive states to interact with moral domain salience and moral judgments of media content.

A basic premise of our research is that the emphasis of various moral intuitions may play an important role in this process. In the current paper, we examine how the emphasis of moral intuitions (i.e., care, fairness, liberty, ingroup loyalty, authority, and purity) differentially predicts perceived issue importance and endorsement of controversial issues. We argue that the emphasis of these moral intuitions should be predictive of endorsement of various issues, but not useful predictors of the perceived importance of these issues.

However, studies of the unintended effects of moral clarity/ambiguity are lacking. Moreover, recent, untested theoretical developments suggest mechanisms for how moral clarity/ambiguity might affect audiences. The current paper presents two studies examining the impact of moral clarity/ambiguity on cooperation in an economic game. We reason that morally clear-cut narratives elicit similar, synchronous responses across audience members, and that this shared experience leads to greater cooperation. By contrast, we reason that morally ambiguous narratives elicit divergent, asynchronous responses across audience members, and leads to decreased cooperation. We conduct two studies (one using text stimuli, and one using feature-length films). Results suggest that moral clarity is indeed associated with higher levels of cooperation than moral ambiguity, and that the emphasis of binding moral intuitions intensifies this effect.

In-depth personal interviews with nineteen patients and two focus groups with providers were conducted, for a total of 32 participants. The Critical Incident Technique was employed in both the interviews and focus groups, resulting in over 150 unique incidents that exemplified key situations when respondents found the system extremely effective or ineffective. Positive narratives accounted for 30% of incidents and included (1) the system’s ease and access, (2) ability to empower patients and (3) generate efficiencies for providers. The other 70% of incidents were negative and consisted of four main themes: (1) communication gaps, (2) generic content; (3) technical issues and (4) increased workloads.",Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

However, online health information comes from a vast array of sources, which means internet users must decide for themselves which information they deem to be credible and trustworthy. In this study, we tested the influence of manipulated source expertise on the perceived credibility of online health messages, specifically, an online health message containing information about type 2 diabetes. Results from this study suggest that online health messages with high source expertise are perceived as being more credible, and in turn, lead to individuals retaining more of the health information from the messages. These findings indicate that the language used in a message, along with the affiliation of the message source, may play an important role in promoting knowledge gain from health information found on the internet.",Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Results show that online health information seeking makes people feel more frustrated and overwhelmed. But in particular, more health anxious people feel more confused and frightened by the information they found online. People who search for health information online visit their doctor more often and evaluate their doctor less good in terms of providing correct diagnosis and effective treatment. Our results furthermore seem to reveal that health anxious people always have a more negative attitude towards their doctor, compared to non-health anxious people who are influenced by the information found online.

Against these theoretic and programmatic dilemmas, this article problematizes the relationship between ITLM and women’s health through health information scanning and seeking behaviors (HISSB). In particular, it aims to explore the general patterns of HISSB of Filipino FDWs in Hong Kong (HK). To this end, a series of focus group discussions with Filipino FDWs in HK was employed. Results suggest that they sought more treatment- than prevention-related information for personal reasons. Unique to their sequential use of multiple sources is that they depended on employers as source of information. Social networking sites featured in their sources used for scanning information. While work, migration, and quality of information served as barriers, religiousness facilitated HISSB.

In the current study, we combine perspectives on bridging social capital and mood in a two-week study of undergraduates (N=154). We compare these outcomes in terms of time (minutes vs. weeks) and location (being home vs. away from home). Findings showed that certain logged Facebook activities (i.e., new friendships, event RSVPs) were strongly associated with baseline bridging capital, whereas tagged photos predicted change in social capital over two weeks. Conversely, average mood over the same period was not associated with logged Facebook use. In addition to “longer-term” outcomes, we found evidence for short-term effects of active Facebook use, including more positive mood and higher arousal when at home. Altogether, the study develops a context-dependent perspective of Facebook that incorporates attention to the temporal and spatial dimensions of use.",Social Capital and Social Media,Communication and Technology

We found that communication with peers helps to enhance users online bonding, bridging and maintained social capital stronger than other use forms. While offline friends in the regional SNS contributed most to bonding and maintained social capital, online friends made online and already met offline could increase users’ bridging social capital.

Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of 142 individual studies and found 685 relevant effect sizes focusing on the association between online media use and users’ social capital/social support outcomes. Our preliminary results reveal that while general Internet, SNS and forum use are positively associated with various dimensions of social capital/social support there is no such effect for the use of digital games, blogs, email and chat. By introducing sample and study characteristics as moderators we found that studies with convenience samples are more likely to find associations between the two variables of interest than with random samples.",Social Capital and Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-1342,2015,Paper Session,"Sexism, Social Capital, and the Spiral of Silence Online",1,"This study explores the relationship between social capital and the spiral of silence on two social network sites (SNSs), Facebook and Reddit, by exposing participants to sexist or neutral memes and comparing their positive responses to posts about women’s issues post-exposure. The results suggest Facebook users perceive more bonding social capital than Reddit users, and Reddit users perceive more bridging social capital than Facebook users. In addition, Facebook and Reddit use were indirectly associated with users’ willingness to positively respond to women’s issues posts through the bridging and bonding social capital users perceived. Bonding social capital was not associated with Facebook or Reddit intensity, but Facebook and Reddit intensity were indirectly related to willingness to respond positively to women’s issues through bridging social capital. The relationship between bridging social capital and willingness to respond positively to women’s issues posts was stronger for experimental participants compared to control participants, but only for Reddit users.",Social Capital and Social Media,Communication and Technology
2015-1343,2015,Paper Session,The Framing Effects of User-Generated Comments on Online News Stories,2,"Framing research has primarily focused on the relationship between professional journalists’ frames and public opinion, but the Internet provides a venue for participatory audiences to alter journalists’ frames or provide new frames. Although there is evidence that Internet users are providing new frames for issues, it is unclear how the frames in user-generated comments influence other readers. Through both a content analysis of user-generated comments on news stories about the Federal Drug Administration’s (FDA) announcement to place graphic warning labels on cigarettes and a controlled experiment, this study explored the potential framing effects of user-generated comments on readers’ frame selection and support for a health policy issue. Results indicate that user-generated comments influence readers’ subsequent frame selection, but there was no relationship between user-generated comment frames and health policy support.",User-Generated Content Effects,Communication and Technology
2015-1344,2015,Paper Session,Selecting Online Reviews After Making a Decision: Congeniality and Refutation Biases,1,"Post-decisionally, individuals may reduce their cognitive dissonance by (a) finding information supportive toward the decision (congeniality bias) or (b) finding weak unsupportive information (refutation bias). Applied to online product reviews (e.g., Amazon.com), competing hypotheses propose that after making a product-related decision, individuals utilze cues available on Web 2.0 sites (e.g., star ratings, helpfulness ratings, and badges) to preferentially select reviews. An original experiment prompted participants to make a decision and select reviews to read. Results showed participants generally (1) selected congenial reviews earlier, (2) preferred reviews rated as (a) helpful and (b) written by authors with credibility badge and purchase verification. Future research proposes to examine the connection between cognitive dissonance and other sources of influence on Web 2.0 websites.",User-Generated Content Effects,Communication and Technology
2015-1345,2015,Paper Session,User Generated Content and Credibility Evaluation of Online Health Information: A Meta Analytic Study,1,"This meta-analysis focus on the reliability concerns for user-generated-online-health information, a topic recently investigated by scholars but reached inconsistent findings around what sources, namely the high credible versus low credible sources, would lead to high perceived credibility of the online health information. A collective of empirical studies were synthesized to get an explanation of the conflict findings. Analysis of 22 effect sizes with 1,346 participants indicated that source credibility had no significant overall influence on the perceived information credibility (r=.03, n.s.). However, the variances across the studies suggested that the platform where the information was posted might be a contingent factor. Specifically, when the user-generated health information was posted on a common website, high credible sources were significantly related to high perceived information credibility. Whereas, low credible sources may directionally go to high information credibility when the platforms were blogs or discussion boards, but the relationship was not statistically significant.",User-Generated Content Effects,Communication and Technology
2015-1346,2015,Paper Session,User-Generated Opinion: How Reader Reactions and Source Reputation Influence the Effects of Online News,3,"On contemporary online news sites, readers are simultaneously exposed to journalistic articles and social reactions toward these messages. Two online experiments (N = 252) addressed whether negative user reactions (competent comments vs. incompetent comments vs. statistical rating) can attenuate the persuasive influence of the main article, and whether these effects depend on the reputation of the original source (high vs. low). Results showed a selective consideration of user-generated content: Readers took into account competent comments and aggregate ratings of a credible website but did not follow others' opinions if the comments merely contained subjective evaluations. On less reputable websites, user reactions were less influential regarding readers' attitudes. This interaction between source reputation and user-generated reactions demonstrates the interplay of multiple sources on participatory websites. Theoretical and practical implications for online journalism and the quality of online deliberation are discussed.",User-Generated Content Effects,Communication and Technology
