2016-0000,2016,Paper Session,A Longitudinal Analysis of Gaming- and Non-Gaming-Related Friendships and Social Support Among Social Online Game Players,5,"Online play is often the focus of research when discussing the potential negative consequences of video game use. One concern is that playing with people online contributes to the displacement of offline relationships and, thus, has detrimental effects on users’ social capital outcomes. However, until today there is little empirical evidence for these causal effects. The current study presents a longitudinal analysis on the associations between gaming- and non-gaming-related friendships and bonding social capital outcomes (as measured by social support) among a representative sample of social online players. Our results show that engaging in online game play with offline contacts has significant and positive cross-sectional associations with users’ perceived social support. Playing with individuals from an online context was not found to have any relationships with social support; neither on the cross-sectional nor on the longitudinal level. Thus, we found no evidence for the Displacement Hypothesis among social online players.",Wanna Join? Teams and Clans in Games,Game Studies
2016-0001,2016,Paper Session,Methodological Considerations in the Study of Tandem Play,4,"This paper presents a detailed discussion of the research methods used in the first part of our ongoing study into “tandem play,” which we have defined as “two or more players engag[ing] with a single-player game together, moving through the game with a variety of potential motives.” Tandem play can take many forms, but the emphasis is on a collaborative, shared experience. Although this phenomenon is as old as video games our research into it is the first, and so we had to design our study from the ground-up. In this paper we discuss four aspects of the study—the choice of game subjects would play, recruitment strategy, our roles as researchers, and the effects of the study having a limited time—and how these decisions impacted our results.",Wanna Join?

2016-0002,2016,Paper Session,Name On! Identity and Naming Practices in Massively Multiplayer Online Games,3,"RESEARCH PAPER
As a unit of analysis, names can provide rich insight into player-avatar identities in Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). This paper reports on a study of naming practices of 1,723 avatar names based on names from 597 players in more than 30 MMOGs, including RIFT, World of Warcraft and Eve Online. All avatar names were qualitatively coded, and then analyzed based on conventional naming practices for first names in Indo-European languages. Our dataset is unique in that it tracked players across multiple games, providing us with the opportunity to examine whether and how naming practices travel across multiple virtual worlds. Furthermore, we have lab-based observational data of 76 RIFT players customizing their avatar’s appearance and then selecting their avatar’s name, which gives us insight into the time and effort players take when choosing their avatar names.",Wanna Join?

2016-0003,2016,Paper Session,Ping to Win? Nonverbal Communication and Team Performance in Competitive Online Multiplayer Games,3,"Non-verbal communication plays a large role in online competitive multiplayer games, as team members attempt to coordinate with each other without distraction to achieve victory. Some games enable this communication through “pings,” alerts that are easy to activate and provide auditory and visual cues for teammates. In this paper, we review the literature on gestures and non-verbal communication and, through an empirical analysis of 84,489 players across 10,293 matches in the popular game, League of Legends, illustrate ping use in multiplayer games and test the impact of ping actions on performance in teams. We show that the amount of pings depends on player role and in-game activity and that pings by players have a positive but concave relationship with player performance. These ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of non-verbal communication and interruption on the performance of virtual teams. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for theorizing and designing sociotechnical systems that rely on users to engage in synchronous, collaborative work in shared visual spaces.",Wanna Join?

2016-0004,2016,Paper Session,Role Choices in Transitory and Established Teams: An Analysis of the Conventionality of Role Choices Within a Team-Based Online Game,2,"The present study examines differences in role choices team members made within a team-based online game. It compares the conventionality of team composition choices based on whether players compete with and against established teams of known players or whether they queue for the battle with complete strangers. The data of over 150,000 matches played within the online game DOTA2 shows that players who compete with and against strangers as part of transitory teams
are experimenting less with different playable characters and roles. These transitory teams also feature more conventional combinations of characters as compared to established teams of players who frequently play together. As a possible explanation, transactive memory systems serving as substitutes for conventional and static team roles are discussed. While static team roles are described as leading to less creativity, transactive memory systems could provide an alternative that leaves room for unconventional strategies.",Wanna Join?

2016-0005,2016,Paper Session,National Narratives Within a Global Media Framing?,3,"This paper presents theoretical and conceptual considerations about narratives and frames followed by an empirical analysis. Six distinct research questions specifically deal with the degree of narrativity of news coverage, story types, narrative roles, issue frames as well as explaining factors for the specific choice of a certain story type. We investigate these aspects by conducting a comparative quantitative content analysis of the newspaper coverage in five democratic countries during four UN climate change conferences. Within the transnational setting of these events, we expect that different levels of influence (transnational vs. national) would determine the constitution of the coverage in each country. We argue that issue frames tend more towards convergence while narrations are more related to the cultural context and particularities of the countries. Our results support this assumption to a certain degree, showing that while issue frames do not differ much across countries, narratives more often reflect cultural resonance.","News as Text: Narrative, Myth, and Exemplars",Journalism Studies
2016-0006,2016,Paper Session,Temporal Layers in News Narratives,2,"This article proposes a nuanced analysis of the temporal spectrum in news narratives, beyond the three conventional temporal orientations (past-present-future), thus affording a more complex understanding of journalism and its varied storytelling patterns. Combining qualitative and quantitative content analysis of print and online news items in the U.S. and Israel, this framework is used to evaluate and compare different journalistic cultures and media technologies in relation to public time. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis, the article offers a definition for ""news"" which associates between five clusters of temporal layers and different journalistic roles: updating (present and immediate past/future), reporting (recent past), contextualization and ritualistic functions (mid-range to distant past), analysis (near future), and projection (far/conjectured future).","News as Text: Narrative, Myth, and Exemplars",Journalism Studies
2016-0007,2016,Paper Session,The News as Myth: Representing the Chinese Stock Market Crisis of 2015,1,"The tumults in China’s stock market in the summer of 2015 riveted the international news media, which converged to speculate on the events' significance for the Chinese real economy and China's unorthodox adoption of market capitalism mixed with command-style economics. Stock markets, however, rarely signify by themselves – to be able to see causality, sequence and high-order significations in the stock exchange's activities and numbers is to find meanings in representation beyond what is manifestly part of the represented incident. That non-literal meanings appear self-evident to producers and consumers of the news indicates the operation of mythical meanings in the text, fulfilling Barthes’s (2012) famous prediction that no language production is safe from myth. The textual analysis of news about the Chinese stock market shows the linguistic and semiological processes that operated in the text to transform stock market news into myths about the perils of betraying free-market principles.","News as Text: Narrative, Myth, and Exemplars",Journalism Studies
2016-0008,2016,Paper Session,The Dilemmas of Using Exemplars in News Reporting,3,"In this paper, we suggest that the use of exemplars in news reports entails a dilemma for journalists. Ordinary people are included to illustrate abstract issues in a vivid and concrete way, which is supposed to make the news more engaging and comprehensible. However, the use of such exemplars appears to be at odds with the professional goal of reporting news in an impartial way. The research goal of our study is twofold; first, to explore how exposure to exemplars affects audience perceptions of news items; second to understand how the use of exemplars affects the audience’s opinion about the political issue at hand. To answer these questions we fielded two experimental studies based on representative population samples. Both studies show that the use of exemplars affects audience evaluations of the news reporting and, to a certain degree, political attitudes. These effects, however, are contingent on the deservingness of the included exemplars.","News as Text: Narrative, Myth, and Exemplars",Journalism Studies
2016-0009,2016,Paper Session,Enlivening Illustration or Public Opinion? An Analysis of Vox Pop Statements in Political Television News,1,"Interviews with the common man or woman in the street are proven to influence audience judgments such as perceived public opinion and own opinion. However, little is known about the content of these vox pop interviews. We address this gap in current research by analyzing these vox pop statements with a specific focus on their role in political news. We conducted an in-depth content analysis of 2,000 vox pops in Flemish television news next to a more general analysis of all vox pop interviews from the period 2003-2013 (N=18,715). The findings of this paper show that vox pops are used as a tool to represent public opinion in half of the news items. In political news items they are used significantly more to represent opinions. However, the opinions shown through vox pops are unbalanced, the large majority of news items shows only one point of view using vox pops.","News as Text: Narrative, Myth, and Exemplars",Journalism Studies

The role of randomization in cancer clinical trials is one such example because patients must understand their illness as well as the role of experimental design in order to provide informed consent to participate. The current study reports on the findings from a nationally representative study comparing the effectiveness of different message strategies for explaining randomization (N = 533). Results of a hierarchical regression analyses demonstrate surprising problems associated with the use of plain language strategies for explaining randomization to cancer patients, while the effects of metaphorical message strategies on comprehension, negative affect, and behavioral intentions to participate in RCTs were mixed. Implications for communication theory and practice are discussed.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0011,2016,Paper Session,It Just Makes Me Feel Better: The Creation and Validation of the Mood-Based Indoor Tanning Scale (MITS),7,"Recent research indicates that mood-based motivations may be an important predictor of indoor tanning bed use, and may be related to indoor tanning addiction. Problematically, little measurement research has been conducted to develop a psychometric measure of mood-based tanning motivations. Thus, the current study seeks to develop and assess the mood-based indoor tanning scale (MITS). Two studies were conducted to identify and verify the MITS factor structure as well as assess construct validity. Results revealed that the MITS is a powerful predictor of indoor tanning intentions and behavior, results from the national sample suggest that a one-point increase in the MITS measure corresponds with using indoor tanning beds eleven more times in the past year. These findings suggest that the MITS can be used by behavioral researchers and practitioners to assess the extent to which mood-based motivations impact indoor tanning bed use.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0012,2016,Paper Session,Multilevel Factors Associated With Cervical Cancer Screening Among Latinas,7,"Despite calls for more ecological approaches to cancer prevention, past efforts have focused primarily on individual level factors. This study examined the barriers and facilitators to compliance with Pap test guidelines across individual, interpersonal, and community levels of influence. We conducted a face-to-face survey of Latinas by recruiting from local clinics and community sites. Participants were classified as compliant or not compliant with Pap test guidelines. We grouped 1,150 participants into 25 geographic neighborhood clusters. Neither knowledge nor positive attitudes toward Pap testing were predictive of compliance. However, having health insurance, lower acculturation to the U.S., and self-efficacy were positively associated with compliance. Likewise, talking to more network contacts about Pap testing was associated with compliance. Living in a community with a strongly integrated communication network was positively associated with compliance among new residents only. Our study suggests the importance of incorporating more interpersonal and community-level measures into predictive models.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication

Following social cognitive theory, we posit that a self-efficacy manipulation will affect subjects’ behavioral intentions and emotions. Results indicate that those in the high efficacy condition show greater behavioral intention to receive a Pap smear and the HPV vaccine, and higher levels of hope than those in the low efficacy condition. The implications for the role of self-efficacy as a message factor in the context of medical drama viewing are discussed.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0014,2016,Paper Session,This is How We Cope: Using PhotoVoice With Parents of Pediatric Cancer Patients,1,"This study examines the difficulties, and communicative strategies of parents of children diagnosed with pediatric cancer. Through the use of PhotoVoice – an approach that provides participants an active engagement in the production of data through photography – twelve parent participants captured photographic representations of what they believed helped them cope. The photo narration results revealed that coping strategies focused on communicating about difficulties faced from the public such as public ignorance and their children receiving increased attention for looking “different.” Results also focused on the healthy siblings; including involving them in social activities to help them receive attention that the parents could not readily provide. Emphasizing play through dolls and tricycles helped not only the children with pediatric cancer, but their parents as well. In addition, being a proactive parent through the use of calendars to record treatment dates, medicine administration and appointments, and keeping their faith, helped parents cope.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0015,2016,Paper Session,Hashtag This! Tagging and Searching Motives,4,"Due to increasing usage and influence of hashtags, a growing number of social networking sites (SNSs) now provide hashtag services. The objective of this study was to identify common motivations of using hashtag among users of two SNSs (Instagram and Twitter). An online panel survey was conducted with 433 hashtag users, including 220 Instagram users and 213 Twitter users. The results suggest that Instagram and Twitter users have four primary social and psychological motives for hashtag tagging: social approval, self-expression, entertainment seeking, and convenience. In addition, the findings show that they have another set of four primary motives for hashtag searching: information seeking, issue seeking, user seeking, and entertainment seeking. Differences in motivation of using hashtag were examined according to platform and gender. The implications of the study findings and areas for future research are discussed.","Hashtags, Tweets, and Instagram",Communication and Technology
2016-0016,2016,Paper Session,Interaction and Influence on Twitter: A Content Analytic Comparison of User Types on Five Topics,4,"The internet and social media in particular have led to a change in the structure of the public sphere in comparison to traditional mass media. On the internet citizens have the possibility to participate in public discourse and bypass media in order to directly interact with each other as well as with spokespersons and political representatives. The question of the type of interaction, the strength of influence, and possible topic specific differences however, remains unclear. We conducted a content analysis of the user type, form of interaction, retweeting and linking practices in 17,629 tweets on five topics and found topic-specific differences in the interaction between media, spokespersons and citizens. Overall, media still hold an important role in information flow and are linked to and retweeted most often by all user types. However, in crisis situations citizens’ messages also find uptake.","Hashtags, Tweets, and Instagram",Communication and Technology
2016-0017,2016,Paper Session,Pace of Life in Cities and the Emergence of Town Tweeters,3,"This paper examines whether Twitter users in larger American cities tweet at a faster rate than their counterparts in smaller American cities. Contrary to how telephony usage and productivity scale superlinearly with city population, the total volume of tweets in cities scales sublinearly. When looking at individuals, however, greater population density is associated with faster tweeting. The discrepancy between the ecological correlation and individual behavior is resolved by noting that larger cities have sublinear growth in the number of active Twitter users. This suggests there is a more concentrated core of more active users that serve an information broadcast function for larger cities, an emerging social group of ‘town tweeters’ as it were, following in the tradition of town criers. Additionally, the timing interval distribution of users’ tweets follow heavy-tailed distributions, indicating they tend to tweet in rapid-fire succession at points in the day rather than at regularly timed intervals.","Hashtags, Tweets, and Instagram",Communication and Technology
2016-0018,2016,Paper Session,Social Comparison as the Thief of Joy: Emotional Consequences of Viewing Strangers’ Instagram Posts,5,"From a social comparison perspective, others’ positive posts on social media are expected to negatively affect viewers’ emotions. From an emotional contagion perspective, others’ positive posts should positively affect viewers’ emotions. The current lab experiment pitches the social comparison and emotional contagion perspectives against each other while taking into account individual differences. Individuals were randomized to either view no posts, positive posts (selfies), or neutral posts (selfies) from strangers on Instagram. In support of the social comparison perspective, individuals who tend to engage in social comparison reported lower positive affect if they had viewed the positive posts. In support of the emotion contagion perspective, individuals who do not often engage in social comparison reported higher positive affect if they had viewed the positive posts. These findings indicate that individual differences in processing tendencies lead people to respond to social information on social media in opposite ways.","Hashtags, Tweets, and Instagram",Communication and Technology
2016-0019,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Two Journalistic Practices in Reporting Conflicting Health-Related Scientific Evidence on Journalists' and Scientists' Credibility,1,"This study investigated the effects of two journalistic practices on journalists' and scientists' credibility when conflicting health-related scientific evidence is reported. The two practices were presentation format (one-story format vs. two-story format) and hedging (reporting study limitations vs. not reporting study limitations). When conflicting findings are reported, journalists can use either one-story format, using one story to report the conflict, or two-story format, using two stories with each story representing one side of the conflict. Hedging is one practice journalists use when they decide to report limitations of scientific studies. An online experiment (N = 290) found that one-story format (vs. two-story format) increased journalists' competence but decreased scientists' competence, which suggests a competence transfer between journalists and scientists, and the transfer depended on people's news reading frequency.",Science and Discourse Studies in Health Communication,Health Communication

2016-0021,2016,Paper Session,Perceived Conflict of Interest in Health Science Partnerships,6,"University scientists conducting research on topics of potential health concern often want to partner with a range of actors, including government, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. Such partnerships can provide access to needed resources, including funding. However, those who observe such partnerships may make judgements based on who is involved. The current study seeks to assess how people perceive two hypothetical health science research collaborations. In doing so, it also tests the utility of using procedural justice theory to assess perceptions of research legitimacy. Findings suggest that including an industry collaborator has clear negative repercussions for how people see a research partnership and that these perceptions shape peoples’ willingness to see the research as a legitimate source of knowledge. Additional research aimed at further communicating procedures that might mitigate the impact of industry collaboration is suggested.",Science and Discourse Studies in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0022,2016,Paper Session,The Discursive and Political Function of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Within the Neoliberal Global Moment,1,"The concept of mental illness bears with it a complex of political, social, and global problematics. This work argues that the articulation of neoliberal governmentality with the biomedical approach to trauma within the psychiatric discipline, which manifests in the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yields a depolitical understanding of trauma. Postcolonial theories offer a unique means by which we may reimagine the discourse of PTSD. I examine the diagnostic discourse within psychiatry that locates concepts of mental illness within the individual, but with an aim toward viewing it as a discourse and set of phenomena that erupt along the faultlines of systemic, global tensions. If neoliberal governance requires the tyranny of individual responsibility, and if the concept of mental illness is one persistently constructed within and beyond the psychiatric discipline as a problem of the individual subject, I contend that PTSD is better conceptualized as an emergent and discursive phenomenon.",Science and Discourse Studies in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0023,2016,Paper Session,Viewing Power and Organisational Transparency in Eldercare Through Foucault’s Heterotopic Mirror,2,"Research has recently recognised that transparency practices are not ethical in and of themselves but are representational practices through which social actors struggle in the contexts of power. We extend critical work on transparency by discussing a photographic essay of aged-care workers in rest homes which intended to make aged-care work more visible and valued. While the photographs were meant to enable viewers to look into the daily reality of aged-care work, we show the visual essay instead acted as a heterotopic hall of mirrors, obscuring labor value to those unfamiliar with it, distant from it, and without insight. We argue organizational transparency needs to be understood as a practice of looking in relation to spatial practices of power. In this case, the politics of space and place obscured the images which attempted to present an authentic and transparent account of the reality of care-giving work.",Science and Discourse Studies in Health Communication,Health Communication

This phenomenon is sweeping through journalism. This study focuses on AI-news writers and the psychological responses they elicit from readers. To advance theory in Communication and HCI our goal was to examine the effects of AI-news writers, determine what psychological mechanisms underlie those effects, and test if the theory Computers are Social Actors (CASA) extends to AI-writers. A 2 (writer: human vs. AI) x 2 (authority: low vs. high) x 3 (topic) between-subjects experiment revealed that (1) AI-writer as source affects credibility judgments, and the effects vary by message topic [human writer preferred in health news, AI-writer preferred in financial news]. (2) AI-writer induced eeriness was a significant mediator of writer trust and message quality in health news, and (3) supporting CASA predictions, authority cue effects were consistent for human and AI-writers.",Perceived Credibility Online,Communication and Technology

Using a 2×2×2 design, we varied the article topic (sports, finance; within-subjects) and both the articles’ actual and declared source (human-written, computer-written; between subjects). 986 subjects rated two articles on credibility, readability, and journalistic expertise. Varying the declared source had small but consistent effects: subjects rated articles declared as human-written always more favorably, regardless of the actual source. Varying the actual source had larger effects: subjects rated computer-written articles as more credible and higher in journalistic expertise but less readable. Across topics, subjects’ perceptions did not differ. The results provide conservative estimates for the favorability of computer-written news, which will further increase over time, and endorse prior calls for establishing ethics of computer-written news.",Perceived Credibility Online,Communication and Technology
2016-0026,2016,Paper Session,Networks in the Eyes of the Beholder: The Influence of Cognitive Social Networks on Information Credibility Perception and Sharing Likelihood in Social Media,1,"Implicit in prior research is the assumption that any judgment about the credibility of information is made in an individualistic and socially isolated fashion. This assumption is no longer tenable in the social media environment wherein people are exposed to a great deal of information, which is selectively fed to them by others with whom they have relationships. The current study attempts to examine how the assessment of the credibility of information and the intentions to share information vary depending on the subjective perceptions of individuals regarding local online social networks, known as the cognitive social network. Between-subjects analysis based on a 2 (information source expertise) x 2 (cognitive network centrality) x 2 (cognitive network homophily) shows that the manner in which people assess and share information in the social media environment is partly a function of how they make sense of their personal networks.",Perceived Credibility Online,Communication and Technology
2016-0027,2016,Paper Session,Ranking Versus Reputation: Perception and Effects of Search Results’ Credibility,2,"Search engines play a key role for Internet users. The vast majority of users are heavily influenced by the given ranking on the search engine results page (SERP). Only few users select search results that are not on top of the SERP. However, this does not mean that the validity or credibility of the information or the website are not evaluated by the users. Therefore, this study (N = 222) examined the influence of ranking and credibility cues on the evaluation and selection of search engine results. Apart from the ranking on the SERP, two credibility cues, the sponsor of the website and the information source mentioned in the search result, were varied. As expected, participants’ selection was mainly influenced by the ranking. However, the credibility cues had a strong influence on the perception of the search results.

This paper focuses on national news producers, Internet natives, and the comparatively understudied local and regional press in the United Kingdom, and identifies viral news as a potential avenue for new and sustained competition between these groups. The paper evaluates the historical strengths and weaknesses of three groups of news producers (local and regional, national and international, and internet native sources), and develops three competing hypotheses for viral success. To test these hypotheses, I present and analyse data collected during the 2015 General Election campaign that specifically measures viral velocity. There is support for the continued success of the national press as well as opportunities for Internet natives, but the continued economic success and community ties of the regional and local press has not translated into viral news success.","Digital Media, Elections, and Politics",Communication and Technology
2016-0031,2016,Paper Session,Self-Motivated or Mobilized: Political Participation in a Digital Age,2,"This paper explores the patterns of political participation offline and online and, using data from an online survey of UK respondents, seeks to determine the extent that internal motivations (personal gratifications), external motivations (self-efficacy) are factors which influence these patterns. Additionally we determine whether communication via social media from political parties, campaign organisations or friends have a mediating influence on motivations. Our data suggests that there remains a divide between the online and offline spheres of participation, there are also divisions over who participates within each sphere, although the demographic variables are diminishing in their explanatory power. Largely internal motivations, relating to personal feelings have the greatest explanatory power, though external motivations are not insignificant in the offline sphere. However encouragements, particularly from campaign organisations, have a strong mediating effect. Encouragements from friends have a lower impact while political parties appear to struggle to mobilize their supporters reflecting a general trend away from engagement in electoral politics.","Digital Media, Elections, and Politics",Communication and Technology

One promising approach in this context could be the use of personal communication strategies which portray the politician as a private person and allow insights into daily activities. An online experiment (N=295) tested the impact of a private Facebook status update (vs. a more formal political posting) on recipients’ evaluation of the politician, parasocial interaction and voting intention. Furthermore, gender, degree of familiarity and party affiliation of politicians were varied. Results showed that the reception of a private status update leads to more positive outcomes in recipients’ perception than the political statement, a more intensive parasocial interaction, and an evaluation of the politician as trustworthy, which positively affects voting intention. Recommendations for the usage of social media for purposes of political communication as well as theoretical implications are discussed.","Digital Media, Elections, and Politics",Communication and Technology

Such coverage is often criticized for sensationalizing or over-simplifying the issue(s). However, little research has analyzed the limitations in which journalists reporting on human rights abuses often work. This study uses news coverage of sex trafficking as a case study for human rights reporting. A series of qualitative interviews with journalists in Thailand that have written about sex trafficking revealed a unique relationship between the Thai government and the press based on government corruption, a lack of press freedom and a one-way flow of information from police to journalists.

2016-0036,2016,Paper Session,Al Qaeda in the American Consciousness: Communicative Construction of the Terrorist Actor Through Attribute Framing,3,"The media play a significant role in the transmission and construction of how we understand terrorism, the organizations that employ and respond to it and the threat it entails. Terrorism is not only constituted by the violence of its action, but also the social construction of the action in its aftermath. We argue that framing theory serves as a useful lens for understanding the communicative constitution of the terrorist actor, providing deeper insight into the core questions of terrorism studies. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of framing theory for studying the terrorist actor by explicating the attribute frames used by journalists when constructing a meaningful understanding of al Qaeda and its actions. We then discuss the implications arising from the differential use of these attribute frames, and how these different framing techniques influence our ability to adequately conceptualize and respond to the global terrorism threat.","Contention, Terrorism, and Media",Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0037,2016,Paper Session,Are Good Characters Better for Us? The Effect of Morality Salience on Entertainment Selection and Recovery Outcomes,2,"Using mood management, social comparison, and recovery theories as a framework, two experiments examined whether one’s moral self-perception affects the selection of content featuring characters with varying levels of morality (study 1), and whether exposure to different character types results in any recovery benefits (study 2). Study 1 found that individuals whose vices were made salient were more likely to select films featuring good characters than were those whose virtues were made salient. Study 2 found that individuals whose moral self-perceptions were threatened relaxed and psychologically detached more after reading stories featuring good and morally ambiguous characters (MACs) than after reading a bad character story, whereas those whose moral self-perceptions were bolstered experienced an equal level of recovery benefits regardless of character type. Findings thus indicate that morality salience affects both the selection of content and the recovery outcomes one experiences after media exposure.",Audience Connections to Characters,Mass Communication
2016-0038,2016,Paper Session,Story Perspective and Character Similarity as Drivers of Identification and Narrative Persuasion,3,"Identification with a character is an important mechanism of narrative persuasion. In two studies, the impact of character similarity on identification was pitted against that of story perspective. Participants read stories in which a lawyer (Study 1) and a General Practitioner (Study 2) had a conflict with another character. Perspective was manipulated by describing the events as experienced and narrated by the lawyer (GP) or by their opponent. In Study 1 (N = 120), 60 participants were Law students, in Study 2 (N = 120) 60 were Medical students. Both Perspective and Study Program influenced identification which mediated the impact of perspective on attitude. If participants felt highly similar to the professional’s opponent, the mediating effect of identification was blocked.",Audience Connections to Characters,Mass Communication
2016-0039,2016,Paper Session,The Virtues and Vices of Social Comparisons: Examining Assimilative and Contrastive Emotional Reactions to Media Characters,2,"Based on social comparison theory, this study investigates how awareness of one’s morality or immorality and exposure to a character in a narrative affect emotions associated with four distinct types of social comparisons − upward assimilative, downward contrastive, upward contrastive, and downward assimilative. Findings of a 2 (Morality Salience: virtue, vice) X 2 (Character: moral, immoral) experiment (N = 106) revealed that those whose vices were made salient elicited stronger: 1) contempt (a downward contrastive emotion) toward an immoral character than a moral character, and 2) envy (an upward contrastive emotion) toward a moral character than an immoral character. Whereas envy toward the character decreased positive affect, contempt toward the character increased it. Implications for assimilative and contrastive social comparisons with media characters that lead to desirable or undesirable affective outcomes for viewers are discussed.",Audience Connections to Characters,Mass Communication
2016-0040,2016,Paper Session,Why Do We Like Morally Ambiguous Characters? Attributions Impact on Character Appeal,6,"Researchers examining the popular appeal of narratives featuring morally ambiguous characters have questioned the ability of affective disposition theory (ADT; Zillmann, 2000) to explain why audiences like these characters even when they do bad things. The current paper replicates and extends a recent study by Bowman, Roman, and Knoster (2014) to determine whether the causal attributions that audience members make for a protagonists bad behavior can explain audience responses. Bowman et al. (2014) examined how the origin story (which provides background on the protagonist) of a morally ambiguous character can influence audience dispositions toward the character. Using logic from attribution theory, the present study tests the proposition that the consistency of behaviors in narrative entertainment will shape the attributions made by audience members which will mediate the behaviors’ influence on character appeal.",Audience Connections to Characters,Mass Communication

Stereotype Threat, Selective Exposure, Media Effects & Math Performance",2,"This study examined women’s media selections when under the gender-math stereotype threat and the subsequent media effects on their mathematics performance. The results provided support for the selection pattern predicted by the SESAM model in favor of mood management theory, and support for the effect pattern predicted by the upward comparison threat in favor of the SESAM model. Women were more likely to select career magazines featuring successful female role models when threatened by the gender-math stereotype; however, this selective exposure decreased instead of improved their math performance. The theoretical and practical implications of this finding, as well as the potential for media use to be employed as a naturalistic and effective method to reduce stereotype threat were discussed.",Media Psychology and the Study of Gender-Related Issues,Mass Communication
2016-0042,2016,Paper Session,"Idealized Female Beauty, Social Comparisons, and Awareness Intervention Material: Evidence for Preventive Effects in Young Women",3,"Previous research indicates that exposure to the idealized thin media standard of female beauty can contribute to body dissatisfaction, negative self-perception, depressed mood, and disordered eating. Importantly, studies have revealed that social comparison processes underlie this negative media effect: Women routinely compare themselves with the encountered mass-mediated thin ideals which, in turn, elicits negative consequences. While there are a multitude of studies on this topic, little is known about how this negative effect can be counteracted. We tested whether watching an awareness intervention video highlighting the artificial nature of mass-mediated idealized female beauty reduces social comparison processes in a subsequent situation. As a replication of previous research, we found that exposure to the awareness intervention material reduced social comparison processes. As a supplement, analysis revealed that this effect was mediated through a change in the ideal self: Watching the awareness material elicited a more realistic perception of what specific body individuals ideally wanted to possess. This more realistic ideal-self standard, in turn, reduced social comparison processes.",Media Psychology and the Study of Gender-Related Issues,Mass Communication

It studies the efforts group members generate to distinguish their group from people who are not considered group members. This study compared two online groups—one for Israeli voluntary childless women and another for Israeli women with fertility issues. Quantitative content analysis of two online support forums—one for voluntarily childless and the other for infertile Israeli women—and in-depth interviews with childless women were used to address the study’s research question. Results elucidate that the type of stigma—rather than simply being stigmatized—played an important role in online boundary work of each online group. Findings suggest that unlike in face-to-face support groups with defined physical boundaries, online communication among stigmatized creates challenges to group identity and stigma management.",Media Psychology and the Study of Gender-Related Issues,Mass Communication

However, others argue that violent women who violate traditional gender roles, leads to the public evaluating them more harshly than men. Over 900 adults read news stories that featured either a woman abusing a man or a man abusing a woman, then evaluated criminal suspects. Women showed in-group favoritism towards criminal suspects that matched their gender. Men did not show preference for their in-group. Overall, men and women participants were more likely to believe the crime was justified, have more sympathy for the criminal suspect, assign less jail time, and have more positive attitude towards the suspect when the criminal suspect was female vis-à-vis male.

News articles of the shooting of Trayvon Martin were used as stimuli, since the news stories touched on two different social issues, racism and gun-control. These stimuli were manipulated in the headline and issue order. The results showed that news evaluation, intention to share and reinforcement assessment were dependent on the level of racial attitudes. Those high in color-blind racial attitudes had a significantly lower news evaluation, intention to share, and reinforcement assessment, compared to those low in color-blind racial attitudes. The implications of the findings are discussed in light of the social identity theory.",Selective News Exposure and Political Opinions,Political Communication
2016-0046,2016,Paper Session,Self-Categorization Theory: An Alternative Way to Test News Effects On Polarized Opinion,2,"Two experiments tested whether exposure to partisan conflict-framed news polarizes news consumers along party lines. Both self-categorization theory and theories of motivated reasoning were used as complementary theoretical frameworks. Path analyses using SEM showed that Democrats and Republicans exposed to partisan conflict-framed news thought their party held more extreme positions on a disputed issue and by assimilating to this exaggerated in-party position attitude polarization occurred. The meditational role of perceived validity of the arguments was less robust. The findings were consistent across different samples. The unique contribution of the present study is applying group decision-making processes in testing media effects on attitude polarization and introducing self-categorization theory as an additional explanatory mechanism, which links news exposure and political polarization. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.",Selective News Exposure and Political Opinions,Political Communication
2016-0047,2016,Paper Session,"Social Not Ideological: Political Social Identity, Social Polarization and Selective Exposure",1,"Politics is not only about beliefs and ideology; it also encapsulates components of social identity. Thus, this study examines consumption of partisan media via the prism of social-identity theory. Strength of political identity is suggested as an explanation for selective exposure (preference for likeminded media content) and the social influences of such exposure is outlined. Mainly, the study focuses on social polarization as it is manifested in stereotypic perception of and social distance from proponents of opposite ideology and the distribution of media content through social networks. Two survey experiments were conducted to test the association between strength of political identity and media choices, as well as the effect of media choice on social polarization (N = 300). Each experiment focused on one element of partisan media: the political identity of the website’s audience and the identity of the writer, respectively. Both experiments demonstrated that political social identity influences media selection. Moreover, evidence was found supporting the social polarization hypothesis whereby consumption of likeminded media increases all three elements of social polarization. The results are discussed in the context of media-effects theory in general and selective exposure in particular, with focus on networked consumption.",Selective News Exposure and Political Opinions,Political Communication
2016-0048,2016,Paper Session,When Party and Issue Preferences Clash: Selective Exposure and Attitudinal Depolarization,1,"Preference-driven selective exposure does not always reinforce existing party and issue preferences. Because voters and parties are unlikely to agree on all issues, preference-driven selective exposure at the information selection stage can expose voters to counterattitudinal information. When party and issue preferences clash, voters are forced to reconcile this mismatch. Instead of polarization, existing preferences can weaken. These propositions were tested with data from an information board experiment. Participants encountered information about five parties and 13 issues in the form of short headlines that could be selected for further reading. The results suggest (1) that selective exposure for both preferred parties and issues is prevalent and exposes voters to a mix of consonant and dissonant information, (2) that most voters require additional cognitive resources to process counterattitudinal information, and (3) that issue position congruency of participants and parties affects the extremity of party evaluations and the confidence in vote decisions.",Selective News Exposure and Political Opinions,Political Communication

And yet, the study of rhetoric as a discipline, and as an instrument of strategic communication, has remained essentially in the hands of theorists and critics; the importance overshadowed by short-term, profit-driven thinking. Consequently, the powerful roles that dialogue and rhetoric can potentially play in constructing future-oriented messages have been largely overlooked. Using The Long Now as a case study, this article argues that integrating dialogue and rhetoric into strategic planning allows public relations professionals to develop compelling visions, long-term and sustainable relationships, and shift the focus from short-term gain to more future-oriented messaging.

The research concludes that the achievement of communication that demonstrates these principles is challenged and constrained by situational forces. As a result, the combination of participants’ attitudes to each other and to the process of dialogue required to operationalize the principles is unattainable in practice.

This paper draws from literature on public relations framing, issue arenas and multimodal discourse and reports detailed explorations of qualitative data retrieved from two websites, Protect Mauna Kea and Maunakea and TMT, which frame the Thirty Meter Telescope’s construction on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii from alternative perspectives. The empirical evidence suggests that by connecting the respective issue and related issues to specific concerns, values and beliefs in novel ways, the challengers and powerholders (Steinberg, 1998) attempt to monitor the way in which the issue is understood by existing and potentially supporting groups. The findings also illustrate how the qualitative methodological approach characteristic of discourse analysis can be employed in order to reveal dynamic framing strategies.",The Power of Dialogue in Public Relations,Public Relations

Guided by framing theory and regulatory focus theory, the present study content analyzes each sentence of twelve U.S. and British mainstream news organizations’ social media guidelines (N = 635) to examine how they introduce the new outlets to journalists. In specific, this study investigates whether the current social media environment is framed as an opportunity to take advantage of or as a risk to tighten guard against. The results indicate that news organizations dominantly frame the new environment a risk to journalists’ and news organizations’ reputations. The guidelines focused on warning against harming their reputations and journalism norms such as accuracy and objectivity (prevention-focused), rather than guiding on how to make good use of social media and maximize the benefits (promotion-focused).

Results indicate that local news organizations in the U.S. mainly used Twitter as an additional platform for news dissemination. While local TV stations and newspapers differed significantly in their use of tweet structures, content, and strategies, both followed the similar practices of their traditional media portals. In addition, the number of followers and total tweets of a news organization’s Twitter account, use of photos, hashtags, usernames, and tweet content predicted audience engagement with the site.

A Comparative Study of Newspapers and Social Media in Japan, Korea, and Finland",2,"Based on media system dependency theory and social shaping of technology perspective, the present study compares how social media influence the production and distribution process of mainstream newspapers in three countries: Japan, Korea, and Finland. Three countries are chosen because they are one of the few countries that still maintain strong newspaper readership while having high penetration of new communication media, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media. The authors argue that the flow of stories across different levels (micro, meso, and macro levels) on social media blur boundaries between the mass and interpersonal communications. Interviews of mainstream newspapers in Japan, Korea, and Finland reveal that while the newspapers have technological affordances to utilize social media in their production and distribution process, they have not been able to actively incorporate social media due to social and media system factors such as mistrust and fear toward social media (Japan), the existence of major intermediary (Korea), and the lack of resources (Finland). The results from the three countries are compared in context of different social and media environments.

Specifically, we sought to determine if Nordic newspaper managers’ cultural ideals – constructed via a select group of personal values – differ by country, while testing whether personal values as a whole vary by nation. We also wanted to know the influence gender has regarding leadership decision-making preferences. Results showed no difference between male and female managers’ styles, suggesting that only some styles are gender-sensitive, while confirming the existence of a Nordic way of management. Although these newsroom managers recognized the 2007/2008 troubled industrial uncertainty for what it was (and continues to be), the results hinted that simply adding more women managers, varying management styles, or changing managers’ personal values won’t have much impact on what ails newspapers.",Inside Journalism Organizations,Media Industry Studies

In addition we discuss the role of lucky incidents and human capabilities in serendipity, and consider their value to creative processes in media work and media organizations.

Social support from family and friends may help individuals cope with the emotional hurt caused by such discrimination experiences. This study advances a theory about effective social support for coping with everyday discrimination by proposing two support message dimensions, person-centeredness and social-identity affirmation, and three mediational pathways through which these message dimensions influence support effectiveness: reappraisal, empathy, and reattribution. The theory is initially tested with a message perception study in which 785 adults (394 African-Americans and 391 Asians/Asian-Americans) evaluated one of 48 support messages in response to one of three everyday discrimination scenarios. As predicted, participants perceived highly person-centered and social-identity affirmation messages as more effective, which facilitated emotional improvement and enhanced collective self-esteem. Reappraisal and empathy mediated the influence of person-centered message on message effectiveness, while reattribution mediated the influence of social identity affirmation on message effectiveness.",Support and Coping in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

Participants (n = 27) engaged with a distressed confederate, who either disclosed very little about the source of their distress (implicit disclosure) or gave all of the details (explicit disclosure). Quantitative results showed that individuals who received that explicit problem disclosure reported that the conversation was more stressful, but were also more likely to approach (i.e. provide support) than participants who received the implicit disclosure. Approximately half of the participants in the implicit disclosure condition approached. Theme analysis of conversation content showed that support providers engaged in all levels of verbal person-centeredness and tended to follow a script for support. Content also varied by disclosure condition, such that individuals in the implicit condition tended to look for nonverbal cues that support was desired and individuals in the explicit condition were more likely to engage in strategies to limit conversation.",Support and Coping in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

A total of 414 international students from 76 countries responded to an online survey. Results indicated that in-person communication with host and SNS communication with home country significant others were related to increased perceived social support, which in turn, was positively associated with sociocultural adjustment and happiness, and negatively associated with depression. Moreover, SNS communication with home was directly associated with less sociocultural adjustment and greater depression. SNS communication with host was positively associated with the social dimension of sociocultural adjustment. In-person communication with home was positively associated with sociocultural adjustment. Overall, our results suggest that in-person communication was relatively more beneficial for international students. SNS might have opposing impacts on international students’ adjustment, specifically when used with home country significant others.",Support and Coping in Interpersonal Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

Extensive research shows that media tends to treat female athletes as stereotyped women or girls rather than athletes and give them secondary status as athletes. In addition, the media representation of female athletes is not constant, which could also be affected by nationalism and individualism. Textual analysis was conducted to explore how Chinese media constructed one elite athlete’s (Li Na) identity within the context of gender, nationalism and individualism during 2014 Australian Open. Research found that gender, in this case, was not the overriding device on media representation, and media tended to construct Li Na in masculine terms. Furthermore, individualism was strongly represented on media coverage, while the influence of nationalism had been decreasing. This shift of media representation of Chinese athletes could reflect the dramatic social change in China during the last thirty years.","Constructions and Contestations of Gender in Gaming, Retail Ads, Sports Coverage, Prison Dramas, and Pornography",Feminist Scholarship

This is framed in a broader study that proposes to analyze Chilean retail advertising and relate it to the cultural changes experimented by Chilean society from 1980 to date. Following socio-demographic characteristics and variables that have been historically tested in previous literature, we propose to look at the portrayal of women in order to determine whether or not this representation is based on stereotypical forms.
In general, the preliminary results show that Chile perpetuates some of the stereotypical forms of representation of women found in the international literature, although various indicators have determined that women should have a more equal status to men in Chilean society.","Constructions and Contestations of Gender in Gaming, Retail Ads, Sports Coverage, Prison Dramas, and Pornography",Feminist Scholarship

Using cultivation and the theory of gendered organizations, this research examined the medical discourse in the television prison dramas Orange is the New Black, Prison Break, and Prison Break: Final Break. Findings demonstrate that the lives of female inmates are profoundly shaped by institutional control over their health through restrictions of access, denial of care, the absence of intervention in violence, and the trivialization of mental illness. On the other hand, male inmates are able to manipulate and control the medical system within the prison, reinforcing notions of masculine dominance and power. Such depictions may reinforce stereotypes about prison violence, women’s fear of victimization, the acceptance of male and female rape myths, and the medicalization of the female body.","Constructions and Contestations of Gender in Gaming, Retail Ads, Sports Coverage, Prison Dramas, and Pornography",Feminist Scholarship

This study compares categories of internet pornography aimed at women (including Feminist and For Women) to Mainstream pornography, examining indicators of both sexual objectification and agency. Results suggest that Mainstream pornography contains significantly more depictions of female objectification than both Feminist and For Women content. There is an objectification gender gap between men and women in all categories, which is significantly wider in Mainstream content than in pornography aimed at women. Focusing on empowerment, queer Feminist pornography contained significantly more indicators of female sexual agency than both For Women and Mainstream categories, although primarily heterosexual Feminist pornography did not. Findings suggest that different categories of pornography provide women with different scripts related to sexual objectification, agency, and gender dynamics.","Constructions and Contestations of Gender in Gaming, Retail Ads, Sports Coverage, Prison Dramas, and Pornography",Feminist Scholarship

This article explores the ways in which moments of tension between women and communities self-identifying as FIG can be understood not through rigid conceptualizations of feminist waves but instead through generational differences that can shape approaches to both thought and action related to equality, equity, and diversity. Drawing on qualitative case studies researching feminist game-making organizations in Canada, we argue that such an understanding of generational approaches to feminism and gender-based action provides a lens by which to better understand the differences and symmetries that comprise intersections of gender (both cis and trans) with race, age, class, education, and other subject-positions. We also indicate how these moments of rupture can be linked to the corporate context underpinning FIG activism before indicating the radical potentialities for feminist praxis.","Constructions and Contestations of Gender in Gaming, Retail Ads, Sports Coverage, Prison Dramas, and Pornography",Feminist Scholarship

This article seeks to heed that call by delineating a discourse approach to the comparative study of media and politics. This discourse approach is introduced with reference to a formerly influential but recently stigmatized strand of research in the tradition of Four Theories of the Press by Siebert et al. (1956/1973), although it abandons and goes well beyond this work. To illustrate the benefits of such an approach, a case study of the media-politics discourse dominant in Russia in 2012/13 is presented.

As I will argue, to study ideology in the context of mediatized politics is not to study the survival or demise of some ‘grand’ belief systems but the potential of political discourse, as it is articulated through several media genres within specific socio-political contexts, to recontextualize symbolisms from the past serving the effective exercise of political power in the present. I will further illustrate this attempted revisionism by briefly examining three televised political advertisements, which I take as an example of mediatised politics, by the American Democratic party for the 2008 presidential election, by the British Conservative party for the 2010 general election and by the Greek Panhellenic Socialist Movement for the 2009 parliamentary election, respectively","Political Discourse, Ideology, and the Media",Political Communication
2016-0071,2016,Paper Session,Liberal Articulations of the 'Enlightenment' in the Greek Public Sphere,1,"The purpose of this article is to study the articulations and uses of the terms and idea of the Enlightenment by Greek, self-proclaimed ‘liberal’ pundits. The research draws on relevant articles published at two popular news/lifestyle websites, 'AthensVoice' and 'Protagon' during the years of the so-called 'Greek crisis'. I argue that the 'Enlightenment' is a nodal signifier of disciplinary discourses, where Greece's economic/social/political crises are viewed as mere symptoms that underline Greece’s fundamental crisis, which is the country's ‘lack of 'Enlightenment’. Critical discourse analysis informed by discourse theory is deployed to analyze such discursive constructions. The article concludes that such discourses are connected to the mainstream crisis/austerity rationales (as articulated by policymakers and pundits), sharing a non-systemic, culturalist/psychological understanding of the crisis’ roots and advancing neoliberal rationales and policies to resolve the crisis in Greece and elsewhere. Post-colonial theory is also is deployed to explain the accounts of the Greek liberals and their relation to the Enlightenment idea and their uses of it, among other bourgeois vantage points of exclusionary and disciplinary discourses and practices.","Political Discourse, Ideology, and the Media",Political Communication
2016-0072,2016,Paper Session,"Symbolic Mobilization: Making Political Discourse at the Chinese Premier’s Press Conference, 1993-2012",1,"Combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) and political studies of symbolic mobilization, this article explores how the discourses at the Chinese Premier’s Press Conferences (CPPC) are properly organized in relation to the identity of the Chinese premier, and what their changing and unchanging themes have been over time in China’s specific ideological context. This study argues that the institutionalized settings have made the political discourse at the CPPC relatively stable. Three groups of comparative themes have been found over the past 20 years: the future vs. the present and the past; responsibility vs. hegemony; national family vs. secession and independence. As a strategic action of symbolic mobilization, the political discourse at the CPPC reveals the positive images of China, but negative images of others as opposition. Besides, the Chinese premiers have used various rhetorical techniques to build up their own charismatic characters at the CPPC.","Political Discourse, Ideology, and the Media",Political Communication
2016-0073,2016,Paper Session,Mexican Children’s Understanding of Criminals: A Social Representations Study,1,"After 2006, a crime wave due to the increasing number of cartels all over Mexico made the delinquency topic one of the most popular themes in the media agenda. This was evident not only in news contents, but also in TV series, soap operas, films and videogames that showed narratives involving Mexican organized crime. Considering the polarized depiction of drug dealers, since sometimes they were shown as heroic and some other times as villains, how did children understand this situation, knowing that there were not sources of information that illustrated this topic for them? This paper shows their social representations towards delinquents. Children from ages 9-12 who participated in this research made drawings and a narrative that described their physical, psychological and sociological attributes, as well as their attitudes towards them, and their sources of information. Results explain the role of media in relation to other types of sources.","I Know You Because I Saw You on TV, but Where Am I? Youth, Stereotypes, and Prejudice",Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0074,2016,Paper Session,Wanting to See People Like Me? Racial and Gender Diversity in Popular Adolescent Television,2,"One source for adolescent identity development is media messages. This study uses Nielsen viewing data of adolescents aged 14-17 years from the 2014-2015 television season to examine diversity in adolescent television exposure. Compared to U.S. Census data, popular mainstream shows underrepresent women, but the proportion of Black characters is representative. Shows popular with female adolescents, compared to those popular with males, are more likely to have a higher proportion of female characters. Black adolescents watch more television compared to their non-Black counterparts and after taking their increased media use into account, shows popular with Black adolescents are more likely than shows popular with non-Black adolescents to exhibit racial diversity. These results support the idea that adolescents seek out media messages with characters that are members of their racial and gender identity groups. One possible explanation is that these characters are serving as tools for identity development.","I Know You Because I Saw You on TV, but Where Am I?

2016-0075,2016,Paper Session,The Influence of Televised Gender Stereotypes and Counterstereotypes on Girls’ Perceptions of STEM,1,"Girls are less likely to show interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) than boys in the United States. The gender gap in STEM has been attributed to environmental forces that socialize children to believe males are better suited for STEM careers than females. The present study, rooted in gender schema theory, examined how television might influence girls’ STEM perceptions. Six to 9 year old girls (N = 60) were either exposed to televised females in stereotypical or counter-stereotypical (i.e., STEM) roles, or were in a no exposure control. No differences in STEM self-efficacy were found between conditions. Girls in the stereotype condition reported more interest in stereotypical careers and were more likely to perceive scientists as males than girls in the counter-stereotype condition or the control. Girls in the counter-stereotype condition did not differ from the control in any measure of STEM perceptions. Results suggest that one-time exposure to televised stereotypes may activate and reinforce existing gender schema about STEM, but that one-time exposure to televised females in STEM may not have the capacity to alter girls’ highly gendered schema about STEM.","I Know You Because I Saw You on TV, but Where Am I?

Based on contact hypothesis, the moderating roles of interpersonal contact with Muslims are tested within this framework. Multiple regression analysis revealed that Western media use and exposure to Hollywood movies were strong predictors of prejudice. However, the relationship between Indian media use and prejudice was better understood by focusing on specific media sources. Further, it was found that qualitative, but not quantitative contact with Muslims, reduced prejudice. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","I Know You Because I Saw You on TV, but Where Am I? Youth, Stereotypes, and Prejudice",Children Adolescents and the Media

2016-0078,2016,Paper Session,"Boosting Acceptance of Online Health Information With a New, Brief Self-Affirmation Intervention",1,"The content of health websites frequently makes people aware of the risks associated with their unhealthy behaviors, which may induce defensive reactions that undermine behavior change. Self-affirming–reflecting on cherished values–has been found to reduce defensiveness. Typical self-affirmation interventions, however, are time-consuming and require motivated participants, herewith limiting its use in mass communication-contexts. This study developed and tested the effectiveness of a new, brief self-affirmation intervention; specifically designed for increasing the acceptance of online health information. Before reading online health information, participants were exposed to a self-affirming pop-up (inducing a self-affirmational mindset as demonstrated in a pilot study) or control pop-up. Participants completed variables related to health message acceptance and behavior change. Results showed that the self-affirming pop-up increased anticipated regret and healthy intentions, and decreased message derogation for at-risk participants. This new, brief self-affirmation intervention could thus potentially be used to boost the acceptance of online health information.",Online and Health Information Seeking: High-Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0079,2016,Paper Session,Pain Tolerance Increased by Presence in Distant Virtual Environment,2,"Virtual reality has been used in the treatment for pain for more than twenty years. While many explanations for the effectiveness of virtual reality in pain treatment have been offered, including its immersiveness and interactivity, these explanations have not fully explained the mechanism of pain relief. Like presence, pain is a subjective phenomenon- it exists only as perceived by an individual. In a definition by the International Association for the Study of Pain (2014), pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.” When people in pain subjectively feel that they are transported from their real-world locations, we propose that their sense of actual or potential damage decreases, and therefore that pain tolerance increases. We show that induced pain tolerance increases when viewing a remote virtual location, after viewing a virtual representation of the physical environment.",Online and Health Information Seeking: High-Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0080,2016,Paper Session,Power of Choice: Tensions Between Desired Quality of Care Criteria on Physician Online Rating Websites,2,"Physician online rating websites (PORWs) give patients the opportunity to write reviews or to consult information about fellow patients’ experiences with an individual physician and his practices. While PORWs may answer patients’ desire for comprehensible physician choice information, such websites also put power and responsibility into laypeople’s hands. Hence, physicians are worried about PORW abuses and impending negative effects on patients’ choices of physicians. This study contrasts and compares these presumed tensions between laypeople and physicians’ opinions on PORWs based on a Delphi study with 48 physicians and an electronic survey with laypeople (n=210) in Germany and Switzerland. These data (a) identify the criteria used by physicians and laypeople to recognize a good physician and (b) show to what extent physicians’ and laypeople’s perceptions about laypeople’s ability to assess physician quality diverge. This study therefore provides insights into tensions between laypeople’s and physicians’ perceptions and outlines improvement opportunities of PORWs.",Online and Health Information Seeking: High-Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0081,2016,Paper Session,Relaying Social Support Among Elderly People in China,4,"This study examines the relationships between different types of social support using an elderly sample in China. We conceptualize health information sharing behavior and interpersonal health communication as a type of enacted social support. Findings of this study reveals that elderly people’s perceived family support and social embeddedness were positively associated with health information sharing behavior. Furthermore, health information seeking behavior emerged as a significant predictor of health information sharing behavior. Interestingly, we found that education was negatively associated with health information sharing behavior among elderly people. The current study enriches the existing literature on health information behavior by integrating social support in our conceptual model. It is suggested that future studies should further explore social factors that influence health information sharing behaviors among elderly people.

The present study aims to validate an Italian version of the eHealth Literacy Scale, particularly structural validity. An online survey was conducted among a sample of Italian-speaking Swiss residents (N = 117). Data were analyzed by applying psychometric techniques that take item difficulty into account.
Non-parametric item response theory analyses confirmed that all 8 items measure a single dimension of eHealth Literacy as intended by its authors. Discriminant and convergent validity of the final scale were also confirmed.

This study was restricted to 2,229 cancer patients and 1,370 caregivers out of the total of 19,420 respondents. Results showed doctors were the most highly valued source for healthcare information. Among the mediated communication sources, print media were rated to have higher values than broadcasting media. The internet was evaluated as low as radio. This study also demonstrated that cancer caregivers valued most of the healthcare information sources higher than cancer patients.

2016-0084,2016,Paper Session,Exploring Measurement Tools of Embodiment,2,"This study investigates measurement practices of embodiment. A survey was employed to assess how concepts such as presence, player-avatar identification, and parasocial interaction may be related to the experience of embodiment amongst users of varied viewing perspectives. Participants were assigned to answer questions related to embodiment based on their experiences with either a first-person, third-person, or birds-eye viewing perspective. Results revealed that the concepts measured warranted a higher-order variable, embodiment, when analyzed in a confirmatory factor analysis within AMOS. Further, the results indicated that the higher-order model was invariant across the viewing-perspective groups, indicating that embodiment was not influenced by the change in these perspectives. Further implications and limitations are discussed.","Last but Not Least: Why Do We Play? Technical Development, Sexualization, Motivation, and Clans",Game Studies
2016-0085,2016,Paper Session,The Hyper-Sexualization of Women in World of Warcaft,1,"Even in massively multi-player online (MMO) games where the freedom of avatar creation is considered empowering, female representation becomes problematic, as femininity is delineated solely through sexualization. Moreover, the creativity of customized avatars is still controlled by the options provided to users by game designers, both at the outset and throughout the implementation of in-world interaction. This case study of the MMO World of Warcraft considers not only the unavoidable attributes leading to this hyper-sexualized portrayal of females when compared to their male racial counterparts, but also the perceived rationales behind this design and community reaction to its implementation.
The evaluation of the avatar includes all methods of user interaction, from avatar customization options to auditory communication and animations. In analyzing this information, it becomes clear that the level of character sexualization permeates all aspects through which female avatars interact within the virtual world.","Last but Not Least: Why Do We Play?

2016-0086,2016,Paper Session,Validating the Digital Games Motivation Scale for Comparative Research Between Countries and Sexes,6,"In order to research motives for playing digital games, researchers can draw on a variety of measurement instruments. When the aim is to compare motives or their effects on other variables between groups, however, instruments need to show specific psychometric properties. More specifically, an instrument needs to be invariant. Strong measurement invariance indicates that the conceptual structure is identical and that questionnaire items are interpreted and scored in the same fashion between groups. Without such properties, comparisons between groups run the danger of yielding invalid results. To our knowledge, no measurement instrument of motivations for play exists that shows strong measurement invariance. The current study investigates to what extent the Digital Games Motivation Scale (DGMS) can be used to compare motivations between cultures by testing it in four different countries. Furthermore, it assesses whether the instrument is invariant when comparing male and female players. Results indicate configural, metric and scalar invariance when comparing the sexes. Similar results are obtained for the cross-cultural comparison, albeit there is only evidence for partial scalar invariance. In conclusion, this study presents a measurement instrument that can be used in cross-cultural settings or when comparing motives for playing digital games between male and female players.","Last but Not Least: Why Do We Play?

VR Headsets, NUIs, and Violent Video Games",2,"In this FULL RESEARCH PAPER we focus on the effects of natural user interfaces and VR headsets on player aggression after playing a violent video game. Recent research introduced NUIs to the aggressive video games debate with very mixed results. Following the assumptions of the General Aggression Model and embodiment, VR headsets are able to further increase perceived realism and thus, aggression. An experimental study (N = 71) compared the Oculus Rift VR headset, a standard display as well as the Razer Hydra NUI controller and a standard mouse/keyboard combination with a wide range of control variables. Three common aggression measures (CRTT, State Hostility Scale, Buss/Perry aggression questionnaire) were used, but they interestingly showed little to no correlation with each other. The overall results show increased aggression levels with the VR headset, which may be overshadowed by simulation sickness. Playing with NUIs did not lead to increased post game aggression.","Last but Not Least: Why Do We Play? Technical Development, Sexualization, Motivation, and Clans",Game Studies

In the interviews the representatives of the companies explained the interiors and their studio philosophy tied to the physical spaces. The focus of this study is in how and why game companies integrate playful elements to their physical office layout and how company representatives see these elements. The presence of play and playful elements were manifested in physical and social artifacts in the office design, and utilized in different playful strategies. At minimum, the game companies practiced a basic play strategy. Other playful strategies included collaborative decorative play, brand play, and gamification through player metrics. In general game companies form special arenas for office play, where play and work are intertwined on symbolic, social and instrumental level.","Last but Not Least: Why Do We Play?

2016-0089,2016,Paper Session,Journalistic Transformation: How Source Texts are Turned Into News Stories,2,"Given intensifying financial and time pressures, journalists are driven to increasingly construct parts of their coverage from abundantly available textual sources. However, little attention has been paid to how journalists transform the available source material in the process of constructing the news coverage: How do they select specific contents to highlight, arrange materials from different sources, and embed them into the news narrative? In this article, we distinguish five characteristic kinds of transformations – evaluative, political, cultural, emotive, and professional – that refer to different journalistic functions and render the news relevant to the respective news audiences. Depending on the specific combinations of such transformations, journalists construct coverage adhering to different journalistic styles and role conceptions. To develop this framework, we conduct a systematic qualitative comparison of news coverage and cited source texts in the Israeli, Palestinian, and international coverage of the abduction and murder of four youths in summer 2014.","Journalists and Their Sources: Relationships, Practices, Perceptions",Journalism Studies

This study introduces the element of time to address the dynamic causal relation between organizational and news media agendas. Vector autoregression (VAR) analyses were applied to daily-level aggregated press releases (N = 20891) and news coverage (N = 80980). Results show that on the salience-level, organizational and news agendas are intertwined in an intimate relation, in which they influence each other reciprocally, or in which organizations take the lead. Conversely, on the sentiment-level, organizational and news agendas rarely influence each other. This implies that the unidirectional conceptualization of news media as a channel to vent organizational messages is too narrow.","Journalists and Their Sources: Relationships, Practices, Perceptions",Journalism Studies

Journalist Perspectives on Government-Media Communication in Northern Ireland’s Power-Sharing Democracy,2,"Numerous studies address the intersection of media and politics and the impact of this relationship on contemporary democracy. However, there is very limited research into the relationships between political journalists and government communicators in constitutionally complex or deeply divided post-conflict societies, such as Northern Ireland. This study fills this gap by examining data gathered from elite interviews with political journalists, Government Information Officers and Special Advisers in Northern Ireland. We analyze the narratives of our participants in relation to key theoretical debates: the role of the political journalist in society, the nature of their interaction with sources, and the relationship between government communication and the media. Several important themes emerge from our findings: the media’s role as unofficial opposition in Northern Ireland’s consociational democracy; the impact of working in deeply divided post-conflict societies on notions of media objectivity, impartiality and bias; and, the legacy of violent conflict on government-media relations.","Journalists and Their Sources: Relationships, Practices, Perceptions",Journalism Studies

The Mediating Role of Expectation of Success,2,"Even though it was originally included in Bandura’s explanation on self-efficacy, expectation of success was not addressed in later self-efficacy studies. Based on conceptual explications of self-efficacy, the present study proposed that expectation of success mediates the effects of source similarity, task self-efficacy, and coping self-efficacy on behavior intention. An online experiment was conducted in which source similarity was manipulated (N = 336). Expectation of success was found to fully mediate the relationship between source similarity and behavior intention and to partially mediate the relationship between self-assessments of capability (i.e., task self-efficacy and coping self-efficacy) and behavior intention.

The findings from two studies concerning safe-sex (N=412) and obesity messages (N=396) demonstrate solid support for the scale’s unidimensionality. In support of construct validity, the scale exhibited strong associations with message avoidance, annoyance, information seeking, and desensitization.

Higher levels of identification and self-referencing were expected to elevate susceptibility and severity perceptions, leading to persuasion. Participants aged ≤30 years were recruited from a crowdsource website and randomly assigned to read one version of a faux magazine article about caffeine overdose. Article versions were defined by a 2 (first- or third-person POV) x 2 (similar or dissimilar protagonist) design. Afterwards, they completed a questionnaire measuring study variables. Contrary to expectations, POV did not affect identification or self-referencing. However, similarity directly impacted identification, which in turn influenced severity perceptions. Self-referencing had a direct effect on susceptibility and also mediated the identification->susceptibility relationship. Susceptibility and severity perceptions were associated with greater levels of persuasion. Implications for message design are discussed.","Message Design Research: Meta-Analyses, Message/Information Fatigue, Narratives",Health Communication

Many studies have investigated the relative effects of metaphorical and literal messages. In fact, a previous meta-analysis of studies from 1983 to 2000 found a significantly greater effect of metaphor on attitudes (r = 0.07; Sopory & Dillard, 2002). The current meta-analysis serves as an update to the previous one. It includes studies from 2001 to 2015, which use additional message formats and topics than those in the previous meta-analysis. There was an overall effect size of g = 0.25 (CI: 0.22 – 0.27), which supports the conclusion that metaphorical messages are more persuasive than literal messages. Moderator analyses indicated that studies focused on crime had the highest effect size of all topics, although it was not statistically different from the effect size of that for health-related studies.","Message Design Research: Meta-Analyses, Message/Information Fatigue, Narratives",Health Communication
2016-0098,2016,Paper Session,Who Avoids Cancer Information? Examining a Psychological Process Leading to Cancer Information Avoidance,1,"Although cancer information avoidance (CIA) is detrimental to public health, predictors of CIA have not been fully investigated. Based on the uncertainty management theory, this study views CIA as a response to uncertainty related to the distress associated with cancer information, and illustrates the psychological process leading to CIA. Given the current information context, it was hypothesized that cancer information overload (CIO), which brings about confusion and stress, causes CIA. As trait anxiety is a strong predictor of CIO, it was also hypothesized that CIO mediates the relationship between trait anxiety and CIA. Study 1 tested this relationship with a U.S. sample (N = 384); the results showed that CIO is positively associated with CIA and trait anxiety indirectly influences CIA through CIO. As Study 1 tested the relationship with cross-sectional data in the general cancer context, Study 2 replicated Study 1 with three-wave longitudinal data in a specific cancer context (i.e., stomach cancer) in South Korea (N = 1,130 at Wave 1, 813 at Wave 2, and 582 at Wave 3). Trait anxiety at Wave 1 predicted CIO at Wave 2, which in turn increased CIA at Wave 3, suggesting that some people are inherently inclined to avoid cancer information due to their trait anxiety that results in confusion about cancer information.","Message Design Research: Meta-Analyses, Message/Information Fatigue, Narratives",Health Communication

Focusing on three international case studies, including the anti-street harassment site Hollaback!, the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, and interviews with teenage Twitter activists, the paper asks: What experiences of harassment, misogyny and rape culture are girls and women responding to? How are girls and women using digital media technologies to document experiences of sexual violence, harassment, and sexism? And, why are girls and women choosing to mobilize digital media technologies in such a way? Employing a unique approach including ethnographic methods such as semi-structured interviews, content analysis, discursive textual analysis, and affect theories, we detail a range of ways women and girls are using social media platforms to speak about, and thus make visible, experiences of rape culture. We argue that this digital mediation enables new connections previously unavailable to girls and women, allowing them to redraw the boundaries between themselves and others.",Fighting the Continuum of Violence From Flaming and Street Harassment to Domestic Violence and Rape,Feminist Scholarship

Taking up Bennett’s and Segerberg’s (2012) continuum of ideal types of movement structures, I conduct a comparative case study of the organizational logics at play at the international level of Hollaback’s branding strategy, particularly its 2014 release of a viral video marketing effort, and at the local level, particularly the Philadelphia chapter’s collective storytelling. Through textual analyses of the narrative work performed on both levels, I identify tensions at play between Hollaback, the international nonprofit with a singular brand, and Hollaback Philly, the local grassroots group that highlights a plurality of voices.

The analysis suggests that certain cross-cultural rape archetypes that are present in ancient mythologies—such as the infallibility of male power figures and blaming the victim—continue to emerge in contemporary news coverage. Differences emerged between the U.S. and India in the attribution of responsibility (individual versus social), but media frames were otherwise similar in their focus on the “good wife” figure in the controversies, the relative lack of concern for rape survivors’ well-being, and the dearth of focus on the lack of legal consequences for the alleged perpetrators.

2016-0103,2016,Paper Session,"""Killed out of Love”: Domestic Violence Coverage in Hong Kong",1,"This study explores how the South China Morning Post (Hong Kong) portrays domestic violence fatalities and what frames are used for coverage. Literature analyses were performed to identify the primary frames and determine whether coverage follows the stereotypical gendered blame treatment found in previous studies. Content analysis was conducted on 124 news stories to determine if fatalities were labeled as domestic violence examples and to locate causes, responsible actors and solutions to the problem. A general frame analysis was done to assemble a gender approach to the stories. Overall, most coverage was executed in a way that supported known views of domestic violence, citing mainly official sources, excusing the perpetrator’s behavior and treating the incidents as isolated events, rather than a larger social problem. However, a few stories recognized the historical subordination of women under patriarchy in Confucianism, but relegated it to the rural areas of Mainland China, challenging a feminist construction of the problem.",Fighting the Continuum of Violence From Flaming and Street Harassment to Domestic Violence and Rape,Feminist Scholarship
2016-0104,2016,Paper Session,Experiential Learning Through Documentary Methodology: A Platform for Breaking Down Rape Culture on College Campus,2,"Rape culture on college campuses is widespread but an issue that has recently come to the forefront through awareness campaigns, highly publicized cases, and media coverage. This study explores an experiential learning project that produced a documentary by undergraduate students under the mentorship of two Ph.D. students. The aim of this project was to teach students film making skills as well as learning the narratives of college rape survivors in order to break down rape myths perpetuated on campuses. The results indicate that this experiential learning project empowered survivors to share their stories since all had been previously silenced through personal guilt and public shaming. Furthermore, the 15 students who participated in the production of the documentary learned both technical skills and the damaging effects of rape and rape culture, some for the first time.",Fighting the Continuum of Violence From Flaming and Street Harassment to Domestic Violence and Rape,Feminist Scholarship

The performance of Conchita Wurst was unique in terms of gender and gender performance for some audience and media, recognized by many as “The Bearded Lady.” The case of Conchita Wurst provides a good opportunity to understand the public framings of sexuality in Europe. Particularly, the comment comparisons between Conchita Wurst and the winners of before and after could shed light on how online commenters are expressing sexuality when unconventional sexulity is presented to them. About 3000 comments Youtube comments from three winners, including Conchita Wurst and two other before and after winners, were analyzed to examine civility of comments related performance, identity, appearance, and discussions. The result indicated that the overall comments were more negative toward Conchita Wurst and discussions were negative toward other commenters in Conchita Wurst Youtube page.

2016-0106,2016,Paper Session,Gamer-Hate and the “Problem” of Women: Finding Feminism,2,"Before August of 2014, very few people who did not either play, make or study games knew any thing at all about the harassment and misogyny that far too many women in our ranks have been receiving for far too long. “#Gamergate” changed all of that, as the scope and depth of the ‘woman problem’ became more publically and graphically evidenced and as women (and their families, pets and associates) have been repeatedly threatened to be raped and/or killed, dismembered, disfigured, their websites hacked, and their private information, home addresses and phone numbers broadcast online. This paper's specific purpose is first to contextualize this singular Gamergate episode within a larger story of a high-stakes digital game culture and industry that has long been hostile towards women, and then to report on a cross-sectoral, international feminist research program designed to re-conceive and re-mediate the ‘problem’ of women in games, a project that is still very much a work in progress.",Fighting the Continuum of Violence From Flaming and Street Harassment to Domestic Violence and Rape,Feminist Scholarship
2016-0107,2016,Paper Session,Does Cyber-Proximity Matter? Social Media Network Exposure and Cross-National Protest Diffusion: Evidence From Event History Analysis of Arab Spring 2010—2011,1,"A majority of diffusion studies on social movement has been conducted within a single system, with few analyzing diffusion in a cross-national context. This study takes an event history analytic approach to systematically explore cross-national contagion during Arab Spring. In particular, this study examines cyber-proximity effect on the protest spillover across 16 countries. Adopting Valente’s (1995) threshold model, the study operationalizes “social media network exposure” and examines its effect as a diffusion variable. The results show the evidence of contemporaneous contagion effect spread via social media network, although no lagged effect is found. The author contextualizes discussions within the scholarship of social movement/protest diffusion, democracy domino theory, and social media-driven collective actions. Future directions are recommended concerning how to delve further into the evidence of SMNE’s temporal contagion effect, diversify the measurements of online network exposure, and apply a social-media-proximity based diffusion modeling to other cases of social movements.",Social Protests and Technology,Communication and Technology
2016-0108,2016,Paper Session,Emotions in an Online Social Movement: A Study of India’s Nirbhaya Protest,3,"Despite the ubiquitousness of social media and ‘Twitter revolutions’, our knowledge about the connections between emotions and online protests still remains limited. In this study, we investigate whether online protest actions follow the same emotional groundwork for supporting and nurturing a social movement as the offline world. Emotion analysis of 65,613 tweets posted during the Nirbhaya social movement (Delhi gang-rape movement) in India identified a strong resemblance between online emotional patterns and offline protest emotions as discussed in literature. Formal statistical testing of a range of emotions (negativity, positivity, anger, sadness, anxiety, certainty, individualism, collectivism and achievement) demonstrated that they were significantly heightened as compared to baseline Twitter conversations, and influenced the course of the online protest, resonating parallels with offline events. The findings highlight the importance of anger and anxiety in stirring the collective conscience, and of positive emotions in sustaining the protesters’ resolve throughout the protest event.",Social Protests and Technology,Communication and Technology

We use the data from 17 online groups representing the branches of the movement for Fair Elections in 17 districts of St.Petersburg, Russia, and compare their online parameters to real offline participation of group members in elections in the role of observers. With around 12,000 online users and over 200 offline participants, we use social network analysis and standard statistical analysis to obtain our results. We find that both on the group and the individual levels participation is related to online networking features and to activity parameters, albeit to a modest degree, and that offline leaders are especially different from the rest of the members in terms of most online features.",Social Protests and Technology,Communication and Technology

It analyzes accounts of 38 youth volunteers aged between 18 and 29 who responded to the havoc caused by a major oil spill and offers a unique view of the role of social media in catalyzing their volunteering efforts. Key factors in youth responses to the crisis included the influence of social media in framing and depicting the crisis, the attraction of the visual media in engaging and tracking the progress of their voluntary efforts, and the ease with which social media helped youth to draw on their large social networks to mobilize volunteer action.",Social Protests and Technology,Communication and Technology
2016-0111,2016,Paper Session,The Critical Periphery in the Growth of Social Protests,1,"Social media have provided instrumental means of communication in many recent political protests. The efficiency of online networks in disseminating timely information has been praised by many commentators; at the same time, users are often derided as “slacktivists” because of the shallow commitment involved in clicking a forwarding button. Here we consider the role of these peripheral online participants, the immense majority of users who surround the small epicenter of protests, representing layers of diminishing online activity around the committed minority. We analyze three datasets tracking protest communication in different languages and political contexts through the social media platform Twitter and employ a network decomposition technique to examine their hierarchical structure. We provide consistent evidence that peripheral participants are critical in increasing the reach of protest messages and generating online content at levels that are comparable to core participants. Although committed minorities may constitute the heart of protest movements, our results suggest that their success in maximizing the number of online citizens exposed to protest messages depends, at least in part, on activating the critical periphery.",Social Protests and Technology,Communication and Technology
2016-0112,2016,Paper Session,Portrait of the Online Local News Audience,3,"With resources for local journalism outlets on the decline and the use of digital tools on the rise, there has been greater consideration of the audience among journalists, editors, and foundations. This concern with understanding audiences, particularly in efforts to better meet their critical information needs, links back to the civic or public journalism movement of the 1990s as well as the FCC standards set for ascertainment of community needs during the 1970s. Yet, a limited amount of current scholarship addresses a qualitative understanding of local news audiences’ habits and beliefs. Drawing upon data from six focus groups across three communities, this paper highlights three common themes, which we have labeled: a) self-reliant news consumer, b) lack of citizen journalism, and c) continued importance of interpersonal networks. These themes may provide insights into the nature of local news consumers and a guide to avenues for future research.",Local Journalism: Community and Diversity,Journalism Studies
2016-0113,2016,Paper Session,Bounding and Bonding Community: Ethnic Diversity and the Ethic of Inclusion in Hyperlocal News,1,"Amidst the changing communication environment, there has been a growing interest from practitioners, policymakers and scholars in harnessing the potential of hyperlocal news to strengthen communities and revitalize the condition for civic action. Hyperlocal news is often taken to signify a form of information provision by and for the community, leaving the boundaries, meaning and assumed normative value of community unquestioned and uncontended. This paper highlights the blind spots in the current research in hyperlocal news, and argues that increasing ethnic diversity in local communities requires confronting the challenge of communication in and across difference. Citing empirical evidence from a small multiethnic city, this paper argues that the concept of community is ultimately unproductive for positively thematizing the role of hyperlocal news in the context of ethnic diversity, and recasting hyperlocal news as a public discursive realm with differently situated publics points to new normative values and directions for research.",Local Journalism: Community and Diversity,Journalism Studies

Focusing upon examples drawn from what I name the mediated universe of Toronto city politics, I suggest the case of Rob Ford highlights the hybridity with which media logics both older and newer “blend, overlap, intermesh, and coevolve” (Chadwick, 2013: 4). My discussion not only considers changing media technologies, but older and newer ways of narrating, documenting, visualizing and doing ‘urban’ politics. The overarching argument is that there is a pressing need to think about the political spaces of journalism specifically, rather than just media in general, in constituting urban public life.",Local Journalism: Community and Diversity,Journalism Studies
2016-0115,2016,Paper Session,Paths of Influence Between a Hyperlocal News Website and Civic Engagement in a Multiethnic Community,5,"This study seeks to understand if and how hyperlocal news websites can enhance civic engagement in ethnically diverse communities. Focusing on one such website launched in 2010 and a survey conducted more than three years into its operation, structural equation modeling uncovers bidirectional influence between connection with the website and civic participation. That is, while this website serves to enhance readers’ participation levels, its readers tend to be those who are already active participants in civic life. Furthermore, connection with this hyperlocal platform is negatively related to connection with existing geo-ethnic media. This suggests that the website has been successful in becoming a key source of news and information by replacing some legacy media in fulfilling the local information needs of diverse residents.",Local Journalism: Community and Diversity,Journalism Studies

Data was collected from each of the official app stores of the four given countries/districts (U.S., China, India, and Taiwan). The sample included the top 50 apps in each of the four nations/districts for a total of 200 apps. Users from collectivistic cultures tend to favor mobile apps that afford more collectivism-related features. Moreover, Chinese and Indian users are more likely to download and use apps that satisfy their deficiency needs, while Americans and Taiwanese prefer apps that meet growth needs. This study suggests that both the factor of cultural values and the factor of hierarchical human needs can predict preferences for mobile apps in four countries/districts.",Globalization and Digital Media: Implications for Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change

Data from Pew Research Global Attitudes survey from 24 countries are used to test the social contact hypothesis—individuals using Internet and social media are more likely to be exposed to novel information generally censored or not permissive in countries they live in. Using social contact hypothesis, four hypotheses were tested. Results from multi-level models show that Internet use, social media use, and attitudes towards Internet freedom are positively associated with attitudes towards homosexuality, even after controlling for sex, age, education, income and religiosity—traditional predictors of gay prejudice. Moreover, individuals in countries with low HIV/AIDS prevalence, ranking high on Gay Happiness Index, without antigay laws, and relatively free Internet access without government control were more likely to report more accepting attitudes towards homosexuality. Internet and social media campaigns may be more economical and efficient way to reach out and reduce prejudice.",Globalization and Digital Media: Implications for Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0118,2016,Paper Session,Assessing the Potential of ICTs for Participatory Development in Sub-Saharan Africa With Evidence From Urban Togo,2,"Africa is currently undergoing a mobile digital revolution and scholars and development practitioners have become increasingly interested in participatory, ICT-enabled interventions as an approach to address the complex challenges of governance in the region. However, research on conventional participatory development interventions has shown that they often produce unintended effects of elite capture due to insufficient appreciation of local context. We argue that ICT-enabled projects need to be custom-tailored to skills and needs of the politically marginalized groups whose participation they seek to encourage. To advance the generation of the necessary empirical data, we survey over 1.4000 respondents across four cities in Togo. We find that socio-demographic factors limiting political participation partially overlap with factors that negatively impact access to ICT and the development of digital skills. Based on these findings we formulate policy recommendations for the design of ICT-enabled projects that proactively seek to increase the participation of marginalized groups.",Globalization and Digital Media: Implications for Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0119,2016,Paper Session,Death From Above: An Analysis of the Central Command YouTube Page,1,"This study gives context to the ways in which government agencies use YouTube to spread images of violent conflict. The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) YouTube channel was analyzed and the content of each video uploaded between 2013-2014 was coded based on the number of views, upload date, likes/dislikes and a variety of variables which included sound, color, people, narration, description length and general theme. The findings of this content analysis show a dramatic shift in the way CENTCOM used YouTube to spread messages immediately following President Obama’s announcement that the US would begin using airstrikes against Islamic State enemies in Iraq in August of 2014. By examining the changes in the US military’s policies towards video-sharing websites such as YouTube over time, this study seeks to provide a context for the ways in which YouTube relates to agenda-setting and propaganda.","Media, Conflict, and Violence",Mass Communication

A 2x3 experiment using a composite newspaper story of IPV was employed to investigate three research questions related to how perpetrator sex and the severity of the violence reported in the news story impacted male and female readers’ perceptions of the seriousness of IPV, initial ratings of perpetrator responsibility, and punishment preferences. Results indicated significant differences in all outcomes. We discuss how these findings contextualize suggestions for media portrayals, journalistic framing, and current understandings of IPV.","Media, Conflict, and Violence",Mass Communication

Drawing on ethnographic data collected with Falkland Islanders during the 30th Anniversary of the 1982 Falklands War I critically consider the context, motivation and agency involved in how and why Islanders remember in and through the media, and the potentially profound implications this may be having on their understanding, negotiation and performance of identity that is (at times) at odds with their everyday existence. The result of the analysis raises critical questions about the implications of the interconnectedness and interdependence of media and remembering in relation to the production, interpretation and negotiation of remembering in the wider media ecology.","Media, Conflict, and Violence",Mass Communication

But is the content of audiences' thoughts about violent portrayals confined to anxious and aggressive fantasies? This study aims to extend an emerging line of qualitative and quantitative research suggesting that some types of violent portrayals might also prompt more complex thought processes that involve reflection and meaning-making about violence as a fact of social reality. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 39 participants from different backgrounds including violent professions, media professionals, and interview partners from the general population without such professional involvement with mediated or real world violence. The interviews revealed three main dimensions of reflective thoughts about violent media content including thoughts about 1) the truth content, 2) the life-world relevance, and 3) the psychological and moral implications of the violence depicted.","Media, Conflict, and Violence",Mass Communication

Our goal here is to construct and validate a set of scales that can be used to examine this question. A review of the roles of intuition in belief formation, and of the rise of relativism provides a theoretical foundation for the work. Using these literatures as a guide, we develop and refine several potential measures. Tests of the measurement models via SEM-based confirmatory factor analysis support the creation of three scales: Trust in Feeling, Disregard for Evidence, and Constructivism. Additional tests show that only the first two scales correlate with belief accuracy. We briefly explore factors associated with the attributes, and conclude with a discussion of the results and their implications.",Predicting and Explaining Opinion Diversity,Political Communication
2016-0124,2016,Paper Session,Motivated Reasoning in Perceived Credibility of Public Opinion Polls,3,"There are a variety of factors that may alter the credibility of opinion poll results. The current study is a survey experiment in which respondents were presented with poll results about both gun control and abortion; for each poll report, three aspects of the presentation were randomized: the direction of the poll result (majority supports vs opposes), the news source reporting the poll (Fox News vs MSNBC), and the amount of detail reported about the poll (none vs lots). Across two distinct samples, respondents who held issue positions that contradicted the results of the polls found those polls less credible. In line with theories of motivated reasoning, however, this decreased credibility was only evident among individuals with high issue knowledge. Factors such as ideological consonance between the respondent and media source, source-message dissonance, or the level of detail presented did not trump this motivated reasoning mechanism.",Predicting and Explaining Opinion Diversity,Political Communication

Previous studies suggest that the tendency of selective expression could be reinforced in continuous discussions, which possibly leads to declining opinion diversity over time. Under the collaborative filtering framework, this study uses data collected unobtrusively from popular web forums to test this suspicious claim. Survival analyses demonstrate that selective expression is not necessarily associated with declining opinion diversity, because discussions with diverse opinions are more capable of attracting further responses and can attenuate the tendency of selective expression. In addition, this study suggests that like-minded discussions can coexist with opinion diversity to sustain healthy political deliberation on the Internet.",Predicting and Explaining Opinion Diversity,Political Communication

The results largely confirmed the spiral of silence effect in the offline scenario, but not in the online condition. Moreover, the finding suggests that, instead of considering the opinion climate from the general public as a whole, the perceived opinion congruency with the peer group positively affected the students’ outspokenness in the real world. Other well-established influencing factors, such as fear of isolation and the awareness of consequence, were confirmed offline as well. Furthermore, alternative media exposure positively predicted one’s willingness to speak up in both the online and offline scenario.

In this paper, we argue for the refinement of the concept of media events by suggesting their study in terms both of their design as preplanned events and their experience and practice by different constituencies, whether producers, participants or viewers. Such an approach allows us to move beyond the functionalist assumptions of the initial concept, while at the same time retaining a focus on the importance of pre-planned events that interrupt media routines. We illustrate our arguments by drawing upon ethnographic material from the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest held in Copenhagen.

How do tourists experience contemporary cities through their participation in crime-detective fiction tours, and what meaning(s) do they attribute to their experiences? Towards this end, an ethnographic approach has been adopted which encompassed participation in three literary crime-detective fiction tours as well as in-depth interviews with twenty participants. The results of this study show that popular crime-detective fiction tourism is best understood as a quest to find the presumed true nature of the city. Certain essentialist conceptions of the city are deemed increasingly problematic in a postmodern context. Viewed against this background, the results show that this practice of literary tourism can be understood as a form of cultural criticism against a supposed “urban placelessness”.",Experiencing Entertainment,Popular Communication

WWOHP seems emblematic of a new trend in theme park design that builds a complete immersive environment based around one media text. Not only the general public, but also the series’ often-critical fanbase has embraced it. What drives this success? Prior research on theme parks generally starts from a critical hermeneutic perspective, which ignores the voices of those that enjoy them: the visitors. This paper addresses this lack through an ethnographic study of WWOHP in Orlando. Utilizing in-depth interviews with 15 visitors and participant observation, we show how the visitor’s experience is shaped through use of the ironic imagination, using the park’s status as an official adaptation to feel ‘as if’ they are physically experiencing the narrative world. In doing so, we present a new understanding of the theme park experience.",Experiencing Entertainment,Popular Communication
2016-0130,2016,Paper Session,The Museum Foyer as a Transformative Space of Communication,3,"This article explores how we may study physical museum foyers as multilayered spaces of communication. Based on a critical examination of ways in which the museum foyer is conceptualised in the research literature, we define the foyer as a transformative space of communication for visitors which has four transformative functions, and we ask the following question: How do people entering the museum practice these functions so as to become visitors – and become non-visitors again on leaving? Answers are provided through a first empirical analysis of the foyer as a communicative space. Based on qualitative studies of four divergent Danish museums and a science centre, we demonstrate that the foyer’s communicative space supports transformative functions consisting of multiple phases before and after the visit itself, namely arrival-orientation-service-preparation (before the visit) and preparation-service-evaluation-departure (after the visit). We discuss the implications of these results for the museum and heritage sectors and argue for more granular understandings of the visitor perspective.",Experiencing Entertainment,Popular Communication

Concertive resistance is exercised by organizational members according to a set of core group-level values which challenge, invert, or disrupt top-down control. Through an ethnography of a major American university football team, this study reveals how multiple and overlapping identifications allowed for collective resistance that arose spontaneously and without the aid of overt resistance leadership. Analysis of participant sensemaking about a resistance episode revealed differences in the discursive construction, application, and understanding of organizational and extra-organizational premises, which were associated with players’ overlapping identifications. The essay contributes to the resistance and organizational communication literatures by using Unobtrusive Control Theory to explain how group-level resistance is accomplished through control.",Team Communication and Technologies,Organizational Communication

This manuscript reviews the last 15 years of interdisciplinary research on virtual teams and conducts an analysis of team type and study design on a sample of 265 articles. We then analyze several systematic differences based these factors that are apparent in research in three areas: leadership, cultural diversity, and technology use.

Recent theory and studies suggest a broad set of project managers’ communication behaviors such as messy talk, facilitating open communication environment, goal sharing, and structuring/planning are critical to project team operations. Results from a sample (n = 160) of team members associated across several industries indicate that project managers' communication behaviors of messy talk and establishing expectations and goals were predictive of project success in Information technology (IT) centric and Human Resource Management (HRM) centric information sharing systems, respectively. Further analyses indicate that organizational membership, distance, and information sharing systems have an interaction effect on project success.

2016-0135,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Self-Affirmation on Publics’ Perception of Crisis,1,"Through a 2 × 2 experiment design, this study applies the theory of self-affirmation to the field of crisis communication. The research found that publics’ crisis emotions mediate self-affirmation’s effect on: blame towards the organization, evaluation of the organization, product purchase intentions, relational trust and publics’ willingness to seek information on social media after the crisis. Although the intervention of self-affirmation may not be beneficial to the corporation (i.e., increased blame and decreased evaluation, etc.), it increased public willingness to seek information. This discovery has profound implications for ensuring public safety in times of large-scale crises or disasters. By encouraging willingness to seek information, we can increase the probability that individuals can understand and engage in safer behaviors in large-scale crises or disaster scenarios.",Top Faculty Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

2016-0140,2016,Paper Session,The Power of Knowing: WhatsApp and Lateral Surveillance in South African Romantic Relationships,1,"Even though there are high and growing levels of penetration of mobile telephony in South Africa, there is little research, in the country, into how mobiles are used in romantic relationships to “keep tabs” on partners and inter alia into how those involved in such relationships may be attempting to achieve and maintain privacy. In this way, mobiles may be ambiguously seen as both empowering but also limiting to the freedom of another partner in a relationship. Using the relational dialectical framework, I study how surveillance and privacy related power dynamics are played out in romantic relationships by selected undergraduate students at a South African University. The dialectical theory of communication privacy management will provide the appropriate empirical lens for investigating how romantic partners deal with the need to stay both private and public in the wake of Instant messaging applications. This study seeks to understand how adolescents in these romantic relationships deal with mobile privacy conflicts that are brought on by mobile instant messaging applications. This study will be informed by the following research questions:

Questions 1: What strategies are negotiated by romantic partners to handle conflict that does emanate from perceived misappropriation of mobile instant messaging applications in the privacy and surveillance dialectic?
Question 2: How satisfied are partners with mobile communication after negotiated strategies for Instant Messaging use have been implemented for the privacy and surveillance dialectic?

Through a quantitative survey, purposive sampling with a confidence level of 95% and 5% margin of error will be utilized in selecting the respondents. Exploratory factor analysis will provide the template for data analysis.",Dating And Romantic Relationships Through Apps,Mobile Communication

2016-0142,2016,Paper Session,Power as Medium: The Third Face of Communicating With Power,1,"The 2016 ICA theme introduces two senses in which we can think about communicating with power -- engaging in communications that are themselves powerful, having lots of effect; and communicating with those in power (with the intent of having effect). There is a third sense in which we can think about the relationships between communication and power, a third face, which is using power itself as a medium of communication. This presentation will synthesize what has been learned from research by others that offers a framework for thinking about power as a medium for communication and information war, peace-making, and peace-keeping; and it will present highlights from what has been learned from a series of studies by this author about information policy in particular as used for these purposes.

The presentation will build upon the theorization of power offered in Change of State (2006), distinguishing among power in its instrumental, structural, symbolic (consensual), and informational and in its sunk, actual, potential, and emergent phases. It will focus on the uses of power as a medium during communications among states and between states and the international community as those communications have involved war, peace-making, and/or peace-keeping. Beginning with discussions among journalists themselves in the 1870s regarding their roles in the struggle to keep peace through contemporary analyses of the ways in which existing international law does and does not apply to developments of concern from the cybersecurity and cyberwarfare perspectives, it will offer an overview of trends in the use of information policy tools to constrain and enable communications among those in power in ways it is hoped will ensure or maintain peace. An exhaustive reading of The Arms Control Reporter (Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies) from 1982-1990 provides the data from which a particularly detailed history of the Cold War period has been built (Braman, 1990). The case study of a proposed satellite system that could be used for surveillance-type functions such as treaty verification (Braman, 1991a) provided insight into the particular difficulties that can be raised by global efforts. And analysis of the information policy provisions of arms control treaties and treaty proposals from the Geneva Protocol of 1928 through the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe treaty of 1989 provides detailed insight into the proliferation of types of information policy tools incorporated into efforts to keep peace (Braman, 1990, 1991b).

Over the course of the Cold War, information policy provisions in arms control treaties and treaty proposals They have multiplied and become more highly articulated over time. Technological innovation, concerns about equity, professionalism of quite diverse types, and other factors affecting these treaties are apparent in these provisions as they change over time. The provisions fall into 6 categories: abstract principles (eg, security theory, doctrine), reportage (eg, notification, fact-finding), observation (eg, personnel exchange, on-site inspections), industrial activity (eg, production line monitoring, monitoring of storage sites), administrative techniques (eg, consultation, management), and mass communications (eg, media access, crisis communications). The literature discussing arms control treaties through 1989 introduced another 13 suggestions of types of information policy tools that could be used for peace-making and peace-keeping purposes (Braman, 1990).

Trends in the development of these information policy tools will be explored and their pertinence in the contemporary environment examined. Of particular interest are the factors that seemingly inevitably trigger increasingly elaborate articulations of rules for how to operationalize basic informational and communicative mandates, the ""rise"" of the types of policies involved from ""low"" to ""high,"" the appearance of familiar issues such as equity and diversity within the arms control arena, the roles that citizens can play, the transfer of policy issues from other arenas into defense, and the increasing information intensivity of arms control treaties themselves over time. All of these are manifestations of the ways in which power is used as a medium.

The information policy regime for peace-keeping purposes put in place by arms control treaties remain in play, as was most recently vividly demonstrated in the course of negotiations with Iran over its alleged development of nuclear weapons. However, there are also significant changes in the use of power as medium since the Cold War period. Most notably, those include the need to deal with information as an agent, the importance of ""witting"" as an evaluative criterion, and the role of intentionality on the part of the state. Where expert analysis of the applicability of international law to cybersecurity and cyberwarfare founders is precisely along the fracture lines of the state itself.

2016-0147,2016,Paper Session,Images of Resilience: The Case for Visual Restorative Narrative (Top Paper),2,"A recently-labeled genre of journalistic storytelling, termed “restorative narratives,” purports to cover the story beyond the immediacy of the breaking news, and in doing so, to help individuals and communities move forward in the wake of large-impact events. Specifically, this research emphasizes visual reporting which functions both effectively and in concert with the tenets of restorative narrative. Through photographic analysis and in-depth interviews with visual journalists the study concludes that visual restorative narrative can potentially provide a venue for the professional photojournalist that is beyond the scope of what can be accomplished with citizen-provided content. And, in doing so, restorative narrative can indeed be a future—and thus a sustaining value—of visual journalism for legacy news outlets.",Visual Framing and Storytelling Between the Affective and the Iconic,Visual Communication Studies

The photographs apparently depict a British RAF serviceman posing next to a ‘dead Taliban fighter’. Primarily concerned with the visual representation of soldiering in the news and what we can learn from the responses of those with direct experience of war and its after-effects, I contend that the news treatment of this snapshot style imagery presents a particularly rich example through which to explore the unsettling relationship that the press and public have with the act of killing in war, and the jarring discomfort experienced when ‘our boys’ are shown to not only take part in seemingly reprehensible activities, but to picture themselves celebrating such acts.",Visual Framing and Storytelling Between the Affective and the Iconic,Visual Communication Studies

While editors aim to women the same as men when editing photographs of war, the participants had some hesitation upon seeing images of women in combat presented in this study, particularly when graphic. An individual level of influence was observed, as was such concern for the audience that it rivaled other social institutions in the hierarchy of influences. Interviews in the first grounded theory study included 17 visual editors and producers of various newspaper, broadcast, and online U.S. media companies.

Using an interpretive visual analysis to examine the first week of broadcast news coverage of Typhoon Morakot—one of the worst natural disasters in Taiwanese history, this article found a series of television techniques, such as interruption of commercials, live broadcasting, dramatization, and cinematic vignettes, have been used to convey and elicit the feelings of horror, grief, anger, pride, and compassion from the audience. While many media critics reduce such media construction to evidence of weepy journalism and therapy news, which exploits public emotions to boost ratings, this article explores the cultural function of emotive disaster coverage. In fact, such coverage united a traumatized society and allowed journalists to establish their cultural authority through emotional storytelling.",Visual Framing and Storytelling Between the Affective and the Iconic,Visual Communication Studies

Through content analysis and survey research, the article considers both news media presentation and audience interpretation. The data show that imagery themes, rather than select images, are remembered regarding Hurricane Katrina. And while select images are known to represent Katrina, they do not serve in such a concrete and enduring way as to be labeled iconic. Using both print and digital news as sites of media content, and in consideration of commemorative journalism, the data showed that while print news focused on current visual imagery best classified as “moving forward,” digital news galleries focused on original visual imagery best classified as “looking back.” In being easily accessible and available, digital space functions in such a way as to make historic images ubiquitous, and in a sense permanent.",Visual Framing and Storytelling Between the Affective and the Iconic,Visual Communication Studies

Studies show that these patients face unique challenges in receiving quality health care (Andrade-Pereira, & De Carvalho, 2010). To understand the factors that limit or facilitate the communication these patients have with their hearing healthcare provid-ers, seven focus groups were conducted. The participants voiced strong concerns that health providers lack education about working with sign language interpreters, and that the Deaf patients lacked appropriate information access prior, during, and after the medical encounter; the Deaf patients often discussed barriers of patient-provider relationship, issues of Deaf people as caregivers, and expressed an overall diminished sense of self/loss of control.

The diversity and inequality in the lived experience of the ageing population in the new media environment constitutes a blind spot in current research. In this essay we bring literatures of (cultural) ageing studies, and (new) media studies into conversation with each other by asking what future directions for research on older people and their media lives from the particular perspective of social diversity could be. We propose three key interventions: developing a focus on social stratification and inequality broadly conceived; designing research with a life course perspective rather than reducing people to age groups; and focusing empirical work on media repertoires looking at the various ways people ‘do’ media.",Responding to Exclusion and Inequality,Theme Sessions

What is less understood is the interactive role of various sources of information. In particular, we are interested in how the mix of attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent sources of communication influence evaluations of what we know and in turn how we process information. In this study we utilize data from a national US survey collected just prior to the 2014 Midterm Elections to address gaps in the literature. We determine that regardless of information type – mediated and interpersonal, attitude-consistent or inconsistent – as information increases individuals’ perceptions of information insufficiency decreases, which is associated with an increase in heuristic processing and a decrease in systematic processing.","Different Types of Media Content, Different Effects?",Political Communication
2016-0156,2016,Paper Session,Political Satire Processing and Policy Opinion Formation: Examining the Mediating Roles of Attitude Homophily and Enjoyment,2,"The current study builds on the growing emphasis of integrating entertainment media variables (i.e., enjoyment and character liking) in political entertainment processing models. Additionally, this work extends recent literature to include a key political psychology variable (i.e., homophily) known to influence attitudes and opinions (yet never tested within a political satire context). Drawing from a contemporary context (i.e., The Colbert Report) an online survey (N = 245) with an embedded media stimulus manipulation was used to conduct a serial mediation analysis. Results indicate that character liking significantly mediated the relationship between one’s consumption of satirically structured policy messaging and their attitudes toward the satire’s joke targets. Additionally, enjoyment and character liking, in serial, significantly mediated the relationship between one’s perceived attitude homophily with the show host and narrative consistent attitudes, but not for all joke targets.","Different Types of Media Content, Different Effects?",Political Communication

All the while politicians communicating for themselves online are gaining in popularity as they use interactivity to attract and please voters. This study sought to examine whether interactivity could enhance these attitudes as well as memory of both simple and complex mediated political content. To accomplish these objectives, a 2 (story complexity: simple or complex) x 3 (interactivity level: low, medium or high) experiment was conducted, finding that interactivity did not enhance attitudes because political party affiliation was a large driver of results. However, interactivity did aid memory of simple information, suggesting that media organizations should divvy up their content into shorter interactive sections to enhance comprehension of content.","Different Types of Media Content, Different Effects?",Political Communication
2016-0158,2016,Paper Session,The Effect of Different Types of Political Conflict in the News on Cynicism and Participation,2,"Previous research has yielded inconclusive results on the question how different types of conflict may matter differently for citizens’ attitudes towards politics and political participation. In this study, based on an experiment (N=339), we consider different types of conflict and their impact on political cynicism and behavior, i.e. disagreement, conflict and incivility. Our findings show that cynicism increases when citizens are exposed to more severe types of conflict. Especially incivility in the news increases cynicism compared to the other types of conflict. This effect is mediated by the perceived likelihood that politicians will find a solution to the problem. At higher levels of conflict, and especially when exposed to incivility, citizens perceive the likelihood that politicians will come up with a good solution to be lower, which makes them more cynical about politics. At the same time, political participation is triggered by more severe types of conflict.","Different Types of Media Content, Different Effects?",Political Communication

As demonstrated in the literature, random friending on social network sites can heavily impact adolescents’ safety online. Results yielded by means of Structural Equation Modelling show that the subjective norm with regard to the acceptance of strangers as SNS friends is the most important predictor, followed by PBC and attitude. Bonding social capital (an individual's disposal of strong, intimate ties) is negatively associated with attitude and subjective norm, whereas bridging social capital (an individual’s disposal of weak, superficial ties) is positively associated with the three TPB antecedents. Life satisfaction is negatively associated with attitude. This study also finds that introverted adolescents anticipate greater positive social pressure to accept friendship requests from strangers than extraverts.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0161,2016,Paper Session,"Beyond the Lab: Investigating Early Adolescents’ Cognitive, Emotional, and Arousal Responses to Violent Games",3,"Cognitive, emotional, and arousal responses to violent games play a central role in theoretical explanations of how violent media may affect aggression. However, existing research has focused on a relatively narrow range of responses to violent games in experimental settings. This limits our understanding of whether and how violent game-induced responses relate to aggression in real life. To address these gaps, this study investigated how cognitive effort, emotional valence, and arousal in response to violent games relate to early adolescents’ aggression, both cross-sectionally and over a period of one year. In addition, we investigated how a social context variable (i.e., family conflict) predicts these responses to violent games and subsequent aggression. A sample of 448 early adolescents (10 to 14 years) completed survey questions and media diaries that measured their responses to violent games. Results showed that, outside the lab, a positive cross-sectional relationship between violent game-induced arousal and aggression exists. In addition, arousal mediated the relationship between family conflict and aggression. Study findings justify increased research attention to media responses outside the lab and a need for further theoretical and methodological refinement.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0162,2016,Paper Session,Exploring the Associations Across Adolescence of Perceived Desirability for Alcohol Advertising and Skepticism About Advertising,4,"Many studies suggest that key variables representing social-cognitive responses to media messages change at different rates of adolescence, but previous research has not established the dynamics between receptivity to alcohol marketing and skepticism across adolescence. Hence, this study aims at understanding the differences in perceived desirability of alcohol advertisements across various adolescent age groups to see if there are concomitant increases in media literacy. The study demonstrates the extent to which reductions in alcohol marketing desirability follow increases in skepticism during adolescence. Data from a diverse age range of adolescent participants showed that that desirability is based on perceptions of similarity in advertising and that desirability increases across adolescent age groups. Even though skepticism also increases with age it is not a sufficient protective factor, at least on its own, as a marker of cognitive maturation.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media

Nevertheless, research on the influence of MTV reality shows on these behaviors is lacking. The current study examined the influence of this genre from a normative pathway and by exploring the role of neuropsychological systems, BAS and BIS. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 922 adolescents (M=14.96 years, 56% girls). The results indicated that BAS is positively related to the viewing of MTV shows, while BIS is not. Support was found for a positive association between MTV shows and intentions towards getting drunk, binge-drinking and smoking. Furthermore, these associations are partially mediated by descriptive peer norms. Also, approval of risk behavior by friends strengthened the association between descriptive norms and intentions. The injunctive family norms, however, did not moderate this relationship. No moderation of BAS and BIS was found.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0164,2016,Paper Session,"Social Network Site Uses, Friendship Networks, and Well-Being of Australian Adolescents",1,"Social network site (SNS) use has been associated with young people’s social relationships and networks. However, little is known about how different activities on SNSs are related to friendship networks and the overall well-being of adolescents. This study aims to systematically examine types of online activities among youth and their influence on perceived stress and well-being. An interviewer-assisted face-to-face survey of Australian adolescents aged 13–15 (N = 401) was conducted in Sydney during October and December 2013. The results show that frequent SNS users have larger online networks, interact more frequently with close friends, and feel a stronger sense of social support from friends, compared to infrequent SNS users. Having a group of close friends with whom they interact frequently (regardless of communication method), and using SNS for communicative and sharing purposes, were positively related to adolescents’ well-being. Using SNS for monitoring increased stress and was moderated by interaction with peers. The types of online activities are more important in determining adolescents’ perceptions of well-being (as measured by Satisfaction with Life Scale) and stress (as measured by Perceived Stress Scale) than duration and frequency of internet use. Communicative and sharing activities are generally favorable for adolescents’ perceptions of well-being. Close friends and social support still remain significant factors in adolescents’ well-being even in a highly connected online environment.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media

Therefore, we propose to study more implicit measures and underlying mechanisms preceding aggressive behaviors, such as self-control.

2016-0166,2016,Paper Session,The Role of Communication and Rumors in Adolescents' Perceptions and Behaviors Regarding Sociopolitical Issues: A Heuristic-Systematic Model,2,"This study examines the communication behaviors influencing adolescents’ acceptance of sociopolitical rumors and the impact of those behaviors as well as rumor acceptance on their perceived situation severity and sociopolitical participation. To examine the processes underlying rumor acceptance, we apply the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) of information processing and suggest that individuals’ patterns and overall level of communication reflect different information processes. The study focuses on the communication behaviors of adolescent population in the context of the 2008 Mad Cow Disease scare in South Korea. Results from survey data (N= 557) suggest that five communication patterns are distinctive, represent the breadth and depth of adolescents’ overall communication, and differently influence their rumor acceptance, perceived severity, and overall sociopolitical participation. Notably, horizontal communication and informative communication patterns consistently predicted these outcomes regardless of the overall level of communication adolescents were engaged in. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media

Effects of Disclosing Television Brand Placement on Adolescents,4,"The present study aimed to increase our understanding of the effects of disclosing television brand placements and disclosure duration on adolescents’ persuasion knowledge and brand responses. To do so, the study by Boerman et al. (2012) that was conducted among adults was replicated among adolescents aged 13 to 17 year old (N = 221). Departing from the persuasion knowledge model and consumer socialization theory, the present study showed that brand placement disclosure had limited effects on adolescents’ persuasion knowledge, did not mitigate persuasion, but did increase brand memory. These findings implicate that brand placement disclosure has fundamentally different effects on adolescents than on adults: the disclosures were less effective among adolescents in activating persuasion knowledge and mitigating persuasion than among adults. This study has important implications for theory, legislation and practice.",Adolescents and Media: Working Toward Adulthood,Children Adolescents and the Media

2016-0169,2016,Paper Session,Did the Internet Have Mobilizing Effects During the 2011 Egyptian Revolution?,1,"Drawing on the 2001 Egyptian Revolution, I test the mobilizing effect of the Internet. I collected original data containing information about daily variation in turnout and variation in Internet availability, created by the Mubarak government’s decision to shut down the Internet for five days. If the social media was indeed a critical mobilizing tool over the course of the revolution, there should have been (a) abrupt drop in turnout on the day the Internet was blocked, and (2) abrupt jump when it was back on. Contrary to this expectation, however, I find no evidence that the Internet mobilized more people to turn out during the anti-Mubarak movements. While this finding does not disconfirm the general notion that digital media is essential in democratic movements, it challenges the validity of one of the main causal explanations, in arguably the most well known example of massive demonstrations.",CAT Hybrid Session 5: Global Perspectives on Technology,Communication and Technology

Panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) models were used to analyze cross-national, aggregate-level data for the years 1990-2012 to gain greater understanding of emerging media systems characteristics in countries as related to sociopolitical conflict types. The primary concepts of these analyses were the presence of communication technologies in a given country and how these emerging media correlated to political instability types, mainly observable displays of anti-government activities or suppression of political opposition by governments. The initial findings provided support for the technology as a tool of repression argument, as internet and mobile phone penetration rates in countries strongly correlated with instances of government crackdowns on political opposition.

Contemporary work investigating experiential concepts and individual differences reveals that the effects of game violence are variable and context specific. However, much of the extant literature considers these concepts in isolation. The current experiment sought to extend work in this area by testing how a number of theoretically-relevant constructs affected the relationship between game violence and aggression-related outcomes simultaneously. Thus, the current study considered the relative influence of each of the included concepts to determine which variables matter most. An experiment (N = 302) determined that interactivity, skill, and transportation may increase aggression-related outcomes and flow may decrease such outcomes.

The current study looks into video game parenting among young children. Existing studies have looked into the parental mediation of video gaming: the rules and discussions. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, the current study extended this approach to include the parenting style. Leveraging longitudinal parental self-report data (N=1546) about their young children (Mage=5.4), a cross-lagged structural model was used to explore relations between parental mediation, autonomy supportive and controlling parenting style, child oppositional defiance and parental perception of problematic (addictive) game use. Both a more controlling parenting style and negative parental perceptions of problematic gaming increased defiant child behavior one year later. Furthermore, more parental concern about problematic gaming decreased parenting efforts. Together, these findings indicate that for gaming, increased concern and increasingly controlling parenting have detrimental effects on young children’s behavior.

FULL RESEARCH PAPER

Bullying can cause life-long physical and psychological damage yet it is often considered a rather acceptable form of violence. BREAKAWAY is a soccer-themed online role-playing game that aims to engage and educate youth around the world about bullying through role modeling and observational learning. This study examined the effect of BREAKAWAY gameplay on bullying victimization self-efficacy among 112 youth in El Salvador between the age of 6 and 19. A field experiment was implemented to compare self-efficacy measures among participants in a control group with two treatment groups: those who played BREAKAWAY and those who not only played BREAKAWAY but also participated in facilitated group discussions. Although self-efficacy of participants in the gameplay only condition was higher than that of participants in the control condition, the results were not statistically significant. However, when gameplay was combined with facilitated group discussions, participants’ self efficacy were significantly better. In addition, male participants in both game only and game plus discussion groups demonstrated a greater increase in self-efficacy. Implications and limitations of this study were further discussed.

2016-0181,2016,Paper Session,Revisiting the Role of Peer Communication in Normative Social Influences on Risk Behavior,3,"This study revisits the role of peer communication in normative social influences on risk behavior by applying the theory of normative social behavior (TNSB) as a guiding framework. Contrary to the TNSB, we do not understand peer communication as a moderator of cognitive mechanisms, but rather as a determinant of social norms and specify its causal role as a function of its (risk-affine vs. risk-aversive) content. We test our hypotheses on peer communication as a determinant of social norms for the case of speeding in road traffic and base our analysis on representative survey data of 1,168 German young car drivers aged 17 to 24. Findings from mediational analyses demonstrate that peer communication plays a crucial role in the formation process of social norms which, in turn, affect risk behavior, and that the communication’s health-promoting potential depends on its content’s risk-affinity. Implications for further norms-based theory development and strategic risk communication are discussed.",Health Risk Perception and Behaviors,Health Communication

Driving recklessly has increased injuries and deaths exacerbating this public health problem (WHO, 2011). In Nepal, drivers are not adequately educated about road safety rules, and regulations are also not strictly enforced. These problems pose a challenge in maintaining safety on the roads. It also hinders changing drivers’ attitude and behavior against reckless driving. Media messages may be able to alter driver’s behaviors, however little is known about which persuasive strategies are most effective. Drawing on self-determination theory and the health belief model, the current study used a post-only 2 x 2 factorial design with participants randomly assigned to conditions. The factors were strong choice message vs. weak choice message, and individualistic appeal vs. collectivistic appeal messages. The study found that in contrast to the predicted model, individualistic message influenced one’s identified regulation. Perceived susceptibility and perceived severity mediated the relationship between identified regulation and behavioral intention. Consistent with past research, behavioral intention and behavior were found to be strongly related. Further implications are discussed.",Health Risk Perception and Behaviors,Health Communication

RDT argues that engagement with society and others is perceptual, relative to immediate social contexts and variable over time.

There are often binary views towards ICTs, which either believe that new information technologies can promote economic and social development or worry that the uneven distribution and adoptions of technologies would exacerbate existing inequalities. To go beyond such dichotomized views and complicate the implication of ICTs for social equality, there would require close examinations of how people’s experiences with ICTs are coordinated and governed through various process.",Digital Exclusion and Inequality,Communication and Technology

Female heterosexuals rated all 9 GHWs as more effective than lesbians, and respondents who were not sure of their sexual orientation. Male heterosexuals reported higher perceived effectiveness than women who were unsure of their sexual orientation. Certain SGM groups found GHWs to be less effective compared with heterosexuals.

However, little is known about the MSM community, in Singapore, and its influence on sexual health behavior. Guided by the culture-centered approach, twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with self-identified gay/bisexual Singaporean men. Findings revealed a culture of sexual hierarchy, oversexualized physical and online spaces, disillusionment with finding love and the lack of a contextualized gay sexual education. These cultural factors were found to encourage risky sexual behavior in MSMs. The implications of the findings resonate with CCA which argues that health communication needs to go beyond a focus on an individual behavior to examine the cultural context the behaviors are situated within and in turn define the behavior.",LGBTQ Health Communication,Health Communication

In developing countries where piracy rates outnumber legitimate sales, can the same be true? Piracy may in fact be the norm and legitimate purchases be deviant. The dynamics of media usage in these countries is vastly different as a result and individuals have different understandings and rationalizations behind them. Contemporary studies often ignore this perspective and take the normative stance of piracy is deviant. This paper proposes a new theoretical model to understanding how individuals in piracy rich countries negotiate their media use through piracy. Using cognitive dissonance theory, this model theorizes how individuals reinforce their beliefs that piracy is normal, justify deviating from it temporarily, and possibly altering their core beliefs to piracy is deviant.

Articles were coded for “prominence” (editorial judgements about each article’s importance) and “direction” (“government responsibility”, “societal – including NGO – responsibility”, or “balanced/neutral” coverage), then combined into a composite “Media Vector” score for each newspaper, ranging from 1.000 to -0.0373 (total range: 1.373 . Eighteen of the 19 leading newspapers manifested coverage supporting government responsibility to combat rape culture.
A striking 21 variables were found to be significant, the strongest correlations linking measures of “vulnerability” to media emphasis on societal responsibility for rape and rape culture., and measures of “privilege” to governmental responsibility. Regression analysis revealed percent population under the age of 14 (r=-.672, p=.001), a measure of “vulnerability” to be the most significant variable, holding “society” rather than “government” responsible for combatting rape culture, and accounting for 42.5% of the variance.",Competitive Papers in Global Media and Culture,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0205,2016,Paper Session,Look on the Bright Side of Life: The Effects of Positive Emotional News on Political Behavior,3,"Despite consistent evidence that emotional news will cause emotional response, and that these emotional responses can explain media effects, little is known about the impact of emotional news on political behavior. Moreover, most studies in the field focus on the effects of negative emotions, and thus neglect positive emotions. By means of two survey experiments (N = 785/516), we investigate the effects of both positive and negative emotional news on political behavior. We also assess both direct and indirect effects of this emotional news content. We find that exposure to positive emotional news causes more emotional reactions among participants than exposure to negative news. Emotional responses mediate effects on political behavior, even though positive emotions only play a role in activating civic behavior. Negative emotions mediate effects on both civic and electoral behavior but prove less strong.",The Study of Emotion in Relation to News,Mass Communication

Results showed that people exposed to uncivil comments that attacked their viewpoints on same-sex marriage felt greater negative emotion but not greater aggressive intention than those exposed to no comments. Negative emotion and aggressive intentions also had positive influences on intention to participate politically about same-sex marriage. In addition, findings support a defensive response whereby incivility indirectly lead to intention to participate politically, mediated through negative affect.",The Study of Emotion in Relation to News,Mass Communication
2016-0207,2016,Paper Session,The Differential Effects of Related and Unrelated Emotions on Judgments About Media Messages,3,"The present study investigated the influence of related and unrelated emotions on judgments about the content of media messages. An experimental study was designed to manipulate both the relatedness of an elicited emotion to a newspaper article, and the depth of processing of the article (substantive vs. heuristic processing). The dependent variable was the particpiants’ attitudes toward the article. Following mood effects theory (e.g. AIM; Forgas, 1995), we expected the related emotion anger to have a stronger effect on judgments than unrelated anger. Depth of processing was expected to moderate this effect, such that it would be stronger in the substantive processing group than in the heuristic processing group. The results showed a main effect of relatedness and depth of processing, but the interaction effect was not found. Implications of the findings for understanding how emotions influence the processing of media stimuli are discussed.",The Study of Emotion in Relation to News,Mass Communication
2016-0208,2016,Paper Session,The Contingent Role of Emotions That Underlie Partisan Selective Exposure and Avoidance,1,"A recent advancement in partisan selective exposure research suggests compelling evidence regarding the separability of selective exposure and selective avoidance, yet the question of how discrete emotions could systematically shape such patterns have not been sufficiently addressed. This study explores the differential roles of fear, anger, and enthusiasm relative to selective exposure and avoidance of partisan news programs, predicting that partisan differences in general approach vs. avoidance tendencies to external stimuli serve as a moderating mechanism. A secondary analysis of 2012 ANES data strongly support the predictions. While fear and anger significantly increased the pro-attitudinal news exposure and decreased counter-attitudinal news exposure, Republicans are significantly more likely to exhibit such patterns. Enthusiasm significantly predicts exposure to proattitudinal news for both Republicans and Democrats, while Democrats are significantly more likely to increase their counterattitudinal news exposure.

2016-0209,2016,Paper Session,Conflicting Realities? How Recipients React to Discrepancies Between Media Representations and Personal Experience,3,"When recipients read, watch, or listen to news stories about domestic issues, it is possible that they are confronted with information that conflicts with how they themselves experience their social environment. Yet, only few studies have addressed how recipients react when they perceive inconsistencies between media coverage and personal experience – and how this determines the effectiveness of a media message. Drawing on an online-experiment we show that participants who are confronted with a news article about decreasing crime rates and who have personal experience with crime tend to trivialize ‘crime’ as a social issue (thereby reducing cognitive dissonance). Participants high in self-efficacy indicated a higher willingness to engage in interpersonal communication when their personal experience contradicted the media message. The willingness to engage in interpersonal communication reduced the probability that the news item could influence participants’ behavioral intentions regarding safety measures. Trivialization resulted in increased effectiveness of the media message.",News and the Active Audience,Mass Communication
2016-0210,2016,Paper Session,Experiential Media Reception: Conceptualization and Empirical Validation of an Integrative Concept,1,"The concept of an experiential mode of reception is proposed as a psychologically anchored framework concept, which allows situating, relating and eventually integrating existing relevant concepts into a comprehensive description of narrative processing and experience. The usefulness of this concept is evaluated in an experimental study (N=253 participants) using news articles as stimuli and self-report measures for data collection. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the concept for both the characterization of media reception processes and the explanation of effects: Media reception processes vary in their proximity to the prototypical experiential mode of reception and, consequently, their resemblance to everyday, primary experience. Second, they do so as a function of text features and personality characteristics of the recipient. And, third, the degree of experientiality is systematically related to emotional reactions, cognitive judgements (issue relevance), message evaluation (general liking, objectivity, credibility, informational value), and attitudes of recipients.",News and the Active Audience,Mass Communication

The news articles were either criticizing or praising American political policies in comparison to other countries. Articles were displayed to 192 American residents while selective exposure was unobtrusively logged. Self-esteem, distinctiveness importance, and distinctiveness evaluation were measured before and after the browsing task. Findings corroborated hypotheses derived from optimal distinctiveness theory but yielded no support for social identity theory. American residents preferred articles that critiqued the United States, which in turn led to an increase in self-esteem, mediated by distinctiveness importance and distinctiveness evaluation. Further, selective exposure to ingroup criticism was more pronounced for participants with higher pre-exposure distinctiveness evaluation.",News and the Active Audience,Mass Communication

2016-0213,2016,Paper Session,Conditional Impact of Facebook as an Information Source on Political Opinions: The Case of Political Reform in Hong Kong,5,"This study is interested in the impact of Facebook as a source for political information on public opinion attitudes during political controversies. In a society where the mainstream media are under heavy influence by the dominant power and yet Internet communication is largely open and free, social media may become particularly important for the transmission of critical information and viewpoints. The social media information environment may exhibit an overall “anti-establishment bias.” However, the impact of social media should vary across individuals depending on the extent and character of user selectivity. Analysis of data collected during the political reform debate in Hong Kong (N = 3,246) show that reliance on Facebook as an information source relates negatively to support for the government’s reform proposal. But the impact is strongest for people without a strong political orientation and people who do not name any newspapers as their main information source.

We examine whether hearing supportive or opposing information on partisan news outlets is associated with perceiving that other people share your opinions. In addition, we examine whether levels of perceived support are associated with the likelihood of people sharing their opinions in online contexts. Moreover, we examine whether the relationship between perceived support and sharing news varies by the individual difference variable of conflict avoidance. To test our model, we use data collected right before the 2014 mid-term election in the US.

2016-0215,2016,Paper Session,Interplay Between Public Attention and Public Affect Toward Multiple Social Issues on Twitter,3,"This study develops a conceptual framework based on three theoretical perspectives to elucidate the intricate interplay between public attention and public affect toward social issues. These theoretical perspectives include endogenous affect hypothesis, affect transfer hypothesis, and affective intelligence theory. Large-scale longitudinal data with 265 million tweets on five social issues are analyzed using a time series analytical approach. The public attention on an issue changes the public affect toward the issue per se. Social issues interact with one another to attract public attention in both cooperative and competitive ways. Instead of a direct transfer from public affect to public attention, the public affect toward a social issue moderates the interaction between the issue and other issue(s).",Public Opinion Research in the Digital Era,Political Communication

This paper seeks to address the ethicality of the film’s attempt to craft the nation’s collective memory of the conflict. Adopting the concepts of representative anecdotes (Burke, 1969), prosthetic memory (Landsberg, 2004), and truthfulness and deception (Bok, 1978) as theoretical frameworks, I argue that the film is an unethical representation of the Iraq War, because it memorializes a deceptive, monomythic narrative of American exceptionalism that vilifies the Iraqi people and glorifies the violence and morality of the individual soldier.",Global Film: Culture and Conflict,Popular Communication
2016-0219,2016,Paper Session,South Korean Hostess Film and Film Censorship During the Military Regime (1960-1979),1,"Park Chung Hee’s military regime (1960-1979) is notorious for state-operated censorship which exerted unprecedented power over film studios and directors. The military government purportedly used film censorship to distract the public from political consciousness by controlling political materials in films while condoning censorship control on sexual content. As a result, the production of soft-core adult films soared and became popular among Korean audiences. One of such films that thrived during this period, so called, Hostess Film (prostitute films) is worthy of attention because this strand of films is characterized not only for the exploitive employment of female sexuality but more importantly for the filmic representation of poverty, rape, and other lower-class issues which the state censorship board particularly sought to regulate.
In viewing such dynamics between state censorship and film, the following questions are inevitable: how was it possible that the state was willing to turn a blind eye on the explicit sexualization of women in hostess films when film censorship was at its peak? Why were the social and political aspects of this group of films about female sexual workers not seriously considered socially relevant by the government at a time when censorship was so high?
This articlw aims to unravel the above issues by scrutinizing the interplay between Park’s state censorship and hostess films using censorship records and notes. Furthermore, it offers an analysis of a hostess film, The Rose that Swallowed Thorn (Cheong, 1979) as a case study to show how this film strategically orchestrates visual and thematic elements to circumvent state censorship enforcement.",Global Film: Culture and Conflict,Popular Communication

In light of Ashis Nandy’s critique of the psychic condition of the post-colonial society, we analyze the social reception of the film in both Taiwan and Japan. We discover that in Taiwan, Kano poses challenge to the established version of the foundational history of baseball. Kano’s sanguine depiction of the colonial memory also addresses the relational nature of Taiwanese identity, in which the manifestation of its political possibilities is conditioned by the dual influence of Japanese colonialism and Chinese nationalism. In Japan, Kano’s reception was stripped of its colonial connotation. It was read mainly for its depiction of the juvenile devotion and passion for baseball. Nevertheless, Kano was also employed as a psychic introjection of Japan-ness which many considered losing in the globalizing social milieu.",Global Film: Culture and Conflict,Popular Communication

Médecins sans frontières (MSF)). To do so, I mobilize a ventriloqual approach to communication, an approach that allows to show how MSF volunteers “make do with” these seemingly incompatibles figures, that is, contradicting matters that are “talk into being” through discursive and materialize embodiments. Identified figures evolve around matters such as (1) the doctor-patient relationship, (2) the divergence of views on how to take care of patients and more broadly on (3) what is culturally sanctioned within the interaction on a daily basis. Identified con-figurations (i.e. an array of embodied figures) such as (a) experience and candour, (b) authority and collaboration, (c) ideals and practice, (d) solving problem and letting it go as well as (e) medical ethic and cultural bias are highlighted. Particularly, this empirical study discloses the ongoing negotiation and co-operation that is needed from MSF volunteers to keep up with these incompatible aspects. I thus identify and analyze, through an ethnographic approach, two key moments that reveals the dynamic interplay among these figures and that illustrate faithfully the challenge of putting up humanitarian aid.",Communicating Organizations: Strategic and Constitutive Communication,Organizational Communication

We call these communicative processes organizational handicapping strategies, and they are especially apparent when organizations formulate the problem of sexual violence. By considering two organizations where sexual violence occurs at disproportionately high rates—the U.S. military and U.S. universities—we show how organizations work to maintain themselves as good, nonviolent entities. We argue that as these organizations respond to sexual violence, both blame and agency are constantly in motion. This mobile quality of organizational handicapping strategies highlights how violence is continually organized. In other words, we show how violence is patterned into organizations.",Communicating Organizations: Strategic and Constitutive Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-0225,2016,Paper Session,"Organizational Transparency: Conceptualizations, Assumptions, and Methodological Strategies",2,"Transparency is an increasingly prominent area of research and offers valuable insights for organizational studies. However, conceptualizations of transparency are rarely subject to critical scrutiny and their relevance remains unclear. In most accounts, transparency is associated with the sharing of information and its perceived quality. But the narrow focus on information and quality overlooks the dynamics of organizational transparency. To provide a more structured overview, this paper unpacks the assumptions that shape the extant transparency literature, with a focus on three dimensions: ontologies, epistemologies and consequences. The paper provides a framework that articulates two paradigmatic positions underpinning transparency literature, namely what we term verifiability and performativity approaches. For each of these, we propose analytical and methodological avenues for future research. The paper contributes to organizational communication and management research by providing insights concerning transparency as a dynamic and paradoxical process with performative characteristics—an approach which remains underexplored.",Communicating Organizations: Strategic and Constitutive Communication,Organizational Communication

Results of our analyses indicate that only perceived classroom interaction was a statistically significant predictor of engagement, satisfaction, and motivation for both online and in-person courses. While perceived classroom interaction and instructor rapport were predictors of satisfaction in both course formats, student study habits played a role in explaining satisfaction for students in online courses and instructor credibility additionally predicted satisfaction for in-person courses.

Focusing on the positive behaviors and emotions in the higher education context, the current study aims to examine the relationship between college instructor’s supportive communication and its effects to students’ positive academic emotions (pleasure, hope, and pride); and in turn, how that influence students’ engagement in learning. Under the guidance of Emotional Response Theory (Mottet, Frymier, & Beebe, 2006), this study found that teacher informational and esteem support positively predict student enjoyment and hope; and teacher esteem support positively influences student pride. In addition, student enjoyment and pride contribute to engagement in learning. Student emotions also mediate the relationship between teacher support and student engagement.

Based on an initial analysis, we propose that normative talk about new media and communication technology is a recognizable practice in situations in which devices and their communicative capacities become relevant. These results suggest that (often device-supported) communication is treated as an accountable activity in which there are identity implications for volume of usage, certain sorts of activities, and situations in which they are engaged. This continuing work has implications for how people engage with the morality of new and emerging technologies and mediated communicative forms.","Communicative Practices to Construct Reasonableness Standards, Responsibilization, Common Ground, and Relationship Bond",Language & Social Interaction

After reading an online tutorial, 12 dyads worked together to take three types of challenging pictures, with three chances to make corrections for each picture. Both those with and without experience, and both friends and strategies participated in the task. Various uses of the five types of common ground units (CGUs) were discovered: simple, overlapped complex, same speaker expansion complex, other speaker expansion complex, and grounding at a lower level. Friends produced more CGUs when they were less experienced, and experts produced more common ground units (of all types) when they did not know the other person. The findings underscore how listener responses in a collaborative task do more than provide feedback or backchannels. Rather, recipient responses actively display understanding while simultaneously advancing the interactants’ joint project.","Communicative Practices to Construct Reasonableness Standards, Responsibilization, Common Ground, and Relationship Bond",Language & Social Interaction

Gossip is common between two individuals to avoid collapsed context (boyd, 2010), so both parties can ascertain the meaning derived from such situated interaction, it is less frequently among multiple small group users. Three forms of gossip identified in this study include (1) sarcastic gossip – negative but not malicious – on fellows, (2) gossip against authorities and (3) celebrity gossip. However, gossiping among freshmen is a life phase phenomenon, usually lasting two or three months until a solid social network with stronger ties in an offline context has been secured. Over time, the freshmen have gradually reduced their amount of time invested in such communicative capital. As result of multimodal communicative tools, social media has afforded wider and more multimodal dissemination of information to which the freshmen might otherwise have not been able to access. Gossiping is popular for they provide sources of conversational comfort and sartorial security, creating a safer net so that the freshmen could playfully navigate through the precarious life phase.","Communicative Practices to Construct Reasonableness Standards, Responsibilization, Common Ground, and Relationship Bond",Language & Social Interaction

Furthermore, it offers insight into components hardly discussed in research and allows for inferences about the underpinning effect mechanisms. A field experiment was performed in natural viewing and shopping scenarios. For the first time, children ages 3–5 were incorporated. Results of logistic regression moderation and mediation analysis show that, despite competitive influences, the risk to select a placed product was eight times as high in the treatment group as in the control group, which was moderated by age: Younger children were more likely to select the products advertised. Neither gender nor usual sweet consumption affected the correlation. Merely the timespan between stimulus and selection tended to have an influence. Findings support the assumption of an implicit persuasion process via evaluative conditioning and, partly, a mere-exposure effect.","Media, Marketing, and Children's Health",Children Adolescents and the Media

The intervention program included a Wii gaming system as well as an iPad app designed to help children better understand their food consumption and eating behaviors. The present study reports on the overall success of the intervention program and further reports on the factors serving as the strongest predictors of positive health behaviors. Results demonstrated that the use of the app enabled children to give more accurate reports of their foods when compared to free-response recollection of their food intake, indicating that the app may play a positive role in affecting children’s health behaviors and literacy. Results further indicate that children who used the Wii gaming system for exercise demonstrated an increase in heart rate and exertion while participating in specific exercise games.

This study aimed to identify and characterize child-oriented, food-branded apps. We conducted a content analysis of 50 apps produced by 36 top U.S. food companies. Very few were child-oriented. Those that were promoted a wide variety of food products. Most of these child-oriented apps featured relatively simplistic arts activities with minimal branding but many opportunities for continued engagement. These apps promoted healthier foods relative to marketing documented across other platforms. At present, child-oriented food and beverage do not appear to present a major health threat, at least relative to marketing on other platforms. However, continued monitoring and experimental research – specifically research into the effectiveness of arts-themed apps – is warranted.","Media, Marketing, and Children's Health",Children Adolescents and the Media

Method: Two waves of panel survey data are used to test relationships between TV use and BMI (n = 1,421). Path analysis is used to model effects of childhood (1997) levels of TV use and BMI on the same variables 14 years later (2011). Results: TV use during childhood is associated positively with childhood BMI (β = 0.08, p<0.05) and young adult TV use is related positively to young adult BMI (β = 0.10, p<0.01). Heavy childhood TV use also persists into young adulthood (β = 0.15, p<0.001), indirectly increasing young adult BMI (β = 0.02, p<0.05).

2016-0239,2016,Paper Session,Modeling the Adoption of Social Media by Newspaper Organizations: An Organizational Ecology Approach,1,"Although theories in organizational ecology has started to inform study in the field of communication, no prior research has applied the ecological perspective to examine organizational selection of social media. This study employs the framework of density dependence to understand what drives the adoption of social media by newspaper organizations in China. To be consistent with the conception of density dependence, the term “founding” is used to refer to the emergence of the population of newspaper organizations on Sina Weibo. Fixed-effects negative binominal regression models were run to test the hypotheses that predicted the founding rates of 2007 Chinese newspaper organizations in 31 provincial units on Sina Weibo from August 2009 to June 2015. Results show that the founding rate of party newspapers first rises and then declines with the increase of local or non-local party newspaper density and non-party newspaper density. On the contrary, the density dependence hypothesis is only supported for the effect of non-party newspaper density outside the provincial unit on non-party newspaper density. Unexpectedly, non-party newspaper density within the provincial boundary exerts no significant influence on the founding rate. Both local and non-local party newspaper density significantly and negatively influence the decisions to start homepages on Sina Weibo among non-newspaper organizations.",B.E.S.T.: Social and Collaborative Technologies in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-0240,2016,Paper Session,Organizational Boundary Regulation Through Social Media Policies,3,"A number of socio-technical developments have influenced changes in contemporary work conditions, and by extension, how employees navigate boundaries across different spheres of experience. New communication technologies, and social media in particular, have made boundaries more permeable, blurred distinctions between personal and professional communication, and weakened the separation between interpersonal and mass communication. In response, corporations have introduced policies that specify the rights, rules, and norms for employee communication and behavior on social media platforms. We argue that these policies represent a form of organizational boundary regulation. Based on a content analysis of 112 social media policies from the world’s largest corporations, we illustrate how companies with different boundary logics differentially regulate how employees should enact their identities, build and maintain relationships, and pursue particular goals in their social media activities. We discuss the implications of these regulations for employee communication in an age of boundary permeability and fluidity.",B.E.S.T.: Social and Collaborative Technologies in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

However, job candidates have access to a wide range of publically available information when searching for jobs that is not controlled by organizations. Social media tools like LinkedIn may present conflicting signals about organizational values when those signals are compared to official corporate communication, and signal inconsistency likely has negative effects for potential job candidates. Results from an experiment show that when diversity signals from organizations conflict with signals available via LinkedIn, potential job candidates view the organization as less attractive and are less likely to apply for employment. Further, these outcomes are magnified for minority job candidates. Given the importance of cultivating a diverse workforce, these results demonstrate that current diversity recruitment efforts may actually negatively impact the ability of organizations to recruit minorities.",B.E.S.T.: Social and Collaborative Technologies in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-0242,2016,Paper Session,Social Media’s Dark Side: Inducing Boundary Conflicts,1,"Using the context collapse and work-life boundary theory, this article examines the relationships between work-related social media use and employee wellbeing. Through interactions on social media the world becomes increasingly connected. While organizations may benefit from this connectivity, it may also result in spill over effects between an employee’s professional and personal life domains, which may impose conflicts. In turn, social media have often been applauded for affording the ability to effectively managing demands from both life domains. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Results are based on 575 employees that participated in this survey study. This study shows that there is a dark side to employees’ use of social media for work as they experience work demands to be intrusive to their personal lives and vice versa. Hence personal social media use for work is a source of conflict for employees and is related to emotional exhaustion.",B.E.S.T.: Social and Collaborative Technologies in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

In-depth interviews with 25 Chinese employees who currently hired by international companies in China were conducted. By drawing on the perspective of organizational socialization and a approach of media affordances, a modified constant comparative analysis revealed that social media affordance diversified Chinese newcomers’ organizational learning, deepened, as well as constrained social connections across the workplace.

This article uses positioning analysis (Bamberg, 2005) to discuss the challenges that uses of humor pose for the identity of public officials and organizations. Four dimensions of social media use and humor are suggested to factor into organizational identity construction. Particularly some forms of humor stands contrary to a bureaucratic ethos of impartiality and confidentiality. Thus, dilemmas arise for public authorities that want to remain “in character”.

The work group literature has found that dense, non-hierarchical interaction structures are associated with productive groups. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that these same structures would also lead to more productivity from new peer production communities. However, an analysis of 2,555 wiki communities shows that early interaction structures have very little impact on eventual productivity (as measured by total edits) or community growth (as measured by total contributors).

Drawing from in-depth interviews with participants in a nonprofit network organized around shared use of knowledge management technology, this research suggests that scarcity of funding and foundations’ encouragement of partnerships lead to the creation of a cooperative system.

The project seeks to open up a conversation about the less tangible qualities of a city that we carry inside us: memories, experiences, emotional connections, and aspirations. To bring these invisible aspects into focus, we designed a digital platform that allows young people to report, explain (visually and textually) and map their emotional responses to different parts of a city. By using technology to mediate an interaction between young people, researchers, city planners, and the other inhabitants of the city, the invisiblecity project grants agency to young people, allowing them to record and share information that explains how they feel about the city and why. We explore how this not only gives a voice to those that are not always heard (especially in relation to policy and planning) but allows for a renewed connection between young people and place.",CAM Research Escalator Session 1,Children Adolescents and the Media

Three types of smoking-related media messages were examined: anti-smoking messages, cigarette promotion messages, and smoking scenes in movies and TV programs. Hierarchical logistic regression showed that adolescents who saw more anti-smoking messages were 27% less likely to intend to smoke, while adolescents who were exposed to cigarette promotion messages or smoking scenes were 47% and 19% more likely to intend to smoke respectively. Mediation analysis showed that perceived descriptive peer norm significantly mediated the relationship between each of the smoking-related messages and adolescent smoking intentions. As a result, future youth smoking prevention program in China should aim to decrease such perceived descriptive peer norm.",CAM Research Escalator Session 1,Children Adolescents and the Media

Along with smartphones, social media platforms have proliferated. With the popularity of platforms, each facilitating a particular type of communication, a small group of “influencers” has emerged. These are individuals whose taste or communication style attracts large numbers of followers. Entrepreneurs have identified the power of social media influencers, building agencies that link influencers with brands and target audiences.
This research presents an analysis of this new communication channel, the social media influencer, through a survey of communications agencies that specialize in this practice.

This paper is among the first to bridge these two lines of study through a proposed theoretical model on the processes of self-concept change for adolescent social media users. Specifically, it explains the two pathways that change in self-concept can take: a) the pathway of social confirmation and b) the pathway of self-reflection. This study argues that there are two motivations for engaging in self-presentation, which are based on impression management and identity experimentation. Lastly, it outlines how this model will be operationalized through a proposed experiment.

To date, however, the role of predispositions in this relationship remains largely unexplored. One such predisposition is children’s general attention-deficit. The aim of the current study is to address whether impaired attention is a relevant predictor of children’s task-switching and extraneous problem-solving behavior when using a tablet. To that end, an online survey was administered to parents of children aged 1 ‒ 5 (N = 297). The findings show that, controlling for gender, age and weekly tablet screen time, parental perceptions of preschoolers’ task switching and extraneous problem-solving behavior when using the tablet are significantly predicted by the child’s attention-deficit.",CAM Research Escalator Session 1,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0254,2016,Paper Session,Journalism Beyond Democracy: A New Look Into Journalistic Roles in Civic and Everyday Life,2,"Journalism researchers have tended to study journalistic roles from within a western framework oriented toward the media's contribution to democracy, civic life and citizenship. In so doing, journalism scholarship often failed to account for the realities in non-democratic and non-western contexts, as well as for forms of journalism beyond political news. Based on the framework of discursive institutionalism, we conceptualize journalistic roles as discursive constructions of journalism’s identity and place in society. These roles have sedimented in journalism's institutional norms and practices and are subject to discursive (re)creation, (re)interpretation, appropriation, and contestation. We argue that journalists exercise important roles in two domains: civic life and everyday life. For the domain of civic life, we identify 18 roles addressing six essential needs of civic life: informational-instructive, analytical-deliberative, critical-monitorial, advocative-radical, developmental-educative, and collaborative-facilitative. In the domain of everyday life, journalists carry out roles that map onto three areas: consumption, identity, and emotion.",Theorizing Journalism,Journalism Studies

Yet, journalism always seems elusive. We argue in this paper that there is a need for journalism scholarship to explicitly recognize what has always been true – that journalism is best understood as a space or field where participants are not equal or even similar in terms of status, influence, work tasks and working conditions. This paper offers a model that articulates how actual journalistic labor is stratified across three dimensions – occupational precarity, organizational framework and journalistic capital. Together these three dimensions create a space in which different journalistic occupations, their work and output can be placed.

2016-0256,2016,Paper Session,A Reconciliation With Objectivity,2,"Objectivity is a central concept of journalism. Even if scholars and professionals alike have harshly criticized it, objectivity remains crucial in contemporary newsmaking. This paper seeks to bridge the disconnect between the theoretical and practical aspects of objectivity that exists in the literature by adopting a relational ontology. Drawing from Actor Network Theory, we contend that objectivity can be conceptualized as a form of recalcitrance, that is, the capacity of a statement to maintain its connection to the world by showing the elements that substantiate this connection. We argue that this ontological stance offers a way to reconcile the notion of objectivity with the various principles that guide journalists in their daily practice. We show how this can be done by proposing a method of analysis to assess the degree of objectivity of news articles by accounting for their resistance to tests. We try out the method on two case studies and, as a result, we formalize rules of method as well as a typology of tests.",Theorizing Journalism,Journalism Studies

However, here I focus on how soft biometric data about emotions is being put to work by the advertising industry. This addresses a research lacuna on the introduction and implications of advertising that scans and traces emotional life by machinic methods. I pay particular attention to the implications of privacy, but the narrative is not an obvious one because although empathic media makes use of large data sets and utilises information about the body, it often cannot be traced back to a living individual. This raises questions about the consequences of intimate rather than private data, the adequacy of our data protection laws and the role of self-regulation. I explore this matter in relation to advertising and retail drawing on an interview conducted with M&C Saatchi who launched the first empathic advertising on London’s Oxford Street.",Advertising and Privacy,Communication and Technology

As sponsored ads are built on an interactive platform that could be seen as invasive to user privacy, the growth of this advertising platform has important implications for consumers, and advertisers alike. As little research is available on consumer response to sponsored advertising as an interactive technology innovation, the current study assesses the effects of user perceptions of privacy risk, intrusiveness concerns and utilities of sponsored advertising on consumer attitudes and purchase intent. Testing a model derived form the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study found that privacy risk and intrusiveness concerns are valid antecedent variables to perceived ease of use and/or usefulness of sponsored advertising. These antecedents also influence consumer attitudes toward sponsored advertising and/or product purchase intentions. The hypothesized relations between perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitudes and purchase intentions were also validated.",Advertising and Privacy,Communication and Technology

Nevertheless, whether such consumer educational programs are effective in actually educating and empowering the consumer is unknown. By means of a two wave experiment,the current study showed that detailed consumer education resulted in more cookie knowledge than general, and no forms of education.

According to the TPB, attitudes, subjective norms and self-efficacy predict behavioral intent, which predicts behavior. For women, we argued that condom negotiation self-efficacy was more important than condom use self-efficacy. Second, fears associated with negotiating condom use were predicted to be negatively associated with attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy. African American women (N = 560; M age = 20.58) completed assessments of TPB variables at baseline and then condom use three months later. Condom negotiation self-efficacy was a significant predictor of behavioral intent while condom use self-efficacy was not. Fear of condom negotiation was negatively associated with all TPB components, which in turn significantly predicted behavioral intent and condom use. Implications for safer sex literature and STI/HIV prevention intervention design are discussed.

Research suggests some users could use Facebook news content as a substitute for other news sources. With an online survey (n = 390), we investigated how substitutive Facebook use can be explained by the feeling of being informed through Facebook and by need for cognition (NfC). Results show that feeling well-informed is an important predictor of substitutive Facebook use. NfC moderates this relationship. High NfC reduces the use of Facebook as a substitute—but only for individuals who feel well-informed.

The research also investigates the relationship between Kenya’s media freedom and journalistic autonomy. Findings show that over half (59%) of respondents believe that there is enough media freedom in Kenya. Similarly, there is a positive correlation between media freedom and journalistic autonomy - a relationship though moderate is statistically significant. While 4 in 10 of Kenyan journalists have “some freedom” in deciding what to include in news, only 15.5% enjoy “almost complete freedom”, and 31.7% have “a great deal of freedom”. When analyzed by demographics and work-related variables, male journalists reported higher autonomy than their female colleagues. Older and more experienced journalists have more freedoms than those who are younger and limited in work experience. Journalists with advanced education (doctoral and M.A. degree holders), those employed on full-time basis, and high monthly earners enjoy more job autonomy.

The study shows 1) Chinese journalists may not feel happy about the current press system in China, but this does not necessarily make them feel dissatisfied with their job; 2) in a controlled press system, journalists who find the system more acceptable are more likely to see the personal benefits offered by their job and feel contented with the work environment; and 3) journalists who find the existing press system acceptable are more likely to feel their personal impact on the news production process and see greater influence in their newspaper, and such perceptions in turn lead them to feel greater satisfaction with their job.",Journalism as Practice: Values and Perceptions,Journalism Studies

2016-0275,2016,Paper Session,Development of a New Research Method Using an Open Source Plugin for Web Analytics Software to Measure Online Selective Exposure in Naturalistic Settings,3,"Measuring audiences’ selective exposure to media content in naturalistic settings constitutes an important methodological challenge in communication research that has only partly been resolved so far. In this paper we present a new methodological approach that is based on custom web analytics software. This method allows for the tracking of selective exposure to regular online content, and facilitates the integration of selective exposure data with online survey data. We programmed a plugin for the web analytics software Piwik to create an interface for using this freely available open source software as scientific research tool. After discussing the methodological background for creating this tool, we provide a step-by-step instruction for implementation by other researchers – specifically concerning the integration of Piwik with online content and survey software as well the merging of tracking and survey data on a case-by-case basis. Research applications, advantages and limitations of the new research tool are discussed.",Methodological Advances in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

The focus of this research is to examine through content analysis the extent to which diversity exists among human samples in the mass communications research published in six premier journals over a five-year period. Based on a sample of 697 studies, this research finds that large groups of people are excluded from mass communications samples. A pro-Western bias in sampling exists across the six journals studied and some regions do not appear at all in samples. In addition, whites comprise nearly three-quarters of samples, and Latino/as and older adults are particularly underrepresented. Samples with children are rare.

Undergraduate students are still the researchers favorite subjects, but the importance of respondents recruited on the Internet is on the rise. This paper deals with the fuzzy concept of convenience samples, outlining their reasonable uses and limitations. To bolster the theoretical discussion on convenience samples with empirical evidence, findings from the non-commercial SoSci Panel, a large-scale volunteer respondent pool, are presented. Convenience pools allow for larger samples than traditional convenience samples, more heterogeneity, and better long-term availability of respondents. Given those advantages, convenience pools bear the potential of being the next rising type of convenience samples. This paper discusses conditions of setting up a respondent pool, as well as the related methodological and practical implications (software, efforts, respondent activity and loyalty).",Methodological Advances in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

2016-0279,2016,Paper Session,Beur Broadcasting and Minority Representation in Postcolonial France,1,"The basic premise of this paper is an attempt to map discourses of ethnic identity, power, and media (specifically radio) in the peripheral space of the banlieues of 1980s France. The settlement and citizenship of ethnic North Africans in France made it necessary to rethink articulations of identity in terms of a greater multiplicity of experiences specifically the role of radio in the production and dissemination of these discourses, and what populations are empowered and excluded by dominant discourses of French national identity.
In postcolonial France I focus on a five-year period from 1981-1986. Within this time frame, my central research question is: What does the early development of Beur broadcasting demonstrate about the role of minority radio in resisting mainstream media representations and discourses of identity?
I argue the case of Radio Beur suggests that the ability of minority radio to resist mainstream media representations and discourses of identity lies in its ability to coordinate campaigns across diverse and distant areas and expand cultural referents to shift cultural geography in relation to the spaces in which radio operated. While the alternative discourse produced by Radio Beur was initially very rooted in the place from which it emerged (despite the limited dispersal of the Radio Beur enterprise), much of its power derived from its ability to enter discourses beyond the delineated and stigmatized space of the banlieues. Broadcasting in the Beur movement indicates a fundamental shift in French identity and its mediated representations
Analyzing the beginning of Beur broadcasting in France offers a specific example of a moment when minority voices have resisted dominant discourses and agitated for more expansive definitions of national identity. In the 1980s in France, the limitations of the French nationalist broadcasting system led to innovation and appeal to affiliations beyond France’s borders in order to fill an ignored need for self-representation.","Politicized Communication: Movements, Ideology, and Modernity",Communication History
2016-0280,2016,Paper Session,"From Propaganda to Realism and Humanism: Three Phases of Chinese Photojournalism, 1937-1988",1,"China’s photojournalistic field undertook great transformations in the 1980s. While the conservatives continued to cling to the propagandistic doctrine, a more progressive trend was emerging. The tension between these two forces had its historical roots and would go on to shape the way Chinese photojournalism developed. Based on archival research and oral history interviews, this paper revisits the history of Chinese photojournalism between 1937 and 1988, examining three periods and addressing three questions: First, how did propaganda become the dominant mode of Chinese photojournalism production between 1937 and 1949? Second, how did Chinese photojournalists put propaganda into practice between 1949 and 1976? Third, how did different photographic groups combat the deep-rooted propagandistic tradition in pursuit of realism and humanism? The paper concludes by analyzing the complex interplay of power dynamics among individual photographers, media institutions, and the larger political and economic structures that shaped Chinese photojournalism within the timeframe.","Politicized Communication: Movements, Ideology, and Modernity",Communication History

Humour, caricature and satire have a long history as forms of public communication in France. In particular, the July Monarchy is seen as a period when satiric print publications flourished and approximated the Habermasian ideal of an authentic public sphere. This study gives a historical overview of the development of the satiric press in the political and social context of the July Monarchy mainly from 1830 to 1835 and assesses the validity of assigning to its reading public the label of “public sphere.” In the process, a critical perspective is applied to both the notion public sphere and satiric communication in terms of their ability to mediate imbalances in the distribution of discursive power and resources across society.","Politicized Communication: Movements, Ideology, and Modernity",Communication History

Specifically, we looked at the case of Journalism and Women Symposium, a women journalists’ organization established in 1985 by a group of feminist journalists who were key figures in the second wave but continued and expanded their activism in the 1980s and 1990s. Our analysis shows that these second wave feminist journalists, while remaining committed to the feminist cause of the 1960s, identified new issues and used their writings to articulate a more inclusive feminist vision. By aggressively incorporating the younger generations into the activist network they built, they were able to carry over the second wave goals and repertories and lead the younger generation into the third wave feminism.","Politicized Communication: Movements, Ideology, and Modernity",Communication History
2016-0283,2016,Paper Session,Casting an ‘Outsider’ in the Ritual Centre: Two Decades of Performances of ‘Rural Migrants’ in CCTV’s Spring Festival Gala,1,"Recent years have seen the rise of the ‘processual approach’ in media ritual studies, which focuses on the making of media rituals through various ‘ritualised actions’ rather than assuming them as isolated events distinctive to ordinary broadcasting. This article advances this line of argument by shedding light on a previously less-discussed form of ritualised action: the ritualised casting. It examines how the character of ‘rural migrant’ has been staged in the 28-year history of China Central Television’s Spring Festival Gala and how the casting of this ‘social outsider’ served as a dynamical strategy in the process of ritualization of the Gala. The case study demonstrates a persistently central position of the image of ‘rural migrants’ in the Gala in the past 21 years, yet the scripting of this ritual subject varied as the agendas and crises of ritualization shifted. This ritualised casting not only delivered a self-replicating effect that made the success of the Gala as natural and desired; but also, it exhibited a power to converge the media’s categories with other social categories, which further legitimised the ritual authority of the Gala as a mediated centre in the festival space of the Chinese New Year.",Textual Analyses in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

Whereas the former disproportionately conveyed “citizens’ possibilities” during the 1994-5 provincial, national, and European election period, the latter consistently framed their rhetoric in overwhelmingly political terms. From these findings, we draw inferences on citizens’ mutual interpretations within authoritarian societies (what is permitted) versus functioning democracies (what is legal), suggesting that only the latter affords the basis for the social construction of democracy.",Textual Analyses in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

As predicted, the lyrics of musicians who committed suicide contained more first-person singular pronouns, discourse with higher immediacy, and were written more dynamically compared to the lyrics of nonsuicidal musicians. These findings suggest that publicly written forms of language, such as lyrics in popular media, can provide insight into the private psychological states of the artists who write them and add to a growing line of research that uses automated text analysis techniques to evaluate social and psychological dynamics.",Textual Analyses in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

The performance of the adversarial interview involves breaching societal norms of politeness and as such can be perceived as hostile. A common strategy to preserve the appearance of non-bias while engaging in confrontational questioning is to present hostile-seeming questions as if they derive from a third party. The assumption that third party techniques produce balanced and fair representations of conflicts, however, is problematic. Taking a critical discourse analysis approach to three interviews of prominent figures in the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the BBC news interview show HARDtalk, I demonstrate that the manner in which third party critique is employed can be interpreted as revealing of bias.",Textual Analyses in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication
2016-0287,2016,Paper Session,"Alternative Citizenship Models: Mapping the New ""Good Citizen""",1,"Expectations about “good citizenship” are often anchored in conceptions of the informed citizen or dutiful citizen. Evaluated through such models, some are worried about waning youth democratic engagement. A different perspective suggests that young people today are attracted towards a different model of citizenship, one that values self-expression, creativity, and connection to existing cultural interests. This paper considers a range of recent arguments about changing forms of citizenship as an emerging paradigm of alternative citizenship models, reflecting both new modes of participation, as well as different norms around good citizenship. Conceptualizing alternative citizenship as an emerging paradigm helps us to notice common threads, as well as to identify gaps and weaknesses in the paradigm as a whole. These include a paucity of empirical examinations of alternative citizenship, and insufficient attention to the role of the changing media environment.","Citizenship, Community, and Civic Engagement",Political Communication
2016-0288,2016,Paper Session,Political Participation in Nonpolitical Online Communities: The Role of Sense of Community,1,"Previous studies of political participation online have focused on political forums and blogs. With recent evidence of political participation in non-political online communities, this study explores important factors that affect political participation in non-political online communities. Alongside of conventional predictors of political participation, such as socio demographics, political characteristics, and news media use, this study examines the role of sense of community in political participation, specifically political communication (reading, writing), attitudinal civic engagement (political tolerance), and behavioral engagement in online and offline political activities. An online panel survey was conducted for non-political online community users, and a total of 405 responses were used for analysis. Results showed that political polarization, political efficacy, and Internet credibility were associated with reading. In case of writing, reading about politics is the most significant predictor of writers. Sense of community was also significantly associated with writing. This study also found that being female, sense of community, reading politics and writing about politics are positively associated with political tolerance. Younger age, internet news use, reading, and writing were significant predictors of online civic engagement; mass media, writing, and sense of community were significant predictors of offline civic engagement. Democratic implications of political participation in non-political online communities were discussed.","Citizenship, Community, and Civic Engagement",Political Communication

The participants were mainly educated, full-time, working professional males with a strong interest in the off-road traffic regulation. Even though women were a minority, they produced more ideas than men. The crowd is motivated by a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic motivations include the desire to do one’s “civic duty” and to deliberate with and learn from peers. Extrinsic motivations include the desire to change the law to resolve a specific issue that the participant cares about. These motivations are, in part, similar to those in traditional democratic processes, such as voting, and in other online collaborations such as crowdsourced journalism and citizen science. The crowds’ behavior is paradoxical: they participate despite the fact that they don’t expect that their contributions will affect the law.","Citizenship, Community, and Civic Engagement",Political Communication

During the last decade, a range of studies conducted mostly in industrialized countries has studied whether the enthusiasm about the mobilizing impact of ICTs holds true. While these studies have produced some evidence on the potential of ICTs for established democracies, we observe a rapid dissemination of ICTs (particularly mobile phones) in less developed regions of the world like sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is not covered by many empirical studies. Thus, countries in SSA are of particular interest for political communication research. This paper analyses how far western research models carry in describing and explaining effects of ICTs in SSA. By scrutinizing the international literature and the scarce studies on African countries, we illustrate the different research perspectives and offer guiding for future research.","Citizenship, Community, and Civic Engagement",Political Communication

In 1993, following liberalization of the media market, local broadcasters and business interests launched a radio station dedicated to broadcasting music and other programming aimed at this community. The success and enduring popularity of this station spawned an industry of Indian music format radio in Trinidad and Tobago that has seen the addition of several other stations over the years and their migration to transnational broadcasting via the World Wide Web. This scenario brings together the historical global influences of colonialism and indentureship with modern globalized realities of Indo-Trinidadian cultural dynamics (within and beyond Trinidad and Tobago) and the global reach of modern media. In order to examine the dynamics of global and local currents in which historical Indian influences and modern Indian content are manifest in a historical diaspora and in new media forms, the present paper investigates the content of user comments on Facebook pages of Indian music format radio stations in Trinidad and Tobago.",Top Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

New communication technologies have also made possible reconfiguration of business value chains in the media sectors, allowing vertical integrations between the media, telecommunication and Internet sectors. In this way, industrial convergence has enabled Indonesian media conglomerates to maintain and even intensify their symbolic and economic power. In fact some conglomerations are now controlling not only communications content through their mass media corporations, but also communications infrastructure and networks through their telecommunications and Internet companies.

This paper explores the unique form and function of satire within a democracy, how language restrictions limit broadcast radio satire, and therefore how a First Amendment right is diminished through its control by a U.S. government agency. Finally, in his dissent, this paper explores how Justice William Brennan prophetically warned that the U.S. Supreme Court Pacifica ruling was a classist, hegemonic effort to re-enforce the values of a dominant culture in the guise of the public interest.",Governing Free Speech and Information in the 21st Century,Communication Law & Policy

The statutory defense of publication on ‘a matter of public interest’ was designed to reflect the reportage defense while removing a judicial tendency to apply the defense limitedly.
Few have paid close attention to the current status of neutral reportage as a statutory defense in UK libel law; therefore, this paper examines neutral reportage in English libel law under common law and under the Defamation Act.",Governing Free Speech and Information in the 21st Century,Communication Law & Policy
2016-0308,2016,Paper Session,Beyond Admissibility: The Prosecutorial Affordances of Social Media Use,2,"Using data from seven recent New York City gang indictments, this paper examines how communication on social media (e.g., Facebook messages, Tweets, photos on MySpace) gets translated into acts of gang conspiracy. We situate our work within recent discussions of the use of social media by law enforcement and the courts. Legal scholars working on this topic have primarily focused on the question of admissibility, especially as it pertains to expectations of privacy and free speech. We take a different perspective by asking what about social media communication makes it useful to prosecutors. Drawing on literature on the affordances of social media in organizations, we examine the prosecutorial affordances of social media use. Our research integrates content analysis of indictment documents with fieldwork in Harlem. Our findings show eight distinct ways that prosecutors used social media evidence to define and prosecute gangs. The most forceful prosecutorial affordance was the conflation of saying and doing.",Governing Free Speech and Information in the 21st Century,Communication Law & Policy

Accomplishments and Challenges in Enforcing China’s First Freedom of Information Law,1,"China’s first freedom of information law, Open Government Information Regulations (OGI Regulations), went into effect in May 2008. After analyzing annual OGI reports released from May 2008 to December 2011 by various levels of Chinese government agencies, the paper finds that Chinese government has been fairly successful in establishing the foundational freedom of information platforms and forceful in enforcing proactive disclosure requirements under the law. The paper also finds that most OGI requests made from 2008 to 2011 were granted. This paper identifies problems that hinder people from having more meaningful access to governmental information. A disturbing trend is for courts and government agencies to bypass the law by making non-disclosure decisions for non-legal or procedural reasons.",Governing Free Speech and Information in the 21st Century,Communication Law & Policy

This essay examines this campaign in the context of postracial understandings of race relations in the United States. Specifically, this essay argues that the creators and participants of the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign learn and teach through strategically communicating and circulating personal experiences to collectively expose and challenge systemic inequities, representations, and interactions perpetuated by postracial, colorblind ideologies.",Race and Ethnicity Across Learning Environments,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

In addition to identifying helpful message features, it is important to understand factors that influence people’s evaluation of support. In an online message perception study 785 participants read everyday discrimination scenarios and evaluated support messages that were manipulated for message features, message quality, and source ethnicity. Participants evaluated the messages for general effectiveness, effectiveness in achieving multiple goals, affect change and collective-esteem enhancement. Research questions investigated three moderators between message quality and message evaluations: source ethnicity number of support receiver’s inter-ethnic friendships, and severity of everyday discrimination scenarios. Source ethnicity did not moderate the influence of message quality on message effectiveness, multiple goal outcomes, and message outcomes. However, source ethnicity influenced message evaluations when participants reported no having any inter-ethnic friendships. Scenario severity did not influence message evaluation and message outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",Race and Ethnicity Across Learning Environments,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Three ideological discourses emerged through the students’ discourse before, during, and after the seminar—Individualism and Meritocracy, Post-Racialism/Color-blindness, and “Reverse Racism.” I analyzed these discourses using a Critical Discourse Analysis approach that most closely follows Fairclough. I then discussed findings from the study that include participants’ subject positioning within the discourse, the implications of ideological discourses that perpetuate the pervasiveness of whiteness and white privilege, and how these discourses reinforce social practices that reify hierarchies, power relations, and status positionings.

2016-0313,2016,Paper Session,"Helping the Homeless: Empathy, Race, and Support for Homelessness in America",3,"What will motivate citizens to support efforts to address homelessness? Empathy can have positive effects on attitudes and motivate altruistic behavior. Thus appeals designed to invoke empathy may be effective in motivating donations and moving policy preferences. Feldman and colleagues (2015) demonstrate that individual level differences in empathetic ability affect peoples’ expressions of sympathy and support for government assistance. At the same time, empathetic ability does not always have these effects. And their research fails to examine the effect that the race of beneficiaries may have. Here we explore the role that individual empathetic ability, race of beneficiaries, and the inclusion of an explicit empathetic appeal have on willingness to donate to the homeless and support for government efforts to address homelessness. We find no main effects of race or empathetic appeals on donating behavior, though providing empathetic information increases sympathy. We also uncover interesting heterogeneity in how individuals react.",Information and Perceptions of Out Groups: Between Empathy and Conflict,Political Communication
2016-0314,2016,Paper Session,I Saw You in the News: Mediated Contact With Outgroups Can Improve Outgroup Attitudes Above and Beyond Direct Contact,2,"This study extends the boundary conditions of mediated contact theory by (1) differentiating between contact quantity (i.e., visibility of outgroups in the media) and quality (i.e., tone of the media coverage), (2) examining whether mediated contact exerts effects above and beyond interpersonal contact, and (3) offering causal as well as generalizable evidence. We use a two-wave panel survey data on a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 2322) and match the individual-level data with data on the amount of coverage about two outgroups, Muslims and Poles, in eight newspapers and with the results from sentiment analysis on the tone of that coverage. Mediated contact improved outgroup attitudes, with contact quantity exerting stronger effects than contact quality. Furthermore, mediated contact improved attitudes independently of direct outgroup contact. These findings emerged for both outgroups, across several outcome measures, and using several approaches to capturing mediated contact. Because we relied on panel data and fixed effects analyses of within-person change, we offer strong causal evidence that mediated contact is sufficient to improve attitudes toward general outgroups and in the absence of a campaign and/or counter-stereotypical outgroup exemplars.",Information and Perceptions of Out Groups: Between Empathy and Conflict,Political Communication
2016-0315,2016,Paper Session,Je Suis Charlie? The Framing of Ingroup Transgression and the Attribution of Responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo Attack,4,"This paper examines the effect of historical transgressions associated with individuals’ ingroup on attribution of responsibility for the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. While the capacity of media frames to induce emotional states is well documented, the current study expands the understanding of the underlying processes associated with the framing effect by highlighting the ability of frames to induce collective level emotions. Through an online experiment (N= 136), we suggest that framing the attack in reference to American transgressions (abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison) initiated collective guilt, resulting in less attribution of responsibility for the attack to Islam and less support for anti-immigration policy in the United States. Conversely, framing the event in terms of American victimization (9/11 attack) engendered high levels of collective victimization, subsequently heightening the perceived responsibility of Islam in the attack and harnessing support for anti-immigration policy. Relevant moderators are considered, and practical and theoretical implications are discussed.",Information and Perceptions of Out Groups: Between Empathy and Conflict,Political Communication

To test this postulate in a mediated context, the purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which affectionate communication as a type of relational maintenance behavior on Facebook is associated with liking, trust, commitment, control mutuality, relational satisfaction, and communication satisfaction. Undergraduate students (N = 132) completed a questionnaire in reference to their relationship with a randomly selected Facebook friend. The results of linear regression analyses provided support for the hypotheses in that expressed affection through Facebook was significantly associated with the six favorable relational characteristics examined in this study.

Facebook use heightened overt narcissism among those who were less concerned about impression management and freely expressed their inner thoughts and feelings. Contrary to the common belief that Facebook use makes people more vulnerable to external evaluations, Facebook use lowered covert narcissism, albeit only for those who were less inclined to closely monitor their Facebook friends for self-evaluation. Moreover, Facebook use enhanced self-esteem among those who expressed their true-self and avoided social comparison on Facebook. Results demonstrate that Facebook use exerts divergent effects on users’ self-views depending on the extent to which they utilize the social technology in an other-directed (vs. inner-directed) manner.",Mediated Close Relationships: Interpersonal Communication Online,Interpersonal Communication

The current manuscript covers a first attempt to test the effects of four different types of employees’ online boundary management behavior (Ollier-Malaterre et al. 2013) on reputation (i.e., respect and liking) in a professional context. We conducted an online experiment (N=257) in which individuals were randomly exposed to a Facebook profile page showing online boundary management behavior of a possible colleague. Respondents rated this person on ‘liking’ and ‘respect’. Results indicated that integrating personal and professional contacts elicits higher levels of likability than segmenting different audiences. Posting self-enhancing messages gains more respect than posting self-verifying messages. Hence, integrating different audiences and sharing self-enhancing content seemed the best online strategy to gain respect from and being liked by potential co-workers.",Mediated Close Relationships: Interpersonal Communication Online,Interpersonal Communication

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two instruction conditions indicating that the messages were delivered to a romantic partner either face-to-face (FtF) or over a computer mediated communication (CMC) device (i.e., text message, phone call, or FaceTime message.) Additionally, the messages were randomly presented in text, audio, or audiovisual format. Results indicated that denials (relative to confessions), audiovisual messages (relative to audio and text messages), and FtF messages (relative to CMC messages) were judged as more suspicious and deceptive. Findings are interpreted in the context of the Projected Motive Model for veracity judgments and provide novel insight on the functions of CMC in romantic relationships.",Mediated Close Relationships: Interpersonal Communication Online,Interpersonal Communication

However, despite the online social networking is booming, little is known about how offline interpersonal uncertainty influences online social networking behavior. This study seeks to bridge the gap between these two. A survey of 244 Facebook users examined the mediating effects of offline liking and intimacy in predicting the use of online interactive uncertainty reduction strategies. In general, individuals’ online social networking is forced by their offline relational status. For those uncertain about their partners, liking and intimacy diminish the impact of uncertainty and motivate online interactions. For individuals uncertain about their relationships, liking and intimacy reinforce the impact of uncertainty and discourage online networking.

2016-0321,2016,Paper Session,Measuring the Effects of Traditional vs. Satirical News on Moral Judgment: A Study With fMRI and Structural Equation Modeling (Top Student Paper),1,"Exploiting fMRI and structural equation modeling, the present study explores how traditional news and its more entertaining alternative, satirical news, influence a viewer’s moral judgment. The case explored here is whether one’s moral cognition is influenced by the news context in which the issue is presented, separate from the issue itself. The findings indicate that traditional news induces stricter moral judgments than satirical news does. Moreover, the data show that traditional and satirical news evoke different patterns of brain mechanisms in making moral assessments on the same event. Building on the internal hypothesis, this study defined a hypothetical neural network model for moral judgment and demonstrated that the more “conscious” process associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was enhanced in the model for traditional news. The current article also found evidence in support of the hypothesis that the more “automatic” thought processes driven by the cerebellum may be preponderate in moral decision making under satirical news. In addition to involvement of the PFC and the cerebellum, the study provides evidence that the temporoparietal junction (TPJ)mediates the neural process of moral decision making in both news contexts. The results uncover neural evidence that satirical news may stimulate an automatic mode of processing for moral appraisal, whereas traditional news promotes a more deliberate process of viewer cognition.

In the present study, we use neuroimaging methods to test an account of information selection and sharing that emphasizes inherent reward in connecting with others. Participants completed an fMRI session while they considered reading and sharing New York Times articles. Activity in hypothesized neural networks involved in reward, self-related processing and taking the perspective of others was significantly associated with decisions to read and share articles. Activity in all three networks was greater when participants considered sharing with others versus reading articles for themselves. Engagement of these regions was also positively associated with preference for the articles. Findings suggest that people consider value not only to self, but also to others when deciding to read news articles. Further, the process of sharing heightens these pathways, supporting an account of humans deriving value from connecting to others via sharing.",Best Papers in Information Systems Division,Information Systems

Lang, 2014). The basic assumptions are: a) humans are embedded in the world, thus human perceptual systems are attuned to the environment, b) emotions have evolved to save energy and facilitate survival and sustainment of an organism, and c) individuals’ interactions with media are fundamentally natural. The environmental attribute considered in this study is illumination, and we test the proposition that darkness of the environment is a worldly condition that leads to activation of the aversive system. Results supported the prediction that darkness in a VE would potentiate the startle reflex in users as it does in the natural environment. Furthermore, the study found variation in aversive activation as a function of different virtual and physical environmental conditions combined with individuals’ responses to the VE darkness.",Best Papers in Information Systems Division,Information Systems
2016-0325,2016,Paper Session,"Educational Systems, Digital Learning & Literacy, and Inverted Funnel Paradigm: A Capabilities Approach to Understanding Gains",1,"This paper contends that presence of multiple educational systems - particularly in developing countries - creates conditions and infrastructural divisions that allow for systematic, unequal and access of varying quality to digital learning and literacy. This process creates differentiated capabilities which in turn affect gains or pay-offs over time for the beneficiaries (students) of those systems. Ultimately, this can widen the gap between the rich and the poor and create a limited capabilities loop as technological dependence increases in economies. Therefore, mere spread of digital technologies or ICTs (for example cell phone or the Internet) cannot be seen as a sign of development but rather how well can an individual use it to attain subjective utility and freedom. Using Amartya Sen's capabilities approach to development, preliminary results from a case study [work in progress] on Pakistan's educational system is presented followed by development of Inverted Funnel Paradigm. The paradigm models pay-offs/gains over time for digital learning and literacy continuum. The project has implications for future thinking, research and policy making when it comes to ICTs in schooling systems.","CAT Hybrid Session 1: ICTs, Divides, and Privacy",Communication and Technology

Researchers have shown that some coping strategies are effective in terms of stopping or decreasing cyberbullying victimization, however no longitudinal studies have investigated the effectiveness years after being cyberbullied yet. To this aim, a five-wave panel study was conducted among a sample of [NATIONALITY ] adolescents aged 10 to 17 years old at baseline. At this moment, four waves of data have been gathered. First results show that only a few coping strategies influence later cyberbullying victimization. More precisely, only talking with parents (seeking support) was found to be an effective middle-term coping strategy.

According to legal and normative views of privacy, personal secrets should be placed at the heart of its protection regardless their nature. However, there might be a difference between what people consider “private” and what is considered “secret.” Viewed as a basic human right, individuals want to protect their privacy as well as respect that of the others. A secret, on the other hand, is something that one wishes to keep from the others but does not want others to have. We argue that such a difference between conceptions of privacy and secrecy may help explain why many Internet users condone or even participate in privacy violations of others, show apathy towards privacy violations and dissemination of stolen information, and engaging victim shaming while still holding strong beliefs in the right to privacy.","CAT Hybrid Session 1: ICTs, Divides, and Privacy",Communication and Technology

The present study fills this research gap by looking at young people and their piracy activities in general. The main research question is how and why young people (12 to 18 years) use file sharing or downloading services and video streaming sites to obtain pirated media. It examines their attitudes towards copyright infringement and asks how they justify their own behavior. The study uses a mixed-methods approach. In a quantitative survey, 461 young people completed an online questionnaire, 11 from these participants were selected for qualitative in-depth interviews. A cluster analysis and subsequent qualitative inquiry revealed three types of users regarding their attitudes towards copyright infringement and the services they use.

In a two-by-three design, a news story from CNN about the health effects of obesity was manipulated to 1) include a verbal frame either emphasizing obesity’s individual or social determinants and 2) include an image depicting an obese or non-obese individual, or no image. In the online experiment, participants were randomized to one of six conditions. Audience perceptions of the causes of obesity, endorsement of policy interventions and behavioral intentions were measured. Results suggest that in the absence of an accompanying image, verbal frames alone might not be effective in influencing audience response in the frame suggested direction. However, images of obese individuals reinforced the effectiveness of both the individual and social determinants verbal frames on audiences’ causal attributions about obesity.

The current study analyzed patient log data as each patient engaged in an integrated eHealth system called the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) and reports on how patients engage with different combinations of eHealth services over time. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (N=443) were given access for six months to one of four different configurations of CHESS:(1) Information, (2) Information and Support, (3) Information, Support, and Coaching (Full CHESS), and (4) Full CHESS and Mentor. Besides a baseline survey, three follow-up posttests were administered. Action log data on how patient engaged with the CHESS were also collected and merged with surveys to examine how patients benefit during the cancer experience. The findings suggest that usage patterns were not competitive, implying that cancer patients’ access to more complex tools generates more use with their time spreading out over the diverse services. Despite overall decline in usage rates, it was less severe in Full CHESS and Mentor condition, suggesting that communication functions drive long-term engagement with the system.

Deep tailoring that integrates the cultural values, norms, and religious beliefs of the target ethnic group indicated a significantly stronger effect compared to surface tailoring, which only incorporates surface cultural features such as language, diet, music, and risk statistics. Moreover, the moderating effects of cancer types, ethnicity, narratives, media channels, message design approach, gender, and research design factors such as study setting and comparison groups were explored. The theoretical and practical implications of the study were discussed.",Top Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0342,2016,Paper Session,Monitoring the Opinion of the Crowd: Media and Social Psychological Mechanisms Underlying Public Opinion Perceptions on Social Media,1,"Social media technologies offer several features allowing users to monitor other people’s opinions on public issues. Initial research showed that user-generated content can shape recipients’ perceptions of the majority opinion on societal problems. Still, it remained largely unexplored under which circumstances people gauge other users’ opinions through social media and whether perceived opinion climates affect people’s opinions and communication behavior in these environments. Results of a two-session experiment revealed that people’s fear of isolation sharpens their attention toward user-generated comments on Facebook which, in turn, affect recipients’ public opinion perceptions. The latter influenced subjects’ opinions and their willingness to participate in social media discussions. These findings are discussed in light of the spiral of silence theory and the projection hypothesis.","Social Media, Discussion, Deliberation, and Public Opinion",Communication and Technology
2016-0343,2016,Paper Session,"Hostile Social Media Effect: Influences of Partisanship, Social Endorsement, and Outrage on Willingness to Engage in Online Discursive Activities",2,"An online experiment (N=210) examined the role of partisanship and social endorsement cues (e.g., Retweets in Twitter) in instigating perceptions of hostile biases in social media contents about a contentious issue (campus carry). Our study results indicate that higher levels of social endorsement in Twitter messages affect partisans’ perceptions of hostile biases in the social media environment. The perceived hostile bias elicited outrage among participants, which in turn influenced people’s willingness to engage in online discursive activities such as voicing their opinions and starting conversations with others. The mediating role of outrage suggests that cognitive involvement alone in the hostile media perception may not be sufficient to elicit behavioral changes.","Social Media, Discussion, Deliberation, and Public Opinion",Communication and Technology
2016-0344,2016,Paper Session,Social Media and Political Discussion: When Online Presence Silences Offline Conversation,3,"This paper explores the relationship between use of social media, attitudinal strength, perceived opinion agreement with social ties, and willingness to discuss a political issue in different online and offline contexts. Unlike the anonymous environment of internet forums in previous generations, social media are closely tied to the activities of everyday life. As such, use of social media is likely to affect everyday conversation about political issues in on- and offline contexts, including the home, workplace, social gatherings with friends, community meetings, and on social network sites. Based on a national probability survey, we find that the use of social network sites (i.e., Facebook and Twitter) has a direct, negative relationship on deliberation in many offline settings. Some uses of these platforms are associated with lower perceived opinion agreement with social ties and this further reduces the willingness of social media users to join political conversations in some offline settings.","Social Media, Discussion, Deliberation, and Public Opinion",Communication and Technology
2016-0345,2016,Paper Session,A Matter of Perspective: Experiences of Moderators in Online Policy Deliberation,1,"Human moderation is one way to facilitate better and more inclusive deliberative engagement in online environments with high barriers to participation. We present an interview study of moderators in RegulationRoom – one such platform for engaging the general public in consultations around federal rulemaking proposals. Our findings reveal that moderators primarily perform two kinds of activities: managing the stream of comments and responding to commenters – both aimed at a short-term goal of facilitating high quality public input into the particular policymaking process. Managing the immediate goals of online policy deliberations, however, might overshadow a more important long-term goal: helping individuals develop participatory literacy beyond a single policy engagement. Our contribution is twofold: we unpack the practice of human moderation in online deliberative environment with high barrier to participation, and suggest both design and process implications for sustainable growth of civic engagement environments.","Social Media, Discussion, Deliberation, and Public Opinion",Communication and Technology
2016-0346,2016,Paper Session,Are Migrants All the Same? Mapping Attitudes to the Resettlers From Post-Soviet South in the Russian Blogosphere,4,"In Russia of 2000-2013, ethnic tensions have become a widespread phenomenon resulting into violent conflicts in Moscow and other cities, as well as into general rise of hostility towards social groups united under the label of ‘migrants’. Public attitudes towards ethnic groups are believed to be a factor influencing the spill-over potential in an ethnic conflict. Recent opinion polls and qualitative studies suggest that, in the European Russia, inhabitants of and re-settlers from the post-Soviet South have caused the biggest amount of ethnic-oriented public discussion and are perceived as the most dangerous and aggressive ethnicities. Using LDA-based topic modeling, statistical analysis, and interpretative reading, we analyze a 360,000-post dataset from the Russian-language Livejournal to map the ethnic attitudes, including those towards ‘migrants’. Our results contradict the existing picture of unified negative perception of post-Soviet re-settlers and suggest that they are not the ones to cause the biggest amount of hostile discussion in the post-imperial blog discourse of Russia.",Ethnicity & Race Across Eurasia,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2016-0347,2016,Paper Session,"Hybrid Frenchness and Republican Citizenship: The Singer Ridan Calls Out ""The Bastards"" of French Politics",1,"This paper examines the work of the French singer Ridan, specifically his 2012 album “Madame La Republique.” The album challenged the racial regime in France and was criticized heavily (and refused radio air time), particularly for the song titled “Ah, les Salauds” (“Ah, the bastards”), in reference to French political leaders. I examine the videos for “Ah, Les Salauds” and “Madame La Republique,” the title track, in a context in which voices critical of racial politics in France are frequently excluded from mainstream media. I show how Ridan uses his fluency in both minority and mainstream French culture to launch a critique of racism and exclusion powered by his cultural competence as a hybrid French citizen and his patriotic claims for belonging and inclusion. I theorize Ridan’s intervention as “hybridity from within” — a form of hybridity that insists on its presence in the centre in order to reconfigure it, posing a subaltern challenge to the hegemony of “classic” Frenchness.",Ethnicity & Race Across Eurasia,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

2016-0349,2016,Paper Session,"Communicating Antiracism: Social Movements, Nonprofit Organisations, and Their Mediated Claims-Making in Finland and Sweden",1,"Although Paul Gilroy in the 1990s talked about the ‘end of anti-racism’, recently, media technological development, particularly social media, has offered new ways for participation and activism to occur. At least in Finland and Sweden, this type of civil society-rooted anti-racism, which seemingly occurs spontaneously and is mainly performed in various online forums, currently seems to be on the rise. However, due to such phenomenon as clicktivism and slacktivism, there is no guarantee that increased activity (as in liking and sharing) contributes to new spaces for the construction of inclusive communities in which politically and socially challenging agency can take form. The starting point for this paper is hence that technologisation processes, together with the increase of neo-conservative and xenophobic movements across Europe and a general tendency to understand radical anti-racism within a framework of political extremism, have created new conditions for anti-racist claims-making. From the perspective of media and communication scholarship, and drawing on the politics of listening and political claims-making theory, this paper examines the content, circulation of and reactions to anti-racist claims in Helsinki and Malmö – two urban milieus marked by different historical, demographic, social and political realities.",Ethnicity & Race Across Eurasia,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2016-0350,2016,Paper Session,Both Sides of the Story: Communication Ethics and Media Accountability in Transition,2,"Current transformations in the media landscape are challenging contemporary communication and media ethics in at least two ways. First, digitization of the media creates new ethical problems that stimulate calls for a re-definition of the norms and values of public communication. Second, new instruments of web-based media observation introduce new possibilities for media (self-)regulation and accountability, thus complementing the initiatives of traditional institutions like press councils. The paper retraces those conflicting developments by reference to two comparative studies, representing the diverging traditions of conventional communication ethics and media accountability research. In bridging over the conceptual gap between the two forms of research, the article develops new perspectives for ethical reflection in the mediatized worlds of the digital age.","Media Technology Industries: Online Journalism, On-Demand, and Streaming Services",Communication and Technology
2016-0351,2016,Paper Session,The Differential Effects of External Versus Internal Communication Features in Digital Magazines,3,"This study investigated the effects of external and internal communication features on consumers’ attitude toward a digital magazine, and the processes underlying these effects. In a two-wave experiment with a 2 (external communication features: present/absent) x 2 (internal communication features: present/absent) between-subjects design, 192 participants were exposed to a digital tablet magazine in which the presence of interactive features was manipulated. The results show that digital magazines with either external or internal communication features are perceived as more interactive, which has a positive influence on consumers’ digital magazine attitude. More importantly, the findings reveal that – in contrast to external – internal communication features also enhance feelings of social presence, which is another process through which digital magazine attitude is positively affected.","Media Technology Industries: Online Journalism, On-Demand, and Streaming Services",Communication and Technology

2016-0354,2016,Paper Session,"Looking at the River, Thinking of the Sea: A Cross-Industrial Comparison of Streaming Media Services",1,"Digital streaming media services are increasingly common in ever more segments of the media industries. Frequent calls for a Spotify or a Netflix for books, magazines or newspapers illustrate how such services are seen to answer to the demands of audiences and producers alike. Moreover, such appeals reveal how streaming is seen as a universal model for digitized media. Based on readings of existing literature, industry reports, press reports, and company websites, this paper examines streaming media services across various media industries including book, magazine and comics publishing, television, computer games, film, music and newspapers. It employs a theoretical framework of innovation theory as applied to the media industries coupled with concepts derived from media management and new media studies. The paper provides an overview of streaming media across media industries, a categorization of various models for simultaneous online provision of media and a proposed definition of streaming media services.","Media Technology Industries: Online Journalism, On-Demand, and Streaming Services",Communication and Technology
2016-0355,2016,Paper Session,How the Language Style of Small Claims Court Judges Does Ideological Work,2,"Small claims courts were created to help ordinary people settle small disputes quickly and cheaply. To make non-lawyer folks feel comfortable, small claims trials were designed to relax legal rules and be relatively informal. A consequence of the justice system’s commitment to informality is that small claims trials exhibit significant variation. A small claims trial in Court A with Judge X can be quite different from a trial in Court B with Judge Y. After overviewing the different ways language/discourse styles and ideology have been conceptualized, we provide background on small claims court and describe the data. The centerpiece of this paper is an analysis of three cases taken from judges in different small claims courts. We show that judges vary in how they: (1) open a trial and frame what they will be doing, (2) announce and justify their decision, and (3) question litigants and solicit their stories. In concluding, we suggest how the style manifested by a judge accomplishes ideological work, instantiating different understanding of justice and what a reasonable relationship between ordinary disputants and the state should be.","Language Use in Small Claims Court, Public Meetings, Consultations for Over-the-Counter Medicines, and Health Information Consumers' Online Comments",Language & Social Interaction

Taking a discursive approach to energy system transformation highlights the importance of understanding how communication and discourse contribute to shifts in policy, culture, and norms. Using Cultural Discourse Analysis (CuDA) (Carbaugh, 2007), we identify cultural discourses of community identity and analyze how they are leveraged within public participation at city council meetings regarding municipalization, examining how Boulder’s “progressive” “commitments” to be an “innovative” “leader” are manifested in citizens’ testimonies in support and opposition of forming a municipal utility. Following the contours of these cultural discourses can provide insight into energy system transformation, interactional dynamics of public meetings, and design of culturally-appropriate public meetings.","Language Use in Small Claims Court, Public Meetings, Consultations for Over-the-Counter Medicines, and Health Information Consumers' Online Comments",Language & Social Interaction

For example, information about cancer prevention may cause decisional conflict. Yet, posts and conversations shared by health information consumers online, in unstandardized format, are not readily actionable for interpretation and decision-making. This study extends prior research on the use of natural language as a predictor of consumer attitudes and provides a link to the decision-making by evaluating the predictive role of uncertainty indicators expressed in natural language. Analyzed data included free-text comments and structured scale responses related to information about skin cancer prevention options. The study identified natural-language indicators of uncertainty and showed that it can serve as a predictor of decisional conflict. The natural indicators of uncertainty reported here can be used to facilitate the monitoring of health consumer perceptions about cancer prevention recommendations and can inform communication campaign planning and evaluation.","Language Use in Small Claims Court, Public Meetings, Consultations for Over-the-Counter Medicines, and Health Information Consumers' Online Comments",Language & Social Interaction

Focus group data from this study revealed that consumption of host country news media was mainly connected to immigrants’ strategies to assimilate the culture, politics and language of the host society, while exposure to international news strongly correlated with participants’ strategies of integration strategies in both countries. This research also found that participants’ educational background and language skills combined with their perceptions of the host country’s news predict the use they make of news for assimilating and/or integrating into the host society.

This study targets Chinese (Mainland) migrant workers who come to Macau, a Special Administrative Region of China, with a regulated labor market that controls the flow of people and workers. From in-depth interviews with five participants, WeChat was found to be a sign and means for collectivism and security. Through WeChat mainland migrant workers could gain information and entertainment; WeChat also helped with socialization and mood adjustment. Interpersonally, WeChat is a place for building bonds and friendships with previously acquainted others, but not for seeking out relationships with new friends, including local Macau people. This may explain why workers use WeChat for bonding with other mainland workers, and have little interaction with local Macau society. Findings of mainland migrant workers’ holding onto ethnic culture are better explained as their voluntary seeking for comfort and strength rather than maladaptive.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication

2016-0364,2016,Paper Session,Communication for Development and Social Change: Lessons Learned in Community Engagement in the Ebola Response,7,"While the Ebola outbreak is not completely over the international public health and development community has engaged in efforts to understand what worked and what did not, and identify lessons for future global public health emergencies. As the outbreak exploded into a global crisis, local communities had begun to take action to protect themselves from the disease, and the role of communication gradually shifted towards a greater focus on community engagement. This paper draws on four case studies from Liberia and Sierra Leone with a focus on the capacity of communities to mobilise and build collective efficacy and action. Drawing on Communication for Development (C4D) and social change principles, these case studies examine the community engagement component of the response and highlight efforts taken at the local level to share information and put protection and prevention mechanisms in place with the aim of ‘keeping people safe’ and stopping the transmission of Ebola. Each case study illustrates the multiple interactions (and potential tensions) that occur between individual, interpersonal, community, organisational and policy levels of engagement, reports different C4D approaches as they were implemented on the ground, and provide insights for future efforts on the community engagement component of public health emergencies.",Top Papers in Global Communication and Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change

The results of the quantitative content analysis reveal that as a transnational news outlet, CNN International more frequently used close-ups and tracking shots to feature refugees in its visual reporting than German news magazine Der Spiegel. The large presence of the “human interest” and the “lose/gain” frames in CNN International visual coverage humanized refugees and called the world’s attention on humanity. By contrast, in Der Spiegel’s coverage, the “human interest” and the “law and control” frames were almost equally adopted. These results provide discussions about whether or not the elements of global journalism are reflected in today’s transnational as well as national news media contents.",Top Papers in Global Communication and Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change

Field sites are compared, beginning with design. Similarities: ephemerality of posts, high speed of exchange, a seemingly outdated interface, serendipity enabled by lack of commodification, and most importantly, a collective mentality among board users. Differences: level of anonymity, subforum structure, and moderation systems. While design effects user action, we argue for culture's primacy. Particularly close attention is paid to the culture of “hacking the attention economy” and the thereby reinforced norms communicated through transgressive play. The study represents an effort to gender men beyond sexual practices while simultaneously extending the discussion of message boards with a transgressive bent beyond the Anglosphere. We conclude that when considering the propensity to trigger offline action, the relationship between platform culture and norms of the larger society must be accounted for.",Top Papers in Global Communication and Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0367,2016,Paper Session,The Case for Communication Rights: A Rights-Based Approach to Media Development,3,"From the 1980s international organizations have devised strategies to develop national media systems to make them more diverse and inclusive, and preserve local cultures. In many countries these strategies have been unsuccessful and information has become a commodity as the interests of private actors prevent many groups from full access to communication rights. This paper attempts to provide a new view on media development from a rights-based approach, derived from a critique to dominant perspectives from international organizations with a too strong focus on technology provision. The paper argues for media development based on the right to communication as an alternative to commodification of information. Through examples from Brazil and Kenya the paper illustrates that viewing communication as a basic right can lead to the inclusion of more voices in the public discourse. Furthermore, a model for media development is proposed that suggests states’ involvement in preserving local cultures.",Top Papers in Global Communication and Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0368,2016,Paper Session,The Road to Rebuilding Media Theory: Computational and Network Approaches to Mass Communication,1,"One of the most important tasks facing media scholars in the 21st century is reexamining the relevance of classic mass communication theories in a new information environment. Major technological and social transformations have changed the practices of media production, dissemination and consumption. Deregulation in the media sector, along with the advent of digital technologies, has lowered barriers to entry, giving rise to countless sources of news and entertainment. The proliferation of distribution channels has prompted speculations about the fragmentation of the media landscape, while personalization and selective exposure trends have motivated studies of audience fragmentation.
Recent technological developments have no doubt put into question existing theoretical and methodological approaches to mass communication. At the same time, these developments have provided the tools needed to address emerging challenges in media effects research. This work argues that computational methods, large-scale digital data collection, and new modeling techniques (combined with qualitative domain knowledge) can help us gain a nuanced understanding of media influence and public opinion formation in the digital age. The article also highlights the need for better transparency and replicability standards in the field of communication.
Network science methods are examined as one key way of conducting investigations of social and technological interactions, as well as diffusion of information and patterns of influence among individuals, groups, and organizations. This paper presents a network-based model of media message flow and agenda-setting processes to illustrate how the computational exploration of complex systems can produce important insights into mass communication theory.",Advancing Theory Building in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

As indicators of the profession’s development, the topics of our field are at the core of this work. Following this line of reasoning, we analyze how the topics in communication science have evolved over time. We therefore evaluated more than 15,000 articles from 19 academic journals, by means of a machine-based content analysis (topic model). Although a discipline strongly interconnected with the surrounding media landscape, our results show that communication science features a consistent set of topics that has defied social and technological transformations.

A content analysis was conducted based on 200 presidential images presented by the leading newspapers and the official presidential office websites in the U.S. and Korea. Findings reveal significant differences between the two countries in terms of look, type, view point, and complexity of the photographs. More specifically, the proportion of casual look, documentary style, pictures showing the rear/back shot or a detailed view, and high complexity images of President Obama in the U.S. were considerably higher than those of President Park in Korea where virtually all images were authoritative, photo opportunity style, front or side, and informational. Those images seen by the public and the differences of how the presidents may be portrayed could be influential in shaping the public’s perception of these presidents.","Selective Visuals: Politics, Metaphors, Narratives",Visual Communication Studies

The research was held to show how different media platforms structure a global crisis and what kind of mediated reality is presented to the public. Specifically, the study examines whether a social networking service’s presentation of an epidemic describes coherent features of reality, showing a possibility to function as an alternative journalistic medium. Even though individual activities on social media are fragmented and disconnected, the study attempts to find if such information as a whole demonstrates some kind of narrative that is either similar to or different from what is constructed by mainstream media. To test this specification, the study conducts a comparative visual analysis on the Ebola images spread by the United States’ newspapers and those spread on Twitter.","Selective Visuals: Politics, Metaphors, Narratives",Visual Communication Studies

With regard to protests and demonstrations, images are of a dual importance: on one hand they serve as vehicles for visibility; and on the other they serve to communicate feelings and atmosphere that are crucial constituent elements of any such action. This paper focuses on a small scale protest in Greece by school teachers demonstrating against impending dismissals, in 2014. Two sets of photos are analysed, contrasted and compared: the photo-reportage of four Greek mainstream newspapers; and the photos of a freelance photojournalist. This analysis of news photography shows how the selective portrayal of images of a Greek protest illustrate and contribute to wider issues and understandings concerning dominant news framings, on both informational and symbolic levels.","Selective Visuals: Politics, Metaphors, Narratives",Visual Communication Studies

The objective is to provide a first step in understanding how these visually represented metaphors impact one’s understanding of big data by first identifying the frequency with which big data is represented as each metaphor.

2016-0377,2016,Paper Session,The Role of Face-Saving and Communication Anxiety in Chinese EFL Students’ In-Class Participation: An Extension of the Theory of Planned Behavior,4,"Chinese demand for American-style education is on the rise; however, importing US education style in China is challenging: Chinese students are in fact reluctant to communicate in class, especially orally. In our study we proposed a novel approach to understand Chinese ESL students’ in-class participation based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010). Our extended TPB-based model was tested by administering a questionnaire to 199 Chinese university students enrolled in a Sino-American university. Data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling method (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2014). Overall, our findings provided some support to our proposed model. The model accounted 47% of explained variance in intention to participate in class and 18% of variance in actual behavior. Attitude, norms, perceived behavioral control/self-efficacy, and face saving contributed in explaining intention to participate, whereas communication anxiety did not appear to play a statistically significant role.",Instructional and Developmental Top Paper Panel,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2016-0379,2016,Paper Session,Examining the Teacher Confirmation-Student Learning Relationship Through the Evaluation of Multiple Theoretical Explanations,2,"Teacher confirmation is often correlated positively with a wide spectrum of student learning outcomes in the classroom. Although instructional communication scholars have produced overwhelming evidence to support this claim, the mechanism by which this relationship operates is still unclear. Multiple theoretical perspectives have been forwarded by instructional communication researchers to explain the relationship between teacher confirmation and student learning, but few attempts have been made to evaluate these frameworks. Therefore, this study sought to examine the utility of the Instructional Beliefs Model, the Motivation Model, and the Receiver Apprehension Model as possible explanations of the confirmation-learning relationship. Findings from mediation analyses uncovered relatively equal support for all three perspectives, suggesting that confirmation indirectly enhances learning through its unique effects on other student constructs such as academic self-efficacy, state motivation, and receiver apprehension.",Instructional and Developmental Top Paper Panel,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2016-0382,2016,Paper Session,Image Capital and Identity Politics in the Age of Celebrity,1,"The field of celebrity studies has quickly been saturated with numerous terminologies, classificatory systems, and ever-increasing definitions of what it means. Graeme Turner (2013) synthesizes it all into an expanded entry: “celebrity is a genre of representation and a discursive effect; it is a commodity traded by the promotions, publicity, and media industries that produce these representations and their effects; and it is a cultural formation that has a social function we can better understand” (p. 10). This paper will first trace the development of the concepts mentioned in that overarching definition. It will then map out some positions on the celebrity function in politics. Finally, adapting these frames, I use some current formulations of “celebrity capital” to propose a new analytic category – identity/image capital – that opens questions on how and where celebrity might interact with identity, image politics, and activism in regards to gendered, raced, and queer celebrities.",Strategies and Tactics in Popular Politics,Popular Communication
2016-0383,2016,Paper Session,Glenn Beck and Affective Media Production,1,"This article examines the emergence of right-wing broadcaster of Glenn Beck as a case study of affective media production. Affect is central to the political and economic logic of contemporary media production. In soliciting the affective and collaborative labour of audiences and users affective media necessarily deploys discourses of social transformation, autonomy and critical knowingness. Beck’s show exemplifies this logic with Beck functioning as a leader of the Tea Party movement who perform ‘free labour’ (Terranova 2004) for Fox News, and Beck’s own media empire, while experiencing this as a form of revolutionary education. Where this audience movement speaks to the political ontology of affective media is in the return of a fetishistic ‘symbolic efficiency’ (Dean 2010a, 5). Beck articulates an antagonistic division of the social with a populist community of jouissance and individuation both threatened and constituted by the rapacious enemy.",Strategies and Tactics in Popular Politics,Popular Communication
2016-0384,2016,Paper Session,Producing Popular Politics: The Infotainment Strategies of American Campaign Consultants,1,Entertainment and popular culture are increasingly intertwined with political communication. This research studies this intersection from the perspectives and practices of those who hold the power to direct this communication: U.S. professionals who work behind-the-scenes on campaigns and on behalf of elected leaders. Drawing upon a unique qualitative dataset – dozens of interviews with these elite operatives involved – this research examines their roles in and attitudes toward the venues and values necessary to popularize politics. The findings demonstrate how consultants reposition political narratives from traditional media outlets to more pleasurable genres (particularly comedic) and script messages with acute attentiveness to image. The study considers how these storytelling adaptations fit within wider transformations in news and political information and critiques such efforts to privilege the sensational and stylistic in contemporary American electoral discourse.,Strategies and Tactics in Popular Politics,Popular Communication

These leaders were depicted through the cow, the bear, the lion and the eagle, animals with vastly different cultural connotations.

2016-0387,2016,Paper Session,The Determinants of Investor Relations on Corporate Websites,2,"This study investigated how firms have built Investor Relations(IR) on their corporate websites, a factor which previously marked the integrated and advanced strategic communication responsibilities in Korea. Drawing on resource dependency and neo-institutional perspectives, we found that two significant factors increased the level of IR on websites(WIR). Korean corporations were more likely to increase the level of WIR if they sought to decrease resource dependence to important resources, which are maintaining investors and price, as well as if they tend to follow the corporate business norm. In order to empirically present, we conducted hierarchical multiple regression and logistic regression analyses. Results showed that Korean corporations advanced WIR not only for acquiring investments from the stock market but also for being acknowledged as a social enterprise in the society which was more strongly supported. For hypotheses testing, corporate resource dependence was measured as (ⅰ) leverage, (ⅱ) foreign listing, (ⅲ) the ratio of major shareholders, (ⅳ) volatility of stock price, (ⅴ) free float, and (ⅵ) the ratio of minority shareholders. On the other hand, the likelihood company conforms to the business norm was utilized as variables such as (ⅰ) the affiliates of big group, (ⅱ) the member of Korea IR Association, (ⅲ) the ratio of foreign shareholders, (ⅳ) SRI index designation, (ⅴ) IR events, and (ⅵ) the listing age of company. For consideration of company size and performance effect, each company’s capitalization, asset, return of equity, earning per share, and number of employees were set up as control variables. Level of WIR, final dependent variable, was formed by content analysis of 704 KOSPI listed companies’ websites in Korea.",Communicating With Power: Stakeholders and Corporations,Public Relations

Using a case study approach, this paper analyses an organisation's past and present CSR/CSV communication to consider whether or not there is a difference between what an organisation does and communicates under the banner of CSV, as opposed to what it used to be doing and communicating under the banner of CSR. The findings of this research suggest that organisations may simply be reframing activities previously done and communicated under the banner of CSR as CSV, without actually changing their business practices. The results also highlight that organisation may be conceptualising CSV to fit their current business practices and agenda, instead of adapting their business practices to fit the theoretical conceptions of CSV.",Communicating With Power: Stakeholders and Corporations,Public Relations

This paper employed a narrative analysis approach to interpret CSR videos of the global fashion brands in this case. Narrative structures and character formations were deconstructed to identify the negotiation of values among different stakeholders portrayed in CSR narratives. Our interpretations suggest that social media serve as a communication platform for CSR narratives to reach their maximum dramatic effect from constructing the heroes and framing the dilemmas that the Bangladeshi victims faced. In particular, the wrongdoers transformed as protagonists through third-party endorsements and viewers experienced the stories while engaging in a theatre through digital platforms.",Communicating With Power: Stakeholders and Corporations,Public Relations
2016-0391,2016,Paper Session,Frame Mismatch: How Framing Communication as Transmission Hinders Interdisciplinary Collaboration,4,"Scientific and traditional organizations are increasingly reliant upon interdisciplinary relationships to foster the development and application of new forms of knowledge. Although broad recognition of collaboration’s appeal exists in these contexts, research suggests that efforts to facilitate interdisciplinarity still fail frequently. This paper develops the concept of communicative frames, or the conceptualization of the type of communication necessary to accomplish ones goals, as one mechanism that may explain the persistence of these collaborative difficulties. We offer a case study of a scientific organization in the midst of implementing interventions to foster collaboration. Analysis shows how management’s framing of collaboration as a simple process of information transfer led to the persistence of barriers that hindered the deeper interpretive practices necessary for effective collaboration. The findings offer implications for how we conceptualize interdisciplinary collaboration, and how we might organize interventions to effectively grow these types of relationships.

2016-0393,2016,Paper Session,Did You Receive What We Provided? A Study of the Coevolving Resource Networks after a Technological Disaster,3,"When an extreme event happens, important questions are often asked: whether the resources received by the affected communities match what the supportive individuals and organizations believe what they have provided and in what ways, and how suppliers themselves receive resource for the operations. To answer these questions, this study draws on the ecological and evolutionary perspective to examine the evolving and co-evolving resource relationships between affected communities and response organizations after an incident of gas explosions that occurred in Taiwan in August 2014. Data were collected from interviews with the affected communities and a survey with response organizations. Findings of the study suggest the existence of a few central resource contacts identified in both of the response organizations’ resource provision network and the affected communities’ resource receipt network. Mutual resource dependence was observed as response organizations’ receipt of resources from the affected communities and other entities influenced their delivery of support albeit with varying effects in later phases of disaster response. Moreover, the change of the network structures in both populations of resource provision and resource receipts over time reflected the evolution of the overall disaster response community. Discussion is presented as to the findings’ implications for organized behavior in the disaster context through the lens of community ecology and community resilience.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-0394,2016,Paper Session,How Communication Impacts Team Performance: Exploring Collective Intelligence and Transactive Memory System as Mechanisms,3,"Research has demonstrated the importance of communication for team performance. While previous research has found types, patterns, and modes of communication that benefit team performance, considerably less attention has been paid to the volume of communication in the early stage of the team project, and its role in facilitating team information processing. In this paper, we examine the relationship between teams’ early communication and their later performance, and explore team cognition as one important mechanism. We specifically focus on two constructs of team cognition: collective intelligence and transactive memory system. We hypothesize that the amount of early communication is positively associated with collective intelligence, which in turn leads to a well-functioning transactive memory system, and that transactive memory system mediates the positive impact of collective intelligence on performance. These hypotheses were supported in our data on 41 MBA-student teams.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

The aim of this chapter is to dig deeper into these findings and study the role(s) of sexual identity when participating in these verbal fights. The chapter concludes that sexual identity was performed to justify positions along existing polarising participation frames, that politically engaged users did not shy away from this more mundane and more emotive space to voice opinions, and that flaming can be considered as a performance of queerness.","Extended Session: LGBTQ Europe, US, and Networks","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Statistical analysis of responses confirm that the enjoyment of the movie is explained by considering that represented sexual intercourses to be not excessive, the artistic-dramatic justification of the scenes, the appreciation, the perceived realism of the sex scenes and the experienced sexual arousal. Results also show that the use of lesbian sex as a lure is a crucial factor for eliciting enjoyment and appreciation of movies featuring images of explicit sex.","Extended Session: LGBTQ Europe, US, and Networks","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

This article proposes that this change can be described using the diffusion of innovations theory to explain how the gay community began gaining social acceptance when it began to no longer hide its sexual preferences and to openly interacting with non-gays following the Stonewall riots, thereby creating an information exchange that promotes diffusion. The documentary films Before Stonewall and After Stonewall will be used in this article to provide context and direction through the insights that they provide into the hidden life that gays led before the Stonewall riots and the activism that occurred afterwards.","Extended Session: LGBTQ Europe, US, and Networks","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Preliminary findings indicate the potential of #lesbiancouple photos for making visible a variety of sexual identities (beyond lesbian) and their intersection with diverse representations of gender, race, class and intimate relationships. These representations are, however, tempered by encoded platform discourses and community practices giving prominence to mainstream depictions of identity through consumption and normative relationship conventions of romance and domesticity.","Extended Session: LGBTQ Europe, US, and Networks","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Despite the growing interest, academic research into persuasive games has yet to deliver conclusive evidence for their effectiveness as a persuasive communication product. The current article investigates the research into persuasive games and offers a new theoretical scope to guide further research. Theories from game studies and psychology are combined to construct a conceptual model for the mechanisms through which games can influence their players’ attitudes. This model draws from the Elaboration Likelihood Model and focuses on the experience of the player by taking game, player and play session factors into account. After describing each factor’s potential influence on the attitude-changing outcomes of playing these games, we outline the multiple avenues of research our conceptual model opens up to pave the way towards conclusively validating the effectiveness of persuasive games.",For the Greater Good: New Approaches in Serious Games,Game Studies

Fifty-five community-dwelling Singaporean older adults diagnosed with subthreshold depression were assigned to perform either Wii Sports exergames or traditional exercise (indoor blowing and basketball shooting) once a week, for 6 weeks. Depression was assessed every two weeks, while positive emotions and self-efficacy were assessed at pre- and post-test period. Results from multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) at post-test period indicated that participants in exergames had significantly lower depression and higher positive emotions, than those in traditional exercise. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect between exercise platform and time was highlighted in the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on depression among older adults.

This paper explores the online dimensions of this behavior. Data from the online game EverQuest 2 are used to explore community sizes in both the regular setting and the human-threat setting (player versus player, or PvP). Data from two points in time were used. At both points in time PvP guilds, on average, were larger in terms of accounts as theorized, suggesting people feel there is safety in numbers. The character to account ratio for guilds, that is, how many characters a player has, was smaller for PvP guilds, suggesting the need for specialization in this difficult setting. Standard deviations for both characters and accounts were smaller for PvP guilds, suggesting that guilds that are too small are difficult in PvP but also that guilds that are too large may not have enough cohesion.",For the Greater Good: New Approaches in Serious Games,Game Studies
2016-0413,2016,Paper Session,Testing the Effects of Administering a Pretest on the Effectiveness Assessment of a Hospital Fire Safety Game,4,"The present study aims at testing whether the administration of a pre-test has a direct effect on post-test scores (practice effect) and/or an indirect effect by making participants more receptive to the intervention (pre-test sensitization) in the context of digital game-based learning (DGBL). For this purpose, an effectiveness study of a fire safety training in a hospital was conducted using a Solomon four-group design. The four conditions in our study were DGBL intervention with or without pre-test and slide-based lecture with or without pre-test. A 2x2 ANOVA showed an interaction effect between pre-test and intervention indicating pre-test sensitization. More specifically, a pre-test influence is only detected in the slide-based lecture, leading to positively biased scores among participants receiving a pre-test before the slide-based lecture. Both game groups, however, outperformed both slide-based groups, showing that the DGBL training was more effective than the slide-based lecture regarding performance.",For the Greater Good: New Approaches in Serious Games,Game Studies
2016-0414,2016,Paper Session,"College Student Adjustment in the United States and Belgium: Family Communication Patterns, Advice, and Support",6,"This study examines how college students’ family communication environments influence their social and academic adjustment during the first year of college in two distinct cultures: Belgium (N = 513) and the US (N = 431). Four structural equation models were tested to determine the mediating effects of (a) perceived family support and (b) quality of advice from parents on associations between family communication patterns (FCP) and student adjustment. Although most relationships are more complicated than predicted based on FCP theory and research, several patterns occur across models and populations. Conversation orientation tends to foster positive adjustment for both cultures while conformity orientation promotes negative adjustment for Belgian students. In addition, perceived family support and advice quality mediate several relationships between FCP and adjustment. Differences between the two cultures, theoretical implications for FCP, and practical implications for academic counselors are discussed along with avenues for future research.","Parenting, Family Communication, and Child Outcomes",Interpersonal Communication

Content and thematic analyses of 127 foster parents’ FENs illuminated nine emergent themes – better off, special, temporary, forever, birth parent choices, birth parent learning, deeper meaning, just the facts, and do not tell story. Structural equation modeling revealed significant relationships between FEN themes, foster child adjustment, and foster parent-child closeness. Findings expand knowledge about how foster parents discursively manage birth parent identity and clarify family boundaries, and effects of telling and not telling FENs on child well-being.","Parenting, Family Communication, and Child Outcomes",Interpersonal Communication
2016-0416,2016,Paper Session,Is Parenting Everything in Family Communication?: The Association of Parenting Styles With Family Communication Patterns,2,"There are several theories regarding parent-child relationships that focus on parenting styles and family communication patterns, with two of the most prominent being Baumrind's Parenting Styles and Koerner & Fitzpatrick's refined Family Communication Patterns Theory. Despite the potential relationship between parenting styles and family types, little work has been done to empirically connect them to one another. Therefore, given their similarities, this study highlights the connection between these two typologies. We also examine their adherence to and/or divergence from established gender norms. As mothers and fathers have been documented to have different styles of communicating with their children, we examine the influence of parental gender on parenting styles and family communication patterns. Ultimately, as results suggest direct associations between parenting styles and family types, this analysis enhances the theoretical foundation of each theory and expands the current understanding of family communication and parent-child relationships.","Parenting, Family Communication, and Child Outcomes",Interpersonal Communication

Furthermore, the study repositions uncertainty as a transformative process that can help create space for new meanings to emerge. Results from 52 narrative interviews reveal six types of uncertainty and six management processes. In addition, uncertainty served to disrupt three commonly held assumptions about families that enabled children to make sense of and gain distance from their unhealthy relationship. Taken together, results suggest that the estrangement process is marked by chronic uncertainty that can serve multiply functions. Theoretical implications and practical applications are discussed.","Parenting, Family Communication, and Child Outcomes",Interpersonal Communication

The present study developed an analytical and theoretical framework to assess which of these two channels gains preference during an exploration of children’s response to their parents’ incongruent communication. Incongruence is conceptualized as a discrepancy or contradiction between verbal/nonverbal communication. Parent–child interactions (n=160) in structured joint game sequences were filmed in their homes and analyzed using a mixed multivariant design. The study expanded the existing research by analyzing a wide range of social and situational contexts. The findings delineated the contexts for nonverbal primacy, verbal primacy, and reciprocal incongruence. The presented framework advanced composite theoretical accounts into a set of conclusions for verbal versus nonverbal primacy.","Parenting, Family Communication, and Child Outcomes",Interpersonal Communication

Based on the latest large scale survey of Chinese journalists in 2013, this study finds that Chinese journalists have a pluralistic perception about media roles, they perceive the disseminator role to be the most important role, while they despise the adversary role to some extent. The survey also suggests that Internet adoption and political ideology are significant predictors of media role perceptions. Furthermore, the analysis reveals the joint effects of both Internet adoption and political ideology on media role perceptions.Implications of findings are discussed in the understanding of journalistic professionalism and social transition in China.","Journalistic Roles: Perception, Performance, Identity",Journalism Studies

Scholars often conflate the attitudinal and performative aspects of journalists’ roles, as well as their normative and empirical dimensions. This article advances an understanding of journalism as a discursive institution and of journalistic roles as being discursively constituted. Journalistic roles are negotiated in a relational structure – the discursive field – where journalists, news outlets and media organizations struggle over discursive authority in conversations about journalism’s identity and locus in society. Journalistic roles are articulated and enacted on two distinct levels: role orientations (normative and cognitive roles) and role performance (practiced and imagined roles). The process model of journalistic roles proposes a circular structure, where normative, cognitive, practiced, and imagined roles are connected through processes of internalization, role enactment, narrativization, normalization, and negotiation.","Journalistic Roles: Perception, Performance, Identity",Journalism Studies

The present study utilized a quasi-experimental design to examine the impact of attractiveness and role congruence on source credibility and reader loyalty for female sport print journalists. A sample of 328 individuals read a newspaper story involving football/volleyball, authored by a man or woman of varying attractiveness. For women, attractiveness was related to reader loyalty, but not credibility. Furthermore, males were perceived as stronger fits than females covering football.

Through a network analysis, the study analyzed over 4,000 news stories to assess the dominance and co-existence of role performances. The study further assesses how journalistic roles are performed in its networks with different sources to provide further indication about differences between the two media systems in regard to professional roles of journalism. The results reveal that the watchdog role remains one professional performance that is significantly different in its connection to sources between the United States and Chile. Results indicate that the watchdog in the U.S. case is highly connected to political and government sources, whereas in Chile the watchdog is not as prominently connected to government sources and less performed overall.

This study investigates how patterns of S&T related searches in Google and Wikipedia change over time, differing between ""ad hoc"" terms that are often motivated by media coverage, and ""cyclic"" terms that are associated with the education system.
Findings show that the online attention to ad hoc terms is significantly shorter than that of cyclic terms. The engagement in Google and Wikipedia for ad hoc terms largely matched, but did not match for cyclical terms. The findings indicate the importance of external cues such as media coverage and the education system, but also of the online engagement process, and particularly the crucial role of Wikipedia in gaining S&T knowledge.",Using Big Data to Examine Science Communication and Research Communties,Communication and Technology
2016-0424,2016,Paper Session,Acquiring Science Knowledge From Social Media: An extension of the Cognitive Mediation Model,4,"Abstract
This study extends the cognitive mediation model to the context of social media by examining the role of social media in cultivating public science knowledge. A sample of 901 Singaporeans was collected through an online survey panel. The results showed that both surveillance gratification and social utility were positively associated with attention to news and elaboration on social media, while social utility was positively associated with discussion on social media. This study also showed that attention to science news on social media had no direct relationship with science knowledge. Attention to science news on social media was positively associated with elaboration and discussion on social media. Elaboration on social media was positively associated with science knowledge, while discussion on social media was negatively associated with it. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

2016-0425,2016,Paper Session,Selling Science 2.0: What Scientific Projects Receive Crowdfunding Online?,2,"Crowdfunding has emerged as an additional source for financing research in recent years. The study at hand identifies and tests explanatory factors influencing the success of scientific crowdfunding projects by drawing on news value theory, theories of online payment and online credibility as well as crowdfunding-specific variables. A standardized content analysis of 371 projects on English- and German-language platforms reveals that each theory provides factors influencing crowdfunding success. It shows that projects presented on science-only platforms have a higher success rate. At the same time, projects are more likely to be successful if their presentation includes human touch elements, the lower their targeted funding is, the less personal data potential donors have to relinquish and the more interaction between researchers and donors is possible. This suggests that after donors decide to visit a scientific crowdfunding platform, factors unrelated to science matter more for subsequent funding decisions, raising questions about the potential and implications of crowdfunding science.",Using Big Data to Examine Science Communication and Research Communties,Communication and Technology

First it presents the stage/s of the research process at which digital means of work are employed, such as the stage of designing the research through to data collection and dissemination of research results. Second, it assesses the complexity and multiplicity of digital tools, resources and services used in research as well as the complexity and range of usages in which researchers engage accordingly, also providing some explanation as to why researchers in different disciplines use differently digital technologies of different range and different complexity. The paper concludes that certain commonalities and differences appear in researchers’ practices with digital technologies and that such practices are largely driven by the joint force of researchers’ (research) experience and expertise combined with disciplinary traditions and etiquettes.",Using Big Data to Examine Science Communication and Research Communties,Communication and Technology
2016-0427,2016,Paper Session,Stick or Carrot Grantseeking Motivation and Search Investment,2,"Grants can enable researchers to expand their research and improve their positions, but some may be forced to obtain grants to maintain rather than improve their position. The current paper grant related promotion or prevention regulatory focus affects academics’ investments in grant acquisition, in particular regarding (1) time spent per application, (2) number of applications, (3) rich media use throughout the application process. The paper relates this to success and contrasts this to two alternate explanations: grantseeking experience and general risk aversion. Outcomes of a survey among 217 researchers publishing in social science show that different perspectives on grant acquisition impact media use, the number of submissions, time spent on searching per grant, and overall success. A promotion rather than prevention focus relates positively to engaging in richer communication with grant makers, which in turn increases perceived fit and –marginally– application success, whereas prevention focus mainly increase time and activity.",Using Big Data to Examine Science Communication and Research Communties,Communication and Technology
2016-0428,2016,Paper Session,"The Social Shaping of the Brazilian Internet: Historicizing the Interactions Between States, Corporations, and NGOs in Information and Communication Technology Development and Diffusion",4,"The history of Internet diffusion in Latin America can be characterized by a complicated series of negotiations between often conflicting groups of actors including national governments, multinational corporations, international social movements, and regional non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Within this history, different actors often get compartmentalized and thus isolated from each other: the state and corporations combat each other over issues of deregulation and privatization (e.g. Noam, 1998) while NGOs work with larger social movements and transnational advocacy networks (TANs) to promote international issues or causes. (e.g. Keck and Sikkink, 1998; Willetts, 2011). Complicating these relatively narrow categorizations, we argue that the ability of NGOs in Brazil to incorporate access to and training in how to use information and communications technologies(ICTs) in community development projects such as professionalization for the work force, technology literacy, and helping create alternatives for young people to criminal activity (Sorj, 2003; Straubhaar and Jambeiro, 2005; Straubhaar, n.d.) is intimately linked to the national political economic environment produced through interactions between regulatory bodies, established corporations, entrepreneurs, and local activists.
Through the study of the social and economic forces at play in the push for ICT diffusion in Brazil, we propose a multi-stakeholder framework for understanding the emergence and evolution of information and telecommunications technologies in developing nations. Our central thesis is that in Brazil ICT diffusion was largely driven by creative innovations in diffusion from below by NGOs who sought to create new forms of access to the Internet to fulfill demand by users . However, these efforts were heavily influenced by national policies regarding public access, liberalization of regulations governing the national telecommunications market, as well as attempts by private corporations vying for consumer access. In this chapter we map this knotted history through a series of cases where governmental, corporate, and activist/NGO collaborate and collide in attempts to promote access on a wide scale..",Communication Infrastructure and the Social Shaping of Technology,Communication and Technology
2016-0429,2016,Paper Session,Discrimination in Online Contracting: Evidence From Latin America,1,"We analyze transactional data in Nubelo, a large online labor platform serving the Spanish-speaking markets. Our results indicate that employers favor domestic contractors. In our most conservative estimate, foreign workers are 15% less likely to obtain contracts in Nubelo compared to domestic workers. Yet this discrimination appears to be statistical rather than taste-based, as it decreases when more information about workers’ quality becomes available to employers. Further, contrary to some of the findings in traditional labor markets, we do not find evidence of discrimination against women in online hiring. In fact, women have a small hiring advantage, particularly among female employers. However we do observe that women are less likely to submit bids and tend to ask for lower wages, particularly when bargaining with male employers. Our findings shed light on how differentials in traditional labor markets play out in online labor environments.",Communication Infrastructure and the Social Shaping of Technology,Communication and Technology
2016-0430,2016,Paper Session,Toward a New Framework for Digital Piracy: Technology and Network Beyond the “Social”,1,"The purpose of this exploratory study is to frame a “right” question for digital piracy. Examining competing discourses on piracy and the practices of pirates in South Korea as a case in point, this paper argues that the question of digital piracy cannot be understood properly when it is framed in terms of the familiar oppositions between legality and illegality or between monopolization of knowledge and free flow and sharing of information. Attempting to move beyond the discursive struggles between proponents of copyright and “pirates” as well as the debates over the human nature that have prevailed in social science literature, this paper suggests that we should bring “technology” back in to the theoretical frameworks of piracy. It also suggests focusing on non-humans in pirate networks, not as ideological elimination of “human agency,” but as a way to restore politics in the discussions of piracy revolving around “the social”.",Communication Infrastructure and the Social Shaping of Technology,Communication and Technology

Cities, in turn, are becoming central as sites and objects of technological, aesthetic, and infrastructural innovation. In this paper, I present a framework for comparing and contrasting digital media interventions into the urban environment. I argue that such interventions are concrete examples of digital urbanism—the emergent, mutual imbrication of urban space and digital media technologies, as well as the ideological predilection for utilizing digital media technologies to respond to perceived urban problems. The framework consists of three interrelated dimensions: the locative-mobility; the cartographic; and the infrastructural.

2016-0432,2016,Paper Session,"Boredom in Free Time: Relationships With Smartphone Activities, Flow Experience, and Multitasking",1,"The smartphone is a device that can accompany the user at all times. This technology has created a unique opportunity for people who feel bored to use their smartphone for leisure activities and to spend their free time anytime and anywhere. The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of flow experience and free time boredom on diverse smartphone activities especially multitasking. The data were gathered through a telephone survey of a probability sample of 863 respondents of whom 653 were smartphone users. The results showed that the smartphone users achieved a flow state when they used the smartphone for entertainment, information seeking, and socializing, especially when they felt bored and did not want their free time to continue. While they waited in line for a service, the smartphone users often used the device for socializing, entertainment, information seeking, and utilities. When they used the smartphone for entertainment, they tended to multitask when they watched TV, listened to music, used the toilet, walked, waited for services, and traveled. The results indicate that the more that smartphone users experience free time boredom and the lack of mental and physical involvement, the more they will use their smartphones to multitask while watching TV, using the toilet, waiting for services, and commuting.

Research so far speaks for detrimental effects of permanent availability and connectivity but also hints at beneficial effects in providing mini breaks from work. Since there is evidence for the recovery potential of mass media, the current study extended this research to the effects of smartphone usage in fatiguing situations on subsequent recovery experiences and cognitive performance. After a strain induction, we observed participants during a waiting time whether they used their mobile devices. Afterwards, data on their recovery experiences and cognitive performance was collected. The results demonstrate that smartphone usage can be beneficial for some recovery dimensions but also detrimental for others.

However, little of the criticism of Yik Yak focuses on actual user practices, and this article fills that gap by reporting on ethnographic and interview work performed with Yik Yak users. The article uses qualitative data to show how Yik Yak represents the convergence of one of the oldest areas of Internet studies—the use of anonymous communication---with one of the newer—the use of locative media.

In addition, we investigate whether smartphone use could lead to education-based knowledge gap and find that smartphone use narrows the knowledge gap between individuals with higher and lower education levels.

We test a technological nudge through a privacy-enhancing app and an exemplar nudge, based on exemplification theory. Empirically, we carried out a 2 (technological nudge: yes/ no) x 2 (exemplar nudge: yes / no) experimental design, with three online surveys within a timeframe of ten days where users had to download two different apps of their choice on their smartphone.

2016-0443,2016,Paper Session,"Bias, Silence, Capture: Communicative Power in Media Policymaking",2,"Communication in the policymaking process – between policymakers and industry, between policymakers and the public, and between industry and the public – has been of interest to political scientists for the better part of a decade. Lamentably, the conceptualization and analysis of communication in the media policymaking process has yet to garner much attention by media policy scholars. Drawing on a radical view of power and theories of new institutionalism, we address this paucity by introducing a theoretical and methodological framework that centers on the intersection of communication and power in media policymaking. Such a framework is particularly required for media policy studies, since media companies not only represent the regulated parties, but also control the avenues of policy communication. This suggests a tremendous amount of power over the policymaking agenda and raises normative concerns for bias, silence and capture.","Ideas, Power, and Accountability in Media Policy",Communication Law & Policy

It therefore assesses the discursive and political struggles encountered during the contentious preparation of a recommendation on multilingualism and universal access to cyberspace, adopted by UNESCO in 2003. The paper builds on a conceptual and methodological framework that links the analysis of discourse creation with the assessment of concrete policy processes, as it combines the methods of Argumentative Discourse Analysis with selected elements of Actor-Network Theory. The analysis is led by the question whether the competing discourses and political controversies were simply the result of divergent ideas and interests, leading to power struggles on the micro-level, or rather derive from deep-rooted disagreements about the role of information and regulation. To answer this, the paper introduces a number of paradoxes that are an inherent part of the globalised digital environment.","Ideas, Power, and Accountability in Media Policy",Communication Law & Policy

2016-0446,2016,Paper Session,Governance by Algorithms: Reality Construction by Algorithmic Selection on the Internet,2,"This paper explores the governance by algorithms/technology in information societies. Theoretically it builds on co-evolutionary innovation studies in combination with institutional approaches. As an institution, software affects societies similarly to laws, contracts and values that are imprinted in algorithms. Methodologically it draws from an empirical survey of Internet-based services that rely on algorithmic selection, a thereof derived functional typology, and an analysis of associated social risks. It shows how algorithmic selection has become a growing source of social order, of a shared social reality, comparable, yet different to the construction of realities by the traditional mass media. Major differences are the growing personalization of constructed realities and the constellation of involved actors, including algorithms as relatively autonomous actors and policy-makers with delegated agency. Altogether, compared to reality construction by traditional mass media, algorithmic reality construction tends to increase individualization, commercialization, inequalities and deterritorialization, and to decrease transparency, controllability and predictability.","Ideas, Power, and Accountability in Media Policy",Communication Law & Policy

2016-0448,2016,Paper Session,How Coping With Emotions Shapes Perceptions of Social Healthcare Robots,3,"Due to the increasing pressure on healthcare systems, robots may provide a solution. However, little is known about how people’s prior emotional state may affect the perception and acceptance of such robots. Following appraisal theories of emotion, preliminary research found that particularly the appraisal of coping potential is important in acting as mediator between prior emotional states and perceptions of a healthcare robot. Hence, the current study focused on how actual coping may influence subsequent robot perceptions. Contrasting previous studies, Study 1 (N=101) used a real humanoid robot but results were somewhat confusing; while manipulations were effective, effects on robot perceptions were not in line with previous studies. Because the novelty aspect of interacting with a real robot may have blurred results, we conducted Study 2, in which participants interacted briefly with the robot before the actual study. Preliminary results are exciting and will be presented at the ICA conference!",CAT Hybrid Session 2: Virtual Experiences and Interaction,Communication and Technology
2016-0449,2016,Paper Session,"KITT, Please Stop Distracting Me: Examining the Effects of Communication in Cars and Social Presence on Safe Driving",6,"The present study examines how communication technologies integrated into the automotive context may influence driving safety. Drawing from data collected in a driving simulator-based experiment, the results did not support expectations that perceiving a car voice as similar to the self and perceiving the car as reflective of identity would lead to safer driving. However, when coupled with high social presence, perceiving a car voice to be similar to the self or the car to reflect the driver’s identity led to less safe driving. This unexpected finding suggests that these facets of perception of the car may distract the driver from the task at hand and have notable implications for the consideration and design of communication technologies in the automotive context.",CAT Hybrid Session 2: Virtual Experiences and Interaction,Communication and Technology

Further, this study explores the moderating effects of the thermal feedback in two different mode of display presentation: mesoscopic (2D) versus stereoscopic (3D) modes. In order to test the research hypotheses and research question, the present study used a 2 (monoscopic 2D vs. stereoscopic 3D display) × 2 (thermal feedback vs. no feedback from heating suit) between-subjects factorial design for an experiment (n=70). Overall, a series of two-way ANOVA analyses of this study suggest that, regardless of the display mode (2D vs. 3D), thermal feedback from the heating suit would generate users’ feelings of spatial presence, willingness to suspend their disbelief, perceived realism, and behavioral intentions to seek further information regarding the solar system.

2016-0451,2016,Paper Session,Reimagining Disability in Virtual Worlds: Avatar Representation Through the Lens of Uses and Gratifications,2,"Disability has always been a part of the human condition. However, only recently have disabled individuals begun to experience social reform that allows them to be seen as a unique culture. Yet, when people who experience disability have the opportunity to represent themselves in a virtual world, they often create avatars that reflect the social norm of beauty defined by western culture. While this is also the case among those who have no visible disability, the questions surrounding virtual representation become more pronounced for those with disabilities. Uses and gratifications theory is well positioned to explain the interplay between physically disabled individuals and their virtual world avatars. Through that lens, this 3-year ethnographic study explored how visual narratives stemming from the experience of healthy embodiment in virtual worlds, especially for individuals living with chronic disease or disability, affects physical life experience, relationships, and quality of life.",CAT Hybrid Session 2: Virtual Experiences and Interaction,Communication and Technology

This study also explores moderating effects of the real hand controller interface when it comes to two different modes of display presentation: monoscopic (2D) versus stereoscopic (3D) modes. The present study used a 2 (monoscopic 2D vs. stereoscopic 3D display) x 2 (virtual hand controller interface vs. real hand controller interface) between-subjects factorial design for an experiment (n = 114). Overall, the results of this study suggest that the 3D game environment would allow the VR game players to perceive more controllability over the game, feel a stronger sense of being there in the game, evaluate the game as affording their actions to a greater extent, feel a higher degree of enjoyment, and have intentions to play, recommend, and purchase the game in future. Unexpectedly, however, the results suggest that the effect size of the 3D display was not moderated by the intuition-based real-hand controller interface.

Regarding virtual environments (VEs) and the transmission of nonverbal cues in avatar-mediated communication, knowledge of the contribution of nonverbal channels to emotion recognition is essential. This study analyzed the impact of emotional expressions in faces and body motion on emotion recognition. Motion capture data of expressive body movements from actors portraying either anger or happiness were animated using avatars with congruent and incongruent facial expressions. Participants viewed the resulting animations and rated the perceived emotion. During stimulus presentation, gaze behavior was recorded. The analysis of the rating results and visual attention patterns indicate that humans predominantly judge emotions based on the facial expression and pay higher attention to the head region as an information source to recognize emotions. This implicates that the transmission of facial expression is of importance for the design of social VEs.",CAT Hybrid Session 2: Virtual Experiences and Interaction,Communication and Technology

Drawing on a content analysis of 1379 stories and 333,605 user comments across 20 news websites, this study explores predictors of the volume of comments (as a proxy for user engagement and interactivity with the news) and the relative quality of those discussions. The results indicate that a number of story topics predict more comments, but many also predict more hostile and/or less civil comments. Objectivity, in terms of including sources in reporting, was a significant predictor of more hostility in user comments. Including multimedia features was positively related to more comments, but also to more hostility. Journalist participation in comment sections led to more comments and less hostility. Finally, the results for organizational commenting policies were mixed; some predicted more comments and some predicted less, while some policies predicted better quality and others predicted poorer quality comments.

However, the communities formed by commenting users have not yet entered into the scope of communication research. This paper is based on two case studies of such networks emerging via comments on a selected topic on two German news sites. One allows for anonymous commenting (WELT), the other requires the disclosure of real names (FAZ.NET). We tracked the users’ interactions and illustrated their interconnectedness and the valence of postings. Additionally, we qualitatively analyzed comments that showed regulative character. We found that the shape and structure of both networks differ, with varying levels of interactivity and reciprocity. A stronger cohesion and specific evaluative behavior of the FAZ network indicates comparatively greater social pressure and more cues for community self-regulation.",Online Comments and the News,Journalism Studies

We analyse data from a quantitative survey (N=3470) among users of four newspaper websites, in order to understand different user groups' experiences and attitudes towards editorial control against a spectrum between liberal and interventionist positions. We find that the liberals tend to be male, participate more frequently, prefer anonymity and rate the quality of the debates higher than the interventionists. Regarding their experiences with control, liberals have more often had their comments edited or removed by moderators, and have more often not understood why this was done. They also believe that moderation has become more strict, and that their opportunities to speak their minds freely have become worse after the terror attacks.",Online Comments and the News,Journalism Studies

First, it is to identify the dominant emotional appeal adopted in Chinese abortion ads. The second purpose is to outline how fear is presented in Chinese abortion ads by identifying the four key variables of the EPPM - the severity of a threat, the susceptibility to a threat, self-efficacy, and response efficacy. A quantitative content analysis was adopted to characterize and analyze 159 Chinese television abortion ads captured from Youku.com. The findings reveal that: first, Chinese television abortion ads often attempt to persuade audiences with fear appeals rather than “rational consideration of medical cost and benefits.” Second, all four components of the EPPM have been presented frequently in Chinese television abortion ads. Third, the benefits of abortion service are oversold in ways that conflict with promoting public health in Chinese television abortion ads.",Health Communication Advertising and Advertisements,Health Communication

We combine data on the televised broadcast availability of statin drug DTCAs in large media markets in the United States with 18 waves of the Simmons National Consumer Survey (n = 120,229) from 2001 to 2009. We find that statin drug DTCA exposure is associated, in a dose-response pattern, with modest increases in the frequency of exercise and large increases in the frequency of fast food restaurant visits. The effects on fast food restaurant visits were largely consistent in direction but differed in magnitude between those without a previous diagnosis of high cholesterol and those treating high cholesterol with a statin.

We adapted the Health Belief Model to analyze the informative (donation information, breast cancer advocacy content, etc.) and persuasive (appeals used, cues to action, etc.) content of the ads. While ads offered minimal informative content about the disease or about ways in which sales will contribute to the breast cancer cause, they integrated “breast cancer appeals,” such as the color pink, the pink ribbon, and mostly positive depictions of survivorship and hope, into the ads. Breast cancer thus took the center stage in the persuasive content of the ads and the backseat in the informative content.

This paper examines youth receptivity to potential campaign ads using data from three message testing studies as part of the campaign’s formative research process. A total of 3,258 adolescents ages 13-17 participated in the studies. About half of the sample were experimental smokers who had not yet smoked 100 cigarettes in their life time, and the other half current nonsmokers who were at risk for initiation. Fourteen (14) ads were tested across the three studies. Participants who viewed the ads generally considered them to be effective. Compared to those in the control condition, participants in the ad exposure condition reported greater health risks of smoking, greater likelihood that smoking would lead to loss of control in life, and more negative attitudes toward smoking. No differences in message effects were observed between campaign themes and between experimenters and at-risk nonsmokers.

Based on public commitment theory, previous research has identified the public nature of online settings to prompt these changes. This study specifically focused on different degrees of publicness (i.e., public and semipublic) and the element of customization brought on by features typically embedded in social network platforms. In an experiment, participants (N = 252) were asked to present themselves as either introvert or extravert, in a public or semipublic setting, or a setting in which participants were allowed to choose how public their self-presentation would be (i.e., customization). The manipulations did not lead to shifts in identity, indicating that the degrees of publicness in the context of social network sites do not necessarily prompt commitment to self-presentations. These findings shed new light on identity shifts in different online settings, and further theoretically advance the role of public commitment.",Selfies and Self-Presentation Online,Communication and Technology
2016-0465,2016,Paper Session,Understanding the Antecedents of Selfie-Posting on Social Networking Sites,4,"With the growing prevalence of photo-sharing social networking sites (SNSs), SNS users communicate and present themselves online through posting self-photographs (“selfies”) on SNSs. Within the last few years, selfies have become so widespread across a variety of SNSs and therefore warrant careful investigation. To delve into this new phenomenon in social media environments, the present study examines selfie-posting behavior on SNSs using the Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In addition, it extends the framework by incorporating narcissism as an additional antecedent, which has not been examined in previous literature. Results show that attitude toward selfie-posting, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control,and narcissism are significant determinants of an individual’s intention to post selfies on SNSs. Further, the findings reveal that one’s selfie-posting behavior on SNSs is significantly predicted by his or her intention to post selfies.

Considering the imagined audience on SNSs, users enact selective self-presentation as they choose, edit, and post photographs of themselves. As such, there is an increased focus on users’ physical appearance, which may compound existing sociocultural pressures about body image. Thus, we synthesized the two-component model of impression management and objectification theory to examine photographic self-presentation on social networking sites. We identified SNS users among a nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 1686) and examined women’s and men’s photo-related behavior, including posting photos, editing photos, and engaging in upward and downward social comparison with others’ photos on social media. We identified some sex differences: women edited photos more frequently and felt worse after upward social comparison than men.

Specifically, selfie-related conflicts play a mediating role in the association between these variables. A possible explanation for this association is jealously in the SNS user’s partner, stemming from the excessive sharing of individual photos or comments about those pictures. Another possibility is that, in sharing a flattering image of oneself, a fantasy persona may be created in the picture-taker’s imagination that diverges from real life, which could also cause relationship problems.",Selfies and Self-Presentation Online,Communication and Technology

The present research examines the role that social evaluation plays in identity shift. An experimental study (N = 178) with a 2 (extraverted/introverted) x 3 (positive social evaluation, negative social evaluation and no social evaluation) design tested how behaviors that are framed as socially desirable or undesirable are incorporated into the self-concept. Results revealed that identity shift was enhanced in conditions where social evaluation was present, regardless of valence, compared to conditions where it was not. This effect was associated with an increased level of other-directed attention when evaluation was highlighted, suggesting that an orientation towards the audience plays a key role in identity shift.",Selfies and Self-Presentation Online,Communication and Technology

Past smoking and drinking behaviors were also assessed. Attitudes, injunctive norms, and descriptive norms were assessed through reaction-time measures of attitude and norm accessibility with attention to the differences between injunctive peer norms and injunctive family norms. Accessibility refers to how quickly a concept can be activated in the mind of the individual. A sample of 413 first year college students living in on-campus residence halls participated in the study. Findings indicate that utilizing measures of attitude and norm accessibility provides a good predictor of TPB with the final models (attitude accessibility, injunctive and descriptive norm accessibility, and perceived behavior control) accounting for 52% of intentions drinking intentions and 65% of smoking intentions.","College Health Promotion: Drinking, Substance Abuse, Sexual Assault",Health Communication

To better understand some of the personality and social cognitive contributors to college drinking, a survey was conducted with first-year college students in the first two weeks of their initial semester on campus (n=421; 46% female). Participants completed measures of reward sensitivity (BIS/BAS), perceived prototype of people who drink, attitude and injunctive norm accessibility, past drinking behavior and future drinking intention. Results confirmed prior work indicating that BAS is a predictor of drinking intention. That relationship was mediated by both injunctive norm accessibility and perceived prototypes of drinkers. These mediated relationships persisted with prior drinking behavior and attitude accessibility entered as controls. This is the first study of its kind to link BAS to social cognitive variables of norm accessibility and prototype perceptions.","College Health Promotion: Drinking, Substance Abuse, Sexual Assault",Health Communication

Indirect effects analyses of marijuana attitudes and usage intentions revealed significant source by language interactions on perceptions of intent to control (p < .02). Language extremity was irrelevant in the peer commentator conditions; adults’ explicit language induced stronger perceptions of control on both measures (p < .05), which was associated with more positive marijuana attitudes and stronger usage intentions (p < .05). Analysis indicated significant indirect effects of language extremity on both attitudes and intentions through perceived control with adult, but not peer sources (both p < .05).

Results of a cross-sectional study conducted among U.S. college students (N = 581) found that close peer injunctive norms other than distal peer injunctive norms positively influenced the relation between descriptive norms and college students’ alcohol consumption. Greater interdependent self-construal was associated with stronger relation between descriptive norms and college students’ alcohol consumption. Interdependent self-construal further moderated the association between close peer injunctive norms and the impact of descriptive norms on college students’ alcohol consumption and intentions to consume alcohol. However, the direction of the three-way interactions was inconsistent with the hypotheses. Implications of the findings for social norms research and interventions were discussed.","College Health Promotion: Drinking, Substance Abuse, Sexual Assault",Health Communication

Findings indicate that students believe that campus sexual assault is still a serious issue in their schools and in the United States, and that schools are responsible for the incidents. Respondents called on schools to stop the myth of victim blaming and provide appropriate solutions and policies to reduce the rate of campus sexual assault. In addition, students indicated they would be more likely to adopt preventive and helping behaviors if they believe that campus sexual assault is not an individual level problem but an overall institutional or societal problem.

For the context of SNSs, however, the privacy calculus still needs further support as most studies consist of small student samples and analyze self-disclosure only, excluding privacy regulation (e.g., the deletion of posts), which is essential in SNS contexts. Thus, this study used an U.S. representative sample to test the privacy calculus’ generalizability and extend its theoretical framework by including privacy regulation behaviors and privacy self-efficacy. Results confirmed the privacy calculus. Moreover, both privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy positively predicted use of privacy regulations. With regard to predicting self-disclosure in SNSs, benefits outweighed privacy concerns, and regarding privacy regulations¬, privacy concerns outweighed both privacy self-efficacy and benefits.",Self-Disclosure and Privacy in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Instead, they quickly assess the security of information systems based on various interface cues, which trigger cognitive heuristics (i.e., rules of thumbs). However, the mechanism by which cognitive heuristics influence decision-making leading to information disclosure is not fully understood. We address this issue by investigating the mediating role of common behavioral rationales that underlie disclosure in various online venues, ranging from social networks to mobile chatting. Using a scenario-based survey of a representative sample of US nationals (N = 786), we demonstrate that users’ beliefs in a set of general rules of thumb (heuristics) are related to their disclosure intentions in 18 popular online/mobile sites, and these relationships are mediated by one or more scenario-specific behavior rationales provided by users.",Self-Disclosure and Privacy in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Paradox on Social Network Sites (SNS) by defining it as an individual characteristic
which can be weaker or stronger for each person. Based on this definition, we
investigate in how far gratifications, the Optimistic Bias and habitualization can explain
the Privacy Paradox. We conducted an online survey (N=305) which revealed that
gratifications and habitualization both enhance the probability that the Privacy Paradox
occurs and are related to the strength of paradoxical behavior. The role of
habitualization is an indicator that people don`t seem to reflect their actions on SNS.
The relevance of gratifications shows that – if people think about self-disclosure at all –
benefits of sharing information seem to outweigh privacy concerns.",Self-Disclosure and Privacy in Social Media,Communication and Technology

That said, few studies have examined how engagement in these impression management strategies varies across users. Using Communication Privacy Management theory and the privacy paradox as guiding frameworks, this paper presents findings from a large (N=1119) study to evaluate the relationship between individual factors, network composition and privacy concerns with the use of social and technical features to regulate access to personal information on Facebook.

However, recent studies indicate, that journalists working in varying news beats or subgenres, covering specific stories, differ regarding the importance they assign to journalistic roles and the professional standards they endorse. Despite journalism’s key function in a public health crisis, to date very little is known as to how journalists themselves understand their roles and how their roles – or their prioritization – may shift in this context. The aim of this study was an in-depth exploration of journalists’ role perceptions in health crises coverage, including differences between crisis and non-crisis contexts, and general versus specialist reporters. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with reporters experienced in health crisis reporting, in Germany and Finland. We identified three themes: meaning beyond facts, stance towards authorities, and care for audiences. During crises, journalistic roles shift (e.g., from watchdog to co-operative), and distinct roles emerged.",Covering Science and Health,Journalism Studies
2016-0482,2016,Paper Session,Scientific Evidence and Mass Media: Investigating the Journalistic Intention to Represent Scientific Uncertainty,2,"Science journalists are responsible for the mass media’s representation of life sciences (e.g., biotechnology, genetics, nanotechnology), and for the depiction of research findings in these areas as more scientifically (un)certain. Although researchers have determined that the representational styles of scientific evidence vary among science journalists, the reasons for these differences have not yet been fully investigated. Against this background, for the first time the present study applies a reasoned action approach and investigates the predictors of the journalistic intention to represent scientific uncertainty. This was done using computer-assisted telephone interviews with a representative sample of German science journalists (n = 202). The results indicate that beliefs about the coverage of other media, perceptions regarding the scientific uncertainty of the main field of coverage, perceived expectations of the audience, past behavior, and gender were the predictors that most strongly affected the journalists’ intention to represent life sciences as more scientifically uncertain.",Covering Science and Health,Journalism Studies
2016-0483,2016,Paper Session,Relationship Building on Sina Weibo: Exploring Cultural Influence on Chinese and German Companies' Communication Practices,2,"China, the second largest economy with immense business opportunities, has attracted many Western companies to rival the domestic firms for the attention and favour of Chinese consumers and other stakeholders. To succeed, relationship building is considered key. This is particularly the case in a collectivistic society like China where relationships are of great importance. Due to their timely transmission, interactive nature and wide public access, social media play an increasingly important role in building corporate-stakeholder relationships. Thus, companies attempt to foster relationships with their online stakeholders through dialogic communication practises on social network sites (SNS) like Sina Weibo. Considering the role of relationships, and the specific features of SNS, this study sets out to extend the research on dialogic communication on social media from an intercultural perspective. Special attention is placed on revealing and comparing relationship building practises of large companies from China and Germany on Sina Weibo and the related responses and attitudes of their online stakeholders. Our findings suggest that German companies employ the SNS mainly as a marketing communication platform whereas Chinese companies make more use of it to foster relationships along with promoting their products and services. This study contributes to the growing body of research on corporate-stakeholder relationship building through dialogic communication on SNS from an intercultural perspective.",Cultural Influence on Advertising and Corporate Communication,Intercultural Communication
2016-0484,2016,Paper Session,Communicative <3 Intimacies: Influencers and Perceived Interconnectedness,1,"Around the world, many young people have taken to social media to monetise their personal lives as “influencers.” Although international news reports have variously described these commercial social media users as “bloggers,” “YouTubers,” and “Instagrammers,” I conceptualise these high-profile Internet microcelebrities (Senft 2008) as influencers regardless of their digital platform. Influencers are everyday, ordinary Internet users who accumulate a relatively large following on blogs and social media through the textual and visual narration of their personal lives and lifestyles, engage with their following in digital and physical spaces, and monetise their following by integrating “advertorials” into their blog or social media posts. A pastiche of “advertisement” and “editorial”, advertorials in the Influencer industry are highly personalised, opinion-laden promotions of products/services that influencers personally experience and endorse for a fee. Although influencers are now a worldwide phenomenon, this paper investigates a subset of them, namely women influencers of the “lifestyle” genre in Singapore. Based on my fieldwork and drawing from Horton & Wohlʼs work on parasocial relations (1956), I observe how influencers appropriate and mobilise intimacies in different ways (commercial, interactive, reciprocal, disclosive), and describe a model of communication between influencers and followers I term “perceived interconnectedness”, in which influencers interact with followers to give the impression of intimacy. The practices investigated and analyses developed in this paper are not unique to Singapore and may be mapped onto larger Influencer ecologies. However, as a small nation of just over five million (YourSingapore 2013) with a high IT penetration rate (iDA 2015) and relatively developed Influencer industry, it is hoped that this study of influencers in Singapore can serve as a microcosm for future comparative studies of influencers globally.",Cultural Influence on Advertising and Corporate Communication,Intercultural Communication

Although a significant amount of research has been done on globalization, few focus on cultural intelligence and how individual exposure to global advertising affects a person's purchasing decisions, especially in the Middle East region, more specifically in Lebanon. This research tests the concept of cultural intelligence in the Lebanese market through an experiment that compares between a locally produced advertisement (local product Unica) and a globally designed ad of an internationally known product (Pepsi). This study adds to our theoretical knowledge of semiotics and practical understanding of both design of advertisements (e.g., local or global) and effects of an individual’s cultural intelligence and purchasing preference.",Cultural Influence on Advertising and Corporate Communication,Intercultural Communication

Specifically, those bloggers who attended political meetings or had contacted a politician or civil servant offline were more likely to express their political thoughts on their blog. Results also showed that those who paid the most attention to political and public affairs reports in newspapers, blogged more frequently, and those who blogged more frequently, exhibited greater expression of political voice through their blogs. In addition, media attentiveness showed an indirect effect on online political voice, mediated through blogging frequency.

Using two-wave panel survey data, results show that trust in citizen media predicts people’s tendency to create news. In turn, citizen news production is a positive predictor of both offline and online participation, even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. More importantly, trust in the media moderates the effect of citizen news production over online political participation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of trust in the media with respect to citizen news production and how it matters for democracy. Thus, this study casts a much-needed light on how media trust and citizen journalism intertwine in explaining a more engaged and participatory citizenry.",What Generates News Content?

Longitudinal evidence to substantiate these claims is largely absent however. This article therefore employs an automated content analysis tool to measure the influence of organizational press releases on a) media agenda building and b) churnalism, or the recycling of subsidized content over time. The tool is applied on a Dutch dataset consisting of 33525 texts from 2004-2013, including press releases from NGOs and corporations, news agency copy and newspaper texts. NGOs were found to be more successful than corporate sources in terms of influencing the media agenda and content. The highest levels of churnalism are found in the content of free newspapers. Overall, the results refute the notion of a journalistic ‘copy-paste’ culture, and neither is a trend of increased source influence on the media agenda and content observable over time.",What Generates News Content?

The review of literature and existing messages in Phase 1 resulted in a typology of 12 message strategies. Based on this typology, trained raters in Phase 2 evaluated water conservation messages (N = 100) to determine whether each message utilized one or multiple strategies. The results revealed various frequencies of strategy application and a correlational analysis rendered a pattern of complementary strategy use. Phase 3 focused on a controlled experiment of the three most relevant strategies: conservation tips, loss aversion, and evidence of drought. Data from a sample (N = 180) of California residents surprisingly showed, regardless of the strategy, receiving conservation messages led to negative attitude change toward water conservation. Additional analyses revealed interesting patterns of complementary strategy effects on attitude.

2016-0494,2016,Paper Session,Using Theory to Inform Water Conservation in Business Communities: Formative Research From a Chamber Initiative,2,"The nation’s freshwater supply concerns continue to increase (United States Accountability Office, 2014). While states are making efforts to improve management of water availability and use, this task is challenging. Aging water treatment and delivery systems, population growth, and climate-related issues increasingly place stress on water resources (United States Environmental, 2015). Water conservation across all community stakeholders is vital to the future of human water usage. A city in West Texas has focused educational and communication conservation effort toward the more salient water users in the area, residential and agricultural, leaving the business sector less informed. With support of the city’s Chamber of Commerce, 176 members from commercial and institutional businesses responded to an online questionnaire.

2016-0495,2016,Paper Session,"Risk, Affect, and Policy Support: Public Perception of Air Pollution in China",2,"Air pollution is a critical environmental problem that has spurred great public concern in China. Applying the central part of the risk information seeking and processing model (RISP), this study examines risk perception, affective response, information seeking behavior, and policy support related to this issue. The recent release of a controversial environmental documentary on Chinese social media, Under the Dome, also prompted us to explore the impact of exposure to this documentary on Chinese social media users’ information seeking and policy support related to air pollution. Results showed that risk perception and negative affect had both direct and indirect effects on information seeking and policy support. Also, exposure to the documentary moderated the relationship between negative affect and policy support. However, contrary to our expectations based on the RISP model, no significant relationship was found between knowledge and information seeking. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings were discussed.

Online communities may have similar nature and function as physical social community. Specifically, social support is acting upon subjective well-being in physical social community. It is wondered whether online social support would also act upon individual online subjective well-being. Therefore, this study explored the ability of online communities in inducing subjective well-being. The research question was: Would online social support predict subjective well-being? This study administered a survey questionnaire to 268 college students. Results found that online social support was significantly related to subjective well-being (β = .295, p < .001) though the effect was small (R2 = .084). Furthermore, the data was categorized into different social media user types. When the model applied to the group data, both correlation coefficient and the predictive power increased nearly double in size, from Lurker (β = .294; R2 = .087) to Socializer (β = .302; R2 = .11) and to Advanced (β = .536; R2 = .255).

Whereas some argue that internet sites are, by definition, public, failing to take seriously this question perhaps constitutes an all-too easy alibi for not taking the ethical concerns of an increasingly vanishing private sphere seriously. In our contribution to this ongoing conversation, we utilized the analytic of dialectical tensions, as no singular definition can be applied to every online context. To undertake this analysis, we examined three online support communities previously studied by communication scholars. In this paper, we argue that if communication scholars are interested in helping and not harming the communities that we study, then it seems the short-cut of internet voyeurism may be a poor substitute for the more rigorous methods of conventional ethnography, such as embeddedness.",Communication in Online Relationships: Is the Medium the Relationship?,Interpersonal Communication

The present study investigated how communication mode and familiarity influence conversational valence (i.e., how negative or positive people talk) and binge drinking norms. During a 2 (offline versus online communication) x 2 (unfamiliar versus familiar conversation partner) lab-experiment (N = 91), participants were exposed to an anti-binge drinking campaign after which they discussed binge drinking and the campaign. Binge drinking norms were measured one week before and directly after the discussion. Results revealed that conversations between unfamiliar conversation partners were positive about the campaign, especially in offline settings, subsequently leading to healthier binge drinking norms. We recommend researchers to further investigate the influence of communication mode and familiarity on discussion effects and we suggest that health promotion attempts might benefit from eliciting conversations about alcohol between unfamiliar persons.",Communication in Online Relationships: Is the Medium the Relationship?,Interpersonal Communication

To address this concern, online platforms increasingly adopt peer evaluations (e.g. ratings, endorsements). However, such evaluations prompt new trust concerns: can the evaluators be trusted? The current paper addresses this issue by focusing on transitivity of positive and negative trust relations. Three online experiments using a real life trust game indicate that especially evaluations by distrusted sources have complex effects: untrustworty positive evaluations may be reversed (exp1), discounted (exp3), or both (exp2), while untrustworthy negative evaluations are trusted (exp3). Peer evaluations by trusted sources have more straightforward effects.

Findings show that not every type of news use may yield equally positive effects. News posting was found to contribute to more participation in politics by positively mediating the link between people’s SNS use and political behaviors. However, news reading and endorsing were negatively associated with political participation.
In addition, the study also explored how different levels of politically relevant social capital, measured by the level of political expertise of online network, moderates the pathways running from SNS use to political participation. It was found that, the indirect effects of SNS use on participation via news posting were highest among those with high level of network political expertise and the lowest among low level of network political expertise.

We consider stereotypes of dying people along three primary dimensions: competence, warmth, and trustworthiness. We propose that (a) the dying person’s death acceptance (fearful vs. peaceful) can lead to very specific types of communication, and (b) that these forms of communication shape people’s stereotypical traits on dying people in general. In addition, (c) we examine whether the age of the dying target moderates the effect of death acceptance on communicative behaviors. As the results, participants’ stereotypes are affected by the death acceptance of the dying conversation partner, with effects being carried through specific communication behaviors enacted by the dying person. The specific communication behaviors that emerged have sensible theoretical links to the specific stereotype dimension.","Contexts, Processes, and Outcomes of Outgroup Attitudes and Intergroup Contact",Intergroup Communication

A survey among Black and White South African students (n=1095) revealed markedly differing consumption patterns among groups and a tendency to select ingroup-rich media. While higher ingroup identification decreased the likelihood that a student has an outgroup-rich media pattern, direct outgroup contact increased it. Future research on positive effects of outgroup exposure should integrate selection processes and pay attention to shared media consumption as both, enabling and following of direct outgroup contact.","Contexts, Processes, and Outcomes of Outgroup Attitudes and Intergroup Contact",Intergroup Communication

An examination of the Chinese Dream posters will help us further understand the role of posters in political discursive formation, and more importantly, provide insights into the integration propaganda in post-socialist China.",The Visual Communication of Identities and Values Across Cultures,Visual Communication Studies
2016-0516,2016,Paper Session,Does the Great Fire Wall Cause Self-Censorship? The Effects of Perceived Regulation and the Justification of Censorship,3,"This study aims to explore the impact of Internet censorship which is represented by the Great Fire Wall (the Internet filtering system in China), on Chinese Internet users’ self-censorship through a controlled experiment. Different patterns of censorship (soft censorship, compared censorship and hard censorship) and the justification of Internet censorship are involved in the experiment as two factors. Self-censorship is measured through the willingness to speak about sensitive issues and the behavior of signing petitions. The results show that perceived censorship significantly causes self-censorship regarding the willingness to talk about sensitive issues. Compared censorship ranked highest in the impact on the self-censorship; shard censorship that directly pointing to a specific individual reduced the tendency of self-censorship, suggesting possible resistance provoked by it. The justification of censorship significantly decreases self-censorship on the behaviors of petition signing. The interaction effects of the two factors generally exist for the willingness to speak about sensitive issues.",Media & Democracy: Press Freedom and Censorship,Political Communication

Specifically, analyses presented in this study examine the relationships that exist between diffusion rates of emerging media and enhanced press freedoms in countries that experienced differing types of conflicts from 1990 through 2006. Through a series of analytic models, the results observed here indicate that higher levels of emerging media and press freedoms are better predictors of nonviolent—as opposed to violent—conflict. Findings from this study thus bridge an important gap in the literature between communication and political science research in establishing linkages between emerging media technologies and press freedoms and their interconnections with nonviolent and violent political conflict.

2016-0518,2016,Paper Session,Media and Attitudes About Electoral Malpractice: A Field Experiment in a New Democracy,2,"What factors determine attitudes about electoral malpractice in new democracies? While an important function of the media is exposing corruption, we draw on psychological theories of norms to argue that discussions about cheating could have perverse effects by actually increasing its social acceptability in these settings. Media in post-liberalization societies often carry repeated and sensationalized reports of alleged malpractice. These media convey the descriptive norm that democratic rules are not being followed, thus normalizing cheating as a behavior. Further, media tend to frame elections as hard-fought affairs, which could lead citizens to prioritize their narrow political goals and downplay injunctive norms that proscribe cheating. We evaluate media effects on descriptive and injunctive norms about manipulation and violence with a field experiment conducted in Ghana during which passengers in tro-tros (commuter buses) were randomly exposed to live radio programs.",Media & Democracy: Press Freedom and Censorship,Political Communication

What’s more, persuasiveness of verbal claims in these ads might operate quite differently from visual depictions of vaping. We randomly assigned 587 former and current smokers to one of three conditions: regular ads with original visuals, no visual ads with visuals edited out but keeping the soundtrack and all verbal claims, and a no ad control condition. Participants in the no visual condition reported less belief in secondhand vaping harm as well as more opposition to vaping restriction than those in the no ad control and the regular visual condition. Also, the mediating role of secondhand vaping harm belief was confirmed.",Antismoking/Antidrinking: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-0520,2016,Paper Session,Message Persuasiveness and Audience Selection: How Argument Strength Shapes Smokers’ Selective Exposure to Antismoking Messages,3,"This study examined how argument strength drives what antismoking messages smokers choose to consume, and how smokers’ intention to quit shapes the persuasiveness-selection link. A nationally representative sample of U.S. adult smokers participated in a multiple-message experiment where they were shown three textual summaries of antismoking videos with varying levels of argument strength (one weak, one moderate, one strong) and chose the one they would be most likely to watch. Antismoking messages containing either strong or weak arguments invited more frequent selections than their moderate counterparts. Smoking cessation intention modulated the argument-strength effect, such that high intenders preferred strong-argument messages (accuracy-motivated selection), but low intenders favored weak-argument messages (defense-motivated selection). These findings were replicated in a secondary data analysis of a previously published study, suggesting that message-choice architecture featuring a sharp contrast of persuasiveness facilitates the role of smokers’ quitting intention as a separator of the accuracy and defense motivations.",Antismoking/Antidrinking: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication

The present study aims to explore the factors that will enhance people’s intention to retransmit binge-drinking messages. A survey was conducted to measure individuals’ evaluation of set of messages (i.e., perceived message novelty and efficacy, and message transmission intent), perceived norms, and individualistic traits. The survey also included open-ended questions regarding to reasons and motivations for sharing and not sharing on social media. Findings indicated that perceived message efficacy was positively associated with message transmission intent.

Applying a new methodological paradigm, we combined the neuroimaging data with LIWC linguistic analysis to examine the counterarguing process smokers engage in during initial exposure to persuasive messages. We found that 1) increasing neural activity during message exposure in the “cognitive deliberation” brain regions of interest (ROI) was significantly associated with more post-scan cognitive word use; 2) increasing neural activity in the “counterarguing” ROI, was selectively associated with less positivity in the post-scan language use; and 3) both effects were conditional on the smokers’ motivational state to quit, such that effects were strongest in those with lower motivation to quit (hence higher likelihood to counterargue). Our study provides novel evidence for two distinct neurocognitive components of counterarguing; neural activity within the two regions during message exposure are predictive of subsequent language use patterns.

Routine exposure to e-cigarette information in the media and through conversations (“scanning”; Hornik & Niederdeppe, 2008) may shape cognitions about e-cigarette use, especially among susceptible youth and young adults. The integrative model of behavioral prediction (IM) suggests three primary cognitive precedents of behavioral intention: attitude, perceived normative pressure and self-efficacy (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2009). In the current study, we tested the effects of e-cigarette and cigarette information scanning on the intention to use e-cigarettes with a longitudinal design, and examined whether such effects are mediated by e-cigarette-related beliefs, normative perceptions and self-efficacy.",Antismoking/Antidrinking: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication

An “I pledge” type of campaign through social media may work well to reshape perceived social norms about drinking, as students see their peers sharing the campaign message and participating in the campaign. This study sought to understand the persuasiveness of messages shared by peers (gain-framed vs. loss-framed) via social media for anti-binge drinking campaigns. This study used a 2 (frame: gain vs. loss) × 2 (focus: personal vs. relational) × 2 (repetition) mixed-experimental design. Data from 112 undergraduate students indicate that students exposed to messages with a relational focus were less likely to perceive that binge drinking is acceptable by their peers than were those who viewed personal-focus messages. Similarly, when the message focus was on maintaining relationships rather than personal benefits, the loss-framed messages worked better than the gain-framed messages for behavioral intentions.",Antismoking/Antidrinking: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication

In the current study the effects of gain versus loss framed messages on cigarette warning labels an their interactive effects with self-efficacy messages were studied. It was hypothesized that gain framed messages would be equally or more persuasive than loss framed messages, when supplemented with low self-efficacy messages, while loss framed messages were expected to be more effective than gain framed messages, when supplemented with high self-efficacy messages. To test this hypothesis a 2(message frame type: gain/loss) x 2(self-efficacy type: low/high) between-subjects experiment was conducted. In the low self-efficacy conditions no differences were found between gain and loss framed messages. In the high self-efficacy conditions, loss frames resulted in significantly higher intentions to quit smoking than gain frames. These findings align with prior research and provide insight into the application of self-efficacy messages on cigarette warning labels.",Antismoking/Antidrinking: High Density Panel in Health Communication,Health Communication

We look at the changing micro-role transitions, derived from boundary theory, in the office as a result of FWDs. Based on in-depth interviews with 23 professionals working at a construction company, this study identifies how this new work design puts specific demands on employees, and how these are dealt with in practice. We advance upon boundary theory by applying it to FWDs and introducing an element of status. All job levels have to perform within FWDs, although the concept seems to be designed only for knowledge workers. Finally, we show that employees deal with the tensions that result from working within FWDs through the individualization of the problems and their solutions, including the constant need to regulate external stimuli that come from the design.",Work-Life Balance and Flexible Work,Organizational Communication

Work-life issues concerning the intersections of personal and professional life affect men and women worldwide. Many scholars attribute the clash between organizational demands and non-work obligations to perceptions of the ideal worker, a deep-seated cultural norm in which a presumably male employee is expected to make work his chief priority. Although traditional ideal-worker norms are still prevalent and problematized in modern organizations, the rise of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the evolution of work relationships (i.e., part-time work, virtual work, contract work, etc.) call for a re-examination of the ideal-worker norm.

2016-0531,2016,Paper Session,"I, Robot. You, Journalist. Who is the Author?",2,"A recent technological development embraced by a minority of pioneering journalistic organizations presents the ability of algorithms to generate journalistic content automatically and (to some extent) autonomously, referred as “automated journalism” or “robot journalism”. This phenomenon holds significant practical, sociopolitical, psychological, legal and occupational ramifications on both news organizations, journalists and the audience. One of its most controversial aspects is the algorithmic authorship. The purpose of this study is to suggest a crediting policy for automated news. Findings are based on interviews with key figures from these organizations and a quantitative content analysis of automated stories. The study detects major discrepancies between the anthropomorphic perceptions of the studied organizations toward algorithmic authorship and their lack of consistent attribution policies, in the background of deeply integrated scholarly theories. To mitigate these discrepancies, we suggest a consistent and comprehensive crediting policy for attribution of automated journalistic content, while sponsoring the public interest.","Robots, Machines, and Algorithms: Perspectives on Automated Journalism",Journalism Studies

We conducted two experiments to study people’s prior expectations and actual perceptions regarding quality, readability, and credibility of such automated in comparison to human-written news. The results were similar across both experiments. First, participants expected more from human-written news in terms of readability and quality but not in terms of credibility. Second, participants’ prior expectations were rarely met for both human-written and automated news. Third, actual perceptions depended on the experimental setting. When participants saw only one article, perceived differences were small. However, when participants saw two articles at once, one each per source, human-written news were rated higher on readability, whereas automated news were favored for credibility. Our results contest previous claims according to which expectation adjustment explains the small differences in perceptions of human-written and automated news.","Robots, Machines, and Algorithms: Perspectives on Automated Journalism",Journalism Studies

Using the cultural discourse theory, I discovered two contrastive colloquial terms used to indicate a sense of membering in the community: teng lang (i.e., Chinese people who act out their Chineseness) and ang moh sai or banana (i.e., Chinese people who act white). A deeper analysis of these identity terms revealed, in particular, that interlocutors are expected to enact Chineseness in Chinese-Chinese interactions, in which interlocutors are expected to create niceness and not hurt one another’s feelings, because the tone of the present conversation shapes the next one and people are interconnected. Interlocutors should be sensitive to each other’s dwelling in a conversation and in relation to the time and place of societal contexts. Creating niceness, while key in everyday conversation, is a rationalized move because interlocutors interpret their interconnections differently.","Culture and Social Interaction: Language, Identity, Community, and Intercultural Communication",Language & Social Interaction

With the help of new technologies, a virtual speech community has taken shape across the border with mainland China and ‘transborder conversation’ as a verbal practice has become routine. Sojourn students from the mainland, who usually stay in Hong Kong for several years, actively participate in this verbal practice. The present study aims to unpack the verbal practice of transborder conversations driven by sojourn students during the umbrella movement from the theoretical perspective of speech codes. By conducting ethnographies of speaking and in-depth interviews with 30 participants, two oppositional codes, cynicism and idealism, have been identified. Each code assumes different relations of the self and the state and different political efficacy, which manifests as different interactional practices. The presence of these oppositional codes has endangered the counter-hegemonic nature of transborder conversations. This study advances the theoretical literature on social movement diffusion by introducing and examining a mass-level type of diffusion triggered by ordinary people’s transborder conversations. It also has crossover with the subfield of mediatisation and sociolinguistic change. By introducing metaphorical concepts such as the ‘invisible interlocutor’ and ‘duelling intertextualities’, this study documents a special interactional practice under networked authoritarianism, and reveals the power dynamics in a mediatised speech community.","Culture and Social Interaction: Language, Identity, Community, and Intercultural Communication",Language & Social Interaction

More specifically, the assumption of this study is that there are common communicative grounds that Korean immigrant storekeepers and African American customers share rather than emphasizing their disparities. This case study shows how a Korean storeowner and his Black customers overcome possible sources of conflict and build a rapport through a discourse analysis of their mundane interactions and interviews. First, although the two groups have different cultural backgrounds, they find common ground in valuing long-term relationships and family ties. Second, the storeowner understands the Black community well and readily responds to its members’ demands on the basis of personal relationships with customers. His African American customers are highly receptive to this, as they perceive it as interpersonal recognition and respect.","Culture and Social Interaction: Language, Identity, Community, and Intercultural Communication",Language & Social Interaction

Much of this information is merely glanced at. Psychological research has shown that people spontaneously form impressions even from minimal exposure to information. Such snap judgments can play an important role in social media, as they can allow users to gain awareness of their unprecedentedly large online networks. However, the extent to which spontaneous trait inferences are made on social media is not clear because social media updates are self-generated and mild in content and because multiple updates are viewed simultaneously.

This paper focuses on the role of personal, social and mass media channels in hedonic event mobilizations. In the context of a unique case (Project X Haren) a survey is conducted. We found that expectations of the event are related to intention to participate. Moreover, the intention to participate is related to actual behaviour. Secondly, we found that social media is related to expectations. We conclude that, indirectly, social media can mobilize people to participate in an event. Other channels, mass media and authorities turned out to have no effect on expectations.

Can social media overcome the problem of collective action, that rational actor will opt to free-ride on other people's efforts instead of taking action? Social media features often make the implicit number of potential participants more explicit. While the number of participants can increase social conformity (bandwagon), it may also lead to free-riding through reducing the impact of individual contributions. We conducted an online experiment using mock-up Facebook action pages to examine the effect of number of participants on people’s self-efficacy, perceived likelihood of success, and intentions to take part in the collective action. The results found a bandwagon effect through perceived likelihood of success. We also found a curvilinear relationship between number of participants and self-efficacy, self-efficacy drops off after a certain point and people are more likely to free-ride.","Social Media, Political Mobilization, and Participation",Communication and Technology
2016-0551,2016,Paper Session,The Social Media Participation Model: A Goal Systems Theory Perspective,3,"Social media provide entirely new ways for citizens to become politically engaged. Accordingly, the study of social media and political participation has been rapidly expanding over the past years. Although the majority of studies suggests that the use of social media can promote various forms of political participation, there is a lack of theorizing about the precise psychological processes behind a potential relation between the two of them. This paper attempts to fill this gap by suggesting and discussing a Social Media Participation Model (SMPM). Taking a goal systemic perspective, the model specifies a set of interrelated processes that need to be realized so that social media use affects political participation. Furthermore, key contingent conditions are outlined and insights into fostering political participation are offered. The article, finally, explains ways of testing the model with surveys and experiments. Implications for research on social media and political participation are discussed.","Social Media, Political Mobilization, and Participation",Communication and Technology
2016-0552,2016,Paper Session,Beyond Hallin and Mancini: A Media System Typology Based on 16 Nonwestern Countries,2,"Following Hallin and Mancini and comparing 16 national media systems outside the prosperous Western world, this paper asks for major principles that could explain different media structures around the globe. The study is grounded in social theory and based on material, which has been collected and analyzed by means of method triangulation. It includes data from more than 150 elite interviews and draws on extensive documentary analysis. The paper shows that steering the public information and opinion-forming stage is not only made up of media laws, media regulation authorities and political actors, but also clearly a function of informal structures of expectations such as media freedom tradition and the importance of that freedom for the people, media financing and, closely related to it, media market structures. The tool to do so is a mass media system typology based on two dimensions: formal expectations and the state’s influence.",Mass Communication Research at the Systems Level (TOP STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication

Results suggest that similarities in time spent viewing and multichannel subscribership remain more important in predicting viewing pattern similarity in general and by channel type. People who spent similar amount of time watching television tended to have similar viewing pattern. Both multichannel subscribers and non-subscribers tended to watch network channels. The two groups had different viewing patterns for only entertainment-oriented content. The findings provide theoretical implications for audience polarization and methodological implications of network analysis in audience research.,Mass Communication Research at the Systems Level (TOP STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication

Results show that the rate at which the Internet has penetrated society has a significantly negative effect on the strength of social connection dependency on the Internet. Individuals will be more highly dependent on the Internet for information seeking and self-expression when they perceive their personal environments to be threatening. Those who perceive the Internet as credible are significantly more likely to rely on the Internet to achieve various personal goals. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence that political affordances of the Internet are premised on the characteristics of the individuals’ MSD relations. Social connection dependency is negatively associated with internal political efficacy. And there is a significant and negative relationship between self-expression dependency and external political efficacy.",Mass Communication Research at the Systems Level (TOP STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication
2016-0555,2016,Paper Session,Understanding Asian Media Systems: How Has the Press Enhanced or Hindered Digitally Mediated Political Activism?,1,"In this study, I argue that a cross-national variation in Asian media systems is an important aspect of understanding the contextual effects of a new opportunity of political communication on individuals’ political participation. Multi-level modeling is used to test whether the impact of Internet use at the individual level is contingent on the newspaper-market structure at the country level. The data came from the World Press Trends for the media-system variables and the Asian Barometer Survey for the individual-level variables. I found that, as Asian countries have a larger circulation of newspapers, unconventional political participation is predicted by: (1) greater political interest; (2) lower news consumption; (3) less frequent political discussion; and (4) low Internet use. The findings suggests that, when media systems become more characterized by the development of a mass-circulation press, the cost structures of public information are less favorable for Internet diffusion to enhance political mobilization.",Mass Communication Research at the Systems Level (TOP STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication
2016-0556,2016,Paper Session,Adolescents’ Development of Political Interest: A Communication Mediation Approach Using Five Waves of Panel Data,2,"Research indicates that political interest is one of the most important individual-level predictors of news media use, public opinion formation and engagement. When, how and why some citizens develop a strong interest in politics, while others do not, is however less clear. The present study analyses the development of political interest during the formative years of adolescence, using a five-wave panel study of adolescents, their parents and friends conducted in Sweden. More specifically, based on the citizen communication mediation model, we analyze how news media norms and habits among family and friends influence the development of political interest among adolescents during a period of five years. Taken together, the findings lend support for several of the hypotheses derived from the communication mediation model. But while empirical support for distinct mechanisms and processes are found, news norms among parents and peers seem to be relatively weakly related to adolescents’ political interest.","News Exposure and Effects: Knowledge, Interest, and Behavior",Political Communication

While prior studies explained information seeking behavior in general, this study takes a step back and examines the driving forces for paying attention to news. By systematically integrating content analysis data (N = 6,432 news stories) with a three-wave panel survey (N = 1,497) this study sheds light on the decisive factors increasing attention towards information about the 2014 EP election among the electorate. Results of OLS regression models in pre- and post-election times demonstrate that amongst others opinion leadership, voting intention and positive affections towards the EU predict citizens’ attentiveness for EP elections. Media coverage about eligible parties and candidates plays a marginal role.","News Exposure and Effects: Knowledge, Interest, and Behavior",Political Communication

An Eye-Tracking Experiment,3,"This study examines to what extent modality of news (i.e., whether news is presented in a printed newspaper, in an e-newspaper on a tablet or news website) affects visual attention to news, and subsequently, learning from news. Data for this study was collected with a laboratory experiment using eye tracking. Results show that reading news in a printed newspaper, leads to more news learning than reading news on a website. This might partly be explained by the fact that citizens who read news on a website, read less articles. But if they do read those articles, they read these specific articles for a longer period of time. This has subsequently a positive effect on recall of information.","News Exposure and Effects: Knowledge, Interest, and Behavior",Political Communication

In a 4x2 within-subjects lab experiment, participants browsed online news while selective exposure was unobtrusively logged. Findings yielded a preference for personalized and dramatized articles and for news with low authority-disorder bias. Fragmentation had no significant impact on selective exposure. However, the preference for fragmentation was influenced by participants’ internal political efficacy, while exposure to personalization depended on individuals’ general news enjoyment, and preference for authority-disorder bias was affected by subjects’ duty to keep informed. Results suggest that a combination of ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ elements may address informational needs of today’s citizens best.","News Exposure and Effects: Knowledge, Interest, and Behavior",Political Communication

Little is known so far how this changes their informational behavior in election campaign times, what information young voters actually receive and whether the exposure to campaign related news via social media affects their electoral behavior. Our study therefore examines, using a smartphone-based media diary, how the first time voters of today use social media channels to inform about an upcoming election. To this end, Danish first-time voters (n=364) were surveyed over three weeks leading up to the national election in 2015. Our study indicates that social media platforms are their main information source for campaign news and that such platforms can help to mobilize first-time voters to engage with an upcoming election.","News Exposure and Effects: Knowledge, Interest, and Behavior",Political Communication

Set against the backdrop of the exclusionary effects of news media representations, this interview study of a group of minority youth makes evident that mass mediated hip hop music is for them taken to entail public representation of minority experiences and sensibilities that engender a sense of symbolic inclusion. By combining recognition theory and reception theory, this article shows how hip hop-related media coverage is experienced to involve a positive affirmation of minority identity that also contributes to the formation of civic bonds among minorities. This article further argues that recognition theory makes up a valuable supplementary concept in our theoretical understanding of the civic dimensions of media reception, and the role of popular culture therein.","Music, Sound, and Popular Culture",Popular Communication

2016-0564,2016,Paper Session,In Living Sound: The Production and Management of Diasporic Connectivity Through Podcast Talk (Top Paper),1,"Media in the South Asian American diaspora underwent a dramatic shift in the 2000s as a slew of second-generation-driven collaborative digital media projects were developed, complementing the dominant practice of recirculating content directly from the subcontinent. The latter implied an audience looking back to a distant homeland; the new projects promoted a self-conscious idea of being South Asian American. Drawing on scholarship from sound, digital media, and cultural studies, particularly the literature on “broadcast talk,” this paper examines a South Asian American podcast, revealing the constant, mundane, and collaborative labor that goes into the creation and management of connectivity. Connectivity must be conceptualized as not only a technological feat, but also as a cultural practice and process, in this example informed by a diasporic sensibility of connection-in-dispersion. The study of the everyday media of diasporic, minority, and marginalized communities is critical as they pioneer the management of cultural connectivity.","Music, Sound, and Popular Culture",Popular Communication

Three main categories were coded for: areas of high contrast/interest, spatial considerations, and colors based on the Winner-Takes-All prediction. The content analysis revealed sustainability leaders did not employ all categories to capture attention and maximize information processing by the viewer. We also conducted a total of 37 interviews with sustainability leaders (SL) at the top 25 sustainable universities in the U.S. to examine how they made their design decisions for their print media efforts.

Art is filtered through the staging of the museum, especially through media. Prominent is a set of fixed and mobile interfaces which accompany and augment the experience of the art piece itself. Therefore the perception of art is often mediated by other technologies: text, audio, video, or interactive installations. We examined whether media modalities, especially interactive simulations of the art production process, alter not just aesthetic experience but also the way users perceive and interact with paintings. Two experiments examine the effect of different levels of media modality (text, audio, video, interactive) on users’ aesthetic experience: their sense of flow and sense of presence. We found that increased media richness increase users sense of presence and flow. Media modalities used to augment interaction with art in museums significantly affect aesthetic experience. Interactive installations may significantly enrich the experience.","Perception, Cognition, and Experience in Visual Communication Research",Visual Communication Studies

Instead of using face-to-face communication, North Korean refugees tend to use diverse digital media channels such as social network sites and web portals to learn about South Korea’s value system, social norms, and even how to form relationships. Based on this social phenomenon, this paper tries to analyze the role of digital access and literacy in relation to North Korean refugees’ adaptation by employing the concept of social capital. Based on in-depth interviews with 12 North Korean refugees, the results of this paper show that the use of digital media is pervasive among North Korean refugees living in South Korea but also that digital media plays an important role for North Korean refugees’ social capital.",Online Social Capital,Communication and Technology

Drawing on the concepts of media logic and media interventionism, it examines the degree to which newspaper from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France have used indicators of “anti-politics bias” in their public affairs reporting between the 1960s and 2000s. Combining a cross-national with a cross-temporal perspective, the paper aims to uncover the causal mechanism behind an increase in mediatized political news. To test the hypothesized relationships, the paper uses multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM). It finds a positive effect between “temporal development” (main predictor) and “mediatized news coverage” (outcome), and finds “interpretative journalism” and “enterprise reporting” (as moderators) to serve as important facilitators and amplifiers in the process. The mediatization process is strongest for the US and British media, followed by the Italian and French media.

Hence, it is crucial to analyse the conditions that might determine a positive or a negative tone towards immigration. We use a content analysis of newspaper articles about immigration in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom (2013-2014) to study how newspapers’ characteristics and the range of actors that ‘talk’ in the news might influence the tone. The results of a multilevel model show that both the newspaper environment and the actor environment matter in shaping the tone towards immigration. More specifically, articles in quality newspapers use a significantly more positive tone to represent immigration, as compared to popular newspapers. Also, the inclusion of quotes by immigrant actors in the news leads to a more positive tone towards immigration, especially when individual immigrants are quoted.",Political News in Comparative Perspective,Political Communication

Findings indicate that the widely noted decline in trust in the press is not a universal trend; it is true for only about half of the studied countries, and it was most dramatic in the United States. Second, of all potential sources of trust in the press, political trust has emerged as the key factor in the formation and decline of trust in the press. The influence of political trust was more pronounced in politically polarized societies.

Using data from a two-wave longitudinal survey among 942 adolescents (10 to 14 years; 50.3% girls), results indicate that restrictive mediation communicated in an autonomy-supportive style was cross-sectionally related to decreased media violence exposure and aggression. Alternatively, inconsistent restrictive mediation was cross-sectionally related to increased media violence and aggression. No longitudinal relationships were found for any restrictive mediation styles. Active mediation did not moderate the relationship between media violence exposure and aggression – regardless of the style used. Findings suggest that autonomy-supportive restriction may be an effective route for parents who are concerned about their child’s media violence exposure and aggressive behavior.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media

However, when it comes to product placements, the effectiveness of these strategies to shield children against advertising effects has not been investigated. This paper describes an experimental study in which children were exposed to different versions of a cartoon-movie which included placements for a chips brand. Children's attitudinal and behavioral outcomes were matched with surveys completed by the children’s parents who answered questions about mediation styles and conversations about placements. Results showed that plot-placements presenting a character-product-interaction lead to an increase in children’s product choice. Parents’ mediation styles and conversations were not able to prevent behavioral outcomes. However, talking with children about product placements reduced their future purchase intention independent of experimental condition. Our findings offer insights into children’s susceptibility to product placement relevant to parents, educators, and policy regulators.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media

It critically examines the limitations of parental mediation theory as applied to current trends in children’s video gaming and suggests how it can be enhanced. Through interviews with 41 parent-child dyads, this study seeks to improve parental mediation theory’s descriptive and explanatory strength by conceptualising parental mediation of video games as comprising gatekeeping, discursive, diversionary and investigative processes that better reflect the current media landscape.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media

An existing parental television mediation scale was reversed and filled in by a sample of 187 parent-adolescent dyads (N= 374) in a cross-sectional survey in XXX. Dyadic data were used, and correlation coefficients were examined to determine interdependence between the answers of the parents and their child. Factor analyses showed that the three original subscales were produced by the reversed version of the scale, and that the internal validity was high. When comparing the parent and child reports, both groups had congruent views about reversed parental television mediation.

Finally, regression models showed that reversed restrictive television mediation was positively and significantly related to higher levels of parent-adolescent television conflict, which was used to assess construct validity.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0587,2016,Paper Session,The Role of Parents on Children's Media Use: A Meta-Analysis of Parental Mediation,1,"The present research aims to systematically examine the effectiveness of parental mediation on media use among kids (0-11years), adolescents (12–17 years), and emerging adults (18–28 years). Specifically, this study examined the magnitude of effects of three main parental mediation strategies—active mediation, restrictive mediation, and co-using— on reducing the amount of media use and the incidence of media-related risks using a meta-analysis of 31 empirical studies regarding the effects of parental mediation, which represented a total sample of 44,674 participants and yielded 71 independent correlations. The results revealed that restrictive mediation was more effective than active mediation in decreasing the time children spend on media, whereas the effects of active mediation and co-using were greater than restrictive mediation in reducing the incidence of media-related risks. Further analyses suggest that age, type of risks, medium, and culture significantly moderated the effects of active mediation or restrictive mediation on reducing the amount of media use and the incidence of media-related risks. Implications and limitations were discussed.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0588,2016,Paper Session,Using Moral Foundations Theory and Parent Mediation to Understand the Effect of Child Exposure to Televised Moral Lessons on Transfer to Moral Situations,4,"Little work has considered the influence of televised moral messages on children’s morality, and no work has examined the role of parent mediation in this process. Using Moral Foundations Theory, this study examined the effect of exposure to a developmentally-advanced moral message present in a prosocial television episode on children’s perspective-taking, ratings of violence, and verbal moral reasoning. One hundred and one parent-child dyads were randomly assigned to experimental condition. Results indicate that treatment video exposure was related to greater gains in perspective-taking, and finding justified violence to be more right, compared to a control. These differences were magnified for children who received parent mediation. There was no main effect of condition on children’s verbal moral reasoning. These results demonstrate the dual-processing nature of morality as predicted by Moral Foundations Theory, with implications for the measurement of morality in children and the use of moral lessons in children’s television programming.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media

Single parents and non-Dutch parents reported the most problems, whereas less media-literate parents and parents with less media-literate children in particular felt less competent in their mediation. Level of education and income, younger or older siblings, and different types of media devices at home or in the child’s bedroom had no or little influence on parents’ experiences with their mediation practices.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0590,2016,Paper Session,Parents and TV as Socializers of 6- to 19-Year-Olds' Expressions of Emotion: Representative Data From Germany,4,"This study examines joint influences of parental socialization and self-socialization via mass media on children's expression of emotions. The effect of parental approval of their child’s expression of emotions on the child’s approval of TV characters expressing the emotion, and the influence of both on the child's expression of emotions within the past 7 days is tested for the emotions fear, sadness anger, and joy with a representative survey of children (N = 1458) aged 6–19 in Germany. Moderating age effects were also considered. Consistent across the four emotions, results showed that self-socialization of emotions via mass media is (partly) driven by internalized parental socialization but has a comparably strong effect of its own on the child's expression of emotion that adds to the variance explained, especially with regard to high potency emotions such as anger or joy. Implications for the conceptualization of parental emotion socialization and emotional self-socialization are discussed.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0591,2016,Paper Session,"Rules, Role Model, or Attachment? The Impact of Parents on Their Children’s Problematic Mobile Phone Involvement",4,"Parents can influence their children’s problematic mobile phone involvement (PMPI) by applying measures of parental mediation, by role modeling their own mobile phone behavior, and by their general and domain-unspecific parenting style that facilitates more or less attachment security of the child. Moreover, children’s attachment security might moderate the effect of parental mediation on PMPI as mediation measures should be more effective within good parent-child relationships. This study tested these assumptions with data acquired from a quota-sample survey with 500 children between 8 and 14 years of age and one of their parents. Results point to the importance of (facilitating) attachment security in order to prevent PMPI and demonstrate detrimental effects of parents’ own PMPI on children’s PMPI.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0592,2016,Paper Session,Social Networking Sites and Materialism: Safeguarding Roles of Parents and Personal Traits,3,"Social networking sites (SNSs) have become indispensable avenues for the young to connect with friends, acquaintances, and even strangers. Although previous studies have examined how SNSs facilitate information sharing and acquisition leading to diverse volitional behaviors, scant research has investigated how the use of SNSs shapes young people’s materialistic values and beliefs. Employing cultivation theory, the present study tests the contention that consumption-related SNS use leads to the development of materialism among emerging adults, which would in turn result in lower psychological well-being. This investigation also proposes that youths’ self-regulation ability and close relationships with parents could buffer such harmful effects. Survey data gathered from 903 youths aged 17-24 in Singapore lend strong empirical support to the hypotheses. Implications for educators and policy makers are discussed.",Extended Session: Parental Mediation,Children Adolescents and the Media

Nearly 5 years later newsgames have not clearly delivered on their potential. With such promise, why didn’t news presses give way to newsgame studios?
This paper provides a simple case study in newsgame production, providing a set of lessons learned from an academic studio working with (anonymized), one of the largest United States based daily newspapers. It does so to examine the contemporary opportunities and challenges in producing games for news organizations.
The paper describes how the increased reliability of low cost, simple game-making software has afforded for the production of just-in-time newsgames. Such opportunity may facilitate a second wave of newsgames as lowered cost of production, increased distribution channels and growing ludic literacy of the general population facilitates their success. However three challenges remain obstacles to their growth: the pace of news; a misunderstanding of the rhetorical properties of games media, and an evolving ludoliteracy shaped by social currency and politics.",On the Technical Side of Digital Games,Game Studies

Two hundred-two participants played a mobile game in a 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design and then completed a questionnaire about their game-play experience and personality traits. The game was played with or without in-game purchases and on a larger screen (i.e., an iPad Air) or a smaller screen (ie., an iPhone 4s). Results show that in-game purchases and a larger screen size have no significant effects on flow. However, particular personality traits did influence flow and interact with the presence of in-game purchases. Furthermore, flow was found to have a positive relationship with the degree of attitudinal loyalty toward the game. The implications of the results are discussed.",On the Technical Side of Digital Games,Game Studies

Advances in gaming technology encourage the development of natural user interfaces (NUIs), but evidence suggests gamers to prefer familiar controllers when playing most games. Comparing gamepad and NUIs users in an online survey, participants had less experience using NUIs, resulting in lower self-efficacy and enjoyment.

In an experiment, we tested whether the presence of blood in a violent game or the use of headphones among players impacted emotions (frustration, fear, anxiety) and the level of cognitive elaboration. Contrary to expectations, results suggest participants felt more frustration, fear and anxiety when playing a bloody game with the headphones off (versus on). When the video game was not bloody, on the other hand, the use of headphones did not affect emotions. In addition, player frustration was related to cognitive elaboration whereas fear and anxiety were not. Implications for research exploring discrete emotions, as well as the intersection between auditory and visual features in video games, are discussed.",On the Technical Side of Digital Games,Game Studies

An optimal balance between challenges and skills triggers the subjective experience of “flow”, a focused motivation leading to a feeling of spontaneous joy. Here we present the validation of a novel technique to indirectly assess the extent to which subjects experience flow during real game play by assessing attentional engagement; first behaviorally and in a second stage by means of electroencephalogram(EEG) recordings. An auditory novelty oddball paradigm, used to investigate attention in the field of cognitive neuroscience, was implemented as a secondary task while subjects played in three conditions: Boredom, Frustration and Flow. We found slower reaction times and higher error rates in the Flow condition. EEG analysis revealed a response-locked fronto-central negative deflection significantly delayed during flow, likely signaling the re-allocation of attentional resources",On the Technical Side of Digital Games,Game Studies
2016-0598,2016,Paper Session,CSR Communication in the Business-to-Business Context: An Exploratory Study,3,"In order for CSR to be effective, it requires sophisticated communication strategies. As most research about CSR has been performed in a consumer setting, the goal of this study was to gain an insight in the way in which business-to-business organizations communicate about their CSR initiatives. Qualitative interviews were conducted with CSR experts who work in or for business-to-business organizations. Participants (N = 16) were asked to elaborate on whether or not the same characteristics of CSR communication as described in business-to-consumer literature are relevant in their specific business-to-business context. According to the CSR experts, CSR is not about supporting social causes anymore. Therefore, supporting social causes that fit the organization, is not considered to be CSR anymore either. Rather, participants of this study suggest an integrated approach to CSR, which has come to be known as strategic CSR. Strategic CSR is designed for creating business value and positive social change, and it is embedded in everyday business culture and processes, so CSR initiatives should be designed and implemented at the strategic level. As a logical result, CSR communication is not seen by the participants as a disconnected communications topic. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.",B.E.S.T.: Social Responsibility and Ethics in Communication Practice and Research,Organizational Communication
2016-0599,2016,Paper Session,Communicating CSR: Navigating the CSR-Luxury Paradox Online through a Discourse of Balance and Convergence,2,"While the notion of responsible luxury has garnered considerable attention, it has also been met with scathing criticism. This is aggravated by the notion of CSR-luxury paradox, which arises from the seemingly contradictory values between CSR and luxury. Employing theoretical frameworks in CSR communication and paradox management, this study aimed to examine how luxury brands employed linguistic and rhetorical devices to communicatively navigate the CSR-luxury paradox online. Qualitative content analysis using a linguistic approach conducted across 43 luxury brand websites revealed that the luxury sector employed active, long-term paradox management strategies to discursively navigate the CSR-luxury paradox online, showcasing sophisticated understanding of paradox management. Nevertheless, some brands lapsed into reactive short-term strategies such as repression and reaction-formation. This paper contributes to the emergent body of literature on CSR communication by luxury brands, while adding to a nuanced, interpretive approach to examining CSR communication and paradox management online.",B.E.S.T.: Social Responsibility and Ethics in Communication Practice and Research,Organizational Communication

Each of these countries faces different types of sustainability challenges, in light of cultural, environmental, legal and economic differences. The objective of this study is, therefore, to conduct a comparative study of the state of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting by the top ranking companies to determine 1) whether variations exist in CSR performance; 2) the extent of variation if they exist; and 3) the variables that can help explain the existing variations.
The study finds that there are many ways in which corporate sustainability reporting can be further improved.

Specifically, this paper considers the powerful role of food retailers and how they may be considered to be legitimately engaging in socially responsible behaviors to lower in-store food waste, yet acting irresponsibly by implementing practices that ultimately contribute to higher levels of food waste elsewhere in the supply chain. In this sense, this paper argues that there is not a legitimacy gap between what the organization claims to be doing and what they are actually doing, but rather a legitimacy gap and a level of CSR ambivalence stemming from a strategic intent which see practices benefiting the organization at the expense of other stakeholders.",B.E.S.T.: Social Responsibility and Ethics in Communication Practice and Research,Organizational Communication

Although research on important aspects of engaged scholarship such as its tensional nature is progressing, there is a need to study how events external to engaged scholarly projects affect these projects. This paper addresses such questions by examining one engaged scholarship initiative’s locally-led Ebola prevention campaign in Liberia. Drawing on qualitative data that the research team collected as part of its campaign evaluation and the reflections of researchers, we articulate tensions in assessing impact: (1) urgency and continuity, (2) action and research, (3) empathy and distance, and (4) attribution and contribution. We complicate the challenge of assessing impact further by underscoring an overarching tension between (a) facilitating engaged scholarship that seeks to have immediate impact and (b) systematically and empirically demonstrating the impact of those efforts.",B.E.S.T.: Social Responsibility and Ethics in Communication Practice and Research,Organizational Communication

Ethical problems addressed by advertising practitioners have significantly increased over the past 30 years, and digitalization plays an important role. Three central, ethics-challenging areas could be identified: (1) the moralization of the markets, (2) the automation of the business and (3) the rise of new entrants. The answers to the question, whether ethical concerns regarding privacy protection in times of digitalization gained relevance, are multifaceted: Every advertising practitioner recognized privacy issues as central—but there are downplay statement groups: (1) advertising does not define the rules, (2) what is legally right, is morally right and (3) the consumer preferences concerning privacy issues are paradox.",B.E.S.T.: Social Responsibility and Ethics in Communication Practice and Research,Organizational Communication

Based on Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) with the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM), we aim to look at how consumers’ CSR skepticism (dispositional and situational) plays a role in coping with corporations’ CSR communication in crisis situations. Employing two multiphase experiments, we found that dispositional CSR skepticism did not moderate the effects of crisis type (Study 1), but situational CSR skepticism, which was triggered by different CSR motives, significantly interacted with crisis type on purchase intention (Study 2). More interestingly such an interaction effect was mediated by CSR skepticism. We discuss theoretical as well as practical implications based on the theories.",The Power of CSR in Times of Crisis,Public Relations

We test whether the impact of prior CSR reputation differs by crisis type. The value of post CSR reputation for anticipating consumer responses is examined as well. An online experiment was conducted. The buffering effects of CSR reputation in times of product-harm crisis were found. Study findings revealed a determinant role of prior CSR reputation in protecting reputational assets. A company with a good prior CSR reputation experiences no decrease in its CSR reputation during victim crises, and a minimal decrease even during preventable crises. A company with a bad prior CSR reputation experiences a great decline in its CSR reputation across both crises cases. As post-CSR reputation is more positive, consumers displayed greater resistance to negative information, supportive communication intent and crisis resiliency.",The Power of CSR in Times of Crisis,Public Relations

Sites like Yelp build massive audiences based on their credibility as authentic, accurate, external reviewers. This study looks at how the co-opting of TPRS pages by advocates and protesters influences public perceptions of credibility on these sites. Specifically, it explores the public’s reaction to Yelp as a digital space of protest after the death of Cecil the Lion at the hands of a Minnesota dentist. Through focus groups, this study identifies that TPRS audiences look for consistency in reviews to determine credibility; the public sees advocacy as harming the credibility of the overall site; current events play a role in the interpretation of TPRS; and the intentions of users is key to building a reputation as credible in digital media.",The Power of CSR in Times of Crisis,Public Relations

The analysis of this case study examines the interaction of BuzzFeed and Gawker, two major online news sites, as they engage in boundary-drawing actions and metajournalistic discourse following deviant behavior on the part of BuzzFeed. The resulting findings suggest that these emergent actors in the journalistic community adopt some of the traditional values of journalism.

The model reveals strategies that experts of future work pursue in order to legitimize their claims. Findings from an exploratory analysis of predictions by future-of-news experts show mixed support for the model, and more emphasis on legitimizing claims publicly than on testing or validating them.

Egocentric networks of a randomly selected 227 active users were extracted from an existing online social network. The study tracked social support messages received by the 227 users for three months. 3270 social support messages were coded into one of the four types of support, including information, emotional, esteem and network social support. The results showed that the brokerage structure operationalized as effective size was a positive predictor to received information and emotional social support. Lack of brokerage in personal networks operationalized as aggregated constraint was a negative predictor to reception of all types of support. In addition, the closure structure operationalized as local clustering coefficient was a positive predictor to received information, emotional and esteem social support.",Social Network Studies in Health Communication,Health Communication

However, little is known about the underlying mechanism through which communicative behaviors influence preventive behaviors. Thus, in the context of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, this study investigates how two communicative behaviors (message expression and reception) in SNSs affect the communicators’ intentions to engage in MERS-preventive behaviors. Using data collected from a nationally representative panel survey of 1,000 South Korean adults aged 19 or older, we examine a theoretical expression and reception effects model. Results support the presence of effects from expressing and receiving MERS-related information via SNSs and their underlying mechanism during South Korea’s MERS outbreak.

In an experiment (N = 142), subjects primed with specific motivational goals (accuracy, defense, or impression motivations, as well as a control group) were asked to search for information. Participants preferred attitude-consistent information and balanced information over attitude-inconsistent information, and also preferred highly recommended articles to less popular ones. Defense-motivated readers exhibited a stronger confirmation bias, while impression motivation amplified the effects of social recommendations.

Humor as a Response to Fear: Decomposing Fear Control Within the Extended Parallel Process Model,3,"This study seeks to analyze fear control responses to the 2012 Tips from Former Smokers campaign using the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM). The goal is to examine the occurrence of ancillary fear control responses like humor. In order to explore individuals’ responses in an organic setting, we use Twitter data—tweets—collected via the Firehose. Content analysis of relevant fear control tweets (N = 14,281) validated the existence of boomerang responses within the EPPM: denial, defensive avoidance, and reactance. More importantly, results showed that humor tweets were not only a significant occurrence but constituted the majority of fear control responses.",Emotion and Information Processing,Communication and Technology
2016-0622,2016,Paper Session,To Fear or Not to Fear? Understanding the Role of Social Media in Risk Amplification,3,"The advent of social media has brought about changes in the way risk information is perceived and disseminated among individuals. Due to the interactivity of social media, individuals are more likely to act as stations of influence in the amplification of risk. This study utilized 2 nationwide environmental health events, smoke haze and dengue fever, which plagued Singapore during 2013 as the context. Among the antecedents explored were the influence of information channels (social media and traditional media) on risk judgment, negative affects, information-seeking, and information-sharing on the enactment of preventive behaviors. Results supported the presence of social amplification of risk for the haze event due to increased chatter (posting, updates, and pictures) on social media, while the dengue event is attenuated. Thus, it appears that social media exposure overshadows the influence of traditional media exposure on risk judgment, negative affects, information-seeking, information-sharing, and preventive behaviors.",Emotion and Information Processing,Communication and Technology
2016-0623,2016,Paper Session,"What’s in a Username? Civility, Group Identification, and Norms",4,"Understanding the role comments in online discussion spaces have on participants has begun to gain traction in the communication literature. While there is ample research addressing potential negative effects of being exposed to uncivil comments, there is little research addressing potential moderating or mediating influences. This paper proposes that understanding who is making the comments, and what individuals expect the online environment to be, will serve as moderators of incivility’s influence on the emotional response to reading these comments, which will subsequently influence intentions to engage in political discussion in the future. To examine this, a 2 (civility) X 2 (group identification) factorial-design experiment was conducted. Exposure to civil, in comparison to uncivil, comments increased enthusiasm, which subsequently influenced intention to engage in political discussion. This indirect effect was moderated by both in-group/out-group perceptions of the commenters and perceptions of whether or not incivility was common in online spaces.",Emotion and Information Processing,Communication and Technology
2016-0624,2016,Paper Session,Using Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas to Revisit Social Information Processing Theory,1,"Social Information Processing (SIP) theory is one of the most cited theories in computer-mediated communication (CMC). One its fundamental assertions is that while initially communication channels with nonverbal cues should be higher in relational communication than text-based CMC, over time these differences should diminish. However, in the theorist’s original empirical test of SIP, this was not found to be true, and there were no differences in communication channels. Further research suggested that this was because the CMC participants’ anticipation of a future interaction affected relational communication levels. To see if the original assertions of SIP hold, the present study attempts to replicate the original study in a novel context that should lack an anticipation of future interaction. Zero-acquaintance teams played the multiplayer online battle arena League of Legends three times in a row using either voice- or text-chat. Such a task should have no anticipation of future interaction.",Emotion and Information Processing,Communication and Technology

A Cross-Cultural Examination of Family Communication Patterns, Affection, and Conflicts Styles",1,"This paper examines the impacts of family communication patterns (FCP), family members’ affection and culture on how families communicates conflicts between adult children and their parents in three different cultures. Participants (N = 594) from the U.S., China and Saudi Arabia completed self-report questionnaires including questions about perceptions of their family’s conversation orientation, conformity orientation, their level of affection with their parents and their preferences of conflict strategies. The results show that cross-cultural variations in how family communicates conflicts are more readily understood by considering an individual family’s emphasis on conversation, conformity and family members’ affection for each other in combination with culture. These indicators are more predictive than culture alone in the outcome of how families manage conflicts between parents and children across different cultures. The study provides further evidence to investigate culture’s indirect impact in cross-cultural comparative studies.","Cross-Cultural studies on Family, Marriage, and Romantic Relationships",Intercultural Communication

Ninety-seven (N=97) Chinese immigrant mothers across the United States participated in this study. An online questionnaire was administered to participants via Chinese mothers’ network sites. The results indicated that the length of the stay in the U.S. was positively related to the conversation-oriented family communication patterns, and negatively related to the conformity-oriented family communication patterns. Cultural identity did not influence Chinese mothers’ parenting styles and family communication patterns. These findings further extend our understanding about how exposure to a new culture can influence family communication patterns among immigrant mothers.","Cross-Cultural studies on Family, Marriage, and Romantic Relationships",Intercultural Communication

A total of 319 Chinese and 262 Americans responded to questionnaires that assessed the value they placed on ten different communication skills. The results showed that Americans valued six out of ten communication skills more than Chinese (conversational, ego-supportive, expressiveness, informative, listening, and narrative skills), whereas Chinese valued one communication skill (persuasive skill) more than Americans in romantic relationships. Our study also detected significant gender similarities and differences in communication values in romantic relationships. Men and women from both cultural groups valued affectively oriented communication skills more than instrumentally oriented communication. In the meanwhile, women placed greater value on most of the communication skills than men did.","Cross-Cultural studies on Family, Marriage, and Romantic Relationships",Intercultural Communication

One hundred and eighty-nine Chinese college students and 198 Chinese parents were recruited to self-report their levels of globalization-based acculturation towards U.S. culture, English communication proficiency, and socioeconomic status. The results indicated that both Chinese students and parents, while strongly tied to Chinese culture, were positively oriented towards American culture, and that globalization-based acculturation was a strong predictor of their acceptance of self or children’s intercultural marriage. On the other hand, English communication proficiency did not have significant influence on Chinese students’ willingness to marry Americans. The higher Chinese parents’ socioeconomic status, the lower their willingness to let their children get married to Americans. Based these findings, we discuss implications for Chinese intercultural marriage and future directions for intercultural marriage studies","Cross-Cultural studies on Family, Marriage, and Romantic Relationships",Intercultural Communication

In this paper we map online debates on climate change in the German-language internet by examining a blogroll link network and evaluating the degree to which it is shaped by mainstream and skeptical views on climate change. By using the theoretical framework of the networked public sphere, we describe the relation between publics and counter-publics and discuss the role of hyperlinks in delineating communities. Our hyperlink analysis shows the discourse to be polarized along factional lines with institutions supporting the mainstream “climate-friendly” position, whereas skeptics tend to be mostly individuals. We show that skeptics form a coalition with other groups like conspiracy theorists or racists. We furthermore find subdivisions along political and organizational lines, with public administration and NGOs relying on scientific organizations, but not vice versa.","Communicating Nature, Sustainability, and Environmental Issues Using Online Media Channels",Environmental Communication

This study examines the intersection of technological affordances, dialogic activity, and where traditional news gatekeepers are now situated in the contemporary multi-gated and networked media environment. Using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as a topical issue from the public and media agendas, social data was collected from Twitter. The most connected (and connecting) users were algorithmically identified and then sorted into ‘community’ groups. The resultant graphs visually and statistically identify which users were important gatekeepers and how the flow of information on this topic was being structured around and by certain users that acted as ‘hubs’ of communication in the network. Data for this study comprised a sample of just over 325,000 tweets that were analyzed to position traditional media gatekeepers amongst the public and other actors, such as scientists and activists to better understand social media coverage of a contentious issue, specifically on Twitter. Results suggest that the ongoing evolution of networked gatekeeping has led to the virtual absence of journalists and news organizations from prominence in social media coverage on certain topics, in this instance GMOs. Normative implications are discussed.","Communicating Nature, Sustainability, and Environmental Issues Using Online Media Channels",Environmental Communication
2016-0633,2016,Paper Session,Sustaining Sustainability: The Multistep Flow of Communication From Government,2,"Modern agricultural systems are experiencing a revolution in how information is disseminated and exchanged among networks of outreach professionals, farmers, consumers, and community stakeholders. The traditional approach to agricultural extension relied on a top-down, continuum model that went from university researchers to cooperative extension and finally to growers. With internet penetration rates rising in rural communities, stakeholders are increasingly experimenting with social media and agricultural information has been widely shared across local, national, and global networks. This paper addresses such networks by deploying a supervised snowball census of the agricultural social web to investigate the formation of communities dedicated to sharing agricultural information. We identified a cohort of 153 individuals responsible for the outreach initiatives at the University of California and mapped the first and second level network of followers connected to this community, thus rendering a population of 59K users that tweeted 250M tweets since signing up to Twitter. We processed the content of each tweet posted in 2014 using multiple classifiers and determined that the boundaries of the network comprise 32K nodes and 4M edges. The resulting graph shows that this community is clustered in areas of agricultural expertise with limited overlap across cliques. We also found increasing patterns of core-periphery dynamics associated with the level of expertise attached to each topical subnet. The paper concludes by discussing related literature and the policy implications of our research.","Communicating Nature, Sustainability, and Environmental Issues Using Online Media Channels",Environmental Communication
2016-0634,2016,Paper Session,A Longitudinal Study on Exposure to Sexually Explicit Internet Material and Adolescents’ Sexual Performance Orientation,3,"Little is known on how exposure to sexually explicit Internet material (SEIM) relates to a performance-focused orientation toward sex. Based on a longitudinal study among adolescents (N = 1,079), we found that watching SEIM stimulated a sexual performance orientation over time. A sexual performance orientation, in turn, partially increased adolescents’ exposure to SEIM. The relationship between exposure to SEIM and a sexual performance orientation was explained by a two-step mediation model. The more adolescents were exposed to SEIM, the more they enjoyed consuming this content. In turn, enjoyment of SEIM predicted adolescents’ perceived utility of SEIM. This increased perceived utility predicted a more intense performance orientation towards SEIM over time. Within this two-step model, we also found full support for a reciprocal relationship between using SEIM and enjoyment of SEIM and partial support for a reciprocal relationship between exposure to SEIM and perceived utility of SEIM.","Media, Sex, and Porn (TOP FACULTY PAPER)",Mass Communication

While previous work mostly focuses on motivation and cognitive mechanisms, this research examines the effect of chronic and temporally-induced disgust on 1) individuals’ perceptions of the negative influence of hate speech and pornography and 2) their willingness to censor them. Appraisal tendency theory predicts that the experience of stronger disgust leads to stronger perceived negative influence of—and stronger support of censoring—both messages. In contrast, the domain-specificity theory of disgust predicts that stronger pathogen (but not sexual or moral) disgust predicts stronger perceived negative influence of and willingness to censor hate speech, whereas stronger sexual (but not pathogen or moral) disgust predicts stronger perceived negative influence of and willingness to censor pornography. Findings of two studies (N’s = 79 and 89) support the domain-specificity theory of disgust but not appraisal tendency theory.","Media, Sex, and Porn (TOP FACULTY PAPER)",Mass Communication

However, little is known about the content of pornography. Based on Sternberg (1986), we defined sex without love as sex (a) without the decision to love another and commitment to maintain that love, (b) without intimacy, and (c) without passion. Through a content analysis of 400 popular pornographic Internet videos from the most visited pornographic websites, we investigated the depiction of love overall, as well as potential differences in the popular genres of amateur and teen pornography. The majority of videos depicted sex in a casual context, but did not omit intimacy and passion. Amateur videos were more likely to depict sex without love than professional videos. Teen videos that focused exclusively on young characters depicted sex more often in a loving relationship context. Internet pornography is thus clearly diversified, and requires a more nuanced understanding of its depiction of love.","Media, Sex, and Porn (TOP FACULTY PAPER)",Mass Communication

Using social network analysis (SNA), we attempted to explore the sexual behavior script in the 10 most popular content categories available on the site. After obtained a clearer view of the prevalent sexual behavior script in online pornography, based on media effect theories, we could explore how the script influences frequent online SEM users’ sexual attitudes and behaviors.","Media, Sex, and Porn (TOP FACULTY PAPER)",Mass Communication

Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) theory posits that online communication enables persons make declarations outside of social norms and power differentials. According to SIDE, Twitter provides a virtual safe space where Indian women may voice GBV-related opinions and press for social change. The current content analysis explored gender differences, using a randomly-selected sample of Indian GBV-related tweets (N=2,626) from September 3- October 1, 2013—a critical time in the above rape case. Females more often than males discussed the norm that blames women for GBV and views GBV as normal in relationships.

This study investigates relationships between motives of WeChat uses, gender, and self-disclosure among Chinese nationals, drawing on uses and gratification theory. A survey of 414 WeChat users found that using WeChat for (1) exhibitionism, relationship maintenance, affection needs, and entertainment needs are significant predictors of amount of self-disclosure; (2) affection needs significantly predict depth of self-disclosure; (3) entertainment needs is a significant predictor of valence of self-disclosure; (4) relationships maintenance and affection needs significantly predict honesty of self-disclosure.

Based on the diffusion of innovations and uses and gratifications theory, the study tries to identify the predictors of middle-aged individuals’ adoption and use of WeChat. Data was collected from a random sample of 300 tourists in Xiamen aged from 36-60. Results indicate that the perceived relative advantages of WeChat can significantly predict the adoption of it. However, its effect becomes very limited to predict WeChat use when the perceived needs for WeChat have been added to the model. In addition, as a heterogeneous group in many aspects, this research also finds that demographic variables (i.e. age, gender and income) and personal innovativeness show significance in predicting both the adoption and use of WeChat among middle-aged individuals.",Messaging Apps and Mobile Social Media (High-Density),Mobile Communication

The original formulation of microcoordination usually assumed point-to-point interaction between two individuals. Increasingly people channel this type of activity through messaging apps that allow for multi-sided interactions. Respondents note that messaging apps make it easy to establish task-based chat groups for coordinating their activities. These groups can vary in size from a handful of individuals to many dozen users. Despite the ease of forming and participating in chat groups, the respondents also realize it is sometimes difficult to manage the increasingly complex flow of messages and to manage the dynamic interaction because of collapsed social contexts.

To address this quandary, we suggest considering the perceived climate of opinion, which has also been found to be an important antecedent of political discussions. We posit that the effects of anger depend on the perceived hostility of the surrounding opinion climate, such that in a friendly opinion climate anger increases willingness to engage in political talk and in a hostile opinion climate anger reduces willingness to engage in political talk.

Deliberative polling results have showed that deliberation can protect against majority cycles by bringing preferences closer to single-peakedness, as evidenced by the increased aggregate-level proximity to single-peakedness after deliberation. However, the individual differences and changes in structuring single-peaked preferences has remained an unexplored territory. This paper is the first empirical study attempting to explain the individual-level preference changes that underpin the aggregate phenomenon of deliberation-induced single-peakedness. Analyzing a pooled data consisting of nine Deliberative Polls on thirteen policy issues, we found that (1) deliberation helped move individual preferences closer to single-peakedness, at least for low and moderate salient issues; (2) individuals moved closer to single-peakedness as they gained more knowledge after deliberation; and (3) the effect of knowledge on individual's movement to single-peakedness is conditional on issue salience, but independent of the substantive agreement in the small groups.",Political Discussion and Deliberation: Theoretical and Methodological Issues,Political Communication

In addition to revealing associations between increased depression, reduced PFF, and reduced help-seeking inclinations, two studies with different samples (Study 1: Spanish-Dominant Hispanics, Study 2: Non-Hispanic Whites), indicate support for the mediating role of PFF in the relationship between depression and help-seeking. Study 2 included an experiment: Participants were randomly assigned to recall positive or negative family experiences. Among non-depressed people, the positive manipulation improved PFF; however, among participants with elevated depressive symptomatology, writing about a positive family experience worsened PFF. Together, these results indicate that increasing PFF among people with depression has the potential to increase help-seeking, but also that influencing people with depression represents a staunch challenge.",Interpersonal Communication and Health,Interpersonal Communication

The doctor-patient communication during medical encounters may play a significant role in helping reduce people’s stress and depression. Based on Street’s pathways linking communication to health outcomes (2009), this paper signifies the mechanism that underlies how patient-centered communication improves emotional well-being. The results show that the impact of patient-centered communication on emotional well-being is mediated by patient satisfaction and emotion management. In addition, patient-centered communication and patient satisfaction both positively predict emotional well-being as well, supporting the partial mediation effects. The findings provide additional empirical evidence to the pathways from communication to health outcomes, one of the least developed areas of communication research, and also provide significant implication for the design of interventions to improve patients’ emotional well-being.",Interpersonal Communication and Health,Interpersonal Communication

This study used a nationally representative survey of youth aged 13-25 years (cross-sectional N=4116; re-contact n= 763) to validate measures of sharing behavior in the context of tobacco and e-cigarette content. Sharing tobacco and e-cigarette content were positively associated with current tobacco and e-cigarette use, respectively, and were positively associated with exposure to tobacco and e-cigarette content in the media, respectively. However, they were found to be distinct from other forms of information engagement (i.e., seeking and scanning tobacco and e-cigarette information). These results provide evidence that the proposed measure of sharing is a valid indicator of the construct.

Feminism(s) is assumed to be universally applicable. This paper, drawing from an in-depth analysis of Africana womanism and African feminism challenges the universality of feminisms.
This analysis reveals that Africana womanists and African feminists acknowledge that predominantly, African women organize with men against racial oppression. Also, both concepts highlight the centrality of the ‘African’ culture and the important role of women as the nucleus of life. Contestation mainly centers on terminology. Africana womanism positions itself as an alternative to feminism while African feminism by using the feminism tag embraces some of its perspectives.
These concepts advocate for African inspired frameworks that challenge ‘western’ feminism and disrupt western theories.
This study contributes to womanhood studies that critically examine Black women’s experiences in the African diaspora.",Top Student Papers in ERIC,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2016-0655,2016,Paper Session,The Myth of Colorblindness,1,"This paper explores the relationship between the public narrative created by dominant socio-ethnic groups and the people being represented in that discourse through the frame of racial colorblindness. Colorblind ideology pervades American public discourse and negatively affects social perception of race in conflict situations. Although some well-intentioned aspects of colorblind policy allow for racial diversity, colorblind ideology is insufficient to protect the rights of minorities and underprivileged groups. An analysis of the philosophy behind racial colorblindness illustrates how groups reinforce privilege and recognizes the reasons why the ideal of racial colorblindness persists despite flaws and inaccuracies. Three individual statements from key figures in Ferguson demonstrate this racial colorblindness, and at times even specifically mention colorblind ideology. This paper unpacks the cultural understanding of racial colorblindness, recognizes the perceptions and perspectives of the speakers, and demonstrates the problems that emerge when the myth of racial colorblindness is left unchecked.

2016-0656,2016,Paper Session,The “Failure” of Multiculturalism as Reported by the European Online Press: A Study on the Manifestation of Othering Discourses,1,"This study critically examined how issues of multiculturalism and Muslim immigration are discursively constructed within the English language European online press. Through the use of a frame analysis as well as a more focused discourse analysis, an examination was undertaken to uncover how “us” versus “them” perspectives were manifest within a public discourse. A total of 132 articles from five online European news sites were selected using a systematic sampling method based on the results of a search query for multiculturalism at each news site. The analysis of the data corpus revealed the news media’s depiction of multiculturalism and Muslim immigrants as not wholly negative on the surface but under closer scrutiny revealed discursive and linguistic techniques that marginalized and “othered” them. The themes found in the data corpus also illuminated a trend of the subordinated population as lacking proper representation and always being spoken for by the news media.",Top Student Papers in ERIC,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2016-0657,2016,Paper Session,How News Media Influence Prejudice Against Immigrants: The Role of Perceived Morality and Moral Emotions,1,In two studies we investigate whether framing news articles about immigrants in terms of their morality has a more pronounced impact on prejudice and discriminatory intentions toward them compared to articles framed in terms of their competence. We also investigate whether moral emotions mediate the impact of perceived morality. Results of both studies show that participants responded with more prejudice and more willingness to expel immigrants when this group was portrayed as immoral rather than moral. These effects were mediated by other-condemning emotions such as contempt. Other-suffering emotions such as pity also mediated the effect of morality on prejudice. Perceived competence had a small effect on prejudice. Present results underscore the impact of framing newspaper articles about immigrants in terms of their moral traits on readers’ moral emotions and prejudiced attitudes toward them.,"Perceptions and Effects of Messages: Group-Based Identity in Media, Mediated, and Health Communication",Intergroup Communication
2016-0658,2016,Paper Session,"Intergroup Dialogue, Group Power, and Social Media: Computer-Mediated Communication Between Israeli Jews and Palestinians",1,"This study examines the ways in which social media is used to promote intergroup dialogue and reconciliation in the setting of the asymmetrical conflict between Israeli-Jews and Palestinians. The analysis is based on a data set containing posts and comments collected from two Facebook pages intended to expose Jewish-Israeli Facebook-users to the perspectives and experiences of Palestinians.
Our findings reveal that while posts that presented the narrative of Palestinian suffering were mostly followed by negative comments from Israeli-Jews, posts that brought up the Palestinian moderate and peace-seeking voice elicited higher Jewish-Israeli acceptance and sympathy. In light of these findings, it might be worthwhile to consider adjusting the model of dialogue implemented online to the features and limitations of this type of interaction. The research contributes to our understanding of both the potential and limitations of social media as a dialogue provoking platform in promoting social change, peacebuilding and intergroup reconciliation.","Perceptions and Effects of Messages: Group-Based Identity in Media, Mediated, and Health Communication",Intergroup Communication

We assume that the theoretical model of individual-level reciprocal effects by Kepplinger is transferable to groups in which a strong social identity is present. Through conducting in-depth interviews with former high-ranked right-wing extremists, media effects on members of the right-wing scene are explored. Evidence is provided that members of right-wing extremist groups feel strongly and personally affected by media re-ports about right-wing extremism and show a chain of very strong media effects. Therefore, it is argued that the model of reciprocal media effects described by Kepplinger may also be applied to group.","Perceptions and Effects of Messages: Group-Based Identity in Media, Mediated, and Health Communication",Intergroup Communication

In an online experiment conducted with Asian Twitter users living in the United States, participants were randomly assigned to view anti-Asian tweets presented either by a single source or by multiple sources. Then, in an ostensibly unrelated task disguised as a marketing survey, participants were asked to customize a pizza by selecting toppings from a list of toppings that included both relatively unhealthy items (i.e., items that are high in saturated fat and calories) and relatively healthy items. Results showed that those who viewed multiple-source anti-Asian tweets chose a greater number of unhealthy toppings than those who viewed single-source anti-Asian tweets. The data further revealed that the participants with relatively low levels of ethnic identification were more likely to be detrimentally influenced by multiple-source hate tweets.","Perceptions and Effects of Messages: Group-Based Identity in Media, Mediated, and Health Communication",Intergroup Communication
2016-0661,2016,Paper Session,Exploring the Intergroup Dimensions of Health Campaigns: Identity as a Framework for Developing Effective Messages for Medically Underserved Audiences,6,"Guided by the Communication Theory of Identity, the goal of the current study is to describe how a medically underserved population of Medicaid enrollees with behavioral health (e.g., bipolar disorder) and physical health diagnoses (e.g., diabetes) construct their identities relative to their health behaviors and how those identities relate to perceptions of recruitment and retention materials developed for the Wellness Incentives and Navigation program (WIN). Findings include that racial/ethnic identities were important to the intended audience, however, perspectives on how well a racial/ethnic group was represented varied by group membership. A second is that although racial/ethnic and gender identities were important, other communal identities (e.g., rural, age) emerged as salient group memberships related to health behaviors. Finally, our analysis revealed the importance of considering how health behaviors are linked to the interpenetration of various identity frames. Implications of the current study for theoretical advancement and recruitment refinement are discussed.","Perceptions and Effects of Messages: Group-Based Identity in Media, Mediated, and Health Communication",Intergroup Communication
2016-0662,2016,Paper Session,A Window Into Opinion Formation During Presidential Debates: Mediating Roles of Real-Time Evaluation and Involvement in the Process of Partisan Reinforcement,3,"Exploiting continuous response measures (CRM), the present study explores how partisanship affects viewers’ processing of a televised presidential debate, specifically their real-time candidate evaluations and attentional involvement with the debate. This article further examines how these real-time judgments and involvement during the debate later influence memory selection and opinion reinforcement of partisan viewers. Our findings indicate that viewers’ real-time evaluations and involvement are strongly influenced by the direction and strength of partisanship. Moreover, the findings reveal that the effect of partisanship on post-debate memory is fully mediated by the viewers actively making real-time instant judgments. Partisanship does influence vote preference after the debate; yet, mean momentary evaluation of the candidates during the debate equally mediates the impact of party identification on vote preference. We also demonstrate that the viewers’ attentional involvement with the debate fully mediates the effects of partisanship strength on post-debate polarization. In sum, partisanship by itself does not automatically shape post-debate cognition or attitudes; real-time evaluation and involvement during the debate fully or partially mediate the effects of partisanship on memory, vote preference, and polarization.",Election Debates: Exposure and Effects,Political Communication
2016-0663,2016,Paper Session,Critical Incident Analysis of Presidential Debates,2,"This chapter takes a multi-prong approach to the analysis of critical incidents during presidential debates. Continuous response measures were recorded from viewers in real time during the 2012 Obama-Romney presidential debates. These responses were then analyzed to determine the “critical incidents” of each debate – points where CRM responses between Democratic and Republican viewers differed the most in terms of approval and disapproval. These incidents were then subjected to functional analysis to determine rhetorical strategy at the time of the incident and content analyzed to identify the nonverbal behavior of the candidates during each incident. Top performing incidents were then shown to focus groups to reveal further insights into why these particular debate encounters stood out to viewers. Utilizing converging sources of data, our framework for understanding critical incident analysis provides a robust methodology for examination of televised presidential debates that overcomes the limitations of any single method in isolation.",Election Debates: Exposure and Effects,Political Communication

This study uses detailed codings of the first and third 2012 presidential debates to evaluate the impact of candidates’ verbal and nonverbal behaviors on viewers’ “second screen” responses. To examine the relationship between candidates’ on-screen behaviors and the social media response, we conduct GLS regression relating two data sources: (1) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for rhetorical/functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates’ behavior during the debates, and (2) corresponding real-time measures of the volume and valence of online expression about the candidates on Twitter. We find that the nonverbal communication behaviors of candidates – their facial expressions, physical gestures, and blink rate – are consistent, robust, and significant predictors of the volume and valence of public expression during debates.",Election Debates: Exposure and Effects,Political Communication
2016-0665,2016,Paper Session,The Influence of ‘Social Viewing’ on Televised Debate Viewers’ Candidate Evaluation: Bandwagon or Underdog Effects?,5,"Television viewing has become increasingly integrated with social media. In the political realm, such social viewing is most common during televised debates. Social media could serve as a convenient window to the climate of public opinion. On the other hand, social media is not a representative cross-section of the electorate. We examine the influence of perceived opinion climate revealed via Twitter postings in shaping televised debate viewers’ candidate evaluation. We conducted two web-based experiments in the high- and low-stimulus elections: (1) the 2012 Korean presidential election and (2) the 2014 Seoul mayoral election. Instead of using contrived stimulus materials, using a custom-designed web application, participants evaluated the candidates as debate-related Twitter postings were being fed in real-time during each televised debate. Our results suggest that exposure to Twitter postings has induced significant bandwagon effects. Although some nuanced individual differences were found, even the more knowledgeable were equally affected as their less knowledgeable counterparts.",Election Debates: Exposure and Effects,Political Communication

Fifteen college students used Instagram in a self-focused mode, and eighteen college students used Instagram in an others-focused mode. The results contradicted the researcher’s expectations: self-focused Instagram users experienced no change in levels of narcissism, and others-focused Instagram users increased in their levels of narcissism. No difference in aggression emerged between the two groups.

Predictors of Using Facebook for Procrastination and its Effects on Students’ Well-Being,3,"Procrastinating with popular online media such as Facebook has been suggested to impair users’ well-being, particularly among students. Building on recent procrastination, self-control, and communication literature, we conducted two studies (total N = 699) that examined the predictors of procrastination with Facebook as well as its effects on students’ academic and overall well-being. Results from both studies consistently indicate that low trait self-control, habitual Facebook checking, and high enjoyment of Facebook use explain almost 40 percent of the variance of using Facebook for procrastination. Moreover, results from Study 2 underline that using Facebook for the irrational delay of important tasks increases students’ academic stress levels and contributes to the negative well-being effects of Facebook use beyond the academic domain. The implications of investigating procrastination as a specific pattern of uncontrolled and dysfunctional media use are discussed with regard to research on the uses and effects of online media.",Negative Effects of Social Media,Communication and Technology
2016-0668,2016,Paper Session,Ostracism in the Online World: Applying the Ostracism Online Paradigm to Investigate Social Media Effects,6,"In times of being always online and connected, cyberostracism—the feeling of being ignored or excluded over the Internet—is a serious threat to fundamental human needs: belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. According to the temporal need-threat model (Williams, 2009), responses to ostracism lead to immediate and universal experiences of negative emotions as well as to thwarted need satisfaction. In two experiments (N1 = 105; N2 = 85), we investigated these effects using a new computerized tool, Ostracism Online (Wolf et al., 2015). In both studies we found that ostracism negatively affected emotional states, belongingness, self-esteem, and meaningful existence but not control. Furthermore, Facebook use as a coping strategy after being excluded had no significant impact on need restoration. In sum, our findings highlight that Ostracism Online is a useful tool to connect the research area of social media and ostracism.",Negative Effects of Social Media,Communication and Technology
2016-0669,2016,Paper Session,The Social Media Disorder Scale: Validity and Psychometric Properties,3,"There is growing evidence that social media addiction is an evolving problem, particularly among adolescents.

The present study, therefore, aimed to test the reliability and validity of a short and easy to administer Social Media Disorder (SMD) Scale that contains a clear diagnostic cut-off point to distinguish between disordered (i.e. addictive) and high-engaging non-disordered social media users. Three online surveys were conducted among a total of 2,198 Dutch adolescents aged 10 to 17. The 9-item scale showed solid structural validity, appropriate internal consistency, good convergent and criterion validity, sufficient test-retest reliability, as well as sensitivity and specificity.

In this research, the level of knowledge was measured to examine the effect of information forms. Also, as an individual variable which has an impact on the effect, health consciousness can influence on the outcome of health intervention. This research examined the effect of health consciousness on the knowledge increasing as well. According to the result, the formats of information does not have a significant effect on improving knowledge. However, the effect of health consciousness was significant on improving knowledge.

This study seeks to understand how to use framing strategies to promote blood donation with valence framing (i.e., gain vs. loss) and temporal framing (i.e., different time reference points) and individual differences that may moderate the effects. Data were collected from 322 undergraduate students in a Web-based experiment with a 2 (gain vs. loss) x 4 (no time specified, one-week, three-months, one-year) between-participants design. A significant interaction effect between the frames was observed such that one-year gain and one-week loss messages increased blood donation intentions. Perceived importance of blood donation was shown to mediate the gain vs. loss framing effect for the one-year temporal frame. One individual difference variable, altruism, turned out to play a significant moderating role. Results of this study have practical implications for developing campaign messages using framing strategies to increase donations.",Experimental Message Design in Health,Health Communication

Experiment 2 was designed to extend and improve Reinhart et al.’s results by crossing gain- versus loss-framed altruistic OTD appeals with abstract versus concrete language within the messages based on elements of regulatory focus theory stressing the linguistic aspects of regulatory fit. Results underscore the limits of prospect theory at reliably predicting the effects of altruistic appeals, while highlighting the value of regulatory fit in optimizing effective message designs.",Experimental Message Design in Health,Health Communication
2016-0674,2016,Paper Session,The Mediating Role of Temporal Considerations in the Effects of Self-Affirmation on Responses to Organ Donation Messages,2,"Previous self-affirmation research has shown that individuals who are allowed to reflect on their values and self-worth (vs. those who are not) are less likely to exhibit message derogation and are more likely to accept risk information and change their behaviors. However, the exact mechanism for such relationships is still largely unclear. Based on a randomized experiment (N = 331), the present study examined the mediating role of temporal consideration in participants’ health related cognitions and emotional responses. We found that self-affirmation participants (vs. not affirmed) were more likely to consider future consequences, which in turn was positively associated with more favorable attitudes toward organ donation, stronger anticipated guilt for not register as donors, and higher donor registration efficacy. Both theoretical and practical implications for self-affirmation theory and organ donation message design were discussed.",Experimental Message Design in Health,Health Communication

An online posttest-only experiment was conducted at a large, self-financed university in Hong Kong. The experiment had a 2 (message frames: gain vs. loss) by 2 (inoculation: messages with a freedom restoration postscript vs. messages without such a postscript) by 2 (language variety: standard Chinese vs. the colloquial form of written Cantonese) between-subjects factorial design, with the nature of the issue (organ donation vs. political consumerism) manipulated as a within-subjects factor. For promoting organ donation, messages using gain frames and standard Chinese generate less perceived threat to freedom. The threat to freedom resulted in psychological reactance and that reactance caused the respondents to perceive the messages as less persuasive, thereby dampening the behavioral outcomes.",Experimental Message Design in Health,Health Communication

Guided by the chief principles of two theoretical models in persuasion, this study examined the effects of two technological affordances inherent to the operation of location check-ins––bandwagon and location cues––in addition to the moderating role of tie strength specifically on Facebook. An online experiment with 221 college students found that the promotional intent to share a business location was assessed under the condition of either the availability or applicability of cues for location proximity and the quality of business, which were signaled by a level of location and bandwagon cue, respectively.

With this article, we extended previous research on the relationship of self-control and smartphone use. Specifically, we conducted an experiment (N = 52) to address three goals. First, we looked at the causal relationship between low self-control (i.e., ego depletion ) and actual smartphone use. Second, we investigated if fear of missing out moderated this effect. Third, we examined guilt as a possible negative affective consequence of the effect of ego depletion on smartphone use. Results showed that ego depletion led to increased smartphone use. This effect was not moderated by fear of missing out. Unexpectedly, there was no effect of smartphone use on guilt.

2016-0681,2016,Paper Session,Appraisal Models of Intercultural Communication Apprehension Among Americans Studying Abroad,2,"We proposed two models (before and during the interaction) of intercultural communication apprehension (ICA), using the appraisal theory of emotions as the theoretical framework. American students who had experience of studying abroad completed the survey. The results were mostly consistent with our hypotheses. Three goal-related appraisals (face uncertainty, perceived probability of losing face, and interaction importance) led to ICA and facework (during the interaction), which further influenced the behavioral tendencies of the individuals. Our study theorizes ICA and supports the utility of the appraisal theory of emotions. The models may be used to integrate previous research on ICA, identify the gaps and important issues in the domain, and provide practical advice for educators and policy makers.","Intergroup Contact, Communication Apprehension, and Cultural Adjustment",Intercultural Communication

Serial mediation analyses revealed that perceived English competency of the Chinese contact had significant indirect effects on affective and behavioral attitudes through the contact’s host and home culture identification, communication anxiety with the contact, and with Chinese in general. While English proficiency had an indirect effect on positive stereotypes only through Chinese contact’s identification with home culture, none of the variables were associated with negative stereotypes, indicating the general positive nature of intergroup contact reported by the American host nationals with their Chinese contact and the tenacious nature of negative cultural stereotypes. Results are discussed in light of intergroup contact literature and Uncertainty/Anxiety Management Theory (Stephan, Stephan, & Gudykunst, 1999).","Intergroup Contact, Communication Apprehension, and Cultural Adjustment",Intercultural Communication

Based on a sample of 157 self-administered surveys, the study examines the position of Iranian Kurdish society on the communication apprehension continuum and the influence of sex, age, and education on CA. Results revealed despite their lower socioeconomic status, the Kurds are relatively less apprehensive than many other cultures. It was also revealed that women have significantly higher levels of dyadic, public, and total CA. Moreover, all CA contexts (group, meeting, public, and dyadic), and total CA tended to increase after grade 9 and then decrease after completing high school. Age however, only had a modest effect on meetingCA. The findings propose higher levels of social encounter due to social and religious customs reduces the amount of CA among the Kurds despite their lower socioeconomic status. The findings also support previous research regarding CA and sex, and CA and education. Implications, limitations, and areas of future research are posited.","Intergroup Contact, Communication Apprehension, and Cultural Adjustment",Intercultural Communication

Three interacting channels, including face-to-face (FtF) interactions, text-based and video-based computer-mediated communication (CMC), were compared to examine their effects in forming impressions and changing attitudes toward the outgroup. An experiment was carried out. A total of 89 participants engaged in paired interactions with a designated confederate in the context of conflicts between Hong Kong people and mainland Chinese in Hong Kong. The results showed that the generalization effect of the contact hypothesis worked better in FtF interactions and video-based CMC than text-based CMC. Favorable attitudes toward the interacting outgroup member were generated through FtF interactions, more so than text-based CMC, leading to more positive attitudes and greater levels of trust toward the entire outgroup.","Intergroup Contact, Communication Apprehension, and Cultural Adjustment",Intercultural Communication

Participants were 178 international students from different universities across the US. The results showed that during the stay in the US, international students accommodate their language and topic choice towards their American peers on Facebook. Particularly, language accommodation levels increase as the length of stay in the US increases. Also students were found to use Facebook mainly to communicate with friends in the US. When students had high mainstream identification, they targeted Americans more as their Facebook audience and had more language and topic accommodation. Also, mainstream identification positively related to the students’ language accommodation level.

Using data from the nationally representative sample of U.S. adults from the 2010, 2012 and 2013 surveys, this study finds that perceptions about scientific agreement was positively associated with people’s own global warming beliefs, but the relationship was greater among those who have high trust in scientists. Furthermore, the finding shows that the conclusion about whether or not Americans understand scientific consensus about global warming could be different depending on the question formats used in the survey. While the use of ‘closed-ended (dichotomous) question’ leads to the conclusion that people perceive “a lot of disagreement” among scientists, the use of a new measure, ‘open-ended continuous question’ indicates that people believe at least a majority of scientists (more than 50%) agree that global warming is happening.",Public Opinion of Environmental Issues and Controversial Science,Environmental Communication

This study analyzes the evolution of public opinion on nuclear energy in Switzerland from 2012 to 2014 in order to find out, first, how different dimensions of attitudes towards nuclear energy changed in the years after Fukushima, and, second, which factors influence the general opinion on nuclear energy. The main findings show that the public opinion on nuclear energy has become slightly more positive as time passed and that the most important predictor of the general opinion on nuclear energy is the individual assessment of the benefits and risks of nuclear energy.",Public Opinion of Environmental Issues and Controversial Science,Environmental Communication
2016-0689,2016,Paper Session,Review: Public Perceptions of Climate Geoengineering,2,"Anthropogenic climate change has become a preeminent challenge in the 21st century. One strategy proposed to curb the effects of climate change is to develop large-scale geoengineering technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While such technologies have been under development since the 1990’s, few studies investigating public perceptions of geoengineering have been conducted. This paper provides a comprehensive review of public perceptions of geoengineering to empower future environmental communication efforts and inform decision-makers. Four major themes across the works are reviewed: 1) familiarity and awareness, 2) perceptions of risks and benefits, 3) support for development and use, and 4) trust in researchers, developers, and governance agencies. Our review also notes that few studies go beyond gaining simple descriptive information and we provide recommendations to forward the field by comparing public perception studies of geoengineering to advanced work that has been conducted on other emerging technologies like nanotechnology and synthetic biology.",Public Opinion of Environmental Issues and Controversial Science,Environmental Communication
2016-0690,2016,Paper Session,First-Person Perception of Environmental Exemplars,2,"Environmental advocates have recently been calling for communicators to make climate change more concrete when addressing the public. These recommendations comport well with the tenets of exemplification theory. However, audiences may also react to a message based on how they think others may be affected, as the third-person effects framework describes. What is not well known is how these two areas of research intersect, namely how the inclusion of specific exemplars about climate change may impact the perceived influence of the message on the self or others. This study examines the effects of exemplars on reverse third-person perception, or first-person perception, of environmental messages. Simultaneous replication in Singapore and the U.S. suggest that first-person perception is related to environmental values and that individuals assume exemplars will be more influential than expository information. However, the exact relationship between exemplars and first person perception varies by national context. This latter finding is useful for understanding how to communicate global environmental problems to global audiences.",Public Opinion of Environmental Issues and Controversial Science,Environmental Communication
2016-0691,2016,Paper Session,Active within Structures: An Integrated Model of Multiplatform Local News Consumption,2,"This study represents a theory-driven effort that empirically examined multiplatform local news consumption. Guided by Cooper and Tang’s (2009) theoretical conceptualization of Active within Structures, this study found that individual factors (e.g., age, gender, education, income, political identification), external structures (e.g., access to media technologies, geo-location), and internal structures (e.g., diversity of community interests, efficacy, gratifications, habit strength, perceived ease of use) significantly predicted local news use across media. Findings suggest that multiplatform local news consumption is not exclusively driven by individual factors or structures, but by relative weight of importance of individual agents, virtual schemas, and social technological constraints. The study calls for more integrated, theory-driven audience research to address the fundamental issue of how and why people choose to consume news across media.",Audience Engagement With News (TOP FACULTY PAPER AWARDEE),Mass Communication

Understanding Diversity Advocacy in Amateur Technology Projects",1,"This paper explores power and participation in digital domains by examining a wave of diversity advocacy that has been sweeping technical projects for the past decade. These include initiatives to promote diversity in free and open source software (FOSS) projects and hackerspaces. “Diversity” is variously construed, but most often focusing on gender. These initiatives are important because they expose many of the assumptions and tensions that surround participatory cultures. On the one hand, most of these projects are organized around voluntarism; in theory, everyone who wishes to participate is welcome to do so. On the other hand, diversity initiatives form in order to address the “problem” of imbalance in the ranks of participants. (A rallying cry within FOSS was a 2006 report showing that while academic and proprietary computer science included around 30% women, FOSS projects were 2% women (Ghosh et al. 2006).) These initiatives represent attempts to change the terms of association that undergird technical projects; they are aimed at hacking the social infrastructure that determines how technical projects form and proceed. Such efforts proliferate for varied, overlapping, and even contradictory reasons, including diversity as a marketplace value and “building a stronger movement,” among other reasons.",Social Media and Technology as New Playgrounds: Hashtags and Beyond,Feminist Scholarship

2016-0697,2016,Paper Session,DIY Feminism: Making the Personal Political - A Work-in-Progress,1,"Since the fight for suffrage, U.S. feminists have consistently relied on tactics focused on articulation: the ways we speak about and to people who are not heterosexual white men, the issues we do and do not talk about, the voices we amplify and silence in the public sphere. Social movement theory, however, has relegated activists’ communication practices to the “cultural” rather than the “political” dimensions of collective action. Motivated by Shaw’s (2012) call for social movement scholars to highlight the political nature of feminists’ discursive activism, this paper draws on more than twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork with grassroots feminist organizations in the city of Philadelphia whose activism primarily takes the shape of alternative media production. These preliminary findings suggest that Philly feminists’ processes of producing discourse as well as the discursive products, themselves, empower participants on the individual level and challenge mainstream power structures at the level of society.",Social Media and Technology as New Playgrounds: Hashtags and Beyond,Feminist Scholarship

I ask: What were the contours of the #YesAllWomen narrative? What made it so compelling to participants and to journalists and bloggers who engaged with it? What can #YesAllWomen tell us about contemporary feminist communication and the dynamics of social change more generally?

As an aggregative narrative of the experiences of thousands of online participants, #YAW vividly illustrated the power of “connective” action and the persistence of fundamental inequalities around sex/power. It was both a critically important expressive protest moment for feminist politics and an effective intervention into gender politics more generally. Patterns of interaction between #YesAllWomen and online-only media also suggest some shifts in movement ecologies and dynamics.",Social Media and Technology as New Playgrounds: Hashtags and Beyond,Feminist Scholarship
2016-0700,2016,Paper Session,Critical Acclaim and Commercial Success in Mobile Free-to-Play Games,4,"FULL RESEARCH PAPER: Critical acclaim is considered to be one of the main predictors of profitability and commercial successfulness of game products. For this reason, major game publishers go through tremendous hurdles in order to fare well in different forums that review and rate their products. However, little evidence exist on the relationship between the ratings and profitability beyond anecdotal assumptions. In this study we present an exploratory qualitative inquiry to the relationship of critical acclaim and commercial successfulness by investigating games with high Metascore and games with top-grossing rank. In addition, we examined the influence of critic reviews to sales. The results reveal, that the relation of review ratings and profitability are even more problematic in free-to-play games than in many other game categories. Games with high Metascore differ substantially from the top-grossing games, and are closer to traditional single-player games than the typical online free-to-play games.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You!

Based on research in game entertainment and the psychology of film soundtracks, we develop and test the hypotheses that soundtrack music contributes to players‘ enjoyment via intensification of emotions (affective route) and via amplification of the sense of Presence (‚being there‘) and of identification with the game character (cognitive route). Participants played an episode of “Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag™” either with the original soundtrack music present or absent and reported game enjoyment as well as scores on the assumed mediator variables afterwards. Findings clearly show an indirect effect of soundtrack music on enjoyment through positive affect and also suggest effects of music on Presence and identification; however, a mediation of the effect of soundtrack music on game enjoyment on the cognitive route was not established. We discuss implications for future research in game entertainment.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You! Digital Games, Driving Forces, and Experience",Game Studies

Furthermore, differentiating between meaningful and nonmeaningful games, we investigated whether these game types lead to the experience of different gaming-related emotions and what determines their discontinuation. Building on an online survey with 325 German gamers, we found a game’s narrative, its mechanics, the satisfaction of basic needs and perceived cognitive and affective challenge to influence the three entertainment experiences in distinct ways. Besides, the results suggest that meaningful and nonmeaningful games induce specific emotions and are abandoned due to different considerations. The study furthers our theoretical understanding of (interactive) media entertainment and shows how the interplay of factors internal and external to a game shapes the overall game entertainment experience.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You!

This study uses a large-scale (n=1101)national survey of older adults aged 60 and above to examine the relationship between digital game playing, social capital and social connectedness. Results showed that playing alone did not displace social capital. Playing with strong and weak ties predicted both bonding and bridging social capital. And playing with online friends predicted bridging social capital. The findings suggest that digital games can be an effective means of promoting social connectedness among older adults depending on who they play the games with.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You!

Results indicated that very few individuals preferred the bad option when given a choice. Although there were no significant differences found between conditions on transportation, appreciation, or parasocial interaction, the study revealed significant differences for identification such that those who committed more moral actions identified less with the main character. Additionally, those who chose good actions felt more moral than those who were forced to commit good actions. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You!

advertising. Several studies have shown that, in line with flow theory, enjoyment
increases retention. Others have yielded opposite results, suggesting that the higher
cognitive load associated with flow may have an adverse effect. This is in line with
Lang’s limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing. In order to
disentangle the effects of enjoyment and cognitive load, this study employed a 2

experimental design (N = 561). Findings showed an overall negative effect of
cognitive load on recall. Enjoyment had an independent negative effect on free recall
in the high-load condition and on implicit recall in the low-load condition. These
results suggest that enjoyment may in some cases divert cognitive resources away
from brand information independently from overall cognitive load. Implications for

These factors explained 52.7% of the variance of viewer enjoyment and 40-57% of the variance of the need satisfaction for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as well as perceived identification and streamer identification. The results also showed that motivations among these spectators differ from those engaged in active game play or traditional sports viewing. Shared experience and shared creation of game content through interactions between streamers, spectators, and the community are unique features of the game-streaming culture.

2016-0708,2016,Paper Session,Social Capital in World of Warcraft: The Role of Introversion,1,"POSTER PROPOSAL: Some studies indicated that playing online games yields a ‘rich-get-richer effect’ and is especially socially beneficial for extraverted players (e.g. Shen & Williams, 2011), while other authors argue that online gaming could have compensational effects for shy players (e.g. Kowert et al., 2014). The current study (N= 409) shows that both perspectives are not mutually exclusive. Path analysis revealed that extraverted World of Warcraft players act more socially towards fellow players and hence have better chances to build up social capital than introverts. However, a subgroup of the introverted players used the game for social compensation. These players chose a more social playing style, which increased their chances to acquire social capital. The results demonstrate that the group of introverted players is more heterogeneous than previously thought and that the links between personality aspects and social outcomes of playing are quite complex and rather indirect than direct.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You!

The present study replicated and extended this research to examine the influence of both chronic and temporary intuition accessibility. Findings demonstrated that chronic and temporary intuition accessibility predicted gameplay choices in different situations. Discussion focuses on the prospect that chronic accessibility should be a better predictor of behavior except in instances where environmental cues temporarily increase the accessibility of another intuition, and examines (a) how game-design features may prime individual moral intuitions, and (b) the potential for repeated exposure to games that prime individual intuitions to increase their chronic accessibility an influence on decisions making.","Extended Session: Let Me Entertain You!

While previous studies provide correlational evidence at best, the current study puts this alleged contribution to a critical test. We rely on a quasi-experiment during Dutch municipality elections and use matching techniques to exclude selection bias, and study the causal effect of using VAAs. We find evidence for an increase in internal efficacy after using VAAs, especially among lower educated voters. We could not find any support for the expected gain in political knowledge.

In that context, media are crucial as the most important source of information about politics. As media environments and media use change, it might thus have implications for the mobilizing effects of elections. The recent transformation towards high-choice media environments and increasing gaps between news-seekers and news-avoiders thus suggests that the mobilizing effects of election campaigns should not be taken for granted, but also that they might differ among news-seekers and news-avoiders. They might also differ between elections, and more specifically between first- and second-order national elections.
Against this background, the overall purpose of this study is to address three research problems. First, what are the mobilizing effects of election campaigns in a high-choice media environment? Second, how do the mobilizing effects differ between second- and first-order national election campaigns? Third, how do the mobilizing effects of election campaigns in first- and second-order national elections differ between news-seekers and news-avoiders?

Existing studies on “modifiers” limit their scopes within the organizational domain and overlook the impact of contextual factors beyond organization, such as society, politics, and culture. To advance the understanding of the impact of contextual factors on crisis, the study conducts an inductive framing analysis to scrutinize the top 100 forwarded tweets about a homicide case occurred at a McDonald's in weibo, the Chinese microblogging service. The findings demonstrate that social media allow multiple crisis communicators to engage in crisis communication at different stages by distributing diverse crisis frames. These frames entail corresponding contextual factors, which constrain or facilitate the reality construction in a crisis.

The study thus aims to look at the change in the visual culture with the intervention of software. Of images produced in two cultures, of knowing the technology and using the technology. A crossing of two cultures, two processes, of image making and the process of image making software. It will also look at how software developed in a remote location in India is consumed elsewhere. Hence a virtual encounter of two cultures, an emergence of a new practice spread across geography.",Current Approaches to Photography's Changing Ontologies,Visual Communication Studies
2016-0723,2016,Paper Session,"Time in Photography: Temporal-Punctum, Chronotope and Digital Aura",1,"Time in photography has been a subject of constant reflection for many notable authors concerned with explaining the characteristics of its phenomenology, expressed within the interpretative plane as well as in its category of object. There are interpretive studies devoted to the comprehension of photography as a historical referent, memory, evidence, document, or information, using a symbolic and cultural reading. From the perspective of photography as an object, there are a few approaches to explaining its technical and industrial evolution, its relationship with other forms of expression and becoming as an object in time. In this essay we address a reflection on time in photography from two basic perspectives: from a traditional approach considering notions traditionally used for time, and from the perspective of photography becoming a virtual object in chronotopes involved in a matrix or an analogic-digital scheme, thus giving way to a reflection on the new aural values of photography in a hybrid matrix of analogic-digital space and time.",Current Approaches to Photography's Changing Ontologies,Visual Communication Studies
2016-0724,2016,Paper Session,Wearable Cameras and the Changing Meaning of Images in a Digital Landscape,1,"A long way into the digital era we are still caught up in doubts regarding digital images’ anchorage in the material texture of everyday life, or to put it in other words, in “reality”. In this paper I will attempt at exploring these issues by entering the field of digital imaging from an analysis of a few selected digital technologies. Focussing on two wearable camera technologies (the life-logging camera Narrative and the action camera GoPro), I will suggest that we are today witnessing to a “material turn” happening alongside the “algorithmic turn” (Uricchio 2011). Contemporary digital image-making practices mark out a shift from conventional notions of the digital as a space of ’virtual’, immaterial, and intangible relations to the outer world. Rather they seem to speak of analogization, i.e. of a closing down of the gap between technology, the body of the users and the materiality of the world surrounding them.",Current Approaches to Photography's Changing Ontologies,Visual Communication Studies

However, second screening has provided an opportunity for enhanced engagement by Latin American TV and their audiences. This study explores the use of second screening in the Latin American context through a secondary data analysis of a survey performed in eight Latin American countries by TGI Latina. Results show that the majority of Latin American second screeners are well-educated young adults with high income who utilize cellphones, tending to be females. The study also shows a positive association between news consumption and second screening. Audiences in Latin American are opting to use both the Internet and multichannel TV consumption together, creating a great opportunity for the TV industry to engage users through second screening practices.",Consuming Media,Media Industry Studies
2016-0726,2016,Paper Session,Frenemies: Towards an Ethnography of Audience Engagement With Public Service Television in South Africa,1,"The audience — in whose interest public service broadcasting [PSB] is supposed to function — is rarely consulted with regard to their interpretations, opinions and perceptions about the ongoing crises of PSB within the South African context. Where audiences are discussed, it is primarily in relation to specific television programmes or genres, or alternatively in relation to a market approach. Such an overly commercial model of evaluation is not suitable for the South African context which is marked by vast inequalities in terms of audience access to the mediascape. This paper contends that we need to move away from the singular focus on television programmes and or genres in audience research and advocates instead for a composite approach to PSB audience research, combining audience share research with qualitative explorations of viewer relationships, attitudes, opinions and perceptions of the role of PSB in their lives. To this end, the bulk of this paper comprises an explication of the findings from an ethnographic exploration of audience perceptions of public service broadcasting - particularly in relation to South Africa’s public service broadcaster, the SABC.",Consuming Media,Media Industry Studies
2016-0727,2016,Paper Session,Understanding the Social in a Postmoviegoing Era of the Multiplex,1,"This paper questions the social experience of contemporary cinemagoing within the understanding of the eventfulness and sociability historically ascribed to moviegoing. From a theoretical point of view, the research focuses on defining place as a spatial site of cinema, and space as a constructed social site of cinemagoing. To understand the nature of the eventfulness and the sociality of cinemagoing in a post-moviegoing age, an empirical research into contemporary multiplex cinema audiences was set up. The surveys questioned 520 young moviegoers on their past and present film consumption. The paper does not claim representativeness but discusses as a main result that the present self-identified practices of the cinematic experience and the memories of sociality suggest that the substitution debate cannot be discussed in technological terms alone, and that the eventfulness, the momentariness and the sociality of cinema are argued into a non-foundational ontology of cinema to defy the demise of the medium.",Consuming Media,Media Industry Studies

These are the “currencies” that support the operation of commercial media. Today, metrics can be derived from many large datasets, raising the possibility that new kinds of currencies might emerge. We argue that data on exposure are the most likely to support currencies, and that these might well go beyond traditional measures of audience size and composition. We explore the relationship between the most plausible contenders for audience currencies: size and engagement as measured by time spent. Contrary to the “Law of Double Jeopardy,” we find these metrics to be uncorrelated in an online environment, suggesting that each might have a role to play as a currency. We conclude with a discussion of how the political economy of audience measurement is likely to affect audience currencies in the age of big data.",Consuming Media,Media Industry Studies

Establishing an audience measurement service requires huge capital investments and the markets are usually natural monopolies. As the digitalization of cable systems in Taiwan, the MSOs can provide census data of subscribers as another currency for sale. However, after two years, Nielsen still hold the monopoly power in Taiwan’s television rating industry. This study interviewed ten professional managers and took the field observation of digital cable servers to unveil the factors of monopoly. The results show that the existing demographics-based, exposure-focused audience ratings will not be dislodged. Other census data of measurement on mobile engagement and social TV analytics will take hold, and will likely persist as an additional source of value in the audience marketplace.",Consuming Media,Media Industry Studies

Attitude toward multiplatform media use and different media platform combinations were explored in the aforementioned contexts. The results suggest that the higher the connected mobile media dependency and TV dependency a consumer has, the more positive his or her attitude toward multiplatform media use. Offline radio and TV affinity, both social media content consumption and creation, smartphone fluidity, gender, and user perceptions of multiplatform value, social norm, and ease of use are some factors that were found to play a role in such media consumption behaviors.",Consuming Media,Media Industry Studies

This article argues that the extensive criticism it has received does not take into account the material and intellectual circumstances under which the book was written. The article concludes from studying biographies, ideas, institutions and actors that the book combined two traditions: the dominant journalism history and the emerging applied international communication research.

The study shows that journalism education and research beyond the Iron Curtain reflected a structural impact that results from the international field of communication studies and, in particular, from West Germany back then. Even if the GDR’s invention of journalism studies was clearly shaped by the communist party’s demand for journalists, the origins and requirements for the field’s professors were quite similar in East and West. Therefore, it is no surprise that at the beginning, GDR journalism professors met with their Western colleagues and found themselves competitive. However, when West German scholars started their own way of international research, GDR professors became isolated from the field. Finally, the politically motivated closure of Leipzig in 1990 buried a paradigm that had lost the connection to international discussions.",Revisiting the Controversies: Histories of Communication Study,Communication History
2016-0733,2016,Paper Session,Media as Pharmakon: Revisiting the Bullet Theory,1,"When pioneers in mass communication research in the 1930s and 1940s attempted to describe the relationship between audiences and mass media, they ostensibly turned to the metaphors of the “magic bullet” and the “hypodermic needle”. Several historians of the discipline have debunked the “myth” behind these theories and argued that they had been used as straw man to establish a research paradigm that wouldn’t be that of the direct influence of media effects. Building from the recent work by Lubken on “hypodermic” (2008), this paper explores its counterpart metaphor, the “magic bullet”. This paper argues that the connection between the metaphors of needles and bullets can be best explained with their common meaning in the field of immunology. The general argument of the paper is that a pharmacological reading of the twin theories depicts media as pharmakon, and that such a reading is much more rich than the naive models we usually attribute to them.",Revisiting the Controversies: Histories of Communication Study,Communication History

This analysis of Dewey’s years at the University of Michigan from 1884 to 1894 reveals the early and original development of his philosophy with communication. Rather than being influenced by Charles Horton Cooley and George Herbert Mead, Dewey produced a comprehensive approach to communication beginning in the 1880s and revealed in a political philosophy course he taught there in 1892. His understanding of communication enabled Dewey to replace his organic, idealist explanation of society with the human activities of language and interaction, which needed to be extended through a tripartite system of speech, record, and distribution if democracy was to work.",Revisiting the Controversies: Histories of Communication Study,Communication History

Yet, as Twitter is becoming important for journalists to build economic and social capital, journalistic branding is becoming increasingly relevant to study. This paper reports the results from a study of 4189 Australian journalists’ Twitter accounts to examine their level of activity and approaches to self-presentation in their profile information. Journalists are relatively active Twitter users who tweet on a regular basis, but they still portray a predominantly professional persona that is closely tied to their employer. Less than half also provide personal information about themselves. Whereas only small differences could be found along gender lines, more significant differences existed in terms of whether journalists worked in metropolitan or regional areas and what their employers’ main platform of distribution was.",Journalism and Social Media,Journalism Studies

Social media offer journalists and citizens a communication space, where they can discuss issues, provide context for the news, and foster community values. This study examines how expectations about journalistic practices on social media influence audience engagement with journalists, and in turn, perceptions of editorial bias. Drawing on a two-wave panel survey from the United States, we first find that expectations about the practice of “good journalism” on social media predict engagement with journalists on Twitter. Second, these personal interactions lead to lower levels of perceived bias in the news media. Finally expectations of journalists’ performance on social media are explored as a moderator of perceived editorial bias. This study adds to the growing literature analyzing the causes and outcomes of audience engagement with journalists on social media.",Journalism and Social Media,Journalism Studies
2016-0737,2016,Paper Session,Agenda-Building and Journalists’ Use of Political Tweets: From Information Subsidies to Perceived Influences,2,"Many politicians as well as journalists are using Twitter regularly and are connected on the microblogging platform. Following the traditional agenda-building approach, it is possible for politicians to try to influence journalistic media coverage through Twitter. Agenda-building in a broader sense, however, also includes reciprocal influences from journalists on the political system. Against this background, this paper analyzes which characteristics of political tweets explain their use as information subsidies by Swiss journalists and whether Twitter as an interactive medium also allows for reciprocal influences. It is based on a unique combination of a standardized online survey of Swiss journalists in 2014 with an analysis of the Twitter metrics of the journalists. The results demonstrate that political tweets are most likely to be used by journalists if they can quote them, making agenda-building processes from politicians on journalists plausible. Reversely, journalists who have many politicians as followers perceive an influence on politicians they do not know personally thus underscoring that agenda-building through Twitter also includes reciprocal influences.",Journalism and Social Media,Journalism Studies

This experimental study (N = 267) examines the influence of a journalist’s self-disclosure through social media on perceptions of objectivity and intention to consume the journalist’s news product. Analyses reveal self-disclosure to positively affect news-consumption intention while negatively influencing objectivity perceptions. The positive direct effect of self-disclosure on behavioral intention is particularly strong when self-disclosure is coupled with a journalist’s direct social media engagement with audience members, but this positive effect is counter-balanced by a sizeable negative indirect effect on behavioral intention through perceived objectivity as mediator.",Journalism and Social Media,Journalism Studies

The first study examines the ability for addressing style of a mediated character to trigger experienced PSI (EPSI), while the second examines the link between EPSI and cognitive elaboration. Finally, a moderated mediation model was analyzed that takes metacognition (i.e., cognitive appraisal) of message-relevant thoughts and perceived quality of the message into account when determining the effects of cognitive elaboration on attitude certainty. Overall, the data suggests evidence for the relationship between addressing style and EPSI, and between EPSI and cognitive elaboration. However, the moderated mediation model was only partially supported by the data. Implications for the use of EPSI as an advantageous motivational factor engaging smokers in careful thinking about antismoking messages are discussed.",Antismoking Health Messages,Health Communication

The study examined the protective role of future orientation, norms, and consequence-focused messages on smoking attitudes and behaviors among at-risk teens. A nationally representative sample of 13-17 year olds completed an on-line message experiment. The present analysis included only non-smoking youth whose family or friends smoke (N = 611). Results demonstrated that future orientation was protective against the risk of tobacco uptake, and partially mitigated the increased risk among youth whose parents or peers approve of smoking. Among the distal and proximate consequences included in the message, DNA harm supported non-smoking intentions among youth high in future orientation. Thus, campaigns for at-risk youth should include messages about DNA harm. Future research could test how to promote future orientation and parent disapproval norms, and continue searching for effective message strategies for present-oriented youth.",Antismoking Health Messages,Health Communication

Two experimental studies on anti-DAD and anti-smoking PSAs were conducted that were conceptual replications of one another. Both studies afforded evidence that externals were more involved in risky behaviors. There was a consistent interaction between locus of control and controlling language, such that internals were more sensitive to this message feature compared to externals. Controlling language was found to increase reactance. The theoretical and managerial implications for health communication were elaborated.

The current study examines the effects of an alternative set of factually accurate graphic warning labels focusing on testimonies of real people who were harmed by tobacco products. An online experiment was conducted (n=2165) examining the impact of various textual and visual features of label vividness on engagement with the messages. Results showed that more vivid versions led to increased engagement that in turn was linked to increased intentions to quit smoking. The indirect effect of vividness on intentions to quit smoking was largely driven by the emotional component of engagement. The role of cognitive engagement only appears at higher levels of the label’s vividness.",Antismoking Health Messages,Health Communication

Numerous campaigns have attempted to get these men, often hardcore lifetime smokers, to quit with little success. This study tried to persuade 80 older smokers to reduce smoking using anti-smoking messages based on regret and generativity. Generativity proved to be a powerful factor for persuading older men to show willingness to encourage younger family members not to smoke. The results for retrospective regret, though consistent with the literature, were less clear. Though many older men showed some regret for the choice to smoke, they largely continued to be healthy and concluded that it was their free choice to continue to smoke suggesting reactance and resistance to the regret message. It might be beneficial to also examine the role of anticipated regret in reducing cigarette consumption among older smokers in future studies.

Based on the literature, this paper expands the CASA paradigm to the Media are Social Actors (MASA) paradigm. We begin by examining how a list of primary social cues and secondary social cues interact with individual differences and contextual factors in evoking medium-as-social-actor presence. Then we provide a list of technologies that can be perceived as social actors. We analyze how these technologies can display social cues and we map them in a coordinate system where the axes are the quality and the quantity of social cues. We then listed eight formal propositions of the MASA paradigm and propose future research suggestions.","Virtual Reality, Presence, and the Effects of Technology",Communication and Technology

Twenty-five undergraduate students participated in an EEG-based experiment that employed a 2 × 4 within-subjects factorial design. In the experiment, each of the participants was randomly exposed to eight combinations of two types of image presentations (photo image vs. avatar image) and four categories of human faces (self-faces vs. famous faces vs. ideal faces vs. unfamiliar faces). The self-report result data indicated that participants felt significantly higher senses of physical similarity to and identification with the characters when they were exposed to their own faces in the form of a photo image.

Or, does it raise our expectation for the degree of anthropomorphism displayed by the chatbot? We explored these questions with a 2 (anthropomorphic visual cue: high vs. low anthropomorphism) × 2 (identity cue: chat-bot vs. sales associate) × 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low message interactivity) between-subjects experiment. Findings show that a high level of message interactivity compensates for the impersonal nature associated with a chatbot that is low on anthropomorphic visual cues. Moreover, the identity cue turned out to be a key factor in eliciting expectations regarding the agent’s performance in the conversation. Theoretical as well as practical implications of these findings are discussed.","Virtual Reality, Presence, and the Effects of Technology",Communication and Technology

We found that people’s support for government actions to reduce health disparities is influenced positively by the extent to which people believe the causes of health disparities are environmental and negatively by the extent to which people believe the causes of health disparities are individual. Moreover, it was found that people are more likely to exhibit political behaviors intended to ameliorate health disparities (personal activism) if they think health disparities come from environmental factors.

Given the confusing and conflicting nature of the mass media content regarding health/medical information, this study examined the potential negative influence of exposure to health information in mass media on patients’ beliefs and medication adherence, in comparison to the effects of another primary medication information source, physicians. Survey data obtained from patients on blood thinner regimens revealed that frequent exposure to health information in mass media was negatively related to accuracy of patients’ beliefs about their illnesses and medication benefits, and patient medication adherence. On the other hand, trust in doctor was positively associated with patients’ medication adherence behavior only.

2016-0750,2016,Paper Session,Specifying the Role of Threat and Efficacy Within the Extended Parallel Process Model,2,"Fear appeals are commonly applied in health related communication as disseminators aim to induce changes to individuals’ attitudes, intentions, and behavior. The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) has stimulated a lot empirical research as well as theoretical development. However, unequivocal empirical support for basic assumptions of the model is still missing. This study aims to specify existing knowledge about the role of fear appeals in health related communication by clarifying the role of central components and processes of the EPPM, e.g., fear, danger control processes, and fear control processes. This was implemented by exploring the relationships and interdependencies through structure equation modeling. Results indicate that efficacy, rather than threats, are more effective in convincing people to adopt health relevant behaviors. Our findings are consistent with existing research, indicating that coping processes are more strongly related to attitudes and intentions to perform a recommended action than to threat related processes.",Studies of Media Effects and Health,Health Communication

This experimental study examines the impact of news exemplars’ recovery perspective, type of disability, and gender on readers’ stigma-related attitudes and behavioral intentions, and the role of readers’ reading experiences and empathy as mediators of these processes. Findings show that routes to anti-stigma interventions, and the effects of promoting a positive recovery perspective, are disability-specific, and emphasize the role of respondents’ gender. Furthermore, effects on stigma-related outcomes are mediated via empathy and reading enjoyment depending on readers’ attention.

In a longitudinal study with a representative sample from Germany (N = 460), using cross-lagged structural equation modeling, we found that SNS communication increased both FtF and IM communication six months later. Likewise, IM communication at T1 increased SNS communication at T2. Regarding potential media effects, FtF, SNS, and IM communication did not affect peoples' loneliness. Moreover, both FtF and IM communication at T1 did not change life satisfaction at T2; however, communication on SNSs increased life satisfaction six months later.

We content analyzed 516 cancer stories for one year period from one national newspaper, one regional newspaper, and one national news portal in China. We found that the main theme was about cancer patients received/ needed aid, especially economic aid. Leukemia and cervical cancers were over-represented, whereas esophageal, gastric, and liver cancers were under-represented, relative to their incidence and mortality. Cancer treatment was much more covered than prevention and detection. We also compared the media agenda of cancer and the health policy agenda of cancer.

The results of a 2 (narratives) × 2 (with vs. without information) online experiment (N = 308) show that embedding relevant information (1) did not impede narratives’ potential to decrease reactance through narrative engagement, (2) successfully reduced attitudinal ambivalence, and (3) ultimately increased organ donation intentions. This paper illustrates the theoretical and empirical relevance of ambivalence and reactance as valuable constructs both for researchers and practitioners in health communication.",Media-Related Health Communication Research (TOP FACULTY AND STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication
2016-0759,2016,Paper Session,Health Literacy and the Internet: An Exploratory Study With Implications for Theory and Practice,2,"Health literacy rates among American adults remain low, with almost half of adults having only basic levels. In this digital era, the Internet has been recognized as an important medium for improving health literacy. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying its impact on health literacy. With a general basis in the Cognitive Mediation Model, this study empirically tested a model that included motivation for health-related Internet use, health-related Internet use, perceived health information overload, and health literacy. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the HINTS 2013 dataset. The results support for all the paths in our posited model. The effects of motivation for health-related Internet use on health literacy were completely mediated by health-related Internet use and perceived health information overload. The findings extend the Cognitive Mediation Model to the context of health literacy and provide significant implications for the design and dissemination of online health information.",Media-Related Health Communication Research (TOP FACULTY AND STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication
2016-0760,2016,Paper Session,Media Exposure and Protective Behavior During a Public-Health Emergency,1,"Based on the Extended Parallel Processing Model and social cognitive theory, this study developed a model of protective behaviors in a public health emergency under extensive media coverage. The study goes beyond the fear appeal messages designed for experiments and tests the effect of media coverage of a public health emergency on perceived efficacy and the consequent protective behaviors. Media exposure was found to have variant effects on perceived threat and fear arousal. The study introduced the three aspects of efficacy as the predictors of health protective behaviors. It found that self efficacy, collective efficacy and proxy efficacy vary in their effects on the two routes of health behaviors. Self-efficacy and proxy efficacy consistently predicted all three aspects of danger control, while perceived efficacy played a less noticeable role in the process of fear control. The influence on danger control and fear control by the same predictors demonstrates significant difference.",Media-Related Health Communication Research (TOP FACULTY AND STUDENT PAPER),Mass Communication
2016-0761,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Scandals on Top Politicians,3,"In modern societies, scandals have become a means of political power. One can distinguish three major players – the protagonists of scandals, the mass media and political forces that use the mass media to attack those in power. There are no studies on the media effects on the protagonists of scandals and their decision-making. As studies in other areas indicate, most people at the center of a scandal behave in two phases. First, they regard the accusations against them as unfounded. Then they recognize that most news reports contradict their views and that they cannot defend themselves against the proliferating accusations. We analyzed the nonverbal behavior of two politicians before and during scandals – German Minister, Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg, and the German President, Christian Wulff. The results confirm the outlined two-period theory. Results are discussed with respect to the role of the media in political opinion formation and decision-making.",Political Leaders and the Media,Political Communication
2016-0762,2016,Paper Session,How Do the Media Shape Perceptions of Party Leaders?,3,"Media coverage can have an important influence on how citizens think about political leaders. The present study explores how three types of media bias (visibility bias, tonality bias and agenda bias) affect voter assessments of politicians’ traits. We argue that bias effects should be stronger for political traits such as competence and leadership compared to non-political traits such as honesty and likeability. We also argue that biases can interact in their effect: specifically, visibility bias moderates the impact of tonality bias. We combine media, party and survey data through manual content analysis of newspaper coverage (N = 7.387) and party press releases (N = 1.493) as well as a three-wave voter survey (n = 1.504) during 2013 Austrian election. We find substantial effects on political candidate traits for tonality bias and agenda bias. Although visibility bias has no direct impact, it moderates effects of tonality bias on candidate assessments.",Political Leaders and the Media,Political Communication
2016-0763,2016,Paper Session,Indirect Effects of Personalization in the Media: Whose Perceived Performance is Determined by Whom?,1,"A still contested research outcome is that voters are by and large influenced more strongly by the perceived performance of a party, than by charismatic appeals of the party leader. The current research asks whether party leaders during election campaigns exert a relatively strong influence on perceived party performance, and therefore a strong indirect effect on the vote, among others through their role in campaign news. The answer is based on content analysis data (newspapers, TV) and biweekly panel survey data from election campaigns in the Netherlands (2002-2012). Preliminary research results show that voters ultimately vote for parties indeed, but that party reputations are vested by the media appearances of party leaders. Leader effects are already incorporated in the reputation of parties with long-standing leaders. Thus far the relative effect sizes of news about party leaders and about their parties hardly gained attention.",Political Leaders and the Media,Political Communication

This study examines how one hospital system implemented a mobile communication app to help their locally mobile workforce communicate in a timely manner. Using boundary theory, we identify the key boundary management issues that personal mobile phone use in this US hospital created at the organizational, unit, and individual level. At the organizational level, the key issues are policy legacy, communicating policy, organizational control needs, dead zones, and mobile costs. At the group level, different hospital units create their own formal and informal policies. The biggest boundary issues for individuals are private ownership of a personal mobile device, job role expectations, and decision-making autonomy. Our discussion presents an overarching model of the influences on boundary management when permissive Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies are implemented. Our model explains why it is not easy to tell employees, “Go ahead and use your mobiles at work,” and have them immediately embrace this new way of communicating.",mHealth,Mobile Communication

Although recent studies have explored positive and negative implications of nurses’ use of personal mobile phones, none has yet analyzed how the interactions of sociotechnical components (users, technology and policy) influence its use. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 nurses in the Philippines and analyzed their responses using sociotechnical analysis. Sociotechnical analysis showed that staff nurses used their personal mobile phones at work in various ways as it greatly helps at work but inevitably alter usual routines. Although most of the hospitals have policies that prohibit its use, staff nurses justified its use for work purposes and for their patient’s benefit. Staff nurses also highlighted the absence of a hospital-provided mobile phone as a strong reason to use personal mobile phones at work. Policy recommendations on nurses’ personal mobile use at work were included.",mHealth,Mobile Communication

Conventional behavioral science relies on retrospective recall measures, and after-the-fact intervention in areas such as drinking behavior. Recall measures have several limitations; which are not just random error but could be serious systematic bias. The present study uses Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) via mobile technology to help collect data from participants in real time.

Longitudinal data from 6 studies on 141 matching dyads in 28 group’s projects were used. Both leader’s and member’s perceptions on dyadic communication was assessed at two points (Time 1and 3) and perception on similarity (Time 2 and 4) used to predict group leader’s perceived ratings of OCB in Time 5 and performance in Time 6 during groups’ life cycles. Results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses indicate that the effect for leader-member dyadic communication agreement and perceived similarity occurs from the beginning to the end of the group’s lifecycle. These findings show that effects for leader-member dyadic communication agreement on OCB and group member performance differ depending on the attraction-similarity hypothesis that is based on initial communication between group leaders and group members, which then leads to agreement on communication and similarity",Leadership in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

Drawing on data from a multinational business organization, this paper analyzes a three-day long change project meeting to uncover how a paradox of understanding while misunderstanding developed from the dynamic interplay between control and resistance. Even though managers collaborated in implementing the change process, they enacted a paradox through producing and responding to dialectical tensions. This research demonstrates how these discursive patterns simultaneously produced both both control and resistance that led to rejection of change.

Furthermore, argument type was found to affect people's beliefs about arguments. The present paper proposes another distinctive argument type: arguments about others' personal issue (i.e., OP arguments). OP arguments are defined as ones about issues that have direct implications on some other people's personal relationship. An empirical study was conducted to provide evidence for the existence of OP arguments, as well as investigate how argument type affects people's argument beliefs under the new conceptualization. It was found that OP arguments were perceived as more enjoyable than personal-issue arguments, but less so than public-issue ones. Furthermore, participants thought OP and public-issue arguments yielded similar amount of pragmatic outcomes. These two types of argument were also perceived to be equally ego-involving, but less so than personal-issue arguments. After having OP and personal-issue arguments, people did not feel as good about themselves as they did after public-issue arguments.","Problematic Interactions: Arguments, Advice, and Other Contentious Issues in Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

2016-0776,2016,Paper Session,Rejection Sensitivity and Serial Arguing: Implications for Conflict Resolution,2,"Demand/withdraw communication is an important dysfunctional pattern of serial arguing. This study aims at addressing factors that affect the ways in which self-demand/partner withdraw pattern increase the likelihood of persistence of serial arguing. We posits that sensitivity to rejection is positively related to the degree to which individuals perceive a partners’ behavior as generally disconfirming, which is positively related to enactment of self-demand/partner withdraw during an argumentative episode. This sequence is positively related to perception of arguments as unresolved. In addition, this sequence is positively related to the likelihood that the argument is resolved without mutual agreement. Serial mediation analysis confirmed that the likelihood of resolution without mutual agreement were positively associated with rejection sensitivity partially because high RS individuals are likely to perceive their partner to be generally disconfirming and to enact self-demand/partner-withdraw communication during the episode. However, this pattern did not apply to perception of the argument as resolved.","Problematic Interactions: Arguments, Advice, and Other Contentious Issues in Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

The current study examined the influence of advice message framing (i.e., gain-framed message vs. loss-framed message) on recipients’ responses to advice in terms of evaluation of advice quality, facilitation of coping, and intention to implement advice, taking into consideration perceived response efficacy and self-efficacy as mediators. An experiment was conducted with 605 participants. Participants read and responded to a hypothetical conversation in which they are receiving advice from a friend. Results indicated that gain-framed advice messages elicited higher evaluations of advice quality and higher perceptions of facilitation of coping from recipients in comparison with loss-framed advice messages. However, there was no significant difference between gain-framed advice and loss-framed advice with regard to intention to implement advice. Recipient’s perception of response efficacy mediated the effect of advice message framing on facilitation of coping.","Problematic Interactions: Arguments, Advice, and Other Contentious Issues in Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

Participants listened to prerecorded dialogues with embedded interruptions and topic changes and completed surveys that assessed the participant’s perceptions of dominance (Youngquist, 2009) or conversational appropriateness (Canary & Spitzberg, 1989). The primary hypothesis, that a speaker who resisted topic changes initiated by interruptions would be perceived as more dominant, was not supported by this research. In fact, the opposite occurred. For the second dependent variable, perceived conversational appropriateness, there was no significant change of perception regarding the speaker who was interrupted and/or experienced a topic change. However, the speaker who interrupted and/or changed the topic (successfully or unsuccessfully) was perceived as significantly less conversationally appropriate in all experimental conditions.","Problematic Interactions: Arguments, Advice, and Other Contentious Issues in Interpersonal Relationships",Interpersonal Communication

Through interviews and focus group discussions, the food practice and discourse of Asian, Latina/o and white residents illustrates the formation of largely ethnically-bounded “culinary imaginaries”. Membership within these imaginaries shapes how residents culturally code and move through spaces—and experience moments of co-presence differentially. The paper demonstrates how food can be used as a barometer of intercultural communication and attitudes towards community change.

To date, researchers measuring changes of students’ discipline-specific epistemological beliefs have predominantly tested artificial texts containing different levels of epistemological dimensions. Applying this logic to audio-visual stimuli, television clips might also affect the epistemological beliefs of students. Three different television stimuli on the subject of Alzheimer’s disease with varying levels of depicting epistemological dimensions were therefore selected through a content analysis, and their effects tested on a sample of 72 students using a pre-post-test.

By surveying 165 parents of 3-13 year-old immigrant children, this study found that low-income Chinese parents enacted restrictive mediation the most and exhibited a slow acculturation process even after an average of seven years of emigration. Higher parental acculturation was related to a higher use of active and restrictive mediation. Additionally, different aspects of parental involvement served as predictors of the three mediation strategies.

First, it argues for a conceptualisation of digital literacy that has ‘interactivity’ at its core and for a micro-perspective on people’s identity in general and age identity in particular in order to conceptually shed light on the joint role that literacy and identity play in digital inclusion. Second, it reports on qualitative research of older and younger digital users that operationalises and empirically tests these conceptual suggestions. The qualitative findings suggest that literacy and age identity affect digital inclusion separately as well as jointly, while age influences actual and perceptual literacy gaps. Our findings disrupt assumptions about young people as ‘digital natives’ and literacy gaps and invite exploration of ‘intra-generational’ nuances in the realm of digital inclusion.",Learning and Thinking Through/With/By Media,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0793,2016,Paper Session,#InshAllahPolitics: The Role of Social Media Technologies in Enabling and Constraining Strategies of Activist NGOs,2,"Given a predominant technological deterministic tendency in organizational research, social media technologies are usually regarded to facilitate information disclosure, freedom of expression and democratization. Nevertheless, this limits our understanding of the tensions such technologies generate for collective organizing, especially in politically unstable environments. This study adopts a socio-materiality perspective and uses ethnographic methods to examine two Tunisian non-governmental activist organizations (NGOs). Our findings indicate that a ‘mashup’ of four social media technologies exhibit the capacity to act by enabling and undermining actors’ ability to coordinate strategies (i.e., share information, make decisions, increase the size of gatherings, etc.). Our contribution is twofold: on the one hand, we show that social media have both a positive and paradoxical role for coordinating collective organizing in areas of socio-political instability. On the other hand, we extend the knowledge base for NGOs working with social media for freedom of expression in non-Western geo-politically relevant contexts.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

2016-0795,2016,Paper Session,A Preliminary Research Design: Relational Approach to Workplace Aggression From the Perpetrator’s Perspective,1,"Harmful effects of workplace aggression have been widely acknowledged and research in the field has rapidly developed in recent decades. This empirical study investigates causes of aggressive behaviors in the workplace, with a focus on the perpetrator-victim relationship from the perpetrator’s standpoint. Data will be collected using an online questionnaire to examine the causal relationships between causes of workplace aggression and aggressive behaviors. A survey will consist of three sections for participants to self-report: (1) experiences of workplace aggression as the perpetrator, (2) causes of aggressive behaviors, and (3) the perpetrator-victim relationships. Multiple regression analyses will be conducted to identify causes as predictors of aggressive behaviors. Identifying the predictors from the perpetrator’s viewpoint may be a powerful approach to prevent workplace aggressive behaviors in a proactive way.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Considering this increase, it is imperative to examine whether it is an effective method for making employment decisions. Thus, the aim of this study is to better understand how major organizations are incorporating social networking sites (SNS) into their recruitment and hiring process. Researchers will use the qualitative method of in-depth interviews to gain new perspectives and understandings pertaining to current hiring strategies and practices involving social media. Interviews will be conducted with a minimum of 20 hiring managers at major for-profit organizations in Richmond, Virginia. Building upon current scholarly literature, the results of this study will help to inform best practices for recruiting and hiring via SNS.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

By examining a recent event that took place at one of the world’s largest television marketplaces ‘MIPCOM’ (Cannes, October 2015), the paper likens the notion of social responsibility to Georg Simmel’s (1908) notion of The Stranger. The inquiry blends three sets of empirical references - paratexts, fieldnotes and interviews - that are analysed through methods of textual analysis, ethnographic narrative and discourse analysis of interpretive repertoires. Current literature on the thinking and exercising of social responsibility are related to the case to discuss themes that include 1) displays of social responsibility by media organizations, 2) negotiations of tensions between CSR and business demands, 3) the role of different television genres for CSR, and 4) the continued association of CSR and the Global South.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Based on the sociological approach of social capital the author created a guideline for expert interviews with employees, change mangers and community managers of international enterprises. The findings were complemented with additional information from several case studies. As a result the paper identifies both opportunities and challenges in the process of introducing social software in enterprises. It also points out the potential benefits for both the organization and its members: Accordingly, communication in social media can improve not only the productivity of an organization but also positively impact corporate culture in general.
The concept of social capital proves to be a useful approach to develop strategies for a successful integration of social media in internal workflows and thereby to align businesses successfully according to the conditions of the network society.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication
2016-0799,2016,Paper Session,Communicating With Power in an Organizational Setting: A Comprehensive Discourse Analysis of an Executive Meeting,1,"Power needs communication to become a reality (Hardy & Phillips, 2004) and is itself constituted through communication (Mumby, 2014; 2001); so too is organization as it is also constituted through communication (Putnam & Nicotera, 2009). Organization power, it can then be said, is exerted through powerful communication. But what is a powerful communication in an organizational context? In this paper, we describe the two different ways by which communication harnesses authoritative force (or legitimate power) for it to be able to make someone do things that s/he wouldn’t otherwise do by him or herself. Through a comprehensive discourse analysis of an executive meeting we show the different articulations and associations organizational actors put discursively in motion and how they affect a dialogue unfolding, with its antagonisms, around competitive choices (Mumby, 2005: 22). These discursive practices are shown to have organizational consequences in terms of conflicts and hegemony.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

We put forward a work hypothesis to determine the index of website development and used communicative practices. According to this work hypothesis, we propose to consider a valid indicator of the level of website development and used communicative practices, and the extent of their use in specific circumstances. Thus, we propose to assess the difference between the ""ideal"" work of the project (which is determined by the results of the information and communication audit and technical specifications of the website) and ""real"" work (in view of the shortcomings of current website). As a result, we come to the same indicator, which reflects the effectiveness of communicative practices of university websites within university information policy.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication
2016-0801,2016,Paper Session,The Institutionalization of CCO Studies: Insights Into the Conversation-Text Dynamics of an Emerging Subfield,1,"Several recent publications have described research on the communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) as an emerging field of inquiry within organizational communication studies (see Brummans, Cooren, Robichaud, & Taylor, 2014; Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, & Clark, 2011; Cooren, Vaara, Langley, & Tsoukas, 2014; Schoeneborn, Blaschke, Cooren, McPhee, Seidl, & Taylor, 2014). We still have comparatively little insight, though, into the communicative dynamics that enable and constrain this emergence. Thus, in this paper, I reveal how texts and conversations promote the proliferation of practices and actions within the CCO schools. Moreover, I argue that CCO studies is taking the shape of a subfield with its own habitus (Bourdieu, 1977) within organizational communication studies by undergoing a process of institutionalization. I also show how this institutionalization is happening through specific communicative practices (Ocasio, Loewenstein, Nigam, & 2015) that resemble Taylor’s conversation-text dynamics (see Taylor, Cooren, Giroux, & Robichaud, 1996 ).",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

More specifically, given that most sustainability development studies are limited to corporations, the study will explore how both for-profit and nonprofit organizations’ violating behaviors influence publics’ evaluation on the organizations. A 2 (organization: for-profit vs. nonprofit) X 2 (scenario: positive vs. negative) between-subjects randomized experimental design will be employed to address the main effects of sustainability development expectancy violation and moderating effects of pre-expectancy, skepticism, and ulterior motives in influencing the effects of expectancy violations.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Organizational Power and Evidence-Based Corporate Humanity,1,"The value that organizations create for the public is a vehicle for both the giving and receiving of power. As the public is empowered, particularly those in economically and socially deprived societies, organizations are empowered with increased human development and security. In his seminal work on organizational effectiveness, Mark Moore suggested the creation of public value (1995) as a means for improvement and innovation in performance. Using Moore’s public value creation theoretical framework and Abrahamson’s critical work on measurement as a managerial fad and fashion, a content analysis of the 35 leading corporate public value evaluation tools is currently underway. By exploring the communications demand for measurement (i.e., who wants to know what is being done by corporations and why), this paper investigates the type(s) of demand for public value measurement to assess the true social utility of organizational measurement and communications in corporations that promise social impact.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Current studies on government use of microblog mainly focused on the communication potentials of microblog in mundane usage. This study takes a homicide case occurred at a McDonald's on weibo, Chinese microblogging platform, as a case to examine how government use microblog genre to influence, manipulate, and regulate the crisis? The findings show that microblog genres have been utilized by governments as parts of apparatus of governance during the crisis. First, genres of governance are mediated genres that are specialized for mediated (inter)action through genre chain. Government sectors and media agencies establish a joint effort through a genre chain. Second, genres of governance are specialized for direct (inter)action by mixing existing genres.

Thus, the current study aims to describe different hiding strategies of hidden organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). In order to explore the practice of anonymous communication at an organizational level, I attended the World Meeting of AA. As a participant-observer, I did ethnographic fieldwork at the international convention of AA in Atlanta, GA during the July 4th weekend, 2015. During the convention, various types of strategies AA used to maintain anonymity as well as celebrate its international convention became apparent.

The cancer research lab, which is par excellence a knowledge building organization, was targeted. Through participant observation, this study collected a number of trivialization practices within 2 cancer research labs, in Belgium and Tunisia. Open interviews and discourse analysis were then conducted to understand the dynamic of trivialization around the collected practices. The study was then able to track back where the trivializations emanate, and how they cause ideas to be excluded. Finally, the research found that studying trivialization from a discursive point of view can be strategically used to understand how knowledge is built and developed.

Social media have often been applauded for facilitating communication practices and enabling the construction of (social) ties between coworkers. However, research increasingly points to social media’s dark side, with studies concluding work related social media use leads to increased work life invasion, information overload and stress. Arguably these advantages and challenges coexist and are inherently related to the use of these technologies in the workplace, thus presenting a paradox.

This study aims to investigate variation in issue-specific news frames that are either in favor of or against active aging policies, and attributions of responsibility for dealing with the issue of older workers’ employability across diverse actors. The data came from a content analysis of 1362 news articles in broadsheet and tabloid newspapers from The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, Denmark, and Spain in the timespan 2006 – 2013. Results shows that news frames are only partly in line with the active aging paradigm.

Considering that this relationship is argued to be a threat to the societal functions of journalisms, as well as a source of conflict in media companies, it is surprising that it has rarely been studied systematically. As the newsroom is the department in which it is finally negotiated whether economic or journalistic goals prevail, a representative sample of German journalists (N= 775) was interviewed to gain a comprehensive overview. Results suggest that the relationship is conflicted because of clashing interests; however, it only moderately limits journalistic autonomy. This may be thanks to the newsroom management, which significantly more often directly communicates with the advertising sales department than low-ranking journalists, perceives conflicts to be more frequent, and according to most journalists is fighting expectations raised by the advertising sales department.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

In this paper we problematize this relationship. Mixing interviews with sensory ethnography and the think-aloud protocol, we asked and observed how users actually browse news and what clicking and not clicking mean to them. The results suggest that clicks are a limited instrument for measuring interest in news. First, users click or do not click for reasons more diverse than (not) having interest in news; we identified 29 distinct reasons, classified into five main categories: professional selection criteria, personal world, topic-related, narrative approach and practical considerations. Second, interest in news does not necessarily lead to a click, as users engage in practices that do not involve clicking but do fulfil valuable functions for them. Finally, we argue that taking users’ news selection criteria seriously could enhance not only users’ appreciation but also the quality of journalism.","News Audiences: Users, Consumers, Citizens?",Journalism Studies

An online survey was used to collect data among Qualtrics panels (N = 1001). Demographics and three other antecedent factors of perceived information overload were considered: the frequency of news access through multiple media platforms, level of attention to news, and interest in news. Three news consumption patterns were investigated as possible consequences of perceived information overload: news avoidance, selective exposure, and willingness to pay for news. The results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed a meaningful distinction between general and news information overload. Overall, news consumers who paid more attention to news through newer media/platforms/devices perceived higher levels of information overload, were more willing to pay for the news, and often avoided news or selectively exposed themselves to certain sources of news to deal with news information overload.","News Audiences: Users, Consumers, Citizens?",Journalism Studies
2016-0815,2016,Paper Session,When Does an Infographic Say More Than a Thousand Words? Audience Evaluations of Information Visualizations in the News,5,"Visualizations in the news are becoming popular. They are believed to attract news consumers to a newspaper and make it possible to integrate big data into the news. However, we know little on how news consumers value these new forms of storytelling. Any debate on the value of visualizations in a journalistic context hinges on two fundamental and interconnected questions that have so far gone unanswered in the literature. Using a comprehensive multi-method approach, we provide an answer on how news consumers use and appreciate news visualizations. Using eye tracking research, we analyzed how news consumer use or read visualizations on three different platforms, a newspaper, an e-newspaper on tablet, and on a news website. Secondly, through focus groups and survey among readers of three news media we analyzed how news consumers value visualizations within a news article. Results show that visualizations are not seen as independent storytellers, but are an integral aspect of a news story. While the reader’s interest in the topic of the story is crucial in deciding to read the article, the aesthetics play a significant role in the intention to read a visual. Nevertheless, the form should also have a function. When aesthetics or visual forms do not serve a purpose within a visualization, they add no value.","News Audiences: Users, Consumers, Citizens?",Journalism Studies

This study advances research on news overload by (a) incorporating a more holistic measure of overall news overload and examining the moderating effect of (b) content characteristics and (c) news topics on overload. Moreover, aside from assessing the interrelationship between news and user psychology, this study also investigates the ways in which the three above mentioned attributes of news overload contribute to selective scanning and news avoidance, two audience behaviors that have an adverse effect on healthy democracy. The results indicate that the antecedents and effects of news overload may be more complex than previously thought and deserve more attention among practitioners and mass media scholars.","News Audiences: Users, Consumers, Citizens?",Journalism Studies

Participants (18-88 years old) were randomly exposed to either four online news articles written in a narrative structure or to four stories written in an inverted pyramid structure. Results showed that people are better informed by stories using a narrative structure. However, participants all had low appreciation for the narrative news stories compared to the inverted pyramid stories. Moreover, the younger audiences have a very low appreciation for all news stories compared to the two older generations, regardless of story structure. Finally, they do not have a higher perception of quality of stories written in the narrative structure. This implies that narrative structure is not a viable strategy to attract younger news audiences.","News Audiences: Users, Consumers, Citizens?",Journalism Studies

More specifically, we examine whether and how evidence type and social distance might interact in influencing non-smokers’ attitudes toward others’ quitting smoking, intentions to persuade others to quit smoking, and health beliefs regarding others’ smoking behaviors. Results of a controlled experiment (N = 281) revealed a significant two-way interaction pertaining to attitudes.

Yet, there was no difference in attitudes between socially proximal and socially distant conditions when participants were exposed to narrative-based anti-smoking messages.",Antismoking Health Messages and News,Health Communication
2016-0819,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Reading Newspaper Articles about Smoking on Implicit and Explicit Attitudes,1,"There is often a conflict between rational, overtly expressed thought and impulsive desire, especially in tempting situations. This is the reason why a change in explicit thought does not guarantee behavior change. Unlike dominant theories of health behavior focusing only on reflective precursors of behavior, more recently developed dual-process models additionally include impulsive precursors of behavior. Indeed, research has revealed that both reflective and impulsive precursors guide health behavior. We tested the consequences of reading journalistic articles highlighting negative consequences of tobacco smoking on reflective and impulsive precursors of health behavior. Using an experiment (N = 671), we tested reading effects on overtly expressed evaluations of smoking (i.e., explicit attitudes) as a reflective precursor consistent with dominant theories of reasoned action. Furthermore, and as the primary contribution of the present study, we also investigated whether reading can influence automatic affective reactions toward smoking (i.e., implicit attitudes) as an impulsive precursor. We found that the reading of negative smoking articles strengthened the negativity of explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking. We discuss implications for prevention and argue that intervention strategies may be most effective when targeting both explicit and implicit attitude change.",Antismoking Health Messages and News,Health Communication

A 5-group-comparison (including control group) experiment revealed that these posters did not increase antismoking attitudes but decreased antismoking behavior intentions. The better liked, more humorous and frightening poster did not result in greater antismoking attitudes or behavior intentions. Further, aided recall exhibited no relationship with any message characteristics of the cartoon posters. These findings warrant the development of theories that clarify the role of humor in health communication. Although cartoons are well liked by adolescents, antismoking practitioners must be aware of possible negative effects of humor in designing cartoon-based messages.",Antismoking Health Messages and News,Health Communication

The method was a content analysis that occurred during a 6-year project aimed at prompting towns in Missouri to adopt smoke-free policies. Results showed the majority of editorials were about tobacco restrictions or ordinances, were neutral in tone, and provided factual information about tobacco control. However, there were more editorials that were negatively than positively slanted toward tobacco control. Most of the positive-toned editorials were published in newspapers in towns that had clean indoor air policies. We conclude that the tobacco industry may have had success in impacting news editorials in no-ordinance cities by diverting attention from tobacco control to secondary topics, such as youth smoking, and from positive health benefits to potential negative consequences of smoke-free policies.",Antismoking Health Messages and News,Health Communication
2016-0822,2016,Paper Session,Vapor and Mirrors: A Qualitative Framing Analysis of E-Cigarette Reporting in High-Circulation U.S. Newspapers,2,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been gaining popularity in the United States since their introduction into the market in 2008. Use among teenagers and young adults has recently skyrocketed, tripling between 2013 and 2014. Given that these products are still unregulated at the federal level, they represent a major public health concern. News media can have substantial effects on public perception of technology and health issues, and so it is important to understand the ways that the U.S. media present e-cigarettes.
This study examined the framing of e-cigarettes in three major high-circulation U.S. newspapers. A qualitative content analysis was performed on 92 e-cigarette-related news articles published between January 2008 and October 2014. Three major frames arose in newspaper reporting: Comparison/Contrast, Regulation, and Uncertainty.

Two online studies were completed with U.S. adults. Study 1 participants (N=1142) were randomly assigned to view print message-sidedness D-PSAs or a control. Refutational messages were more effective at increasing help-seeking for individuals with elevated depressive symptomatology than the control. Study 2 participants (N=567) with mild to severe depressive symptomatology were randomly assigned to view video message-sidedness by attitude function D-PSAs or control messages. Functionally matched D-PSAs were more effective than mismatched D-PSAs and control messages. Refutational messages were more effective than one-sided D-PSAs. Ineffective D-PSAs (e.g., mismatched D-PSAs) can bolster the negative effects of depressive symptomatology on help-seeking, while effective D-PSAs (e.g., refutational and matched) can initiate the help-seeking process. Help-seeking for depression can lead to improved symptomatology, a better quality of life, and reduced likelihood of suicide.",Mental Health and Depression,Health Communication

Functional social support was only negatively associated with mobility (β=-.16, p<.01).
The role of emotional social support is substantial in coping depression and improving QOL. Informational and functional social supports were not associated with QOL and depression. The findings confirm that HIV/AIDS care in China should consider the conceptual differences between emotional, informational and functional support.",Mental Health and Depression,Health Communication
2016-0826,2016,Paper Session,The Role of Cultural Identity and Media Use at Influencing Intentions to Seek Mental Health Information Among Chinese Adults,2,"Mental health is a stigmatized issue in many parts of the world. We conducted a survey of Chinese adults (n=776) to examine predictors of intentions to seek information related to mental health. Attitudes and subjective norms positively influenced intentions to seek mental health information, with subjective norms being a stronger predictor. Cultural identity was negatively associated with intentions to seek mental health information, and media use was positively associated with intentions to seek information. This research highlights that cultural identity should be taken into consideration when it comes to a specific health topic, and that health campaigns could focus more on influencing subjective norms, thereby changing the seeking intention of Chinese adults regarding mental health information.",Mental Health and Depression,Health Communication
2016-0827,2016,Paper Session,The Vicissitudes of Medical Discourse and Embedded Cultural Rationality: A Content Analysis of Health Reporting for Neurasthenia and Depressive Disorder in China,2,"Neurasthenia (shenjing shuairuo) and depressive disorder are medical issues that have given rise to disputes in China for more than 20 years. Since the 1980s, the once ubiquitous diagnosis of neurasthenia in China was rapidly substituted by depressive disorder in the clinical context. Globally, the metamorphosis from neurasthenia to depressive disorder heralded the triumph of scientific rationality, which identifies neurasthenia as a categorical fallacy. In China, however, although ceasing to serve as a clinical diagnosis, neurasthenia retained social and cultural significance; thus, it has become a contestable discourse in relation to depressive disorder. By examining the health reporting of both discourses over a decade, this study set out to explicate how neurasthenia and depressive disorder were represented in a popular health newspaper in China. The content analysis showed that neurasthenia is a more culturally and everyday embedded discourse closely associated with Chinese medicine and laymen’s discourse on mental illnesses, while depressive disorder is more associated with Western medicine and the professional discourse on mental illnesses. Taken together, the differentiation of two sets of medical discourse evinces that despite the ostensibly prevailing scientific rationality in media health reporting, cultural rationality is deeply embedded in communicating mental health issues with the lay public. It further suggests the cultural significance of investigating the social and cultural expression of mental illnesses in China.",Mental Health and Depression,Health Communication
2016-0828,2016,Paper Session,"It’s the Audience, Stupid: Differences in Social Support Between Social Media Sites",3,"Responding to recent calls to transcend social media platforms when examining media effects, this multi-method study first uses a national survey (N = 325) to examine social support via paralinguistic digital affordances (PDAs) across and between platforms. PDAs are the frequently-used one-click social media affordances for phatic communication where meaning is ascribed in both sending and receipt. Results of the survey reveal some significant between-platform differences in the amount of social support a PDA can provide; but no significant differences for the relational closeness of the PDA sender. Next, using the social information processing model as a framework, these findings were used to design and conduct focus groups (N = 36) to understand why these differences exist. Focus groups reveal that while social support is provided across all platforms, different types of social support are sought depending on the platform and the network audience that platform accesses.",Social Support Online,Communication and Technology

One challenge facing support seekers is the relatively low response rate on support-seeking posts. This experiment employed an interactive forum to examine people’s willingness to reply to a support-seeking post and its relationship with opinions expressed in their responses. The results suggested that viewers were more likely to respond to a support-seeking post if the original poster replied to previous comments and if viewers perceived a post topic to be more personally relevant. In general, viewers with a majority or minority opinion were equally willing to respond to a support-seeking post.",Social Support Online,Communication and Technology

The present work seeks to redress two limitations in these previous studies, the bifurcation of tie strength and the treatment of social support as a unidimensional concept, testing hypotheses regarding the linear effect of relational closeness on four dimensions of social support. A survey of 474 Europeans and Americans had respondents complete scales assessing emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal support for three types of relational ties (i.e., weak, medium, and strong). Findings demonstrate linear relationships among relational closeness and all four dimensions of social support, even after controlling for Facebook use and the mediating role of geographic distance. Results are discussed with relation to conceptualizations of tie strength and social capital as well as social support via social media.",Social Support Online,Communication and Technology

Our research shows that level of social media use is positively associated with level of perceived social adjustment but not with level of perceived social support. International students don’t feel comfortable discussing their distress via social networking sites due to complex cultural internetworking present on their social media sites. The results of this study indicate that in studying this topic we should take into account both common challenges in getting social support online and special circumstances facing international students. The current study offers scholarly and policy implications for providing relevant social, academic, and professional resources to international students in the United States—a group that has significantly grown in numbers in the past decade.",Social Support Online,Communication and Technology

Our study problematizes this concept, focuses on defining communication overload in an information and communication technology (ICT)-diverse environment, and creates a comprehensive conceptualization of communication overload that applies in everyday life. Using theory, past scale development, and insights from experts, we followed a Q-method to develop 38 statements that tapped into the construct. These were sorted by 96 undergraduate students and they also answered open-ended questions to make their sorting decisions more transparent. We identified seven factors that accounted for 70.7% of the variance in communication overload. These factors suggest that ICTs, messages, and pressures from others, impact perceptions of communication overload. This concept, as opposed to information overload, is viewed as 1) more human communication-focused 2) more taxing, and 3) less under individual control. Using these foundational assumptions, we develop seven propositions useful for extending and testing this work.",Communication Technology and Work,Communication and Technology

Based on prior research on social capital and the role of networking for career success, potential predictors of informational benefits were derived. We used four waves of a longitudinal study among Dutch internet users to explore the concurrent and longitudinal effects of passive and active usage, content of posts, network composition and strategic networking. Professional social media use resulted in higher informational benefits half a year later. Within the group of users, we found consistent concurrent associations of participating in groups, posting work-related content and strategic networking across waves. The number of strong and weak ties did not matter. Interestingly, there were no longitudinal associations of actual social media use and the network variables on professional informational benefits. The results shed light on the complex interplay of concurrent and longitudinal processes.",Communication Technology and Work,Communication and Technology

However, we know little about inequalities in outcomes of Internet use. Using data of a random sample of Dutch adult Internet users collected in 2009, we examine educational differences in making new online contacts that offer access to career-relevant social capital. Additionally, we compare these findings with data on offline career-relevant social capital, in order to assess whether the magnitude of these inequalities differs online versus offline.
Results show that higher educated Internet users are doing better in initiating career-relevant contacts on the Internet. This is partly explained by the fact that they use LinkedIn more often. Furthermore, educational differences in career-relevant contacts online and offline tend to be of similar size. The findings demonstrate that the Internet and social media do not help compensate disadvantages in access to important forms of social capital that lower educated users tend to suffer from.",Communication Technology and Work,Communication and Technology
2016-0835,2016,Paper Session,Why Should I Help You? Man Up!: Bystanders’ Gender Stereotypic Perceptions of Workplace Cyberbullying,3,"When cyberbullying occurs, the behavior of those observing the incident (bystanders) is of crucial importance. Bystanders who support the victim can prevent further attacks by the perpetrator and considerably mitigate the victim’s suffering. However, bystanders do not always intervene in favor of the victim. We argue that gender stereotypic perceptions of female vs. male victims contribute to explaining differential reactions of bystanders to cyberbullying incidents. Drawing on an online experiment, we show that participants with moderate or high levels of sexist attitudes are more empathic toward a female victim than toward a male victim. Consequently, a female victim is more likely to receive help. Additionally, female victims are less likely to be (partially) blamed for having provoked a bullying incident than male victims – but only if the perpetrator is male. The results imply that male victims of cyberbullying incidents are at risk of being marginalized by their social environment.",Communication Technology and Work,Communication and Technology

I model an approach to mapping the worldwide fact-checking landscape in terms of institutional ties to the fields of journalism, academia, and politics. I consider effects that this internationalization has had on the US fact-checking movement. And drawing on fieldwork from two international gatherings of fact-checkers, I survey competing understandings of the mission, the target, and the practices of fact-checking. As a genuinely transnational professional movement which includes practitioners from multiple journalistic cultures as well as other fields, fact-checking offers a new site to study the question of whether and how professional journalism is meaningfully becoming globalized.

In our study we develop a theoretical model which outlines relevant criteria and their impact. Our expectations are explored in three case studies which look at EU issues and involve journalists from a variety of European countries and beyond. The cases represent joint efforts of transnational investigative journalism and subsequent publication of European issues.

As theoretical basis served assumptions from entertainment theory and positive psychology. In an online survey (N = 675) a curvilinear relationship between hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment experiences was found. The second study (N = 132) was an experiment in which hedonic entertainment experiences were manipulated. Again, a curvilinear relationship between both entertainment experiences was detected. Furthermore, the entertainment experiences were associated with information processing in a meaningful pattern. These results point to the distinct relationships and effects of different entertainment experiences.

Participants then characterized the talk show as news, entertainment, or a mixture of the two. Results indicate that hosting style significantly impacted viewer assessment of media genre. Additional analyses point to the role of viewer demographics, media habits, and specific evaluations of the host in predicting whether the different talk show programs were considered news.

Within this paper, the relationship between citizens’ emotional states and their judgment of trust in politicians is investigated. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotion, this paper seeks to answer the question whether affect predicts trust judgments and which emotion plays what role. Findings of two studies, one in the context of the 2013 German national election and a media effects experiment in the context of the 2014 EU elections, supported the assumption that effects of affective states differ depending on the appraisal of the emotion. Emotions that can be characterized by other-control appraisals (anger) and no-control appraisals (happiness) do affect trust in politicians, while emotions with situational control appraisal (fear, sadness) or self-control appraisal (pride) do not have an effect.",Politicians in the News: With What Effect?,Political Communication

However, we do not know how micro level subjective perceptions of individual politicians moderate their objective behavior, meaning the level of congruence between the media agenda and their political agenda. This study is the first to examine this by using survey-interviews conducted with 32 Israeli members of parliament as well as automated content analysis of 14,457 articles and 820 speeches. The results demonstrate that politicians who feel highly overwhelmed by information are more responsive to the media coverage. However, politicians who are generalists in their activity (""Foxes"") are not affected more by media agenda than specialists (""Hedgehogs""). Lastly, against our expectation, the agenda of politicians who perceive themselves as representatives of their party is more congruent with the media, compared to the ones who emphasize citizens' views.",Politicians in the News: With What Effect?,Political Communication

This study extends this line of scholarship by focusing not merely on valence or volume but on the structural features of the overall discourse aggregated across media sources per candidate. To quantify structural properties of election news coverage, we employ semantic network analysis, NLP and sentiment-analysis. This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence suggesting specific network-level indicators of a candidate’s semantic network can account for unique variances in electoral success. Controlling for volume and tone, the clustering coefficient and power law exponent of the semantic network are found to be significant predictors of vote shares gained by candidates in four cycles of U.S. Senate elections, suggesting candidates’ success is correlated with the segregation of candidates’ semantic network.",Politicians in the News: With What Effect?,Political Communication

Thereby, well-known politicians represent the preferred targets, which are attacked both for political and personal failings. The present study contributes to research disentangling the potential entertaining and persuasive effects of political satire. By applying affective disposition theory and humor psychology, it examines the appreciation and processing of person-centered political satire, additionally considering the different focus of the typical jokes. Results of an experimental study with N = 420 participants yielded mixed patterns of effects. Affective dispositions did neither consistently affect humor appreciation nor the rejection of a humor mindset, and did not trigger different processing of political and personal jokes.

This essay explores Chinese women’s discourse of fan authenticity for European football. Conceptualizing Chinese female fans as the readers of the transnational text of European football, I conducted in-depth interviewing with 15 self-identified female fans in Shanghai, China. The analysis shows that in their discursive formations of gendered fan authenticity, these women simultaneously reproduce and contest the patriarchal dominance and female stereotypes in European football fandom. As a result, they articulate an ambiguous relation between authenticity and themselves as women. Instead of regulating feminine identity to fit into the masculinist fandom, these fans still hold up to the traditional Chinese expectations of femininity in their fan experience.

2016-0850,2016,Paper Session,Post-Mao Narratives of Individualism: A Case Study of Remixing Propaganda Posters in Contemporary China,1,"Cultural production in the Post-Mao Era has taken on new looks on the online space in China. From the perspective of visual rhetorical analysis, this paper examines several parodic works of Maoist propaganda posters in today’s China, and situates them in relation to the individualism orientation in the context of social transformation in Chinese society. Challenging the expectation that appropriation needs to resemble oppositional or antagonistic strategies of Western precedent, the study argues that online parodic works of propaganda posters constitute a cultural phenomenon that targets playfulness rather than aggression, thus reinforcing the dominating ideology they presumably seek to subvert. The study suggests that satirical works on the Chinese Internet are not monolithic and stable, but complex and multifaceted. By employing new information technologies and appealing to affect rather than rationality, this type of parodies forms a culture that remixes Mao’s cultural emblems with new characteristics of individualism in contemporary China.

Negative disclosures are one way in which companies demonstrate transparency and adhere to the UN’s Global Reporting Initiative’s disclosure guidelines for holding companies accountable. We use intercultural communication theories (individualism–collectivism, face, and low-vs.-high-context communication) to predict differences in the extent of negative disclosures, and the concreteness, and degree to which companies “own” their negative disclosures. To this end, we examine negative disclosures in 96 company CSR reports from the Global Forbes 500, coming from Confucian Asian, Germanic/Northern European, and Anglo cultural regions. On the whole, companies are not divulging negative CSR information, claiming ownership, or being concrete in their negative disclosures. Still, we found significant cultural differences in the extent of negative disclosure and ownership claimed.

However, there is inconsistent evidence regarding the relationship between a company’s CSR identity and consumer buying behavior, and research is yet to explore how consumers’ perceptions of a brand’s CSR change over time. This study explored how the salience of CSR in a brand’s image changes as the brand becomes more mainstream.

Bonding online buffers emotional distress only when victims perceive the prejudiced acts encountered as relatively less severe. Maintaining casual connections with diverse people offline also helps victims cope with racial discrimination assertively when supportive messages fail to fully validate and recognize their feelings.

The other line of studies, on the contrary, has reported that social relationship may have a positive impact on the level of life satisfaction. Few studies, however, have empirically investigated whether the associations are unidirectional or reciprocal. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reciprocal relations between social relationship and life satisfaction using longitudinal data. This study examined two different set of longitudinal data of freshmen students during their first semester at the college. The author explored causal sequences between social relationship and life satisfaction with the autoregressive cross-lagged modeling and the synchronous effects modeling. The results showed that there was a statistically significant effect between life satisfaction at one time and social relationship at the next time. It implied that life satisfaction could account for individuals’ social relationship.",Who We Are is How We Talk: Predicting Interpersonal Communication Processes,Interpersonal Communication
2016-0861,2016,Paper Session,Predicting the Intent to Use Dating Apps to Look for Romance and Sex: Using the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction,1,"This study used the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IMBP) to predict the intent to use dating apps to look for romance and casual sex. The IMBP states that any behavioral intent is directly determined by the attitude toward, perceived norm, and self-efficacy of carrying out the behavior, and indirectly determined by some background variables. Two models—Romance and Casual Sex—were tested with structural equation modeling (N = 379). Results were generally consistent with the IMBP, except no relationship was found between the perceived norm and intent in the Sex model. Some background variables were also found to have a direct effect on the intent. In short, the IMBP is useful in analyzing the uses of dating apps.",Who We Are is How We Talk: Predicting Interpersonal Communication Processes,Interpersonal Communication
2016-0862,2016,Paper Session,Relationship Characteristics That Predict Relationship Talk and Topic Avoidance for Same-Sex and Opposite-Sex Couples,1,"This study employs the Relational Turbulence Model to explore associations among intimacy, relational uncertainty, and partner interference, as well as to identity characteristics of romantic relationships that predict relationship talk and topic avoidance in both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships. I surveyed 100 college-aged individuals who are currently involved in opposite-sex (N = 51) and same-sex relationships (N = 49). For both groups, intimacy was negatively associated with relational uncertainty and curvilinearly associated with interference from partners. Relational uncertainty and partner interference were both positively correlated with the perceived threat of relationship talk and topic avoidance, which were also negatively associated. In addition, only self and partner uncertainty, as well as the perceived threat of relationship talk, were negatively associated with enacted relationship talk. Although the majority of these variables and associations were statistically invariant for opposite-sex and same-sex relationships, some notable differences were found and discussed.",Who We Are is How We Talk: Predicting Interpersonal Communication Processes,Interpersonal Communication

Most of the research involving ITAs investigates their presence in the classroom from the perspective of the American undergraduate or for determining the necessary training modules and/or oral proficiency tests before their assignment as teachers. This exploratory qualitative study surveys the experiences of 22 female ITAs, from across the U.S., employing Leximancer as an analytic tool to consider their perceptions of teaching in America.

2016-0864,2016,Paper Session,The Challenged Researcher? Ceremonial and Substantial Meanings of “Perceived and Articulated Cultural Otherness” in Academic Interview Situations,1,"Researchers increasingly investigate topics in diverse cultural contexts (Jentsch, 2004; Livingstone, 2007). This paper discusses whether and how this “own cultural otherness” of the researcher plays a role in academic interview situations. Qualitative interviews are a frequently used method in media and communication research. It will be shown, how not being educated, socialized and cultivated within the fieldwork context - the own cultural otherness - can reflect throughout the interview situation. The analysis draws from encounters between the European author and 118 interviewees from South American countries in 2007, 2010 and between 2013 and 2014. Leaning on Goffman´s theory of interaction under conditions of otherness, the role cultural otherness of a researcher can assume in the interview situation is reconstructed systematically. The qualitative content analysis of the material suggests that cultural otherness plays an important role in academic interview situations and therefore merits being the subject of methodological considerations.","Cultural Adaptation, Developmental Communication, and Community",Intercultural Communication
2016-0865,2016,Paper Session,Covenant: Binding Participation in Development Projects Through Indigenous Communication,1,"Development projects have been implemented Indigenous Cultural Communities (ICCs). These ICCs have unique socio-cultural contexts with Indigenous Knowledge, Skills and Practices (IKSPs) and Indigenous Forest Management Systems and Practices (IFMSPs).

This qualitative study looked into the communication approaches used by the Second Cordillera Highland Resource Management Project in the implementation of its development projects. It tried to understand the interplay of Indigenous Communication and Convergence Communication to elicit participation.

Through Key Informant interviews and Participant Observation, the following were generated: (1) Development Projects may have activities that would use Indigenous Communication and Covenants if the implementers belong to ICCs; (2) Motivations of project implementers in using Indigenous Communication and covenants are based on the imbibed values and indigenous culture they acquired from their ICCs; and (3) ICCs and participants will highly participate in development projects and their level of project ownership is strengthened when Indigenous Communication and covenants are used.","Cultural Adaptation, Developmental Communication, and Community",Intercultural Communication
2016-0866,2016,Paper Session,Cultural Adaptability on Sojourners’ Mental Model Change and Psychological Adjustment,2,"This study examined cultural adaptability as a predictor of sojourners’ psychological adjustment. A dynamic constructivist approach to cultural adaptation was employed to examine sojourners’ mental model change as a result of staying in the host culture. Participants were 126 sojourning Chinese in the U.S. Data were collected shortly after the Chinese sojourners arrived in the U.S. and again three months later. A measure of mental model change was generated by comparing each Chinese sojourner’s mental model at Time 1 with their mental model at Time 2. Results showed that cultural adaptability was positively associated with sojourners’ psychological adjustment. In addition, culturally adaptable individuals tend to change their mental models regarding their adaptation experience faster compared with less adaptable individuals. However, such mental model change had no significant effect on sojourners’ psychological adjustment. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.","Cultural Adaptation, Developmental Communication, and Community",Intercultural Communication
2016-0867,2016,Paper Session,Storytelling the Santo Niño Ati-Atihan Festival in the Philippines: A Communication Infrastructure Approach and Implications on Sustainable Festival Tourism,1,"Guided by ‘communication infrastructure theory’ this work addresses how local arts and culture organizations, local Catholic church, and local government assign meanings to the increasingly popular Santo Niño Ati-Atihan Festival in the town of Kalibo, Philippines. Because of the increasing concern that small town festivals in developing nations are becoming commoditized in the age of global tourism, studies are needed that link local meanings of the festivals with more sustainable practices of festival tourism. Through semi-structured interviews with the organizations and participant observation fieldwork during two consecutive festivals, the study reveals that the meanings ascribed to the festival are interdependently linked around key themes of religion, dance, and tourism. These local findings are further discussed within the context of how these observations can inform sustainable festival practices that value local community traditions of sustaining community within the increased intensity to turn the festival into a global tourism hot spot.","Cultural Adaptation, Developmental Communication, and Community",Intercultural Communication

We focus on one case, alongside comparison to a series of other cases, to examine how gender is made relevant to courses of action. We identify a number of uses to which gender invocations are put in these sorts of occasions, particularly with regard to the accountability of categorical expectations. We show how gender is an accountable category with regard to its association with cleaning activities, and therefore how gender categories provide a resource by which participants can solicit and resist participation in cleaning. Participants therefore use categorical associations, or stereotypes, in local practices for practical purposes. Our analysis provides some insight into why participants use stereotypes in everyday talk and what functions such talk serves.",Identity Matters in Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction

We conducted an experiment manipulating identity salience using gender-stereotypic conversation topics, and typicality, using biographies of the fictitious interlocutor. The results were consistent with previous research on gender-based language use: Men were more tentative when discussing a conversation topic in which their gender group was not considered experts. Moreover, interlocutor gender typicality influenced participants’ tentative language, such that when the interlocutor was a typical woman, men and women became more tentative discussing a conversation topic in which they were not considered experts. This study has implications for future research on gender-based language use in terms of the joint effect of interlocutor typicality and other contextual factors, including conversation topics.",Identity Matters in Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction

This paper examines 30 TV shows, music videos, commercials, 23 news articles, and 17 blog or website entries. The analysis shows the heteronormative script is dominant in how LGBTQ issues are framed in Taiwan; each family member’s role and expectation is structured by heteronormativity. Homonormative script is also dominant, which favored a heterosexual-like relationship over other types of relationship. Finally, I argue that compulsory marriage is the underlying force for both heteronormative script and homonormative script. Compulsory marriage dictates marriage to be the single most important achievement to make in life, and individuals are judged by their likelihood to enter a heterosexual, monogamous marriage.",Identity Matters in Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction
2016-0872,2016,Paper Session,From “Super-Parent” to “Super-Predator”: The Power of Language in Juvenile Justice,1,"Judicial decisions, particularly those of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), frequently garner widespread attention by the time an outcome has been reached and disseminated to the public. However, since the outcome of the case is what grabs the attention, consideration of the specific language used in those judicial opinions is far less common. Such neglect is dangerous because the language choices of justices are extremely powerful in the way they shape public opinion. This project will examine whether the rhetorical categorizations of juvenile offenders used in news media impact the rhetorical categorizations of juvenile offenders used by SCOTUS justices and, by extension, the potentially dangerous effects this has on juvenile justice in the United States.",Identity Matters in Social Interaction,Language & Social Interaction

We argue that this perspective will be helpful in exploring the nuances, mechanisms, drivers and complexities of the role of online communication platforms in new, contemporary forms of civic mobilisation and activism. We present this social capital research perspective through a ‘two-level social capital analysis’ framework, the applicability and value of which we test in the study of the role of Facebook in Taiwan’s Sunflower Movement. Initial findings from this case study lead us to the conclusion that the proposed ‘two-level social capital analysis’ framework enables deep and nuanced analysis of the role of online communication platforms, such as social media, in instances of civic activism and mobilisation. At the same time, we acknowledge the need for further testing of the ‘two-level social capital analysis’ framework while noting the lessons for future research.",Collective Action in the Digital Era,Political Communication

It seeks to determine the rationale behind the organizations’ filtering behavior and to designate the tactics that the various organizations use to identify candidates who manifest specific desired attributes. By bringing filtering practices to the forefront, the suggested framework goes beyond one of the limitations of current research: The assumption that in the digital era, in which affordable Internet-based tools are readily available, organizations tolerate various types of participatory activities and concomitantly cut back filtering endeavors. Since an increasing number of social movement organizations, parties, and firms adopt online tools, the offered framework could be applied to organizations operating in other arenas.",Collective Action in the Digital Era,Political Communication

Legacy groups are adapting the trend of open-source and grassroots to create their own “online based” movements. Claiming to be the “largest grassroots environmental event in history,” Earth Hour is World Wildlife Fund’s mass engagement platform for climate change. We ask, what is the organizational infrastructure of a hybrid organization like WWF/Earth Hour? How does the strategy of the Earth Hour campaign drive their digital media tactics? We explore these themes through a case study, drawing on interview data and analysis of Twitter content and network analysis of the information flow within. The research reveals that Earth Hour is successful at mobilizing people and making the movement international, while the operational infrastructure behind is still based on WWF’s traditional hierarchy national office mechanism.",Collective Action in the Digital Era,Political Communication

Data came from the Asian Barometer Survey, which conducted cross-national surveys in eight Asian countries during the two waves of data collection: 2005–07 and 2010–11. The results of this cross-national analysis with longitudinal comparisons show that Internet use has a positive relationship with participation in the emerging but unconventional forms of political action. Furthermore, the relationship is augmented among those who lack opportunities for political discussion and social interaction. In this study, I find that the “Asian Internet” has a democratic impact that mobilizes political communication systems that are marginalized by tradition.",Collective Action in the Digital Era,Political Communication
2016-0877,2016,Paper Session,Old Concept With New Power: Why Digital and Unconventional Activities Can be Political Participation,3,"Digitally networked activities and unconventional actions on a community level increase citizens’ repertoire of participation. Political communication research, however, is having a hard time to consistently integrate such activities into the concept of political participation. Our study empirically tests how activities like crowdfunding or urban gardening can be combined with more traditional forms of participation. We use 34 participatory activities from a national survey conducted in Denmark (N=9125) and apply a suggested framework of political participation by van Deth (2014) to this selection. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates the existence of four distinct types of political participation. We show that activities formerly described as civic engagement (Zukin et al., 2006; Norris, 2002) can be re-integrated into the concept of political participation and confirm that digitally networked activities rather than being an unidimentional construct are an integral part of most types of political participation.",Collective Action in the Digital Era,Political Communication

The current two-wave study among 1.597 10 to 14 year olds (Mage = 11.07, SD = 1.07) aimed to delineate factors that contribute to the endorsement of such beliefs. Results showed that tweens discussed appearance-related topics with their friends more often when they frequently watched tween television programs (all time 1). Both media exposure and peer conversations (time 1) were related to the perception that attractiveness is beneficial (time 1) which, in turn, predicted the internalization of appearance ideals (time 1).

We proposed an integrative model to examine whether (a) pre-adolescents’ reliance on and internalization of media appearance ideals could be explained by pubertal timing and peer appearance criticism, and (b) such media internalization and informational reliance could foster pre-adolescents’ dysfunctional body image investment. Structural equation analyses showed that early maturation relative to peers positively predicted pre-adolescents’ informational reliance on and internalization of media appearance ideals, directly and indirectly via peer appearance criticism. Such media use, in turn, positively predicted pre-adolescents’ development of dysfunctional appearance beliefs. The endorsement of dysfunctional appearance beliefs positively predicted higher levels of body surveillance.

The current cross-sectional study among 1349 early adolescent boys and girls (Mage = 11.08; SD = 1.08) examined whether total amount of television and magazine exposure is related to the endorsement of dysfunctional appearance beliefs. In addition, the study examined an explanatory mechanism involving the internalization of appearance ideals and appearance-related expectations of opposite-sex peers. The results show that media exposure is related to early adolescents’ internalization of appearance ideals which, in turn, predicted the endorsement of dysfunctional appearance beliefs directly and indirectly through appearance-related expectations of opposite-sex peers. This study therefore provides evidence for the explanatory value of both mechanisms in the relationship between amount of television and magazine exposure and the endorsement of dysfunctional appearance beliefs.",Self-Presentation and Appearance Issues of Youth in Media,Children Adolescents and the Media

Using a sample of thirty episodes from ten animated cartoons, this content analysis coded characters for demographic information, physical attributes, and several personality traits. Results from the present study found that males continue to outnumber females in children’s animated television nearly two to one. Female characters were also rated as skinnier and more beautiful by coders, and were more likely to be rated as good, kind, and peaceful than were male characters.

However, longitudinal research on the relationships between (sexy) online self-presentation and adolescents’ gender role orientations is lacking. The present study investigated whether stereotypical gender role orientations (i.e., hypermasculinity for boys, hyperfemininity for girls) predispose adolescents to engage in sexy self-presentation, or to look at others’ sexy self-presentations, on social media. In addition, we investigated whether engaging in sexy self-presentation and looking at others’ sexy self-presentation increased hypergender orientations over time. Using a three-wave longitudinal panel survey among 1,467 Dutch adolescents, the present study found that adolescents’ hypergender orientations predicted more frequent sexy self-presentation and exposure to others’ sexy self-presentations on social media six months later. However, hypergender orientations were not predicted by these online behaviors.

2016-0886,2016,Paper Session,Attempts to Bridge the Gap Between Authority of Expertise and Authority of Position,1,"Many contemporary organizations rely on a horizontal organization where local experts acquire authority. Despite this, the overall model appears to be the bureaucratic model where authority is distributed vertically and authority of position and expertise is considered to coincide. These two contradictory models can coexist because the relationship between authority of position and authority of expertise is loosely coupled. However, the contradiction may result in a gap between managers and subordinates as subordinates lose trust in managers if decisions are not based on expertise. Organizations commence to acknowledge this gap and consequently aim to bridge it. In this paper we explore how organizations initiate communicative practices in order to negotiate authority among organizational members. The results point to the importance of providing communicative tools that assist members to reach coorientation in their interactions. As a result the negotiation and sharing of authority seems to be more prone to take place.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 2),Organizational Communication

To facilitate efficient communication and decision making, multidisciplinary oncology team (MDT) meetings have been introduced. Decision making for older (≥ 70 years) cancer patients is particularly complex, as they are a heterogeneous group and are therefore often excluded from clinical trials. Hence, the results of clinical trials are not always representative for older patients. The aim of this study is to investigate how treatment decisions for older cancer patients are made during MDT meetings. Although it is frequently argued that individual patient characteristics and arguments should be used in the decision making process for older patients, this study shows that these arguments are typically not included in the decision making process during MDT meetings. Instead specialists still use results of clinical trials that are not always reliable for older patients.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 2),Organizational Communication

This process is known as translation and requires that researchers work closely and communicate with practitioners to improve the state of health and healthcare in the United States. The public health community has lacked a template at all levels of stakeholders for optimizing the rapid and effective conversion of research into practice. A recently accepted and deeply troubling estimate is that it takes 17 years to translate 14% of original research into practice (Balas & Boren, 2000).

These mixed findings might be explained by conditional factors. For example, CMU may not actually result in a comparable increase of demands for every personality. In this study, we systematically study the role of personality on the effects of CMU and its demands, by means of an online questionnaire (N=663). This study supports the proposition that CMU comes with several related demands that strain employee well-being. In addition, this is the first study to show the influence of personality in a context of CMU. Except for neuroticism, all personality dimensions were found to mitigate an indirect relationship between CMU and one of its demands.

2016-0897,2016,Paper Session,Building Microcredit as an International Cause: Representations and Symbolic Power,1,"The engagement of an idea of microcredit into the controversial communicational journey of being regarded as a universal (unanimous and across countries) cause bears testament to the power stakes arisen by the discourses and representations used to foster a consensus on a social and political ideal supported by organizations with an agenda.
The microcredit summit campaign (the Campaign), a network of over 2000 heterogeneous actors, was endeavored to promote a way forward – the “pathways out of poverty” – to eradicate poverty.
As a matter of fact, the semiotic and narrative analysis of the portraits used by The Campaign reveal the universal-oriented picture of poverty they draw and the paradoxal statuses of suffering they bear. It sheds light on a symbolic role that exceeds the strategic one assigned to them by the rhetoric stakes carried by the microfinance discussion, triggering anew the persistent debate about the deserving and non-deserving poor.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 2),Organizational Communication
2016-0898,2016,Paper Session,Structural Balance and Trust in Multiteam Systems,1,"Trust is a fundamental driving force for performance of organizations and teams. Specifically in the setting of multi-team systems (MTS), in which individuals not only have to coordinate with their own team members but also those of other teams, collaborative efforts are crucial for high performance. The study proposes that balance is a useful mechanism to explore trust at multiple levels of MTS that extends beyond dyads. Balanced state in the context of MTS may resemble high and stable trust, while an unbalanced state may indicate low trust and high tension among members. I conduct a case study of 33 multi-team systems navigating a virtual military zone. From analysis of sociograms, selective coding of gameplay videos, and survey outcomes, I found 3 balancing types: (1) Low to High balance, (2) No change-balanced throughout, and (3) No change-unbalanced throughout. Evidence suggests that teams of balance type 2 have highest performance scores.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 2),Organizational Communication

2016-0900,2016,Paper Session,Communication and Corporate Culture in the Postindustrial Society. From the Fordist Factory to the Living Organization,2,"At the end of the twentieth century Charles Perrow had predicted that the importance of organizations would surpass economic or salary dependence. At present, companies and institutions position themselves as actors that go beyond the production of goods and services, as organizations that impact on society through their communication and culture.

The results of our research ""The Axis of Organizational Culture of Corporations and Institutions of the XXI Century"" (2011) allowed the validation of what Hernandez and Cendejas (2006) considered the new corporate values. From an exploratory and descriptive case study, we found that values such as innovation, organizational learning, knowledge management and social responsibility overlap as the guides that outline the organizational behavior and culture in two Mexican companies.

The discussions on this research were directed to new approaches. They allowed us to think about the new power relationships that constitute postmodern organizations from a critical perspective. How the new corporate values are restored and restoring the organizational practice? What kind of communication do organizations make use to make them effective? What is the effectiveness of the different forms of communication in the corporate culture but in the subject itself?

The approach and observations presented in this paper are based on a critical review of our exploratory work but also in new bibliography that allows us to analyze the post-industrial corporation as «a field of structured and structuring structures» that mediate in the social life and the construction of subjectivities, a space where communication has become a device by which new collective and individual strategies are unfold.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 2),Organizational Communication

2016-0902,2016,Paper Session,Why Drop a Paywall? Mapping Decommodifications of Online News,2,"News has always had a dual existence as a commercial product made by organizations following market forces, and a public good essential to democratic communication. In the context of the networked press, online news is frequently commodified behind paywalls that give access only to paid subscribers. At times, though, these paywalls are dropped, reconfigured, or otherwise altered to make news circulate freely without payment. Analyzing a year’s worth of trade press and organizational self-accounts of such drops, we identify the “paywall exception” as a moment when news that is usually commodified behaves like a public good. We identify six motivations for such exceptions—public emergencies, planned special events, universal access, advertising and promotion, audience development, and experimentation—and reflect upon their significance to the study of institutional news, the sociotechnical dynamics of journalistic infrastructures, and normative arguments for treating online news as a public good.","The Many Faces of ""Commercialization""",Journalism Studies

Since readership is the foundation for subscription and advertising revenue, this study, through a longitudinal analysis of readership data (2007, 2011, and 2015) of 51 U.S. newspapers, provides an up-to-date review on these newspapers’ online and print readership. Results indicated that the (supposedly dying) print product still reaches far more readers than the (supposedly promising) digital product in their home market. In addition, these major newspapers’ online readership has shown little or no growth during the past eight years. And the online edition contributes a relatively small number of online-only users to the overall combined readership in these newspapers’ home markets. These findings challenge U.S. newspapers’ technology-driven strategy and call for a critical re-examination of unchecked assumptions about the future of newspapers.","The Many Faces of ""Commercialization""",Journalism Studies
2016-0904,2016,Paper Session,Native Advertising in Digital Journalism: An Explorative Study of the Blurring Boundaries Between Editorial and Commercial Content,1,"This paper examines the increasing trend of adopting native advertising in the digital editions of traditional news media outlets. Native advertising is defined here as a form of paid media where the commercial content is delivered within the design and form of editorial content, with the attempt to recreate the user experience of reading news instead of advertising content. Methodologically, this study looks at news websites of 12 legacy newspapers from Sweden, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S., and analyses the adoption of native advertising during the span of January 2015. Subsequently, these advertisements are analyzed in terms of type, form, function, integration, measurement, disclosure, and authorship. The results show that while the degree of implementation is still modest, the way in which is implemented is uneven across countries.","The Many Faces of ""Commercialization""",Journalism Studies

Combining content analysis of nearly 5,000 articles and transcripts from 13 news organizations with 41 in depth interviews conducted with prominent political journalists and survey practitioners, I argue that shifting news norms and methodological disagreement among pollsters are resulting in considerable pressures on editorial standards. I show that sponsored survey results are especially common with respect to the types of ""public journalism"" proponents of polling deem normatively important to democracy. I contend that such results may become more commonplace as news organizations cut back on their own sponsored polls and that gatekeeping for opinion data reliability appears increasingly untenable in a competitive digital media environment.","The Many Faces of ""Commercialization""",Journalism Studies

2016-0907,2016,Paper Session,College Males’ Perceptions of Benefits and Barriers to the HPV Vaccine,3,"College males represent an important and overlooked catch-up population in the pursuit of HPV prevention. An in-depth understanding of college males’ health beliefs about HPV and HPV prevention can guide the development of health promotion messages targeted toward college males to increase HPV vaccination. This study convened 9 focus groups among 84 college males to discuss their perceptions of benefits and barriers toward HPV prevention 4-years post-vaccine licensure. Findings revealed both enduring and novel barriers and benefits. One novel barrier that emerged was the perception that it was too late for college males to benefit from the vaccine. Although other barriers were equally nuanced for this population, they were also largely consistent with earlier HPV work and included lack of knowledge/awareness, apathy, dismissiveness, stigma, practical barriers, and skepticism. One novel benefit that emerged within this population was a perception of wider social benefit beyond the self and partner. Other benefits included a reduction of worry and anticipated regret, a perception that “there is no reason not to,” and distinct prevention and protection benefits. Implications of these findings for enhanced vaccine promotion among this group are offered.","Vaccine Communication: Childhood, Flu, HPV",Health Communication

Based on inoculation theory and tone of voice, the current study used a 2 (message content: inoculation vs. supportive) × 2 (tone of voice: human voice vs. organizational voice) mixed experimental design. A total of 231 parents who have teenage children were recruited through Amazon Turk.
Overall, people who were exposed to inoculation messages were more likely to have a positive attitude toward HPV vaccination, a higher intention to vaccinate their children, and a higher intention to share the content with others. In addition, using human voice was effective to increase intention to word of mouth and an interaction effects was found.","Vaccine Communication: Childhood, Flu, HPV",Health Communication
2016-0909,2016,Paper Session,The Silver Lining of Shame: Framing HPV to Influence Disclosure and Vaccination,2,"College students suffer disproportionately from HPV, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that could result in genital warts or cancers in both males and females. Research contends that stigma and shame may serve as barriers to disclosure intentions, as well as vaccination intentions. The goal of this study was to examine whether two framing strategies – whether to mention that HPV is sexually transmitted and whether to highlight the cause of infection as internal or external – would influence young adults’ intentions to disclose a potential diagnosis and their intentions to get the HPV vaccine. Results indicate that STI-framing and gender had consistent impacts on disclosure and vaccination intentions. Further, causal attribution framing also influenced participants’ intention to get the vaccine at no cost immediately and their intention to get the vaccine at the retail price of $375 in the future. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Vaccine Communication: Childhood, Flu, HPV",Health Communication
2016-0910,2016,Paper Session,Effects of Health Information Inoculation Against Misperceptions About Flu,2,"This study applied the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) and inoculation theory in order to explore perceptions of flu and the flu vaccination. This study examined how risk campaigns can inoculate people against attacks to preexisting beliefs with a two (Message framing: heuristic information message vs. systematic information message) by two (expert source vs. non-expert source) online experiment. The experiment was conducted in two phases right before the flu season. Although this study found mixed results of inoculation effects, the heuristic inoculation message from an expert source generated higher resistance against the attack message. Risk perception of flu and the flu vaccination and intention to get the flu vaccination did not change after received the attack message, whereas benefit perception of the flu vaccination slightly decreased. This study suggests that controlling the fear of vaccinations could affect the intention to get the flu vaccination.","Vaccine Communication: Childhood, Flu, HPV",Health Communication

Results show incivility had a limited effect on unspiraling the silence. People were most likely to express their opinion on the safety of childhood vaccines when in a friendly opinion climate and exposed to civil comments, confirming the SOS. But those in the hostile condition who were exposed to uncivil comments were more likely to speak out than those exposed to civil comments in the hostile condition or uncivil comments in the friendly condition. This suggests incivility triggered an emotional response that may diminish the societal norm to keep mum when people hold a non-majority view.","Vaccine Communication: Childhood, Flu, HPV",Health Communication

(Research question, RQ1); and, (b) How do CAM practitioners connect holistic health within their modality in order to communicatively constitute expertise as health providers? (RQ2). Frame analysis reveals CAM practitioners constructed holistic health as (a) compositional, (b) contextual, and (c) cartographical (RQ1). Practitioners framed holistic health within their modality in order to construct their expertise through (a) privileging the self, (b) presenting the body, (c) focusing on the whole through bridging and regenerating, and (d) drawing on replicability and objectivity (RQ2). Taking expertise as socially constructed, by reducing uncertainty through proof offered by self—practitioner’s transformative life experiences, the frames categorized a knowledge framework that naturalized sensory, connected, and integrative worldviews, and reduced uncertainty through proof offered by the body within that knowledge paradigm.","Holistic, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine and Therapies",Health Communication

As one force in shaping cultural beliefs about women and birthing, this study seeks to understand how news stories characterize alternative birthing options and the women who use them. Covered by public and many health insurances, midwives and doulas provide women with a safe birth option yet their practices are little-known to the public. Using framing as the primary theoretical basis, we evaluated 195 newspaper articles published United States over the past 30 years to examine how women are portrayed as midwives, doulas, and patients. Results show the predominant article theme was the choice of a woman to use midwives and doulas, although representations of doulas and midwives differed. Political implications for a de-emphasis on midwives, shaping public awareness, and giving power to women about birth choices are discussed.","Holistic, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine and Therapies",Health Communication
2016-0914,2016,Paper Session,"Medicine, Culture, or Myth? Analyzing News Coverage of Chinese Medicine in Chinese Print Media",1,"Using the framing approach, the study examined media coverage of Chinese Medicine (CM) in conventional Chinese press. A content analysis was conducted with news stories collected from newspapers published in urban areas of China within the past five years. The content analysis examined how CM was framed as a medical practice and how its cultural elements were reflected in news stories. Major findings from the content analysis include: 1) in general, news stories presented a supportive or neutral attitude towards the use and development of CM; 2) major problems and controversies were covered by a small portion of the stories, and the problems were framed to be less significant than the benefits brought by CM; 3) CM myths were frequently quoted in news stories introducing CM approaches. The findings demonstrate the feature of current media discourse framing CM, which is rooted in the broad social and cultural context of contemporary China. Overall, conventional news stories enhanced the myths about CM and emphasized the cultural values of CM, but they rarely discussed the benefits and risks of CM from the contemporary medical perspective. This kind of depictions blurred the boundary between medicine and culture, which can be misleading to the audience.","Holistic, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine and Therapies",Health Communication

This study explored the roles of privately hired doulas serving women in the St. Louis metropolitan area, and their influence on patient-provider interactions before, during, and after childbirth, within the framework of patient-centered communication. In-depth interviews with six doulas offering support to childbearing women giving birth at hospitals were conducted, and the findings suggest that doulas believe they enhance communication between patients and their providers, by taking on the roles of advocates and liaisons. Aspects of the training and scope of practice of participant doulas, the type of clients seeking their services and their motivations, as well as common misconceptions and challenges arising when communicating with clients and providers, were also discussed.

Guided by agenda setting theory and the health belief model, this paper presented a quantitative content analysis of all pins about skin cancer (n=753) on Pinterest. Overall, sun and tanning beds were described as the most prominent causes of skin cancer and alternative therapies such as herbal medicine were discussed more than traditional biomedical treatment or prevention. Furthermore, pins about non-melanoma skin cancer (such as squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinoma) were found to be especially information-poor, and were less likely to include information on the causes, prevention, and the biomedical treatment of skin cancer and were less likely to include health belief constructs associated with the promotion of health behaviors.","Holistic, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine and Therapies",Health Communication
2016-0917,2016,Paper Session,Developing and Testing the Facebook Usage Questionnaire (FUQ) and the Perceived Facebook Usage Questionnaire (P-FUQ),2,"A lot of research has dealt with motivations to use social networking sites (SNS). However, there is little methodological research on how to properly measure active use and how that use is perceived by other users. For our explorative studies, we developed and tested two instruments: (1) The Facebook Usage Questionnaire (FUQ) and the Perceived Facebook Usage Questionnaire (P-FUQ). To test the validity of the instruments, we investigated whether the FUQ is able to detect age and gender differences in Facebook usage and whether the P-FUQ is associated with the perception of credibility, sociability, and narcissism. Our findings suggest that the FUQ captures 3 different dimensions of Facebook usage: social interaction, personal, and professional posting. Age was positively correlated with social interaction and personal posting, whereas gender was only positively related to social interaction.

2016-0918,2016,Paper Session,Studying Communication Networks by Merging Mobile Log and Self-Report Data: Enhancing the Name Generator Approach,2,"Recently, the issue of self-report bias has drawn the attention of scholars who study mediated communication. As a number of studies have demonstrated data validity with self-reported measures of mediated communication, the use of logged communication data has become an increasingly attractive option. Although log data can more accurately track communication behaviours, they cannot capture many relational aspects of the communication behaviours. These relational aspects include feelings of closeness, the general content of interactions, and the social role of ties with whom individuals have logged interactions. In this paper we will explore a new technique that has been developed to fill out logged mobile communication data with on-screen survey questions that have been adapted from the name generator instrument popularized by Marsden (1987). We will also discuss how this approach helps to enhance the validity of the name generator instrument by drawing on logged mobile data to decrease the cognitive burden typically associated with the name generator approach.",New Methods in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

The indicators were derived or adapted from ITU 2014 cyber wellness profile for each country, DTTC’s white paper to the industry on Cyber risk- a global systemic threat, and the Cyber readiness index. The final CRPI score is a simple average of the five composing sub index scores, while each sub index’s score is a simple average of those of the composing indicators. In doing this, we assume that all Index sub-indexes give a similar contribution to a national cyber resilience preparedness. The findings indicate that six countries (Sudan, Ghana, Libya, Zimbabwe, Algeria, and Angola) are more at risk than cyber spirited or resilient to compromise of critical systems. However, Egypt tops the chart among the six countries (Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia, Morocco and South Africa) that are cyber spirited i.e. preparing against the risk of compromise of critical systems, industries, classified documents and industrial espionage.

In this paper, we examine a not yet commercially available form of interactivity – haptic (or tactile) feedback – as a way of understanding how new interactive features shape parent-child reading interactions. Using data collected from a between-subjects experiment (N = 18 dyads), analyses reveal that dyads reading a haptic e-book talked more about the technology compared to those in the control condition, but this additional talk was not at the expense of story-related talk. Parents in the haptic condition used the tactile feedback to discuss the narrative, while parents in the control condition engaged in higher rates of expressive behavior (e.g., making sounds and gestures) as a way of elaborating the story narrative and engaging their child. We discuss the implications of haptic feedback as a new form of interactivity.",Technology Use Within the Family and Across the Lifespan,Communication and Technology
2016-0922,2016,Paper Session,Between Association and Dissociation: How Parents Influence Media Innovativeness at Later Life Stages,3,"The present article deals with parents’ influence on media innovativeness at later life stages. In line with existing research, we argue that the adoption of media innovations depends on a domain-specific inherent media innovativeness which we conceptualize as the willingness to spend time and money on media innovations. We discuss how this trait might be influenced by parental media education and parents’ own media innovativeness which could serve as a model. Resulting assumptions are tested in a telephone survey (n = 434). Results show that individuals who have perceived their parents as innovative media users have a higher media innovativeness themselves. Parental restrictions of media use also increase innovativeness, but only in terms of money spent on media innovations. Moreover, the effect of parental restrictions is a conditional one. It only occurs when parents were not perceived innovative. The model of parents’ media innovativeness outshines the effects of media education.",Technology Use Within the Family and Across the Lifespan,Communication and Technology

Moreover, we aim to explore possible factors that predict parents’ child-related SNS use to stay in contact with children living outside the parental home, with a special focus on the reduced parenting role. Results showed that child-related SNS use increased in the period when the child was leaving the family home. Over the subsequent two years, SNS contact gradually decreased to eventually reach a level similar to that of six months before the child's launch.

Results were analyzed by age and generation. In addition, a distinction was drawn between media multitasking that included communication monitoring (checking, following, or creating messages via text, email, or social media to stay in contact with one’s social circle) and traditional media multitasking. Although older people multitasked less than younger ones, it appears this was driven less by age itself, and more by lifestyle factors such as having children and careers. Boomers also tended to engage in communication monitoring less frequently than Gen Xers or Millennials, and to report being less uncomfortable with being unable to engage in such behavior. All age groups engaged in strategies to manage their multitasking, although what these are varied, most likely as a function of the demands their lifestyle places on them. Future research on how media are used and processed should strive to account for these strategic adjustments, particularly as they vary by age group.",Technology Use Within the Family and Across the Lifespan,Communication and Technology

Data were gathered from a probability sample of 509 information workers who were not self-employed. The results showed that the more that people used ICT to do their work at home, the greater they perceived the flexibility and permeability of work/family borders. Interestingly, low flexibility and high permeability, rather than the use of ICT at home, had much stronger influences on increasing work-family conflict. As expected, work-to-family conflict was significantly and positively associated with techno-overload and techno-invasion. The results showed that techno-overload was mainly caused by work-to-family conflict, high permeability in the home domain, low flexibility at work, and low permeability in the work domain. Results also showed that the telecommuters tended to be older, had lower family incomes, used ICT frequently at home, and had a permeable boundary that allowed work to penetrate their home domain.

Studies that focused on journalists who covered natural disasters have identified their experiences as either journalists trying to balance their norms or as victims dealing with trauma. Our analysis brings these experiences together for a more holistic description of the experience of covering a natural disaster, arguing that one aspect of the experience cannot be understood without the other.

These themes resounded in media coverage of Haiti’s 2010 cholera outbreak, despite the fact that United Nation peacekeepers introduced the disease to the country (Katz, 2013; Polyné, 2012). Such failings of Global North media in covering Global South issues provides important opportunities for citizen journalism to serve as a democratizing agent, elevating the voices of those otherwise silenced by traditional media (Allen & Thorsen, 2009; Murthy, 2013).

Drawing on a critical discourse analysis of the Belgian news reporting on a bus crash in 2012, the paper reveals a twofold articulation of this social role. The first consisted in newspapers highlighting the emotional dimension of the accident with potential societal implications of raising compassion and identification. Second, we found a strong articulation of a discourse of (national) unity and community, aimed at restoring the disrupted social order in the aftermath of what was viewed as a national disaster. Both aspects were discursively established by a dominant presence of emotional testimonies, strategies of personalization and by the use of inclusive language permeated with references to nation or community.",Reporting on Disaster and Conflict,Journalism Studies
2016-0929,2016,Paper Session,Evolving Alignments: A Longitudinal Comparative Study of Intermedia Similarity and Diversity in the Coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,2,"Covering the same issues, news accounts in different media are simultaneously similar and diverse: On the one hand, they report on the same facts, cite similar sources, and apply conventionalized news routines to present professional accounts. On the other hand, they procure diverse information, highlight different aspects and perspectives and relate events to different news audiences. In this paper, we assess how similarly eight opinion-leading Israeli, Palestinian, and international media cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Analyzing recurrent patterns in the associations among concepts raised in over 200.000 news texts published over almost ten years, we trace the varying, evolving alignments in the news coverage of the respective media. We find a slow convergence trend regarding all outlets' selections of facts and events, while alignments and disalignments in interpretation remain temporary and evolve in response to major conflict events. Discussing the observed diachronic patterns, we point at interacting pressures shaping the news.",Reporting on Disaster and Conflict,Journalism Studies

I contextualize these artistic and technological vanguards against historical, political, and economic conditions that allow them to build an “anthropophagic” network of Brazilian innovation. I examine discursive legacies from preceding cultural economies: the Neoconcretismo and Tropicalia movements in the 1960s-1970s coinciding with the mass introduction of computers, and the Internet-based technocratic elite of the 1990s-2000s under Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil. A renown Tropicalia musician, Gil vowed to “‘transform the ministry into ‘the home of all those who think about and invent Brazil,’” setting favorable conditions for the cultural awareness of technology-based measures for progress. The ensuing accounts of technology transfer, vanguard art movements, and state measures produce contemporary visions of Brazilian networked society as state policy, local innovation, and cultural institutions that are decidedly not use-neutral.",Social Movements Around the World,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0931,2016,Paper Session,Protest Theming as Safe Authoritarian Audience Costs Strategy: Calls for Boycott During the 2012 China Anti-Japanese Demonstrations,1,"Autocratic regimes have been said to enjoy an “audience costs” dividend by using the signaling ability afforded by anti-foreign street protesters. In the case of China, however, this is somewhat contradicted by recent work showing that while anti-government speech online is largely acceptable, speech with the potential to incite collective action is squelched. This study looks at the anti-Japanese protests of 2012 which were carefully managed to emphasize a boycott as demand theme. Based on analysis of the particularities of keyword and hashtag blocks on Sina Weibo posts made at the height of the protests, I explain this theming and its timing as representing a compromise between fear of chaotic collective action and desire on the part of the Chinese authorities to be seen by the Japanese government as constrained by rabid nationalists. These findings help understand China’s success at skirting the ‘dictator’s dilemma’ with regards to the internet.",Social Movements Around the World,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0932,2016,Paper Session,Internet Censorship in Digital Divide: Why Chinese Labor Activists Do Not Use ICT in Activism,1,"The tentative study explores why Chinese labor activists do not use information and communication technology (ICT) politically other than the framework provided by digital divide. Through in-depth interviews with worker activism participants that are supposed to be particularly motivated in adopting ICT for collective actions, the study found that media censorship, users’ coping strategy and self-monitoring are influential in preventing them from mobilizing and organizing via ICT. A typology is accordingly developed based on censorship coping literacy and perceived importance of specific media to position labors’ perception of adopting the Internet and mass media in activism. The two constructs are then incorporated in a revised pyramid model of digital divide to describe two advanced divides when people already have access, skill and motivation to use ICT in societies with media censorship.",Social Movements Around the World,Global Communication and Social Change

Drawing on Downing’s (2008) argument that there is very little dialogue between the areas of social movement studies and media and communication, a link between social mobilization and communication is identified in Latin American scholarship. The argument advanced is that concepts such as hybridization and conscientization, developed by Latin American scholars to explain social mobilization in the region, can be the missing analytical connection between social movement studies and media and communication. Furthermore, as these concepts were developed to explain social mobilization in post-colonial, underdeveloped and unequal societies, they are presented as a theoretical alternative to the Euro-American universalism of the dominant theories.",Social Movements Around the World,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-0934,2016,Paper Session,Understanding Globalization From the TEA Party Movement’s Perspective,1,"The Tea Party Movement (TPM) has thus far been read mostly from a bipartisan perspective of US domestic politics. This study, however, links the movement to the globalization processes. It elaborates how the Tea Partiers understand globalization-induced social changes and their proposals to act upon such transformations. By analyzing the debates on the Tea Party Patriot forum, three globalization processes emerge as their central concerns: border, sovereignty, and collective identity. As globalization renders both physical and virtual borders ambiguous, the TPers propose defensive means to restore previous boundaries. Moreover, in terms of sovereignty, the TPers sense a feeling of declining US sovereignty due to the supranational institutions and waning popular control. They suggest seceding from the global institutions in order to preserve their republican ideals. Finally, globalization challenges a national culture and collective identity tied to hierarchical conceptions of race, gender, and religion. A defensive policy to preserve traditional national culture seems implausible since the TPers themselves have acknowledged some of the newly coalescing egalitarian national culture. While previous studies on Alter-globalization focus on the left-wing movements’ perspective, this study anticipates to fill in the gap by understanding the anti-globalization sentiments from the political right.",Social Movements Around the World,Global Communication and Social Change

The theoretical and empirical approaches hereby range from a psychological micro perspective focusing on individual traits and needs to a sociological macro perspective addressing diffusion processes and stratifications in societies. This paper provides a contribution on the intermediate meso level of friendship structures. Based on a longitudinal multi-layer network analysis of a three wave panel survey among 336 pupils we investigate (RQ1) which effect the social context has on TV and YouTube use and (RQ2) which effect the use of these media have on the development and maintenance of social relations. Based on stochastic actor oriented modelling we find support for the hypothesized social influence processes but not for social selection processes.

2016-0938,2016,Paper Session,The World Through the Eyes of the New York Times and People’s Daily: A Network Agenda-Setting Analysis of Psychological Geography,3,"The focus of this paper is to compare the maps of the world sketched by the international news coverage of the People’s Daily and the New York Times, major newspapers in countries that are culturally and politically very different. The images of foreign nations as objects of salience are of particular importance to scholars. Such images are considered extremely influential in post 9/11 world, given trends in political discourse (Kiousis & Wu, 2008). Most agenda-setting research since McCombs and Shaw’s (1972) study of the 1968 U.S. presidential election has focused on the relationship between the news media’s ranking of issues (in amount and prominence of coverage) and the public ranking of the perceived importance of these same issues in various surveys. This study is a departure from this method.
By examining the international news coverage we hope to find insights into how inter-media agenda setting works between the two newspapers, the New York Times in the US and the People’s Daily in China, from countries with very diverse political systems and ideology. Previous studies have focused on content analysis of network newscasts to analyze agenda setting effects (Wanta, Golan, & Lee, 2004). This study through its comparative analysis of influential print media through a novel method of examining agenda influences in two culturally different countries is an addition to the sphere of intermedia agenda setting using network analysis.",Network Analysis in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

Since independence in 1947, Bollywood has played a significant role in creating both a sense of nationhood in India and an other/enemy’ on the screen. The film industry has echoed India’s changing priorities to reflect political equations between the two nuclear archrivals. As India has engaged in on-off peace-talks with Pakistan, Bollywood too has used Pakistan as a backdrop in many plots. Although there have been films showing a peaceful relationship, majority of the films on the topic have focused on enmity between two nations. And yet Pakistan has remained a trustworthy consumer even during the four decades (1965-2008) ban on Hindi cinema in Pakistan. Today many Pakistanis are an active part of contemporary Bollywood.

An experiment with two points of measurement was conducted. After watching a full-length movie with a humanoid robot in a main role (vs. a control film condition) participants had a clearer understanding of humanoids. This in turn was related to a stronger link between the concept of humanoid robots and the self, which predicted a higher willingness to buy or use humanoid robot technology. The results remained stable after a two-week post-exposure delay.

2016-0942,2016,Paper Session,South Korean Hostess Film and Film Censorship During Park Chung Hee's Military Regime (1960-1979),1,"Park Chung Hee’s military regime (1960-1979) is notorious for state-operated censorship which exerted unprecedented power over film studios and directors. The military government purportedly used film censorship to distract the public from political consciousness by controlling political materials in films while condoning censorship control on sexual content. As a result, the production of soft-core adult films soared and became popular among Korean audiences. One of such films that thrived during this period, so called, Hostess Film (prostitute films) is worthy of attention because this strand of films is characterized not only for the exploitive employment of female sexuality but more importantly for the filmic representation of poverty, rape, and other lower-class issues which the state censorship board particularly sought to regulate.
In viewing such dynamics between state censorship and film, the following questions are inevitable: how was it possible that the state was willing to turn a blind eye on the explicit sexualization of women in hostess films when film censorship was at its peak? Why were the social and political aspects of this group of films about female sexual workers not seriously considered socially relevant by the government at a time when censorship was so high?
This articlw aims to unravel the above issues by scrutinizing the interplay between Park’s state censorship and hostess films using censorship records and notes. Furthermore, it offers an analysis of a hostess film, The Rose that Swallowed Thorn (Cheong, 1979) as a case study to show how this film strategically orchestrates visual and thematic elements to circumvent state censorship enforcement.",Advances in the Study of Film,Mass Communication
2016-0943,2016,Paper Session,Drivers of Populism: A Four-Country Comparison of Party Communication in the Run-Up to the 2014 EP Elections,1,"The aim of this paper is to analyze what different types of populist communication styles emerged during the 2014 EP election campaign and under which conditions political parties selected specific populist communication styles. To do this, a comparative quantitative content analysis of press releases in the run-up of the latest EP elections has been conducted for parties in France, Germany, Austria and Greece. The paper presents a definition of populism based on the contemporary academic discourse, which focuses on the transnational nature of the European political field. The analysis shows that populist party communication is more pronounced on the fringes of the political spectrum and in countries struggling with severe macroeconomic difficulties. Contrary to intuitive expectations, the perceived populist rhetoric of exclusivity in the context of the European sovereign debt crisis, which is identified as a central feature of right-wing populism, barely takes place within populist party communication.","Populist Parties, Populist Appeals, and Media Populism",Political Communication
2016-0944,2016,Paper Session,Emotional and Persuasive? An Empirical Test of Common Assumptions About Populist Appeals,1,"Populist parties have been extremely successful in recent years. It is often argued that their focus on emotional appeals instead of rational arguments contributes to this success. However, it has never been tested empirically if populist appeals do indeed elicit emotions, and if therefore they are more persuasive. In order to close this research gap, an experiment was conducted. Participants (N = 580) were presented political posters claiming stricter labor market regulations. Based on appraisal theories of emotions, it was assumed that posters promoting these claims with a populist argumentation would elicit emotions. Further, it was assumed that the persuasiveness of the claims would be mediated by these emotions, and that the claims would be more persuasive for people with strong populist attitudes. Confirming all of the assumptions, this study suggests that populist appeals are indeed persuasive because they elicit emotions, and that this effect is even stronger for people with populist attitudes.

2016-0945,2016,Paper Session,Media Coverage and Issue Expansion of Right-Wing Populist Parties,4,"Support for right-wing populist parties has increased across Europe in the last decades. Prior studies have established that mass media coverage plays a role by legitimizing the issues traditionally linked to these parties. However, with becoming more established they may seek to expand their issue repertoire through the mass media, further increasing their support. This study adds to the existing literature in two ways. First, we examine the ability of these parties to increase their electoral support by expanding their issue reputations. Secondly, in contrast to prior research we use an experiment to assess this. We test whether right-wing parties’ ownership of issues affects the impact of media coverage on support. Moreover, we examine whether the presence of party cues has an effect. The results indicate that on both owned and unowned issues, media coverage can foster right-wing populist party support. Coverage on issues owned by other parties, decreases support.","Populist Parties, Populist Appeals, and Media Populism",Political Communication

Distinguishing between anti-establishment and exclusionist populist attitudes, this paper is the first to empirically explore how preferences for populist media coverage are related to both dimensions of the populist attitude. Drawing on survey data collected among a nationally representative sample (N = 809), we find that citizens’ preferences for media populism are congruent with citizens’ populist attitudes: the more people prefer exclusionist media populism, the stronger their exclusionist populist attitudes. Citizens preferring anti-elites media populism scored higher on the anti-establishment dimension. These findings provide new insights into how preferences for media populism are related to citizens’ susceptibility or resistance to different populist worldviews.","Populist Parties, Populist Appeals, and Media Populism",Political Communication
2016-0947,2016,Paper Session,Easily Connected but Difficult to Get Close: Intercultural Friendship on Social Media Among Taiwanese Sojourners in the United States,1,"Adjustment to a foreign culture involves continuous adaptation, which is why participants in an exchange program are likely to be active users of social networking technologies while abroad (Lee et al., 2012). Drawing on ethnographic interviews with 18 Taiwanese sojourners in the United States, this study asked informants to retrospectively recount their use of social media with respect to intercultural relationships during their sojourning experiences. Friendships between Taiwanese and people from other cultures may face linguistic and cultural barriers, and while the use of social media embedded with various multimedia communicative tools (e.g. static or animated stickers, selfies or hyperlinks) can help overcome the tensions and challenges involved in the initial stage of communication, these multimedia communicative tools were phatic and supplementary to textual information. Intercultural/interracial friendships can only be better maintained and sustained with the sojourner’s mastering of textism in vernacular English, and interlocutors can experience greater social bonding as more textual information is created. Unless tailor-made for a specific interlocutor, graphic postings shared on social media are mostly merely complementary to textual information. Additionally, social media nurtures intercultural friendships between sojourners from different East Asian countries (e.g. Taiwanese and South Koreans in the US) more effectively than friendships between Taiwanese sojourners and Americans.","Cultural Influence on Friendship, Intimacy, and Conflict at Work",Intercultural Communication

This research took a cross-cultural perspective by comparing 204 profiles from the U.S. and 204 profiles from China. The results showed that Chinese GMG tended not to show their face on Jack’d than American GMG. Chinese GMG also mentioned a fewer number of relational goals than American GMG. In terms of self-presentation strategies, Americans tended to self-promote and to ingratiate, while Chinese tended to supplicate and to intimidate. This study showed that the differences of low-/high-context culture and individualistic/collectivistic culture reflected in the GMG’s online presentations.","Cultural Influence on Friendship, Intimacy, and Conflict at Work",Intercultural Communication

In particular, intimacy level was distinguished as very intimate (good friend), intimate (casual friend), distant (mere acquaintance), and stranger. This study featured direct and indirect communication strategy preference across these four targets. A total of 279 students of universities in Central Japan, and 162 students at a university in Southern California participated in the questionnaire survey. A 2 (nation) x 4 (target) repeated mixed design MANOVA was conducted, with 6 direct (blunt, polite)/indirect (indirect, third party, flatter, avoid) strategies as dependent variables. Results indicated little difference across cultures for blunt and polite direct strategies, while Japanese showed clear preference for indirect strategies toward mid-level intimacy targets (casual friend, mere acquaintance).

This study investigates how group composition and contextual factors influence communication in intercultural collaboration in a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual context. The current study focuses on one specific aspect of cultural diversity: nationality. Ethnicity was kept constant. A single-factor pretest-posttest two-group quasi-experimental design was used in this study with two conditions: nationally heterogeneous and nationally homogeneous. Twenty four participants were allocated to eight three-person groups with four groups per condition. Participants went through two 20-minute problem-solving and decision-making tasks adapted from the Desert Survival Scenarios. Self-report measures were collected and discussions were videotaped and coded for communication process measures. Results showed that nationally homogenous and heterogeneous groups did not differ in communication frequency or discussion exclusions. However, nationally heterogeneous groups experienced more discussion dominance and perceived the group communication process as less positive than nationally homogenous groups. Implications for theory and organizations were discussed.","Cultural Influence on Friendship, Intimacy, and Conflict at Work",Intercultural Communication

The author first defines intercultural conflicts as a national culture-bonded domain and provides working definitions for intercultural conflict at workplaces. Major theories are identified from a macro level to a micro level. The author examines relevant empirical studies and isolates three levels of emphasis, under which the major research lines are identified: organizational level (organizational control and management; organizational culture and discourse; and organizational learning), group level (in-group and out-group interactions; supervisor and subordinate relationship; and virtue team), and the individual level (socialization and adaptation; identity; and conflict management). The overview reveals that the three levels of factors are crucial understanding intercultural conflicts in the international workplaces.

The feminist tradition of studying gendered diseases, such as hysteria or anorexia, for broader insights into culture at large, inspires the analysis I apply here to critical media studies.

The degree and manner that advertising contains overt symbols and discussions of class may be influenced by the particular era in which a campaign appears. This paper argues that “post-recession” campaigns take comparisons farther than in many previous eras, as seen in “class shaming” strategies -- like ridicule of service workers, overt comparisons, and “lower-classface” performances -- for brands including Buick, Allstate, Cadillac, and DirecTV. In such ads, representations of the working-class are equated with losers, incompetents, and non-brand users in the ads, while affluent users and opulent lifestyles are celebrated.

Uses and gratifications theory (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974) was adopted to understand why people would like to use company Facebook pages. In addition to company-related uses and gratifications, self-serving uses and gratifications —expressing self-concept and seeking social interactions—were identified in the current study. Company reputation and company tribalism were incorporated in the theoretical model as an underlying mechanism to explain company Facebook page usage along with the benefits of relationship building and engagement behaviors. Results demonstrated that the uses and gratifications of expressing self-concept led to better perceptions of company tribalism and improved relational outcomes (trust and satisfaction). Company-related uses and gratifications, on the other hand, increased trust and satisfaction by increasing the evaluation of company reputation. Satisfaction was found to significantly encourage individuals’ word-of-mouth activities about the company as well as Facebook engagement.",The Power of Social Media,Public Relations

State-holding corporations gained more views than private corporations but not the likes. The automobile industry’s WeChat communication received most views and likes among sectors.

The findings suggest that there is room for improvement in organizations’ use of dialogic principles and highlight the complexity of audience responses. While each dialogic principle can be argued to theoretically have a positive effect on these responses, audiences on Reddit especially hold transparency, open communication and honesty in high regard and expect organizations’ AMAs to have extrinsic and/or intrinsic value for the publics besides having value for the organization in marketing and/or PR context.",The Power of Social Media,Public Relations

China) x 2 (ethnic identity: Hongkonger .v. Chinese) mixed-model design. Consistent with LIB assumptions, those who identified themselves as ‘Hongkonger’ would use more abstract language to describe prosocial behaviors performed in Hong Kong and antisocial behaviors performed in China. Moreover, ethnic identity interacted with LIB in accentuating subtle prejudice towards the Mainland Chinese. This study shows that LIB can occur not only in intergroup contexts based on clear racial, linguistic or political differences, but also within relatively homogenous groups.","The Role of Language, Narratives, and Framing in Intergroup Relations",Intergroup Communication

We conducted two experiments to test whether participants being exposed to biased ironic remarks about warmth or competence related behaviors of unknown social categories (1) recognize the biased impression from speakers, and (2) self-adopt the biased view in their own category impression. Results demonstrate that participants (implicitly) recognized the biased pattern in speaker remarks, particularly in the “ironic about positive behavior” condition (compared to all literal and ironic about negative behavior), yet did not self-adopt this view. When biased remarks are perceived as unnecessarily prejudiced, this may prevent recipients to follow suit in forming a generalized category stereotype.","The Role of Language, Narratives, and Framing in Intergroup Relations",Intergroup Communication
2016-0962,2016,Paper Session,Communicating Collective Victimhood: Legitimizing Violence by Uncertain Groups and Perceived Group Entitativity,2,"In two experiments, we examine the impact communication of specific group-based information can have on third-party perceptions of conflicting groups. Specifically, we examine the extent to which communication of ingroup victimhood experiences (studies 1 and 2) and framing of communications about relative group power (study 2) can impact perceptions of group uncertainty, legitimization of group violence, and perceived entitativity. In study 1 (N = 86), we found that groups claiming victimhood within the context of conflict appeared more uncertain and thus as less distinctive and entitative in a mediation analysis. While in study 2 (N = 165) we found that relative group power moderated perceived entitativity of victim claiming groups—low-power groups claiming victimhood appeared most entitative. Further, violent and retributive intent of victim-claiming groups was legitimized through perceptions of heightened uncertainty. Implications of framing of information about conflicting groups on already troubled intergroup relations are discussed.","The Role of Language, Narratives, and Framing in Intergroup Relations",Intergroup Communication
2016-0963,2016,Paper Session,Partisan Code Words Affect Policy Opinions and Group Demographic Estimation,2,"Policy judgments are often based on intergroup dynamics, meaning they are influenced by perceptions of whether one’s ingroup or outgroup will benefit/suffer due to the policy (i.e., group-centric). Past research has shown that concerns for group competition can be primed by the use of code words, or words used in order to implicitly prime stereotypes (e.g., “inner city” primes stereotypes of violent Black criminals) without having to explicitly evoke them. Research has not yet tested how liberal/politically correct (PC) code words may differentially prime intergroup competition. In this paper, we present data that indicate that the use of liberal code words (as opposed to conservative ones) primes ideas of group membership differently for liberals and conservatives. More specifically, in the liberal code word condition, the more liberal a participant was, the higher they estimated Blacks’ incarceration rates.","The Role of Language, Narratives, and Framing in Intergroup Relations",Intergroup Communication
2016-0964,2016,Paper Session,The Power of Stories: Narrativity in Videos Against Extremism and its Effect on Persuasive Processing and Behavioral Intentions,4,"Right-wing extremist and Islamic extremist propaganda videos have become common in the Internet. Numerous governmental and civic actors try to challenge these extremist ideologies online via so-called counter-narratives. Research on the effectiveness of counter-narrative videos is seldom and factors underlying a potential effect have not been studied systematically.
Drawing upon research on narrative persuasion and two-process models of persuasion, the current study (N = 331) tested the effects of narrativity in videos against right-wing extremism and Islamic extremism on persuasive processing subsequent behavioral intentions. The results confirmed narrativity as crucial factor for a better evaluation and deeper elaboration of counter-narratives against extremism. In addition, both evaluation and elaboration fostered behavioral intentions for low-level political engagement against extremism. Results are discussed concerning the power of stories in challenging current extremist ideologies.","The Role of Language, Narratives, and Framing in Intergroup Relations",Intergroup Communication
2016-0965,2016,Paper Session,Voices of the Marginalized: An Analysis of Social Media Message Frames and Functions in a Ferguson Social Justice Movement,2,"On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old African-American male,
as shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri. The shooting sparked tension within Ferguson and across the nation and prompted the formation of online communities that confronted issues of race, class and police brutality and called for justice. Using content analysis, this study examined how online Twitter and Facebook communities stemming from the Ferguson incident used social media to counter mainstream media portrayals, galvanize support and exert social influence. Through an analysis of message frames and functions, this study found that although race was a major issue in online and offline discourse, a majority of the posts were framed around the topic of justice, not race. The study found that users’ social media posts functioned primarily to convey information versus call for direct action that could have potentially activated greater user participation in online and offline acts.","Media, Ferguson, and #BlackLivesMatter",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

This study adds to a nascent body of research on Black Twitter by examining how celebrities, in particular hip-hop celebrities, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to create and maintain Black identity during the 2014 Ferguson protests related to racial justice and police brutality. Using computerized and manual content analyses of 2.67 million tweets, this study found more celebrity tweets were framed as related to Black identity compared with marketing/self-promotion. Further qualitative analysis of the Black identity-framed tweets revealed four themes: speaking to whites, solidarity, Black is beautiful, and equality. Through a lens of social identity theory, this study demonstrates how hip-hop celebrities used Black Twitter to construct Black identity and community, building on research that shows group identification is fundamental for creating the solidarity and commitment necessary for collective action.","Media, Ferguson, and #BlackLivesMatter",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Major themes in these public discussions surrounding Broken Windows in the “Ferguson era” are identified and held up against the original Wilson and Kelling (1982) article to understand how theory has been put into practice, and is understood over 30 years later. Through a close reading of Wilson and Kelling, I demonstrate that a focus on minor crimes persists from the original article to current popular discourse and that concerns in connection to race, anticipated in the original article, have increased greatly in the contemporary climate. I also argue that environmental disorder is under-emphasized both theoretically in the original article and in current discourse.","Media, Ferguson, and #BlackLivesMatter",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

In 1964, Malcolm X delivered his famous “The Ballot or the Bullet” speech. Malcolm X called for solidarity in the Black community, constructed the White Man as the enemy, advocated Black Nationalism, and gave the White Man a choice: the ballot or the bullet. Fifty years later, protesters took to the streets of Ferguson after the killing of an unarmed Black teenager. In their struggle for justice, power, and equality, the protesters utilized rhetoric that echoed the same five themes put forth by Malcolm X. This study examines that use of this thematic rhetoric by Ferguson protesters through the analytic lens of Malcolm X’s speech.","Media, Ferguson, and #BlackLivesMatter",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Still, visuals remain an understudied field in communication studies (Geise & Baden, 2015), especially when it comes to multimodal approaches (Matthes, 2009). This potentially leads to an incomplete understanding of media events.
This paper presents the results from a multimodal quantitative content analysis of the online coverage of 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, wherein an innovative comparative approach to visual and textual frames was applied. Herein, we examined the existing frames, identify patterns of visual and textual frame co-occurrence and describe changes of the applied multimodal framing.
The study identifies (1) moments of complementary application of visual and textual layers and moments of shifting (2) interpretational emphases through a change in the combination of both type of frames.

Political and media scholars are concerned that social media will accentuate the polarization and fragmentation found in news media. To test that concern, the study utilized a full year of news articles and Twitter posts in all 50 states mentioning income inequality through a third-party big data search system. The most common frames of inequality were identified through literature and national surveys then used to compare how two types of media (news and social) differed in framing the income inequality and how those frames differed across Democratic and Republican states. We found that news media differed significantly by political ideology but the Twitter conversation did not.

This study employed an information quality framework to examine not only sexual health information seeking, but also how such information is encountered, evaluated, shared online, and impacts decisions about sexual health offline within a specific sociocultural context. Data were collected through both face-to-face interviews (N=30) and cross-sectional online surveys (N= 561) with Chinese young adults aged 18 to 25. Findings show that participants appreciated the utility of online sexual health information (OSHI) in response to their pressing needs, but opposed sharing OSHI on social media in fear of being judged negatively by others. After engaging with OSHI, 87.3% of the survey participants followed online advice on at least one occasion, and 54.9% discussed this information with others (mostly with partners and friends) offline. Having sexual intercourse in the past three months was the best predictor of engagement with OSHI. Contrary to previous findings, participants with higher family income were more likely to engage with OSHI. Insights of this study’s findings can be incorporated into future online intervention programs.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-0974,2016,Paper Session,Do Media Light Their Fire? The Dual Role of Sexualizing Media in Adolescent Sexual Behavior,3,"This three-wave panel study (N = 824) examined the relationship between adolescents’ sexualizing media exposure and sexual behavior drawing on a dual-pathway model. Structural equation analyses supported the proposed dual pathway, showing that the impact of sexualizing media on adolescents’ sexual behavior proceeds through an inhibitory pathway, linking sexualizing media exposure to lower levels of sexual behavior through sexual body consciousness, and a supportive pathway, linking sexualizing media exposure to higher levels of sexual behavior through self-objectification. Regarding the supportive pathway, sexualizing media exposure (W1) positively predicted sexual behavior (W3), through media internalization and valuing appearance over competence (W2). Regarding the inhibitory pathway, media internalization positively predicted body surveillance, which, in turn, positively predicted sexual body consciousness (all W2). Sexual body consciousness (W2) negatively related to sexual behavior (W3). From a sexual developmental perspective, these findings emphasize the importance of guiding adolescents in interpreting and processing sexualizing media messages.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media

A total of 36 adolescents (aged 16 to 19 years, 72.2% girls) participated in one of twelve homogeneous web-based focus groups. The themes that emerged from the focus group discussions suggest that sex-related Internet use is a complex and ambivalent experience for adolescents. Participants perceived the Internet as a useful, versatile, and easily accessible source of sex-related information, stimulation, inspiration, and communication. Yet, participants experienced or expressed concerns about a range of negative consequences or risks related to sex-related online behaviors, particularly concerning pornography’s potential to create unrealistic expectations about sex and sexual attractiveness.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media

Based on a three-wave panel survey among adolescents (N = 1,079), we found that watching SEIM predicted engagement in casual sex over time. Conversely, casual sexual activities partially predicted adolescents’ use of SEIM. A two-step mediation model explained the relationship between watching SEIM and casual sex: First, watching SEIM predicted stronger instrumental attitudes toward sex through increasing adolescents’ perceptions of SEIM as useful. Second, perceived utility of SEIM predicted casual sex through strengthening adolescents’ instrumental attitudes. Partial support emerged for a reciprocal relationship between watching SEIM and perceived utility.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media

It is one of the first studies to explore sexting from youth’s perspectives. Iceland’s small population and lack of anonymity provides an excellent context to consider socio-cultural influence on sexting norms. Thirty-three participants between 16-25-years-old participated in eight focus groups. We used the social norms theory because it recognizes indirect peer influence through subjective perceptions about norms. The results of our thematic analysis revealed that sexting is common albeit more stigmatized than commonly thought, which suggests that engagement in sexting is influenced by more factors than commonness, where social pressure is an overriding factor. Therefore, we argue that peer influence is more direct than the social norms theory posits. The article concludes with discussion on policy implications of the findings, reflection on the study’s limitations, and suggestions for future research.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media

We conducted eleven same-sex focus groups among 57 adolescents (66.67% females; n = 38) between 15 and 18 years old. The analysis revealed that sexting mostly occurs through smartphone applications, such as Snapchat. Both female and male participants observed that some girls would feel that they had to engage in sexting, out of fear that they would otherwise lose their boyfriend. Male and female respondents mentioned three main ways in which sexting images could be abused: 1) they could be used to coerce or to blackmail the victim, 2) they could be distributed out of revenge after a romantic break-up, or 3) they could be forwarded or shown to peers in order to boast about having received the picture.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media

Yet, it is unknown whether online communication is associated with the initiation of romantic and sexual activity among adolescents. This two-wave study among 1,163 adolescents investigated the longitudinal impact of online communication using chat rooms, dating websites, and erotic contact websites on the initiation of romantic relationships and sexual intercourse, using logistic regression analyses. The odds ratio of initiating a romantic relationship among romantically inexperienced adolescents who frequently used these websites were two to three times larger than those of non-users. Among sexually inexperienced adolescents who frequently communicated online, the odds ratio of initiating sexual intercourse was two to five times larger than among non-users, even after a number of other relevant factors were introduced. This is the first study to demonstrate that online communication predicts the initiation of offline sexual and romantic activity as early as adolescence.","Sex, Sexting, Sexuality",Children Adolescents and the Media

In this contribution, we scrutinize the diverse motives for internet-mediated sharing as well as their role in shaping attitudes towards sharing one’s possessions in commercialized as well as non-commercialized settings. Employing a motivational model of sharing, rooted in the theory of planned behavior, we show that sharing attitudes are driven by moral, social-hedonic and monetary motivations. Furthermore, we identify materialism, sociability and volunteering as predictors of sharing motives in different sharing contexts. Against this background, we discuss the possible role of monetary compensation as a necessary but not sufficient condition for granting others access to one’s possessions.","CAT Hybrid Session 3: Social Media, Interactions, and Self-Presentation",Communication and Technology

This intersection of mass media and interpersonal media is examined by testing how different motivational factors might lead to selective patterns of sharing media content (e.g., music and films) in a social network site. A social identity motive should drive sharing of popular media, an impression management motive should drive sharing of prestigious media, and a self-expression motive should drive sharing of guilty pleasures. An online experiment was conducted with a convenience sample of 168 Facebook users. The experiment invoked motivational situations, asking participants to list songs and films they would share. These media were then rated for perceptions. Findings provide support for predictions regarding social identity and popular media, as well as impression management and prestigious media.

A two wave longitudinal survey (with a time interval of two-months) among 1,852 adolescents and young adults showed that, only among adolescent girls, more frequent sexy self-presentation on social media predicted a greater willingness to sext. This suggests that sexy self-presentation in social media can predict the sharing of explicit sexual content of one self, and that adolescent girls are most susceptible to this influence. It has implications for both the role of social media in the lives of young people, as well as for targeting young people who are at risk for sexting behavior.","CAT Hybrid Session 3: Social Media, Interactions, and Self-Presentation",Communication and Technology

A survey with a novel Following Motives Scale (FMS) shows that antisocial motives (i.e., others providing a target for downward comparison, competition, schadenfreude, gossip, and “hate-following”) and insecurity motives (i.e., others providing reassurance, preference for online interaction, and social obligation), can be distinguished from positive sociable and inspirational motives, and are related differently to self-esteem, need for popularity, narcissism, and dispositional schadenfreude. Moreover, an embedded experiment demonstrates that antisocial motives predict acceptance of a Facebook friendship request from, schadenfreude towards, as well as gossiping about, a high school acquaintance that suffered a setback, thereby providing a convenient source for self-enhancement.","CAT Hybrid Session 3: Social Media, Interactions, and Self-Presentation",Communication and Technology

Those disclosure messages can vary in the level of intimacy, ranging from mundane information about oneself to intimate feelings and beliefs. Several pieces of messages taken together can also vary in the level of narrativity: disclosure messages with high-narrativity are able to present a vivid story of one’s life, by involving more details and transitional descriptions. This study examines the effects of disclosure intimacy (after control for disclosure appropriateness) and narrativity on social attraction and feeling of closeness in zero-acquaintance situations. A unique design of stimuli that resembles real-life browsing experience was pretested, and a 2 (superficial vs. intimate disclosure) X 2 (high- vs. low narrativity) between-subjects experimental design is utilized.

2016-0986,2016,Paper Session,"The Effects of Facebook Usages, Posts and Replies on Network Heterogeneity and Social Resources",3,"Facebook has become one of most popular online services in recent years. Users create an online profile on these sites by listing personal and professional information and interest, linking up with other users, and regularly sharing updates about what’s going on in their lives with those in their networks. Wellman suggested three revolutions (social network, Internet and mobile) have made possible the networked individualism that people function more as connected individuals and less as embedded group members on social networking sites. Networked individuals have a variety of social ties to count on, especially looser and more diverse social networks. This research aims at examining whether use of Facebook help extend personal layers of social circles and increase heterogeneous networks? In addition, we tried to answer whether a broader layer and diverse social network on the Facebook help users to meet their needs of informational, emotional and economical resources?

A six-month duration activity logs on Facebook of 374 college students in a private university were collected. To avoid oversampling strong-tie problem in the name generator method, we randomly selected 12 alters for each student from their activity log lists. Then, egocentric social network questionnaires for each student were customized conducted. In all, we collected 4,391 interpersonal ties of different layers of relations (i.e. close friends/classmates/teachers/friends/close friends’ friends/friends’ friend/internet or Facebook friend) and 4,392 heterogeneous networks of job titles (i.e. manager/professional/technical-assisted/clerk/service personnel/craft/mechanical/ student/others) between egos and alters.

Descriptive results suggested that students with longer seniority on Facebook showed a more heterogeneous social network on job titles. Time of everyday usage, numbers of posts and replies didn’t show significant impacts on network heterogeneity. Those who updated FB personal profile more often reported to have higher degrees of emotional resource, while those who spent more time on Facebook received better information resources. More friends on Facebook didn’t guarantee to have greater mobilized resources. In particular, number of Facebook friends ranged from 200 to 400 received a better support of material resources than the others. Descriptive analyses of network heterogeneity, layer, and types on mobilizing resources suggested that students who had more heterogeneous social networks revealed to have better emotional resource. Students with higher numbers of close ties in social cycles and acquainted with managers, professionals, technical-assistant professionals received better social resources. Regression analyses suggested that Facebook seniority and updated personal profile were positively related to emotional resources. While responding to posts was positively associated with informational resource, replying to FB photos showed an opposite direction. Those who updated their personal profiles more often showed a higher degree of mobilizing material resource, yet great number of friends on Facebook deteriorated resource of this kind. Obviously, different Facebook usages and behaviors resulted in acquiring different kinds of social resources. For the effects of social layers, regression results suggested number of higher degree of heterogeneity increased the acquisition of emotional resource, but not informational and material resources.","CAT Hybrid Session 3: Social Media, Interactions, and Self-Presentation",Communication and Technology

The emergence of the smartphone has led to a new form of interaction that occurs on mobile dating applications. A number of researchers have explored the strategies that online daters use to give off a desired impression. However, these analyses center on the affordances provided by Computer-Mediated-Communication, which have distinct differences than the affordances of mobile media. The proposed study fills in this gap by exploring how self-presentation occurs within the environment of mobile dating applications. Through semi-structured interviews with 30 active mobile dating application users, it assesses how mobile dating applications provide new opportunities, constraints and strategies for self-presentation. Findings from a recent pilot study reveal that there were constraints of time, space, lack of cues and visibility. The user developed strategies to overcome these issues by engaging in straightforward communication, emphasizing images and communicating outside of the mobile dating application. Lastly, the user revealed opportunities for presenting a concise self-presentation that required minimal effort. Findings from the upcoming interviews would contribute to the literature on impression management by revealing how user strategies have shifted due to changes in technology. This can provide insight into the field of communication and technology by updating and extending the literature on online dating practices.","CAT Hybrid Session 3: Social Media, Interactions, and Self-Presentation",Communication and Technology

Some people have argued that this type of stimuli could have negative effects on users, like promoting discrimination or even violence against women. Correlational studies suggest that there is a connection between game usage and some forms of sexism. Only experimental research could tell us if there is a causal relationship. However, there is only a couple of experiments on the subject. In order to make sense of the limited evidence, we analyzed the results based on theories and concepts from Cognitive and Social Psychology. Our work suggests that, through mechanisms like Spreading Activation, Modeling, the Proteus Effect and Cognitive Dissonance, some forms of sexist game content could make people think in a more sexist manner.

2016-0995,2016,Paper Session,Breaking Bad News: A Challenge for a Doctor's Communication,2,"Interpersonal communication competence has a central meaning in a doctor’s work. Successful interaction between a patient and a doctor is connected to good results in care, compliance and the patients’ experiences concerning the care results. Situations where the doctor’s task is to break bad news (BBN) have special challenges. BBN usually refers to circumstances in which the doctors inform the patients that their health or functional states have crucially worsened.

In research literature, BBN has been elaborated considerably both from doctors’ and of view patients’ points of view. This phenomenon has most often been approached quantitatively and the methods typically used have been the half-structured or structured inquiry. Even if qualitative research is scarce to be found, e.g. in the field of speech communication, so is BBN based on the doctors’ own experiences researched qualitatively even more sparsely.

This article is grounded on a qualitative research, in which 27 doctors from different healthcare sectors and eight subspecialties were interviewed. The aim of the research is to particularize what kind of an experience BBN is to the doctor, and how the doctors operate, when they disclose these kinds of news to their patients. The results can be utilized e.g. in communication education for medical students as well as in developing practices for BBN.

The doctors in this research experience BBN as a challenging and emotionally burdening task. The emotional burden comes from two directions: a doctor has to recognize and deal both with his/her own emotional experiences as well as those of the patient’s. The majority of the doctors prefer acting in a matter-of-fact way and telling the truth straight out to their patients. Therefore, medical educators’ important task is to help future doctors to recognize the expectations intertwined with the interaction in BBN situations and to process the powerful emotional experiences.

Phone interviews were conducted with 12 patients with chronic pain, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Noteworthy findings were that in contrast to previous research, for most patients in this sample, interactions with their current provider(s) were collaborative, characterized by, for example, shared decision making and belief in the legitimacy of pain. Further, some participants framed their treatment goals in psychological/emotional terms (for example, resuming a “normal” life, confronting the emotional trauma of the condition) and found it more challenging to cope with the psychological rather than physical impairment wrought by their condition. Study results provide further support for the importance of collaboration for a therapeutic relationship as well as the need to incorporate psychological care in chronic pain management.",Qualitative Studies of Provider-Patient Communication,Health Communication

Early elective deliveries often result in poor health outcomes, including increased infant morbidity and mortality. The sample in the study consisted of 28 obstetricians who participated in semi-structured interviews.

The findings of the current study reveal overall positive perceptions of the March of Dimes health communication campaign and hospital hard-stops. However, the providers noted that the campaign and the hard-stop initiative may have potentially harmful unintended consequences. They claim that patients who are medically indicated for early delivery may not be delivered in an expeditious manner because of the national initiative to reduce early elective births.

This study examines the follow network among organizations, defined as which organization follows which organization on social media, as dynamic systems of representational communication networks. We investigate the influence of network structural factors and organizational attributes among a network of 201 environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) over 13 months on Twitter. Findings suggest that NGOs prefer to follow NGOs that share the same geographic region and they are less likely to follow NGOs with higher revenue. Second, NGOs are more likely to follow NGOs that are already popular among organizations, have a larger number of followers, follow a larger number of accounts, and send more posts on Twitter. Implications for the study of dynamic representational communication networks are drawn from the findings.","Big Data & Networks: Connecting Communities, Organizations, and Reviews",Communication and Technology

For this purpose, instead of looking at egonetworks, we look at networks of online communities specifically aimed at development of location-independent ties. The paper focuses on the 25 largest professional communities of software developers in the leading Russian social networking site VKontakte, one of the communities being studied in depth. Evidence suggests that membership and friendship ties are overwhelmingly cross-city and even cross-country, while an in-depth analysis of one of the groups gives ground to assume that, comment-ing and liking in such communities might also be location-independent. This group case study also provides some insights into a more general nature of professional networking and shows independence of the three networks: the friendship network as a means of groupidentification, the commenting network as an advice-giving tool, and the liking network as a result of approval by occasional visitors","Big Data & Networks: Connecting Communities, Organizations, and Reviews",Communication and Technology

The study first tests whether LIWC dimensions that are assumed to express evaluations, positive and negative emotion words, are in fact associated with opinion differences. In each of 26 distinct geographic areas, as expected, higher reviews contained more positive emotion words and fewer negative emotion words than lower reviews. The study then examines the extent to which construal and legitimation encourage different language use patterns. We observe that the rate of first-person singular pronouns (e.g., I, me) was greatest for extreme reviews (e.g., 1-star, 5-star), and the rate of present-tense language is greater positive reviews. Despite these robust patterns, predictive analysis indicates that while language features are a better than chance predictor of review levels, these language features alone do not precisely characterize these reviews. We also examine variations across the 26 communities and find that in more critical or dissatisfied communities – those with lower general ratings for their businesses – there is a tendency to add more negative language to low rating reviews. The implications for these findings for the study of review sites, as well as the study of social media via text analysis, are also discussed.","Big Data & Networks: Connecting Communities, Organizations, and Reviews",Communication and Technology
2016-1004,2016,Paper Session,Information Processing Style Moderates the Effect of Input Device on Pre- and Postpurchase Product Evaluations,2,"Touchscreen tablets have become a key component of the online shopping landscape, making the role of finger based direct touch in online consumer behavior increasingly prevalent. This paper presents a first study investigating how the effect of input device (mouse-driven desktop versus touchscreen tablet) on post-purchase evaluations is moderated by individual differences in information processing style. The results of an experiment show that a touchscreen device helps item-specific focused individuals to form accurate product expectations, ultimately resulting in positive post-purchase product evaluations including product confirmation, post-satisfaction and low intention to return compared to a desktop computer. Contrarily, for individuals who rely more on a relational processing style, a mouse-driven desktop computer rather than a touchscreen device showed to result in positive post-purchase product evaluations. Results indicate that perceptions of online products are filtered through the lens of both the type of device and information processing style used to explore them.","Big Data & Networks: Connecting Communities, Organizations, and Reviews",Communication and Technology
2016-1005,2016,Paper Session,A Replication of Channel Complementarity Theory Among Internet Users in India,2,"This article examined channel complementarity in health information seeking among Internet users in India. It posited that online users complementarily use different channels to search for health information. Based on the existing literature, it suggested that age is an important moderator among different channels as health information sources. Data regarding the consumption of 11 different channels was collected from nearly 1000 Internet users. The results demonstrated complementary use of different channels as health information sources in relationship to the Internet as a health information source, except for newspapers and family members. Moreover, not supporting our hypothesis regarding the sources of health information among online users, the Internet was surprisingly not the primary source of health information, being shadowed by the predominant and significantly greater use of newspapers as sources of health information among online users in India. Extending the theory of channel complementarity, we found that age is an important moderator of complementary relationships among various channels as health information sources, demonstrating that younger users were more likely to use greater numbers of channels complementarily as compared to older users. Contributions to channel complementarity and implications of research are discussed on the basis of the findings.","Online Health Literacy, Information Processing, and Seeking",Health Communication

Using two independent surveys addressing different Dutch health websites (N = 423 and N = 395), the mediating role of cognitive load, imagination ease, and website involvement was tested. Results showed that the influence of health literacy on information recall and website attitudes was mediated by cognitive load and imagination ease, but hardly by website involvement. Thus, in order to improve recall and attitudes among people with limited health literacy, online health communication should consist of information that is not cognitively demanding and easy to imagine.","Online Health Literacy, Information Processing, and Seeking",Health Communication

Older Cancer Patients’ Recall of Online Cancer Information,8,"This study proposes and tests a theory-based model to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the contribution of chronological age and age-related ability and motivation factors in explaining recall of online cancer information among older patients (n = 197). Results revealed that recall is not a matter of chronological age per se, but rather a matter of ability and motivation. Age-related ability and motivation factors explained 37.9% of the variance in recall. Health literacy, involvement with the webpage, and satisfaction with the emotional support positively influenced recall. Furthermore, recall was negatively affected by frailty, anger, future time perspective and perceived cognitive load. The findings pose relevant opportunities for tailoring interventions to improve online information provision for older cancer patients.","Online Health Literacy, Information Processing, and Seeking",Health Communication

As part of a larger project, this study explores the nature of, what we call, networked intimacy, which is enabled by the use of dating apps. Interviews with seven Asian American gay men living in Los Angeles showed three characteristics of this form of intimate relationships: Ambiguous and contradictory relational goals, heavy emphasis on the construction of profiles, and a priori screening of a massive pool of potential partners. Although findings from this study cannot be generalized to the population at large, the experiences of our informants provide critical insight to contemporary intimacy.","Online Dating: The Beginning, Middle, and End",Communication and Technology

This study seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of how adaptive communication is enacted and how perceptual bias (i.e., idealization) is developed by incorporating self-report and behavioral data. Through a one-week diary with both members of heterosexual dating couples via a texting platform, the study compared daily communication and relational perceptions in long-distance versus geographically-close relationships. The results offer solid support for the effect of behavioral adaption, as long-distance partners self-reported greater self-disclosure and self-responsiveness to their partners, and such differences were also documented on the linguistic level. Relative to geographically-close partners, long-distance partners reported greater idealization in partner responsiveness, but not in partner disclosure. The magnitude of idealization was further explained by heightened relational uncertainty, exclusive uses of text-based communication, and intrapersonal projection of one’s own behaviors.","Online Dating: The Beginning, Middle, and End",Communication and Technology

A total of 36 students participated in a speed dating event, resulting in 95 unique dates. For their first date they were randomly assigned to a first date via text-only CMC or audiovisual CMC. The dyads had a second date, which was face-to-face. We found that there was more social attraction between interactants in text-only CMC than audiovisual CMC. This supports the hyperpersonal communication model. Furthermore, we found that for social attraction the hyperpersonal effect persisted after a face-to-face meeting. However, for romantic attraction the modality switching leads to a lower level of attraction. Results are discussed in light of hyperpersonal communication model.","Online Dating: The Beginning, Middle, and End",Communication and Technology
2016-1013,2016,Paper Session,Sharing a Breakup With Friends and Family: Patterns and Effects of Interpersonal Media Use on Personal Growth,2,"Breakups are prevalent experiences among college students that are intensely stressful. The present study examined (1) how college students share a breakup using interpersonal media with consideration of different types of relational partners and across geographic distances and (2) whether sharing a breakup is associated with the sharers’ personal growth afterwards. Results show that interpersonal media play significant roles in the social sharing process, however, it suggests that it is necessary to consider the relationship type and geographical distance with the communication partner in order to understand media use. Overall, face-to-face interaction was used most for sharing a breakup, followed by texting, and least via phone calling for geographically close relationship. This pattern was somewhat different depending on the relationship type (friends vs. family members) and geographical distance (long distance). Results show that only face-to-face sharing with close friends was significantly associated with the sharer’s personal growth after breakup. The results extend the social sharing framework and advance the literature on interpersonal media use.","Online Dating: The Beginning, Middle, and End",Communication and Technology

Face-to-face arguing, an inherent feature of personal and public experience, seems never to have been previously studied in Malaysia. We did so here, and compared results to those obtained in India, China, and the U.S. We found interesting distinctions between Malaysia and the other nations on several measures fundamental to the study of interpersonal arguing. Malaysians had a number of comparatively aggressive impulses, but these were tempered by their higher expectation of civility in arguments and their greater sophistication about the general nature of interpersonal disagreement. Malaysians had positive correlations between argument-approach and argument-avoid, and between verbal aggressiveness (prosocial vs. antisocial). Malaysia also produced few sex differences. These were interesting findings, both for what they say about Malaysia and for what they imply about our originating theories of interpersonal arguing.","Arguments, Argumentation, and Language Competence",Intercultural Communication

2016-1020,2016,Paper Session,"A Time Paradox in Framing Changes in Income Inequality: When Duration Frames Increase, Undermine, and Polarize Redistributive Policy Preferences",2,"This paper analyzes news coverage of income inequality and reports results from two randomized survey experiments designed to test how temporal duration frames used in political discourse about income inequality influence public preferences for redistributive policy initiatives. In Study 1, a computer-automated analysis of temporal markers used by U.S. news media revealed that newspapers most frequently described income inequality as having widened over a period of 30 years. In Study 2, participants in a randomized web-based experiment (N=556) rated their support for redistributive tax policies in response to a mock news article framing the duration of changes in income inequality. Participants showed more support in response to long-term framing (the rich have gotten richer during the past 3 “decades”) compared to short-term framing (the past 3 “years”). In addition, short-duration frames led to political polarization by further reducing levels of policy support among political conservatives. In Study 3, participants in a randomized national telephone survey experiment (N=1,000) rated their support for a progressive tax policy in response to a similar duration manipulation, this time using an additional question designed to prime ideological cues. Before answering questions about policy preferences, the survey primed participants to think about causal attributions by asking them to answer a question about why income inequality has widened over the years. As with Study 2, long-term framing led to greater overall support for progressive tax policy. However, long-term framing reduced support among political conservatives relative to a no-exposure control group, also leading to political polarization.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Politics,Mass Communication

That is, exposure to partisan conflict-framed news made partisan identity salient in the minds of Democrats and Republicans, ultimately exacerbating attitude polarization along party lines. Two experimental studies provided robust support. We also found that the proposed impact of partisan conflict-framed news on attitude polarization persisted regardless of whether the news exposure was congenial or uncongenial to a person’s party identification.

This study takes media coverage of the crisis as the dependent variable. Focusing on the Netherlands, it investigates how print media framed the crisis and to what extent temporal and outlet factors account for variation in the use of different frames. We selected three major Dutch newspapers: Het Financieele Dagblad, de Telegraaf and de Volkskrant. Relying on an in-depth qualitative content analysis and a quantitative analysis, five major frames are identified that journalists use when discussing the crisis. Our findings show that frame variation is mainly due to temporal factors. While the specific interpretation of the frames might differ across the outlets, the three newspapers show remarkable similarities in the over-time prominence of the frames they use.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Politics,Mass Communication
2016-1023,2016,Paper Session,What Changed Public Opinion on the Same-Sex Marriage Issue? New Implications of Attributes in Media Agenda Setting,2,"This study explored attribute agenda-setting effects regarding the issue of same-sex marriage, examining the effects of the substantive attribute salience and the affective attribute salience of the news coverage on public opinion over 10 years. Three attributes were examined: religious beliefs, family values and legal rights. Both immediate (β = 7.308, p < .05) and cumulative substantive attribute salience (β = 1.083, p < .05) of the news coverage significantly predicted changes in public opinion on religious issues. Cumulative substantive attribute salience and cumulative affective attribute salience of the news articles were highly positively correlated with the number of people in favor of same sex marriage. While this study shows that the media has had a long-term effect on public opinion about the same-sex marriage issue, methodologically, the findings underline that the number of articles is as valid as the frequency of the attributes of the issue cited in the articles to examine the agenda setting effect. Also the affective attribute salience (positive or negative) of the news coverage has stronger effects on attitudes than the substantive attribute salience of news coverage alone. The more positive the news coverage about a controversial issue, the more people who had no opinion about it will agree with what the media is presenting.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Politics,Mass Communication

For this so-called privacy regulation, users need to have online privacy literacy. In this study, we discuss factors that potentially contribute to and result from online privacy literacy. In an online questionnaire with 630 Facebook users, we found that people who spend more time on Facebook and who have changed their privacy settings more frequently reported to have more online privacy literacy. People with more online privacy literacy felt safer on Facebook and implemented more social privacy settings. Time spend on Facebook and experience with privacy regulation did not increase safety and privacy behavior directly, stressing the importance of online privacy literacy as a mediator for a safer online behavior. We conclude that Internet experience leads to more online privacy literacy, which fosters a more cautious privacy behavior on SNSs.",Promising Student Papers,Information Systems
2016-1025,2016,Paper Session,Variation in Probe Tone Frequency Affects Secondary Task Reaction Time,2,"This study explores the relationship between pitch onset and response times. It is widely understood that humans’ auditory response to loudness over the range of audible frequencies is nonlinear (Fletcher & Munson, 1933). Stemming from evolutionary psychology, this study employs a theory of processing positing that stimuli activate motivational systems in service of the organism (Cacioppo & Gardner, 1999). Thus, a possible explanation for this curve is that the human auditory system is more sensitive to frequencies that are evolutionarily relevant. Secondary Task Reaction Time (STRT) is associated with cognitive load. If different pitches result in different response latencies, then it would suggest that some pitches take cognitive priority compared to others. This could drastically impact media production by introducing a new means to grab listeners’ attention.",Promising Student Papers,Information Systems

The current study investigated the recovery potential of listening to music from a mood regulation perspective, extending it by questioning the role of social groups and the social embeddedness of personal stress relief. We experimentally examined the recovery potential of a highly arousing vs. a less arousing Heavy Metal song after a fatigue induction, comparing Heavy Metal fans to non-fans. Preliminary results of 128 participants confirmed the arousal regulating potential of music, additionally showing that an activated social identity as Heavy Metal fan mediated the effects of the fan status on the recovery experiences psychological detachment and relaxation. A direct effect from the arousal and the fan condition emerged on vitality with no mediating effect of social identity.",Promising Student Papers,Information Systems
2016-1027,2016,Paper Session,Insensitive Players? Playing Violent Video Games Relates to Impaired Recognition of Negative Emotions,4,"The present research investigated the relationship of exposure to violent video games (VVGE) and emotion recognition as key component of empathy. We measured the level of violent video game exposure in hours per day and emotion recognition, and controlled for gender and trait empathy. The results of two studies, one with adolescents (N = 54, Mage = 17.09) and one with adults (N = 137, Mage = 26.06) showed that VVGE was negatively related to the recognition of emotions. Thus, results suggest that VVGE impairs the skill to recognize negative emotions, in particular negative ones, which underlies the ability to build a cognitive representation of other persons’ mental states – a key component of empathy and theory of mind.",The Study of Emotion and Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1028,2016,Paper Session,Is Seeing Really Believing? The Underlying Processes of Involvement Across Print and Audiovisual Narratives,4,"Despite the fact that theory and empirical evidence regarding the underlying processes of narrative persuasion have become a burgeoning area of research in media psychology, limited attention has been given to the role that the channel of story presentation plays in this context. The present study (N = 243) tries to fill this gap by directly comparing narrative involvement across print and audiovisual versions of the same cervical cancer-related story. Though there were no main effects for channel of story presentation (audiovisual vs. print) on narrative consistent attitudes, the mediation analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms of narrative persuasion. Indeed, exposure to the audiovisual narrative was associated with higher levels of cognitive and emotional involvement, than exposure to the exact same narrative in its printed form. Yet, the higher levels of transportation in the audiovisual condition came at a price of enhancing psychological reactance, eliminating the relative advantage of the film narrative. Based on the results, the current study proposes a more refined understanding of narrative involvement that takes into account the unique experiences that different channels of communication provide. Relevant explanations are considered and practical and theoretical implications are discussed.",The Study of Emotion and Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1029,2016,Paper Session,"To Forgive, or Not to Forgive, That is the Question: The Influence of Severity, Blameworthiness, and Commitment on Audiences’ Forgiveness of Media Figures",2,"The present study investigates whether severity, blameworthiness, and commitment can influence audiences’ forgiveness of media figures for their transgressions. Using 2 (severity: high vs. low) × 2 (blameworthiness: high vs. low) × 2 (commitment: high vs. low) mixed design, an experiment was conducted. Severity and blameworthiness were within-subjects factors and commitment was a between-subject factor. Two interaction effects emerged. Severity and blameworthiness had an interaction effect on forgiveness, and blameworthiness strengthens the effect of severity. Blameworthiness and commitment also had an interaction effect on forgiveness. When blameworthiness is high, the difference between the forgiveness of audiences’ favorite figures and the forgiveness of a figure they are less committed to is greater than the difference when blameworthiness is low. All three predictors had significant main effects on forgiveness. Severity of transgressions and blameworthiness of the media figures as perpetrators were negatively associated with forgiveness. Commitment to the PSR with the media figures was positively associated with forgiveness.",The Study of Emotion and Entertainment Media,Mass Communication

Overall, media were spontaneously named as guilty pleasures by approximately half of the sample, with food consumption (e.g., chocolate, snacks) named by approximately half. Three forms of guilty pleasure were evaluated: Procrastination Guilt (the activity displaces other activities), Quality-Based Guilt (the activity is perceived as low quality), and Normative Guilt (other people may disapprove of the activity). Media-based activities were associated with greater procrastination and normative guilt than non-media activities. Although mediated and non-mediated guilty pleasures were associated with equally low levels of appreciation for the activity, mediated activities were associated with higher levels of enjoyment. Results are discussed in terms of issues related to the ubiquity of media entertainment, the importance of multi-tasking, and the reasons behind self-reported guilt.",The Study of Emotion and Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1031,2016,Paper Session,Measuring Media Diet in a High-Choice Environment: Testing the List-Frequency Technique,3,"How to measure exposure to information in the media is highly disputed, primarily due to the difficulties of obtaining accurate self-reports. The growing supply of outlets and proliferation of information sources have added an additional level of complexity to these problems. Reflecting on old and new approaches for measuring exposure to political information it is argued that both the specific source and the frequency of exposure must be taken into account. The validity of this so-called “list-frequency technique” is tested using a two-wave panel survey as well as a split sample experiment from the survey pre-pest to enable comparison with the “list technique”. The results support the list-frequency technique in being the best current solution, since it provides the same aggregate estimates of media use as the already validated list technique, and further is likely to give more detailed effect estimates and increase the explained variance when predicting political knowledge.",Studying News Exposure in the Digital Era,Political Communication

We identify the drivers that influence online exposure to politically relevant information, paying special attention to the level of fragmentation. Using a community detection approach, we determine that the provision of news is highly fragmented, with clear fault lines associated to media ownership structures. The audience network, which reveals no such fragmentation, is only slightly correlated to the media network. We discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical accounts of how digital technologies are reconfiguring the public sphere and we asses recent policy attempts to regulate online content.",Studying News Exposure in the Digital Era,Political Communication

This study aims to provide an answer to this question, with strong causal inference made possible by an innovative field experiment that exploited the customary use of a popular portal website in Japan. By using add-on software installed on the participants’ web browser, we not only digitally recorded their visits to the Yahoo! JAPAN home page but also gained full control over the number of hard news headlines presented on the page. Our three-month experiment produces clear evidence of the positive influence of online news exposure on civic competence. That is, those who are exposed to a greater amount of online hard news learn more about current public affairs, demonstrate greater interest in politics, and are more likely to vote in a national election. Furthermore, a follow-up survey demonstrates a positive influence that persists even two months after the experiment.",Studying News Exposure in the Digital Era,Political Communication

Television news is shown to retain its standing as the dominant information source worldwide. A large majority of the comparisons run for this study (92.3%) reveal TV news to be used more frequently than the other forms of mediated communication (p < .01E-10). A content analysis of media-centered social scientific political communication research published in nine communication journals from 2010 through 2014 indicates growth in this area of study, but a corresponding decline in the attention political communication scholars are giving to television.

At the same time, knowledge and interest are also considered important predictors of news media exposure. This field experiment (N=393) is one of the first to test this double-barreled role of knowledge and interest in a realistic media choice setting. We examine whether pre-existing interest and knowledge predict which individuals can be encouraged to use a newspaper, and if using this newspaper has, in turn, effects on interest and knowledge. Results show that political interest and knowledge are predictors of compliance in the field experiment. We find that knowledge is influenced by the additional news exposure, whereas interest remains stable.",Studying News Exposure in the Digital Era,Political Communication

A survey research in Kashiwazaki City in Niigata Prefecture that hosts a large nuclear plant reveals that residents’ willingness to talk about the nuclear plant and radiation related issues is influenced by residents’ connectedness to the neighborhood storytelling network. The neighborhood storytelling network consists of interpersonal conversation with neighbors about things happening in the neighborhood, participation in community organizations, and connectedness to local media. Civic participation, which has been identified as one of the outcomes of connections to the storytelling network, was found to partially mediate the influence of the storytelling network on the willingness to talk. On the other hand, spiral of silence variables that have mainly been associated with willingness to talk about a controversial issue in past studies did not have significant influence in the current study.","Environmental Narratives: Gender Roles, Citizen Engagement, and Storytelling",Environmental Communication

Yet one key challenge is how to engage the public in ongoing action against climate change at the grassroots and online. This paper examines how narrative repetition through a mantra (an inspirational saying repeated over and over) that originated within the context of a renowned religious non-governmental organization is appropriated to grassroots climate activism. We investigate how mantra (re)citation in mass media, interpersonal, and other complementary digital platforms help mobilize local recycling volunteers around the world and sustain a common vision for environmental care. In doing so, this paper provides valuable insights into discursive and culturally sensitive ways to protect the environment and contributes a fresh interdisciplinary approach to advancing environmental communication research.","Environmental Narratives: Gender Roles, Citizen Engagement, and Storytelling",Environmental Communication

Drawing on data from focus groups and in-depth interviews, this study attempts to examine attitudes among immigrant females toward air pollution and coping strategies toward environmental-health risk. It also explores possible agents for engaging females in future environmental participation. Findings suggest that immigrant females tend to pay a great deal of attention to the smog problem and are highly concerned about environmental health risk. Seven themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) perception of smog; (2) perception of health risk; (3) concern about air pollution; (4) information exchange; (5) female role; (6) escaping from smog; and (7) participation, ideas for solutions. A model is thus proposed to reflect these findings and to further serve as a theoretical basis for future environmental behavior research.","Environmental Narratives: Gender Roles, Citizen Engagement, and Storytelling",Environmental Communication
2016-1039,2016,Paper Session,Ecomasculinity and Ethics of Daring: Bollywood Through an Ecocritical Lens,2,"Scholarly engagement has produced important insights into gender, environment, nature and culture. However, little academic work has been conducted in exploring the positive relationships that may develop between environmentalism and masculinity. Within this context, an ecologized masculinities theory and praxis endorses a shift towards modern men and masculine identities from a ‘culture of daring’ to a ‘culture of caring’. The article maps a course towards this ecologized masculinities theory and praxis as a conceptual and practical means for answering the social and environmental crisis that pervade the malestream world. Using the film Swades (2004) this paper seeks to illustrate the conceptual and practical applications of ecomasculinity that emphasizes on caring. The paper aims to underline the conditions that need to be created for modern men and masculine identities to demonstrate an ethics of caring towards the environment. An ecocritical reading of popular Bollywood films can be useful to identify traces of counter-arguments against hegemonic masculinities and ethics of daring, even within a mainstream media content. Positing eco-masculinity within the wider theoretical matrix of critical men’s studies, this paper seeks to engage with the notion of eco-masculinity from an Indian perspective to explore, in what way this framework may provide an alternative understanding of the interrelationship between the notion of the hegemonic masculinity and a variety of environmental discourses beyond the scope of ecofeminism. The notion of eco-masculinity may provide an important contribution in building a bond between maleness and nature and to produce a more sustainable ecology.","Environmental Narratives: Gender Roles, Citizen Engagement, and Storytelling",Environmental Communication

This assemblage of infant communication is discussed in relation to Mark Deuze’s (2011, 2012) claim that we no longer live with but in media, which challenges modes of media resistance found in medical discourses of ‘exposure’ and restriction (Strasburger and Hogan, 2013), and within strands of media theory (Stiegler, 2010).

2016-1041,2016,Paper Session,"Telemarketing, 800-Numbers, and the Making of the Perpetual Marketplace",1,"In the mid-1960s, AT&T introduced a commercial telephone package called In-WATS, which allowed subscribers to extend toll-free calling to customers. Consumers and audiences came to know In-WATS by another name: the 800-number. This paper examines rise of the 800-number and explores the role it played in recasting the infrastructures of U.S. consumer capitalism and the lived experience of consumer culture in the late 20th century. Because marketers had long understood toll-free calling as not only a means of increasing sales, but also of remaking long-distance shopping patterns around new computer technologies, credit payment systems, and logistical networks, the 800-number very much set the stage for the Amazons and eBays that would soon follow. And likewise, toll-free calling played a major role in reshaping the basic temporal frameworks of consumer culture – introducing U.S. shoppers to a marketplace that promised never to close.",Media Life: Markets and Ethics,Popular Communication
2016-1042,2016,Paper Session,"Ethics, Evolved: An International Perspective on Copying in the Networked Age",1,"A defining characteristic of digital culture is the ability to copy information and reconfigure it as an element of creative expression. While copyright law has little or no accommodation for the resulting emergent cultural forms (aside from the vague and difficult-to-defend “fair use” provision), online communities have developed a range of nuanced ethical frameworks to distinguish between “good” and “bad” copying. This paper examines these ethical frameworks, by analyzing qualitatively and quantitatively the results of a survey fielded in 2014 and 2015 to 1,397 English- speaking adults in 11 different nations in Europe, North America, Africa and the Asia/Pacific region. The survey, which is substantially similar to earlier ones fielded by the author in 2006 and 2010, combines quantitative, multiple-choice questions regarding the prevalence of remix cultural practices and attitudes with qualitative, open-ended, questions in which respondents’ write-in responses reflect their ethical beliefs regarding these practices.",Media Life: Markets and Ethics,Popular Communication

The paper examines 6 South Korea format programs and the role of the production team in the choices that were made for adaptations. It identifies three phases in the cycle of adapting format programs, depending on the decisions of the producers. The adaptations that were found in all the case studies differed by the many situations the format in which was used in, such as the political situation, the brand of the channel airing the format, and what resources were available to the producers.

2016-1044,2016,Paper Session,So Many Communication Technology Options: Communication Media Repertoires as Reifying Hospital Interprofessional Roles,7,"Around the globe, hospitals have undergone many changes in the past few decades. This study focuses on how hospital workers use technology to communicate and coordinate patient care. We rely on the theoretical work on communication media repertoires (CMRs) to analyze our qualitative data. In this free-standing pediatric teaching hospital, CMRs segment physicians into two separate categories: hospitalists and residents. When we observe how the repertoires of different professionals overlap, like they do during the coordination of patient care, we find that interprofessional roles are reified through work flow patterns, anonymity, perceptions of communication media use acceptability, and reliance on others to make decisions. Nurses, the primary patient contact, operate under conditions of sequential interdependence, asking questions and waiting for decisions. The pharmacists process their work in an assembly-line fashion with the goal of maintaining medication safety. While the CMRs of hospitalists and residents are very different, their communication objectives converge in that their repertoires function to get information and make decisions. Our findings suggest that interprofessional teams might consider developing Team CMRs and focus on common goals to overcome repertoire differences.",Technologies at Work,Organizational Communication
2016-1045,2016,Paper Session,The Dual Role of Mobile Technology in Relation to Autonomy and Control,4,"Mobile technologies introduce greater personal freedom and flexibility for employees, while at the same time enabling increased control through managerial use of the technology for monitoring. The findings of our research into the use of Mobile Sales Force Automation (SFA) at a multinational beverage company indicates that this technology is related to an increase of both organizational control and agent autonomy over time. We suggest that the relationship between autonomy and control needs to be re-conceptualized as the shifting of different forms of control between three controllers (the human agent, the organization, and the technology): practice control (over individual work), management control (over employee performance) and process control (over information processing). Technology plays a dual role in relation to autonomy and control as it increasingly becomes responsible for process control duties, leaving professionals more room for practice control (or autonomy), and the organization more room for management control.",Technologies at Work,Organizational Communication

We reviewed the literature of EMR adoption and concluded that there is a dearth of research on the topic from communication research, especially organizational communication. Then we advanced the case that EMR would benefit from being studied as ‘cyberinfrastructure,’ as this framework provides a sophisticated view on EMR. In order to expand on this argument, we describe the four dimensions of organizational, individual, social, and technical, to describe the complexity of EMR as a cyberinfrastructure. Finally, we conclude by proposing the three stages of design, implementation, and analysis as focal processes of EMR diffusion that can be studied by organizational communication researchers.",Technologies at Work,Organizational Communication
2016-1047,2016,Paper Session,In The Wake Of New Media: Strategic Action As Relational Agency,2,"In this article we argue that while there has been an intensified exploration of how organizations strategize in recent years, there seems to be a key component missing, namely questioning who these organizations are. As such, strategic communication implicitly continues to rely on a classical understanding of organizations as “social units (or human groupings) deliberately constructed and reconstructed to seek specific goals” (Etzioni, 1964, p. 3). Assuming rather than exploring who the organization is, we argue, hinders a full exploration of how strategy works. Aiming to tackle this issue, we will first present three ways in which the classical understanding of organizations is being theoretically challenged by organization studies and empirically challenged by new media. Then we examine how the reconceptualization of the organization influences the concept of strategic communication. Finally, we discuss how this affects the notion of strategic action, asking what strategic action is and who performs it.",Technologies at Work,Organizational Communication

U.S. National Football League team captain Tom Brady held a press conference in January 2015 during a major sports scandal. This served as our stimulus for measuring people’s reactions to a speaker equivocating in crisis communication. We experimentally manipulated versions of the press conference, one with all the equivocal parts (e.g., “I don’t know, I have no idea”), and one with those parts removed. Outcome measures included source credibility and perceptions of dodging questions. Results supported predictions of strategic ambiguity and equivocation theory. When the organization's spokesperson equivocated, participants perceived him to have more goodwill. Furthermore, his equivocal responses were not perceived as dodging the questions.",Powerful Explorations: Public Relations Theory,Public Relations

Building a Theory of CSR Communication on Meso and Macro Level,1,"This conceptual paper asks for elements towards a theory of CSR communication to describe and explain different forms of CSR engagement on organizational meso and a societal macro level.
The approach starts with a literature review on CSR and CSR communication research that is arranged according to the main stakeholder groups
This paper combines approaches of new sociological institutionalism (CSR research) and system theory (PR research). This connection brings together both areas and uses the strengths of each theory. Core terms and core concepts of PR research are implemented.
CSR is a management concept. Beyond that obvious insight, CSR communication is part of communication management, whereas the operative tasks of it (e.g. CSR reports) are part of PR/communication departments. Moreover, literature review identifies two different perspectives on CSR communication: (1) an organisational view as part of communication management; and (2) a public-oriented view as part of a public discourse. Combining both perspectives, CSR and CSR communication can be described and explained as a public rationalized myth that is reflected differently in the organisational construction of reality.
This conceptual paper brings together theoretical concepts and empirical findings. The combination of theories is able to explain CSR communication on an organisational level and to describe on macro level the differences of organisations, industries, and countries.",Powerful Explorations: Public Relations Theory,Public Relations

The purpose of this explication is to show how their theories can add breadth, depth, and specificity to discussions of ethical dilemmas that practitioners face. In particular, pluralistic theories can make the following contributions to public relations ethics. First, they remind us that there is more to ethics than choosing the right duties and actions. Second, they reveal the diversity of goods that people value, as well as the complexities involved in ranking these goods. Third, they emphasize that different goods require different strategies of justification. Finally, they can either help us find new ways to resolve ethical dilemmas or help us see why such resolutions are not possible.",Powerful Explorations: Public Relations Theory,Public Relations

Numerous studies have suggested that psychological distance can influence people’s cognitions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. However, few attempts have been made to examine psychological distance’s potential for public relations theory and practice as a predictor of supportive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward communication campaigns. Therefore, this study conceptualizes psychological distance within the context of Construal level Theory (CLT) to examine the relationship between psychological distance and public attitudes and participation intentions related to a social issue campaign. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the proposed relationships. Results reveal salience, knowledge, and relevance are strong indicators of overall cognitive distance, whereas emotional connectedness and empathy are strong determinants of emotional distance. Cognitive distance and emotional distance were found to have a significant and positive effect on attitudes and behavioral intentions.",Powerful Explorations: Public Relations Theory,Public Relations

The primary objectives of this study are to explore what considerations and purposes are copyright regulation created for during the emerging video website market in China, and how do the relevant regulation measures affect the development of video websites and the industrial market outlook in China. The results of this study indicated that, in terms of video website copyright regulation applied by China during different stages of developments, China uses different corresponding control directions in order to achieve different political and economic objectives. Ultimately, copyright regulation has three actual effects in China: (1) it is an important means of political control over the video website market; (2) it is a powerful market competition strategy and tool; and (3) it is an effective means to achieving capital benefits.","Privacy, Copyright, and Piracy",Media Industry Studies

Though unauthorized and unlicensed, the programs are streamed and downloaded on tablets and smart phones, free of charge. Zimuzu allows many thousands of Chinese viewers to devour foreign fare, thus sidestepping official channels of distribution, and control. Why do they do it? How does it work? Who do they reach? What kinds of reward can they claim? And why is China the world’s leader in online subtitling? We assess explanations that range from a neo-liberal work ethic to “serious leisure” pursuits, from networked communication to grey market media. We propose it is best to understand Zimuzu within spheres of media marketization; Zimuzu typifies slippage between state regulation and market-driven media consumption. And there are deeper layers of networked subjectivity, related perhaps to Chinese practices of gift economy, exchange and “face”.","Privacy, Copyright, and Piracy",Media Industry Studies

Moreover, it is examined how viewing motivations, habits of use, and attitudes towards digital piracy and the motion picture industry are related to the willingness to pay for online video services. Therefore, an online-survey (n = 292) was conducted, containing conjoint tasks and direct measures. Results suggest that the choice of online video platforms mainly depends on their price models, novelty of their range of movies and series, and language options. A viewing habit such as pursuing secondary activities while watching videos does not lead to lower but higher willingness to pay for online video content. While positive attitudes towards digital piracy are related to a lower willingness to pay as well as a likeliness to deny authorized online video services, participants with anti-industry attitudes are less likely to deny the proposed video platform options.","Privacy, Copyright, and Piracy",Media Industry Studies

It will be argued that the image of the ‘occupied square’ helps to connect the indignados to both local and global publics of equally disaffected ordinary citizens who reject the old politics. By directing the analytical lens to the indignados’ symbolic communication and visual expression, it is possible to understand the occupation of city squares as a political performance directed to a global audience. We will see that the iconic image of the occupied square resonates with global audiences because its meanings tap on a repertoire of culturally shared representations of non-violent occupations of urban space in the twentieth-century that is powerfully embedded in western public memory.","The Visual Powers of Place, Space, and Landscape",Visual Communication Studies
2016-1058,2016,Paper Session,The City as Medium of Revolution? Beirut Graffiti and the Syrian Uprising,1,"This paper explores Beirut graffiti as a medium of social and political activism, culminating with the explosion of Syrian revolutionary graffiti since 2011. As the Syrian uprising, which started in March 2011, devolved into a protracted, bloody war, Beirut emerged as a proxy space for Syrian revolutionary activists and regime supporters. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Beirut between June 2011 and June 2012, which yielded a massive collection of graffiti related to the Syrian revolution, this paper revolves around two issues.
First, it identifies body symbolism as a key modality of revolutionary graffiti, through which activist directly attack the body of the dictator, and situates this tendency in a larger pattern of Beirut activist graffiti in which the body is central that preceded the Syrian revolution.
Second, the paper argues that stencil graffiti, which dominated Syrian revolutionary graffiti in Beirut, is particularly suited for a revolutionary situation.
Third, this paper shows how revolutionary graffiti is often the work of anonymous collectives, and focuses on one such group, “The Syrian People Know Their Way.”
Finally, the paper advocates going beyond approaches to graffiti and street art that see them as monological expressions of aesthetic, social or political messages, and argues for a renewed understanding of graffiti as a dialogical space of argument and contestation.","The Visual Powers of Place, Space, and Landscape",Visual Communication Studies

It looks as at the way in which three different communities engage with the statue, including the artist, Fremont residents, and Fremont’s tourist community, have engaged with the statue in a variety of contexts. Through the use of interviews, visual analysis, and the examination of press articles and online message boards, it finds that the kind of engagement an individual has with the statue shapes the way in which they understand the relationship between ideology, art, and public space. These various engagements are both spatially and temporally bounded, and that these boundaries influence the way in which the statue is understood.","The Visual Powers of Place, Space, and Landscape",Visual Communication Studies
2016-1060,2016,Paper Session,The Tragedy of Landscape: Walking the Migrant Path from Italy to France,1,This essay and the photographs examine visual traces of irregular mobility in the border landscape between Italy and France. The ruined buildings and objects witness decades of movement of undocumented people on this old migrant path across the mountains. By taking the theoretical concept of multidirectional memory (Rothberg 2009) the essay argues that the Path of Hope can be thought of as a memory site through which the issues of migration in contemporary Europe can be seen in a more sustainable light. The ruins and discarded objects link memories of different places – including different border zones – in ways that allow us to critically examine borders as a practice – rather than as existing dividing lines. Reading visuality of this border zone allows one to imagine a migrant’s vision of the landscape.,"The Visual Powers of Place, Space, and Landscape",Visual Communication Studies

Messages compete for attention in order to construct and maintain culture, making space in crowded urban centers a valuable commodity. As Starbucks expands throughout the globe, how do the coffeehouse locations change the cultural space? For this exploratory investigation, Starbucks stores from three different continents are reviewed for their visual communication details in attempt to understand the Western-based company’s impact on local cultures. The qualitative study uses a constant comparison approach with literature of architectural communication, visual culture, visual economy, and Disneyfication concepts as a framework for theoretical development.","The Visual Powers of Place, Space, and Landscape",Visual Communication Studies
2016-1062,2016,Paper Session,Attribute Agenda-Setting and Affective Priming in the 2011 Seoul Mayoral Election: How Media Descriptions of Candidate Attributes Affect Political Decision-Making,2,"The present study offers new theoretical and empirical advancements to the fields of attribute agenda-setting and affective-priming hypotheses with the data from the 2011 Seoul mayoral election. By combining a content analysis of the candidate coverage in seven major news outlets and an exit poll of voters (N = 690) on Election Day, the present study directly explicates the relationships between the cognitive and affective components of candidate attributes most accessible in one’s minds, their feelings toward the two mayoral candidates, and vote choice among actual voters who have just cast their ballots. It also explores how these relationships differ depending on the level of individuals’ news media exposure. By so doing, the study clearly illustrates that mediated political campaigns influence public opinion and behavior not only through cognitive priming but also through affective priming. That is, campaign news can semantically prime certain aspects of candidate images while eliciting affective reactions to those aspects through its evaluative tones. In this process, cognitions and affective tones highlighted by the news media interactively influence political judgments.",The Agenda-Setting Role of Old and New Media,Political Communication

Individual-level analysis of the 2012 American National Election Studies (ANES) combined with content analysis of three TV channels supported the hypothesized sequence from TV news attention to issue voting. Agenda setting contributed to issue-based voting by increasing the value of issue proximity. The effects of agenda setting were expanded to include the behavior of vote choice. Issues were found to be a more compelling predictor of real vote choice among people who were more susceptible to agenda setting due to greater attention paid to TV news.,The Agenda-Setting Role of Old and New Media,Political Communication

A Panel Study of Agenda-Setting Effects at the Individual Level,1,"Traditional media effect theories as agenda-setting theory have recently been questioned due to the development of the media environment with media fragmentation and individualized media consumption. Other scholars disagree and suggest that a distinction has to be made between actual agenda-setting effects and the ease with which they can be measured. Given this scholarly discussion the purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the agenda-setting effects of different media consumption measures on individual issue salience. The study is based on a panel survey that includes different measures of consumption: (1) general news media attention, (2) exposure to different media types such as traditional news media, online news media, and political social media. Overall, the findings suggest that general news media attention might be a more significant measure for consumption in a high-choice media environment. In essence, this study suggests that agenda-setting effects are not becoming non-significant but rather difficult to measure.",The Agenda-Setting Role of Old and New Media,Political Communication

Intermedia Agenda-Setting Online: The Case of NSA,3,"Since the early introduction of the notion of agenda-setting, researchers have attempted to determine the factors that shape media agendas. One of the key sources of media agenda has been identified as intermedia flow, which various studies revealed in the traditional offline-to-traditional online-to-new online media context. While most of them focused on the offline-online flow, the present study examines agenda-setting within the new online platforms in various countries, thus allowing for cross-country and cross-media comparisons. We applied time-series analysis to new online media and to traditional online media samples in the context of Edward Snowden's NSA revelations. Our findings of inter-media agenda-setting effects show a moderate but consistent flow from new online media to traditional online media. This highlights the importance of studying these new directions of agenda flow. Apart from that, no profound agenda-setting patterns can be found elsewhere. Possible reasons and implications are discussed.",The Agenda-Setting Role of Old and New Media,Political Communication

Recent studies have shown that, contrary to the expectations, Digital Natives have low levels of IL. In order to improve IL of Digital Natives formal education and training related to IL is required. In practice, in order to support systematic education and training related to IL from an early age, the development of IL is increasingly considered as an important goal for schools. However, one major obstacle for considering IL in secondary schools is a lack of a scientifically proven model to operationalize and measure IL particularly in schools. The paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing and empirically testing the 7i framework for modelling and measuring IL in secondary schools.","News, Journalism, and Information Literacy",Children Adolescents and the Media

The Internet literacy is conceptualized as skill, information and creation dimensions and the effects of each dimension is evaluated. The positive effects of skill and information literacy are confirmed even after controlling for the level of political interest. In contrast, creation literacy, which has been highlighted as a key engine that moves the participatory culture, has significantly negative effects. We also find out that that the creation literacy has a negative effect on civic engagement only when it is not accompanied by certain level of information literacy. The study confirms the important role of internet literacy and especially that of information literacy. In addition, this study unfolds that our understanding of the power of the creative agency that the Internet has afforded may have been over-evaluated and points to the need for further research.","News, Journalism, and Information Literacy",Children Adolescents and the Media

Nevertheless, a closer look on children’s daily lives shows a surprisingly gender segregated reality. The paper studies the Norwegian news media aimed at children, Aftenposten junior and Supernytt , and their take on gender and equality. The analysis includes a quantitative study of the sources’ gender, status and age, and a qualitative study of how girls and boys are portrayed, combined with the recurrent topics. The findings show that the news media directly aimed at children expose larger differences within the ‘gender boxes’ that separate girls and boys, than between them, and the gender roles are even more diversified than in Norwegian news for adults. Both Supernytt and Aftenposten junior address children first of all as citizens defined from a broad range of interests, whereas gender comes second or is not even relevant at all.","News, Journalism, and Information Literacy",Children Adolescents and the Media

Factors at individual, school, and country level were taken into account by applying three-level multi-level analyses on 65 countries, using PISA data from 2009. At the individual level, findings indicate that both parental education and reading climate at the parental home affect adolescents’ news reading behavior positively. In addition, adolescent’s individual reading attitudes mediate the relation between reading climate at the parental home and offline and online news reading. Regarding school characteristics, results showed that if schools lay more emphasis on the importance to keep abreast of the news in their curriculum, their pupils are more likely to read both offline and online news. Lastly, findings indicate that the extent to which a country is characterized by a democratic landscape does not affect offline and online news reading.","News, Journalism, and Information Literacy",Children Adolescents and the Media

Using a national online survey of public relations practitioners in the U.S. (N = 838), our findings reveal significant results, suggesting that trust has a strong and significant direct effect on job satisfaction. More importantly, our findings identify that such strong trust-satisfaction relation is mediated simultaneously by practitioners’ job engagement and leadership performance as demonstrated by their communication leaders. Organizational culture and support further moderate the engagement- and leadership-mediated trust-satisfaction relation. All the indirect effects explained by the moderator and mediators address the importance of understanding the complicated institutional environment in trusting building and satisfaction enhancement among public relations practitioners.

To fill in the gap, this study takes an interdisciplinary and synthetic approach to reconceptualize trust as publics’ commitment in the relationship based on their expectation of the organization’s trustworthiness, namely, ability, benevolence, reliability, fairness, and transparency. The interdisciplinary and synthetic approach not only specifies aspects of organizational trustworthiness from management, business studies, political science, mainstream communication effectiveness research, and risk communication, but also justifies that commitment manifests publics’ willingness to take a risk in the relationship based on the organization’s trustworthiness according to theoretical contentions and empirical findings in interpersonal commitment, public relations, and relationship marketing.

A Reflection on the Vision of Public Relations,1,"Drawing upon the concept of social capital, trust in public relations research is categorized into four types: 1) a bonding social capital serving organizations’ interests; 2) a bonding social capital facilitating the mutual benefits of organizations and their publics; 3) a bonding social capital advancing social wellbeing; and 4) a bridging social capital contributing to social wellbeing. Based on the role of public relations in society, the number of articles fallen into each category suggests that a pragmatic orientation toward trust has been playing a major role in public relations research, whereas either the ideal or radical orientation is emerging as a new research direction. Given the crucial status of trust, the article concludes that the vision of public relations is gradually extending from immediate and instrumental concerns focusing on organizations’ interests to wider possibilities such as helping solve various issues in a small community or in the greater society.",The Power of Trust in Public Relations,Public Relations

2016-1075,2016,Paper Session,A Self-Determination Perspective of Online Health Information: The Internet vs. Face-to-Face Office Visits With Physicians,2,"This study elucidates the experiential and motivational aspects of online health
information beyond the theoretically limited instrumental perspective that dominates extant
literature. Based on a sample of 993 online health information seekers in India, the survey found
that online health information seeking offers individuals greater autonomy, competence, and
relatedness compared to face-to-face office visits with physicians. Individuals are motivated by a
control of one’s actions, validation of one’s skills and competencies, and a feeling of connection
with others who shaped one’s decisions. These three psychological needs, which motivate
individuals to pursue what they innately seek for as human beings, help explain why individuals
turn online for health information. A regression analysis found that two variables, Autonomy and
Relatedness, significantly predicted online health information seeking. Competence was not a
significant predictor, due to competency issues faced by individuals in interpreting,
understanding and making use of online health information. The findings, which do not suggest
that online health information seeking would displace physicians as many have feared, offer
promise for an integrated system of care. Office visits with physicians would necessarily evolve
into an expanded communicative space of health information seeking instead of an alternative
channel for health information.

2016-1078,2016,Paper Session,The Role of Phatic Communication Between Diabetes Patients and Their Physicians,2,"Patient-centered care relies on the premise that patients are given the opportunity to express their concerns and ask questions during visits with care providers. While there is a substantial amount of work illustrating the benefits of effective communication in provider-patient settings, little has been done to tease out the actual issues that are discussed in these conversations. This study applied Relational Framing Theory to assess the range of issues discussed in conversations between diabetes patients and their physicians, and measured the extent to which these issues were resolved. Forty transcripts (a subset of a larger corpus; Cegala, 1997; Cegala, Street, & Clinch, 2007) were coded for medical issues (medication, pain, blood work, skin conditions, and diagnostics) and social issues (family/spouse concerns, diet and exercise, disability concerns, and phatic communication). Analyses revealed that phatic communication and discussion about medication and pain dominated the interactions. Approximately one-third of the utterances were coded as phatic communication and, perhaps most importantly, the phatic communication seemed to impact the ability to acknowledge and help resolve patients’ medical issues. We discuss these findings from a Relational Framing Theory perspective and elaborate on the role that phatic communication plays in conversations between physicians and diabetes patients.",Provider-Patient and Other Hospital-Based Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-1079,2016,Paper Session,The Strength and Form of L1 Discursive Features of HIV/AIDS Consultations in South Africa,1,"Abstract:
This study addresses a gap in medical research, especially in the field of HIV/AIDS, namely, a lack of sufficient data-driven analytical investigation into the linguistic and conversational nature of doctor-patient communication in English as lingua franca (ELF) in a multilingual setting as obtains in South Africa. It is a qualitative analytical study that investigates the use of ELF between doctors and patients with different L1s in different HIV/AIDS clinics in the Western Cape Province. The data consist of transcribed audio-recording of HIV/AIDS consultations conducted in ELF. Both Discourse analysis (DA) and Conversation analysis (CA) were used to decipher the socio-cultural role and the form that ELF takes in HIV/AIDS interactions, and to understand the organizational structure of the consultation in terms of turns and the different types of repair strategies. From the DA perspective, the results reveal characteristic linguistic features of ELF usage like borrowing, linguistic transference from L1, the use of analogy, code-switching and local metaphors, all resulting from processes of indigenization and hybridization. Meanwhile, the CA reveals the pre-selection and recurrent speakership patterns in turn organization that makes the doctor unavoidably the dominant partner as s/he even in L1-L1 situations is more knowledgeable with the disease and thus determines the course of the consultation by initiating more turns, asking most of the questions and often unilaterally deciding on topic changes. The patient is mostly portrayed as a docile participant who takes very little, if any initiative to communicate his/her views and desires, often only responding being addressed by the doctor. The study therefore shows that there are some linguistic and socio-cultural specificities of HIV/AIDS consultations that show that the interactants get strength from appropriating ELF.

With recourse to the concepts self-disclosure, disinhibition and social identity this study explores user behavior in anonymous communication environments. In contrast to other empirical approaches, online disinhibition is conceptualized multi-dimensionally: Besides negative effects (e.g., flaming, bullying), anonymity is expected to foster prosocial behavior and self-disclosure. Finally, a complementary mixed-method research design was developed that integrated a quantitative content analysis (N = 2542) and a user survey (N = 1177). The key findings indicate four dimensions of disinhibited behavior in the analyzed anonymous communication scenario: prosocial behavior, rude behavior, antisocial behavior and the communication about taboo topics.

This is an interesting context because criticism is swiftly and harshly punished—thus highly stigmatized—with the anticipation of contagion of negative outcomes associated with criticizing the regime. Family are punished for the others’ actions, which influences every stage of the disclosure and turbulence process. Applying a multi-theoretical framework of Communication Privacy Management Theory, the Cycle of Concealment Model, and the Revelation Risk Model, this qualitative study (n=29) finds that disclosure concealment from family members is based on anticipated response and maintaining visibility is paramount for concealment. .

Results showed significant three-way interaction effects on changes in attitude toward and on changes in intention to drink. When there was greater freedom of choice, messages that did not include an expected reward tended to have a boomerang effect on non-binge drinkers, whereas the same messages tended to have a persuasive effect on binge drinkers.

Through a content analysis of 800 Instagram posts, it assessed the way in which both communities conveyed their social identities and provided social support. Findings showed that fat acceptance members identified with their community through hashtags related to positivity and self-love, while pro-anorexics identified with their community through posts related to “thinsperation” and negativity. Members of the fat acceptance community distinguished against outsiders by attempting to reframe beauty, while members of the pro-anorexic community distinguished against outsiders by arguing with recovered anorexics. Lastly, both communities provided support by complimenting users’ appearances and by providing informational resources on how to maintain one’s body image.

Factors Affecting the Intention to Use Smartwatch,1,"Smartwatch, among many form factors, has become an important starting point for wearable device’s wide dissemination. Smartwatch is not only a new form of IT product, but also a daily fashion product. Viewing smartwatch as the converging point of IT innovation and fashion product, current study examines whether factors germane to the characteristics of fashion product affect the intention to use smartwatch. Utilizing technology acceptance model (TAM) as the base framework, current study extended the model with perceived enjoyment and perceived self-expressiveness, which are influenced by individuals’ vanity and need for uniqueness. The findings from 562 Korean respondents indicated that smartwatch’s characteristics as fashion product significantly explain the intention to use smartwatch, especially the individual’s need for uniqueness. Limited effect of one’s vanity to self-expressiveness implies that smartwatch is not yet deemed as a luxury commodity.

2016-1093,2016,Paper Session,To Gamificate or Not to Gamificate? An Experimental Study of the Influence of Badges on Motivation and Behavior in an Online Learning Course,2,"In the last years, the implementation of game elements, like badges, in non-game environments has gained more and more attention (Butler, 2014). In this study, we tested whether badges which could be received for successful task performance and specific activities within an e-learning course in a higher education setting have an impact on students´ motivation and performance. In a between-subjects experimental setting, students were randomly assigned to three different conditions (no badges, badges that were visible to peers, badges that were only visible to themselves).
The results show that badges have less impact on motivation and performance than is commonly assumed. Independent of condition, results reveal a decrease of students’ intrinsic motivation over time. Against expectations, those badges that can merely be viewed by oneself are evaluated as more positive compared to those that can also be viewed by others.",Motivations for Technology Adoption and Use,Communication and Technology
2016-1094,2016,Paper Session,Colonial Diva and Unclaimed Memory: The Unheard Voice of a Modern Girl as Cultural Icon,1,"Lee Erisu, often referred to as the “Diva of the Century,” was the one of the first popular singers and Shinpa actresses in Korea under Japanese rule with the release of Ruins of Hwangsŏng in 1927. She recorded popular songs in both Imperial Japan and Korea which confirmed her status as a cultural icon of inter-Asian colonial modernity. A legendary recital of Ruins of Hwangsŏng in 1933 instigated collective mourning for Korea as the “ruined country” and provoked anti-Japanese patriotism. Lee also typified the modern woman figure and the concept of free love. In 1932, at the pinnacle of her career, Lee disappeared from the entertainment industry and tried to commit a suicide with a married man she loved. Seventy-five years later, she was found in a sanitarium at the age of 98, oblivious to the past. As a study of cultural memory, this paper focuses on Lee Erisu’s life and the ways in which her records addressed embedded structures of Japanese colonialism, the impact of Lee’s stardom on socio-cultural values, and the invention of a modern, female subjectivity. By tracing untouched narratives of Lee’s career and music, this paper articulates various discourses of acoustic modernity, modern free love as an ambivalent sense of desire and reversion, and accounts of audience reception to her music as both passive resistance to, and ambivalent desire for, colonial modernity.",Images of Women Across Cultures,Intercultural Communication

2016-1096,2016,Paper Session,Achieving Cultural Pluralism? Selective Inclusion of Female Muslim Figures in the News,1,"Negative Muslim stereotypes have appeared in Western mainstream media over the years; intensifying after the events of 9/11; a barrier to intercultural communication as audiences are influenced by biased media coverage. However, emerging alongside these negative media frames are several non-traditional Muslim figures creating a counter-narrative to Islamophobia. This qualitative frame analysis of 132 newspaper articles identifies how two prominent female Muslim figures are portrayed in Western media: Comic superhero Ms. Marvel Kamala Khan and former Danish political candidate Asmaa Abdol-Hamid. Results indicate that positive and negative frames are dependent on the figure’s level of religiosity, creating both a rejection of varied ideologies or pluralism and selective inclusion of the figures. Regardless of negative or positive frames, both figures are defined within the context of their religion and are considered by some as either too liberal or too conservative.",Images of Women Across Cultures,Intercultural Communication
2016-1097,2016,Paper Session,"Culturally-Situated Femininity: Language, Identity, and Gender Role Negotiation in Taiwan",1,"This paper compares the use of a specific Mandarin Chinese term of femininity in traditional Chinese popular literature and modern texts circulating in current Taiwan. The native term that represents the dominant feminine feature in modern Taiwan is sajiao and this paper aims to explore its literal and contextual meanings. Reviewing these textual records, it becomes clear that, the connotative meanings of this term in the past differs from the current understandings of sajiao in Taiwan, which makes Taiwan a unique Mandarin speech community and reveals the internal struggle in shaping Taiwanese identity. In traditional Chinese literature, prostitutes, concubines, and unvirtuous wives were depicted negatively in the context of sajiao. However, women in all ranks in Taiwan nowadays are encouraged to perform sajiao as a necessary skill to express their femininity. By comparing and analyzing the texts about sajiao, this paper shows that the performance of sajiao is believed to become an important criterion in evaluating a woman’s femininity in contemporary Taiwan and a hybrid cultural identity has been established through this everyday language.",Images of Women Across Cultures,Intercultural Communication
2016-1098,2016,Paper Session,"A Cross-National Comparison in the Relationship Between Habitual Media Use and the Perception of ""Healthy"" and ""Frail"" Thin Ideals Across US and Korean College Students",1,"The present study investigated the underlying factors of thin ideals and tested if the structures are invariant across US and Korea. Also, the study examined if US and Korean women perceive factors of ideal thinness in different manner, by testing the strength of each attribute across countries. Further, in order to test 2nd-order cultivation process related to thin ideals, relationships between habitual thin ideal media use and the potential factors of ideal thinness were tested and compared cross-nationally. EFA results indicated that ideal thinness is constructed by two factors, healthy thinness and frail thinness in both US and Korea. In cross-cultural comparison, it was found that US participants more strongly linked thin ideal to most attributes (toned/fit, healthy/in good shape, strong/muscular, small/petite, and slender/extreme skinny) than Korean women, except ‘weak/frail’. Lastly, results indicated that habitual thin ideal media (in Korea) was related to both ‘healthy’ and ‘weak’ thin ideal. Habitual media use (in U.S.) predicted only ‘weak’ thin ideal whereas no effects were found between media use and ‘healthy’ thin ideal. Strength of associations between media and factors of thin ideals were higher among Korean women than US women, however, the differences (Critical ratio of difference) were not all significant.",Images of Women Across Cultures,Intercultural Communication

We analyzed the influence on print newspapers across three years (1996, 2008 and 2013) and compared influence on print and online newspapers in 2013. Results indicate that the influence of ANP on print newspapers only increased slightly. Online newspapers, however, depend heavily on ANP and are highly similar as a result of it. We draw conclusions pertaining to the gatekeeping role of news agencies in the digital age in general, and in the context of the Netherlands in particular. Additionally, we demonstrate that techniques from the field of information retrieval can be used to perform these analyses on a large scale. Our scripts and instructions are provided online to stimulate the use of these techniques in communication studies.","What is ""News Content""?

2016-1101,2016,Paper Session,Economic News for the Public Interest or Promotion of Commercial Interests? Changes in Economic News Over the Past 20 Years in South Korea,2,"The purpose of this study is to examine how economic news has changed over the past 20 years under the pressure of financial crises experienced by newspaper organizations in South Korea. A content analysis of 2,442 news articles published in South Korea's three daily newspapers with the highest circulation showed that between 1994 and 2014 the topics and sources of economic news changed significantly. Specifically, topics that address the broad economy decreased while economic news about individual corporations and potential newspaper advertisers increased dramatically. For the same time period, use of corporate executives as news sources rose while the use of government sources declined. When it comes to the media’s watchdog role in reporting economic issues, a meaningful difference was found between topics related to the general economy and topics related to individual companies. News articles about the general economy were more critical than news about individual businesses; moreover, news articles about the general economy became progressively more negative over the same 20-year period compared to stories about individual companies. The results of this study indicate how economic journalism may be marginalizing topics of the general economy that are of public interest while promoting news about individual companies as a way to indirectly increase the revenue of newspaper organizations from corporate advertising.

2016-1102,2016,Paper Session,Journalism as Multichannel Communication: A Study on the Use of Social Media in German Newsrooms,3,"The main objective of the present study was to systematize the uses of social media in journalism and explore empirically the profiles of different social media. Based on theoretical considerations and a review of literature, five dimensions with 24 special tasks for using social media in journalism were distinguished. In an online survey, editors-in-chief of German Internet newsrooms (n=105) were asked about the use and appropriateness of social media. Results show, that Facebook and Twitter are the Swiss clasp knives of journalism. They are used for many tasks, but may not be the perfect tool for every job. In contrast, blogs and YouTube are specialized tools. Editors-in-chief see the different qualities of social media channels, and their answers are highly consistent. They seem to have already learned to understand the differences within social media. However, they are not always able to utilize social media in the best possible way.","What is ""News Content""?

While rich and informative, the research offers discrete insights into an array of research questions, but lacks a comprehensive account of the larger picture that emerges. With this in mind, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for evaluating and understanding UGC’s roles in professional news websites. Based on a synthesis of accumulated research, we differentiate between the realm of journalism as a business and a practice; and the realm of democratic citizenship, wherein news media may play an important role as a public sphere and a means of political empowerment. The paper offers a comprehensive look at key findings and themes arising from existing UGC research, along with an array of examples. We conclude with key findings and point to those areas that require further attention.","What is ""News Content""? Perspectives on Texts and Production",Journalism Studies

A Quasiexperimental Study of Corrections at Five Newspapers Before and After Outsourcing of All Copy Editing,2,"This study tests the assumption that outsourcing copy editing harms accuracy, and content analyzed all corrected errors in five newspapers in a full year both before and after the outsourcing of all copy editing operations (N=3,255), while controlling for each newspaper’s changes in circulation. The authors identified five newspapers in the U.S. and Canada that outsourced all their copy editing either to parent-company editing centers in other states or cities (in the cases of the Hartford Courant, C.T.; Raleigh News & Observer, N.C.; Winston-Salem Journal, N.C.; Newport News, V.A. Daily Press) or a firm external to the newspaper company but based in the same city (Toronto Star). Results do not support the suppositions of some industry observers that outsourcing copy editing uniformly harms accuracy. The Daily Press experienced a significant increase in accuracy, that is, a fall in the number of average daily corrections. Average corrections did rise significantly at the News & Observer, but were unchanged at the other newspapers. In terms of specific corrections, mathematical errors following outsourcing, while visual and layout errors increased.","What is ""News Content""?

2016-1105,2016,Paper Session,Algorithms and Collective Action: Between Collective Identity and Visibility,1,"How does the algorithmically mediated environment of social media re-structure social action? This paper combines social movement studies and science and technology studies to investigate how social media mediate the organization, unfolding, and diffusion of contemporary protests. It examines how activists leverage the technical properties of social media to develop a joint narrative and a collective identity, and offers the notion of cloud protesting as a theoretical approach and framework for empirical analysis. Cloud protesting indicates a specific type of mobilization is grounded on, modeled around, and enabled by social media platforms and mobile devices and the virtual universes they identify. It emphasizes both the importance of activists’ sense-making activities, and the productive mediation of social and mobile media. The article shows how the specific materiality of social media intervenes in the actors’ sense-making activities by fostering four mechanisms—namely performance, interpellation, temporality, and reproducibility—which concur to create a ‘politics of visibility’ that alters traditional identity dynamics. In addition, it exposes the connection between organizational patterns and the role of individuals, explaining how the politics of visibility is the result of a process that originates and ends within the individual—which ultimately creates individuals-in-the-group rather than groups.",Collective Action and Digital Advocacy,Global Communication and Social Change

With the term fake accounts I refer to humorous social media accounts that satirize a politician or a political organization through impersonation. I examine two different models that we can use to assess the role of user-generated satire: satire as fandom and satire as activism. Through in-depth interviews I explore the motivations and the relationship with Italian politics of a sample of fake accounts creators. The results show that most of the satirists interviewed here consider satire as a form of activism and even those who do not, still recognize the subversive nature of satire. Furthermore, a majority of the interviewees have complex biographies of activism that predate the creation of the fake accounts. For a smaller number of them, the fake accounts have also provided new possibilities to engage in activism away-from-keyboard.",Collective Action and Digital Advocacy,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-1107,2016,Paper Session,Advocacy Repertoires and the Contentious Politics of Network Neutrality,1,"Over the course of nearly fifteen years network neutrality grew from an insider regulatory debate to the most commented on issue in the history of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The history of effective media policy advocacy reveals the critical role of targeting institutions (Dunbar-Hester, 2009, 2014; McChesney, 2005; Pickard, 2014, 2015a) but research can be advanced by investigating advocacy in relation to the process of public policy development (Kingdon, 2011; Flew, 2014), rather than merely in relation to outcomes, to better document how advocacy leads to political change. This article incorporates contentious politics (Tilly & Tarrow, 2006; Tarrow, 2011) as an approach for investigating advocacy (Lang, 2012; Author, 2014) to analyze repertoires of public and institutional advocacy and introduce the explosive growth of digitally enabled crossover advocacy that influenced the passing of network neutrality regulations in the United States.",Collective Action and Digital Advocacy,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-1108,2016,Paper Session,The Strategic Advocate in the Digital Storm: How International NGOs Pursue Publicity Online,1,"This paper examines how and in what ways international humanitarian and human rights groups use digital tools to pursue publicity. Drawing on fieldwork research and interviews with professionals working at leading organizations, it finds that digital tools are used primarily to attract the attention of journalists and to promote and protect organizational brands. Public engagement, by contrast, is largely neglected. While this media-driven approach carries risks (e.g., ignoring issues not on the media agenda), it also provides advocacy groups with the opportunity to graft humanitarian and human rights frames onto existing news coverage, which may diversify global news. These findings suggest that use of digital tools is neither as revolutionary as some suggest, nor as regressive as others worry. Instead, it reflects the pragmatic orientation of strategic advocates trying to maximize positive publicity while minimizing negative coverage in a fluid and chaotic information environment.",Collective Action and Digital Advocacy,Global Communication and Social Change

Examining Third-Person Perceptions of Pre-Election Polls,1,"In this study we examine voters’ third-person perceptions of pre-election polls and we focus on polls’ influence on electorates’ voting choices specifically. We argued that perceptions of polls’ influence on voting behavior should be measured by a bipolar scale, ranged from the underdog effect, to no effect, and to the bandwagon effect. In general, voters believed that others’ voting choices were more likely to be influenced by pre-election polls than their own voting choices. They perceived not only the bandwagon effect but also the underdog effect in pre-election polls. Perceived poll influence on the self was found more toward the underdog effect than perceived poll influence on others when voters’ favored candidate was losing in the polls. Perceived poll influence on the self was found more toward the bandwagon effect than perceived poll influence on others when voters’ favored candidate was in the lead in the polls. In addition, we found that the magnitude of third-person differentials was associated with voters’ support for media restrictions on pre-election polls. We concluded that voters supported media restrictions to prevent from an election outcome that they didn’t like.",Advances in Third-Person Effects Research,Mass Communication

When there is reasonably valid and accurate information regarding (self vis-à-vis other) media consumption and vulnerability to media influence, the associated self-other gaps in media effects are not exaggerations, hence, not TPP.

Analyses used a robust specification of self-other asymmetric perceptions and supported 12 of 13 predicted relationships. Consistent with prior work, participants rated themselves as less exposed to pornography and having greater self-regulatory efficacy than others. The former gap increased when the actor was described as a heavy Internet user; the latter gap increased when the actor was described as being gullible. These patterns extended to asymmetric beliefs of censorship efficacy. These results help clarify the cognitive basis of the third-person effect. In particular, support for censorship may reflect beliefs about exposure and efficacy, which may depend on a narrow definition of an imagined audience.",Advances in Third-Person Effects Research,Mass Communication

The analysis demonstrates how the multiplatform production contributed to make the public aware of the senseless waste of a million empty homes in the UK and to offer opportunities for the audience to take action and change government policies in order to promote the revitalization of abandoned properties. The theoretical framework focuses on the conceptualization of transmedia storytelling in the scope of participatory culture. The methodological approach of the case study is based on the transmedia analytical model developed by the author and applied to this case to depict how transmedia strategies collaborated to influence social change.

The case of Medellín thus offers the opportunity to study institutionalized and non-institutionalized participation, and the complex relations between the two. What emerges is not a binary between empowering or exploitative participation, but rather productive tensions; this paper explores some of these tensions drawing on fieldwork carried out using primarily ethnographic methods. It focuses on the intersection of institutional and grassroots participation within the participatory budgeting process in Medellín, paying particular attention to the participation of low-income and marginalized youth. It teases out the productive tensions between state strategies and grassroots tactics of participation, challenging binary claims about participation that have dominated the study of development communication to date.",Participation and Governance Processes in Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change

Based on previous research, sports, news, and situation comedies were examined for their effects on attitudes toward African Americans. Participants completed implicit and explicit measures of prejudice, their motivation to respond without prejudice, and retrospective reports of genre exposure during their lifetimes. Results suggest that exposure to sports and news is associated with more negative attitudes while sitcom exposure is associated with more positive attitudes. Sports viewing was associated with both implicitly and explicitly measured attitudes; news and sitcom viewing were associated with explicitly measured attitudes but not implicitly measured attitudes. Exploratory analyses suggest that the relationships between sports and news exposure and attitudes may involve changes in motivation to respond without prejudice. The relationship between sitcom exposure and attitudes was unaffected by the influence of motivation.","Media, Race, Ethnicity, and Stereotypes",Mass Communication

In this paper, we ask the question, in how far media can be used to illicit these moral management processes. We employ a two part experimental design study relying on a sample of N = 363 undergraduate students from the Netherlands and Singapore. Participants had to perform a moral transgression with respect to racial equality in an online forum and were provided with different measures to manage their moral self through media. Findings demonstrate that neither acts of sub-activism (e.g. supporting an online petition) nor eudaimonic media content provided any moral management opportunities. Yet, we observed moral management processes with respect to media content that addressed the domain of the moral transgression (e.g. racially themed movies). Implications for moral management processes through entertaining media are discussed.","Media, Race, Ethnicity, and Stereotypes",Mass Communication

We draw on two independent experimental studies, with a systematic sample of Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands and a representative sample of non-Muslim Dutch citizens. Both samples read the very same message with textual information and the photo of the source held constant, and with the background behind the source varied to include or exclude a visual cue related to Islam (i.e., a mosque). We find that this visual cue was sufficient to influence the evaluation of the otherwise identical message. The inclusion of the cue led to a more positive message evaluation by the Muslim sample, and especially by the highly religious participants. Conversely, the cue resulted in negative evaluations among those Dutch participants who hold anti-Muslim attitudes.","Media, Race, Ethnicity, and Stereotypes",Mass Communication

Social media, it is argued, are characterized by porous boundaries between private and public spaces; between modes of participation, as well as non-political and political activities – thereby lowering thresholds into political engagement. This argument is tested in the present study. By relying on a five-wave panel study, we provide insights into the levels and development of young people’s online political activities. The study analyses short term and long term implications of the porous boundaries argument, on four distinct forms of online political activities. The findings suggest that online political engagement is (1) relatively infrequent, and (2) characterized more by a temporal tune-in tune-out pattern than by (3) clear divides between the politically passive and active. In addition, (4) online social interaction has clear effects on online political engagement beyond political socialization and motivation.","Young Citizens, Social Media, and (Online) Political Participation",Political Communication

Yet, some observers warn that online political participation may consist of mere posturing for the benefits of peers. Digital divide research has shown that older, educated and male citizens are more likely to engage in online political participation. At the same time, impression management research has found that socio-demographics – gender, in particular – distinguish user propensities for distinct impression management techniques. Based on a survey of 1’548 German and Swiss Facebook users under the age of 31, we analyze whether impression management mediates the effect of socio-demographics on Facebook political participation. We find that taking impression management into consideration allows for a more differentiated understanding of gender differences in online political participation.","Young Citizens, Social Media, and (Online) Political Participation",Political Communication

Turnout among the youngest generation of voters is dwindling, in particular during European elections. It is therefore crucial to understand the drivers of participation. Relying on a data set that combines content analysis data of news stories about the EU (N=769) and panel survey data (N=747), we analyze the impact of exposure to online and offline coverage of relevant topics on the likelihood to turn over the period of six months. We find that exposure to news in offline media had no significant effect on participation, whereas exposure to relevant news in online media positively affected turnout. This process is mediated by two factors: the development of civic duty and the development of information efficacy.

It is interested in not only levels of participation but also the structure of participation, especially the degree to which young adults’ public affairs participation is issue specific. Analysis of a representative survey of university students (N = 897) in Guangzhou, China, shows that, generally speaking, online and offline participation on the three issues are explained by different sets of factors. Social media communication concerning public affairs is a strong predictor of online participation related to political issues, but it does not predict the other participation variables. Connection with public actors via social media, meanwhile, consistently predicts participation on different issues both online and offline. Moreover, time spent on social media is a consistent and significant predictor of degree of issue-specificity of young people’s participation. Theoretical and social implications of the findings are discussed.","Young Citizens, Social Media, and (Online) Political Participation",Political Communication

Drawing from 42 interviews from women in science and engineering careers who are employed in organizations, the study explores the meanings of leadership along with the organizational and societal perceptions of leadership as elucidated by the participants. The analysis elucidates framing role conflict, organizational response to upward mobilities and impediments to leading as the themes highlighting the experiences and understandings of women in STEM regarding leadership. The findings contribute newer understanding of leadership aspirations of the participants with respect to work life balance and perceived organizational support regarding upward career mobilities.",Identity and Power Relations in Organizations,Organizational Communication
2016-1127,2016,Paper Session,Mediated Identity Regulation and its Promoid and Paranoid Responses,2,"This paper contributes to literature on identity regulation within critical organizational communication and organization studies by expanding the current conceptualization of identity regulation in different ways. First, we argue that the media and the management in the media serve to set a direction for employees that is pervasive empirically yet remains theoretically under-explored as a specific type of identity regulation that exists outside the organizational boundaries. Second, we illuminate via a Foucauldian inspired framework and two vignettes how the mediated identity regulation leads to responses of promonoia and paranoia inside the organization. On this basis, we finally argue that mediated identity regulation and its responses induce self-disciplinary control in which the employees themselves come to reproduce the identity regulation.",Identity and Power Relations in Organizations,Organizational Communication

A multiple regression analysis showed that religious centrality, anticipated benefit, and anticipated risk variables significantly explained the variance in minority religious identity disclosure, with the latter being the strongest predictor. Organizational factors were found to be related with perception of risk and benefit but did not directly impact the decision to be open or closeted about one’s minority religious beliefs. Results are discussed in light of self-identity, organizational identity, and organizational control theories. Directions for future studies are also provided in detail.",Identity and Power Relations in Organizations,Organizational Communication
2016-1129,2016,Paper Session,"Why Does Employee Communication Matter in Employee-Organizational Relationships? Exploring the Linkages Among Employee Communication, Relational Trust, and Ethical Organizational Climates",2,"This empirical study explores how employee communication practice can contribute to employee-organizational relationships. A national survey of employees from seven organizations in the U.S. reveals how four dimensions of employee communication (accountability, participation, secrecy, and substantial information) relate to employees’ trust and their perceptions of four ethical organizational climate types (caring, instrumental, law and code, and rules). Secrecy and participation are the most critical of the four dimensions; secrecy deters employees’ trust and causes them to perceive a more instrumental climate, while participation is significant for developing their trust and encouraging them to perceive a caring climate. Employees’ trust completely mediates the theoretical linkage between accountability and a caring climate. Substantial information shows theoretical associations with two principled-climate types, law and code and rules climates. Detailed theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the study.",Identity and Power Relations in Organizations,Organizational Communication

This paper uses a socially progressive American program as a case study to build on prior research into technical and cultural aspects of adaptation by focusing on the interwoven aspect of industrial norms and production processes. By investigating issues such as casting, cultural fidelity, and production workers’ constructions of the audience, this study traces industrial norms and production processes that shape a text’s linguistic transformation as it is dubbed into Spanish before circulating throughout Latin America. This research demonstrates that between imperialism and indigenization is an entire adaptation industry which simultaneously exaggerates and downplays cross-cultural similarities and differences.",Work Processes and Production Practices in the Media Industry,Media Industry Studies

Here, I will focus on the labour of a particular team – the keyword team – in the news pictures production routine at the powerful Thomson Reuters international news agency. By analysing the daily work of keyworders at Thomson Reuters, I explore how the word-image problem is demonstrated, and settled, in international news production. Similar to the picture categorising mechanisms in the stock business, I argue that word and image relations in news media can also be productive, serving as a cultural practice that helps extending the shelf-life of archived pictures, thus increasing news picture sales worldwide.",Work Processes and Production Practices in the Media Industry,Media Industry Studies

But the factors that drive digital disruption are in no way unique to mainstream media industries. The distribution and use of screen content in education – whether that content is produced for educational use in the first instance, or whether it has been produced for entertainment or other purposes and is repurposed or reused in educational settings – in many ways parallels the experience of the broader screen industries. Just as traditional entertainment platforms, particularly broadcast television, cinema and DVD, are being challenged by new online services, so too traditional modes of distributing and accessing screen content in education are being disrupted by new online services. This paper analyses these disruptions through close analysis of the production and distribution of educational screen content in Australia.",Work Processes and Production Practices in the Media Industry,Media Industry Studies
2016-1133,2016,Paper Session,“Boundaryless” in the Creative Economy: Assessing Freelancing on oDesk,1,"This paper examines a growing trend within the creative economy, the rise of freelancing, in the online context. Specifically, it offers a preliminary analysis of creative worker freelancing on oDesk, an online marketplace. The analysis begins by contextualizing the growth of freelancing in a larger economic shift to post-industrialism, characterized by an attendant transformation of capitalism to a mode of flexible accumulation. An exploration of the characteristics of technology-mediated work on oDesk, including contract structure, remote supervision, wages, consistency of work, and profiles of clients and freelancers follows. The findings suggest that despite the company’s emphases on efficiency, flexibility, and freedom from the physical office, freelancers face significant trade-offs in undertaking such work, notably its infrequency, barriers to high wages, as well as intense global competition. The discussion emphasizes the precariousness and risks associated with freelancing, while underscoring that the practice is becoming increasingly normative for the creative sector.",Work Processes and Production Practices in the Media Industry,Media Industry Studies

The notion that runaway productions bring jobs to particular locations under the hegemonic discourse of ‘growth and jobs’, needs to be critically reassessed from the angle of the quality of these jobs, labour right protection and the overall sustainability of such (cultural) development (Katunarić and Cvjetičanin, 2001). This will be researched from a Croatian audiovisual industry perspective, which had its’ historical background of ‘runaway productions’ during former Yugoslavia. I will present results from a case study of the ‘runaway productions’ based on the exploratory sequential mixed-method design (Cresswell, 2009) that will combine the analysis of the quantitative indicators – i.e. fiscal indicators of the Incentive Programme provided by Croatian Audiovisual Centre (HAVC) and qualitative data (interview guide approach [Patton 2002]).",Work Processes and Production Practices in the Media Industry,Media Industry Studies

I use both frameworks to suggest that adjacency pairs are central to stance acts, especially where adjacency pairs are used for stance acts most explicitly - in misalignment. Creative resonance is used in misalignment to increase the dis-stance between the participants by disconnecting the actual words and syntax of one utterance from its prior one. This leads to an iconic view of language, creative resonance distances the utterances of the participants from each other, and the distance between the utterances is iconic of the distance in the participants’ relationship. Moreover, the creative resonance leads to meta-communicative discussion and these discussions suggest that the creative resonance utterances combined with their dispreferred elements make the utterance’s communicative goal a poetic one.","Studies of Talk-in-Interaction: Achieving Misalignment Stance, Indexing Membership, Making Requests, and Telling Stories",Language & Social Interaction
2016-1136,2016,Paper Session,Indexing Membership via Responding to Irony: Communication Competence in Israeli Radio Call-In Shows,2,"Drawing on both Ethnography of Communication and Pragmatics, we investigate the callers’ responses to call-in radio shows to hosts’ ironic utterances. Since irony is indirect, it may pose problems for the participants, and responding to it may be an indicative of speakers’ communicative competence. We associate this competence with the notion of ""membering"" (Philipsen 1989), thus arguing that by reacting differently to the host’s irony, callers demonstrate different levels of communicative competence. Standard callers have difficulty understanding irony, let alone responding to it. Regular callers, on the other hand, demonstrate higher communicative competence and provide responses, from recognizing the irony to continue the ironic line and create a joint ironic sequence. Thus, whereas standard callers are mere participants in the programs, regular callers act as community members. However, even regular callers succumb to the host’s irony when it is destructive and offensive, showing that communicative competence has its limits.","Studies of Talk-in-Interaction: Achieving Misalignment Stance, Indexing Membership, Making Requests, and Telling Stories",Language & Social Interaction

The aim is to describe the resources used by prospective speakers for story entry, and possible actions served by storytelling in the interactional and sequential context in which they are launched. We find that speakers use similar techniques as reported in the literature (e.g., story preface, embedded repetition). We also find interesting instances where a speaker, in order to fit his/her telling into the ongoing talk, asks questions about something not mentioned but is nevertheless related to prior talk, thus skillfully creating a particular relevance for storytelling. Stories in our data often implement aligning, affiliative, or persuasive actions. We will discuss the findings from this study in relation to the insights from classical as well as more recent studies on the emergent, interactive and contingent character of storytelling in conversation.","Studies of Talk-in-Interaction: Achieving Misalignment Stance, Indexing Membership, Making Requests, and Telling Stories",Language & Social Interaction

The data for this study come from audio-recorded telephone calls to the 9-1-1 Costa Rica: 7300 audio files. This study uses the method of Conversation Analysis, and ethnographic work. Some preliminary findings show that the level or urgency of the incident reported is made relevant in the composition of the request of help: (a) incidents with a low level of urgency are constructed with low entitlement and high contingency, whereas (b) incidents with a high level of urgency are constructed with high entitlement and low contingency. This paper sheds light on the interactional functions of the composition of the request of help in calls to the 9-1-1. Analyzing data from other language rather than English, will contribute to widen the borders of the research on emergency calls, which has been mainly conducted in English speaking countries.","Studies of Talk-in-Interaction: Achieving Misalignment Stance, Indexing Membership, Making Requests, and Telling Stories",Language & Social Interaction
2016-1139,2016,Paper Session,Investigating Mechanisms of Visual and Textual Framing Effects,4,"Media effects research has begun to clarify the combined impact of visual and textual media on political opinions and behaviours. However the mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. To address this issue we used an experiment to present news reports comprising visual and textual exemplars of counter-frames from war and conflict news in congruent and incongruent pairs. In addition, we induced heuristic or systematic processing of the article by either giving participants a concurrent cognitive load task, or informing them they would take part in a debate on the topic afterwards. By doing so, we examine whether experimentally inducing different information processing styles drive framing effects in the direction of the framed image or text. Preliminary findings presented in this extended abstract shed new light on the mechanisms of multimodal framing effects.",Researching the Effects of Visual Communication,Visual Communication Studies
2016-1140,2016,Paper Session,Persuasive Effects of Multimodal News Frames? The Limited Power of Visual and Textual Gain and Loss Frames on Climate Change Attitudes,3,"Most media products nowadays combine resources alluding to different sensory channels (e.g., visual and auditory) or join, within the same sensory channel, different modes of presentation (e.g., textual and pictographic) which in turn initiate different types of information processing. Yet, effects of multimodal media content, for instance in frame-reception processes, have gained only little scholarly attention so far. First, we show, based on a survey (n = 157), that gain and loss frames can also be perceived in climate change visuals. Second, we present findings from an online-experiment in a 3 (visual frame: gain vs. loss vs. no visual) x 2 (textual frame: gain vs. loss) between-subjects design (n = 273) investigating the effects of multimodal gain and loss frame-arrangements on climate change attitudes and behavioral intentions. The study does neither find direct effects of consonant (gain + gain, loss + loss) nor competitive (visual gain + textual loss / visual loss + textual gain) frame-arrangements, but does find an indirect effect of the competitive arrangement of visual gain and textual loss framing through perceived news quality on recipients’ acceptance of the anthropogenic cause for, problem awareness about, and willingness to act against climate change. The results scrutinize the idea that the reception of (and sometimes recommended use of) particular visuals in climate communication would automatically lead to positive or negative climate change attitudes.",Researching the Effects of Visual Communication,Visual Communication Studies

2016-1143,2016,Paper Session,The Effects of Visual Isolation on the Perception of Scandalized Politicians in Mediated Scandals,2,"Journalists frequently use visual news frames that highlight the (alleged) isolation of politicians in mediated scandals (e.g., depicting a politician alone in parliament). However, the effects of such a visual isolation remain unclear. To test if a visual isolation affects a recipient's information processing an experiment (between-subjects design) with four groups was conducted. Participants were exposed to a news article dealing with a political scandal. The article was either accompanied by a visual depicting a scandalized politician as totally isolated (group 1), partially isolated (group 2) or in a non-isolated way (group 3). Group four participants were not exposed to a visual. A MANCOVA revealed that a visual isolation of the scandalized politician generated significant direct (attitudes) and indirect (guilt attribution) effects. Thus, a visual isolation systematically affected the participants' perception of the scandalized politician.

Regarding the concern about the accurate measurement of media consumption, social desirability is most commonly cited as the likely cause for the over-reporting of media use. We present a new theory that provides an alternate account of this observed behavior. We propose that the act of responding to a series of political attitude and opinion questions constitute an implicit challenge to one's political identity. Our results provide evidence that under conditions of identity threat, partisans engage in identity affirmation on political surveys.",Between Partisan Media and Partisan Opinions,Political Communication

By combining individual-level public opinion data in 28 countries, an expert survey on media systems, and a variety of country-level indicators, I find that higher levels of political parallelism in a country is associated with a larger winner-loser gap in institutional trust and satisfaction with democracy. The relationship is contingent on whether or not people are actually exposed to said media. This research, which links the study of political communication with the study of comparative political behavior, indicates that the increasing availability of partisan news around the world is a cause for concern.",Between Partisan Media and Partisan Opinions,Political Communication

We used multi-stage cluster sampling to recruit a nationally representative sample of adolescents between 13 and 17 years old (n = 4,920) to complete a self-administered survey. Our extended model achieved good psychometric properties and we found distinct paths on how relationship with father and mother relate to deficient self-regulation, habit strength and time spent on SNSs. While relationship with both parents were negatively associated with depression—which was positively associated with self-reactive outcome expectation and deficient self-regulation—only relationship with father was negatively associated with dependence on SNSs for identity formation, which was strongly associated with deficient self-regulation and SNSs habit strength.","Expectations, Strategies, and Issues of Youth Social Media Use",Children Adolescents and the Media

This study adds to the emotion regulation literature and affordances of technology perspective by describing how adolescents feel when using different social media platforms and how and why they use social media for applying certain emotion regulation strategies, such as looking for distraction and the social sharing of emotions. In-depth interviews with 22 adolescents aged 14-18, show that adolescents use social media for multiple emotion regulation strategies. Although different platforms might have similar affordances, there are clearly different social norms, which influence adolescents’ online behavior. Facebook statuses, Instagram and Snapchat are mostly used for sharing positive emotions, if emotions are shared at all. Twitter and Facebook Messenger, on the other hand, are also used for sharing negative emotions.","Expectations, Strategies, and Issues of Youth Social Media Use",Children Adolescents and the Media

This, in turn, generated a range of insights into the factors that influence children’s online engagement and its practical, social and psychological outcomes. We developed the model by testing it with both qualitative and quantitative research methods, the most substantial being a 25,000 in-home, face-to-face survey of children in 25 countries aged 9–16, as well as a short interview with each of their parents. The model has since provided the basis for a host of replications and extensions of the research in many countries. This process has, in turn, identified strengths, limitations and areas for further development. Hence we conclude this paper by presenting a revised and updated version of the analytical model, drawing out the pressing questions for future research.

Eleven focus group conversations among 57 adolescents between 15 and 18 years old were analyzed. The findings demonstrate that social networking sites play an important role in relational information seeking. Pictures are regarded as the most important information source. In order to express romantic interest respondents indicated that they would like pictures and status updates from several years ago or that they would initiate a conversation through private messages. The adolescents recognized the potential of social networking sites to elicit jealousy and identified forms of controlling behavior such as sharing passwords or monitoring the partners’ profiles. A romantic break-up often led to removing ex-partners from one’s profile pages and adolescents most frequently observed the posting of emotional status updates by ex-partners as a result of the relationship dissolution.,"Expectations, Strategies, and Issues of Youth Social Media Use",Children Adolescents and the Media

An online experiment was conducted in which 144 girls (14-18 years old) were randomly exposed to either original or manipulated Instagram photos. Results showed that exposure to manipulated Instagram photos led to lower body satisfaction. This effect was stronger among girls with a high social comparison tendency. Body image of girls with a low social comparison tendency did not differ after exposure to either original or manipulated photos. Findings also showed that girls believed that the materials showed a representative view of reality and that the photos painted pictures that were not better than reality. Results thus imply that the common practice of Instagram users to manipulate and tweak their appearance in pictures is problematic, at least for girls that are used to make social comparisons.","Expectations, Strategies, and Issues of Youth Social Media Use",Children Adolescents and the Media

We carried out twenty interviews that also included a vignette exercise. The four dimensions in friendship expectations of Hall (2011) guided this research. The results revealed that even though online communication is important to almost all participants, many emphasized that the behavior of a friend in ‘real life’ was more important than their online behavior. The adolescents do have specific expectations concerning the online behavior of friends. Almost all the participants found it normal that a friend responds to a personal message; however, the time within the response was given was not considered to be relevant for most of them. Additionally, emotional availability is expected of friends and online support is appreciated. The adolescents put the emphasis on personal contact when it concerns their expectations.","Expectations, Strategies, and Issues of Youth Social Media Use",Children Adolescents and the Media

Based on three audience-center media use theories and review of literature, a research model was proposed to study college students’ stress driven Facebook use and how their positive strategic use of certain online activities was related to adaptive coping and adjustment. A total of 262 undergraduate students in a Midwest public university participated in this online survey study in spring 2014. Results show that student participants’ positive strategic Facebook use to a certain extent assists in their adaptive stress coping and adjustment. Student participants’ perceived support from Facebook was the key connecting positive strategic SNS use and adaptive coping. Self-efficacious college student users and users with more online social capital are more likely to use Facebook to cope with stress adaptively.","Expectations, Strategies, and Issues of Youth Social Media Use",Children Adolescents and the Media

To investigate that question this study engaged in exploratory research centered on the question: “in what ways do individuals play single player videogames with or alongside other people?” We conducted a year long study with two research conditions to investigate: having individuals play a game together as pairs, and have individuals stream a single player game via the live streaming service Twitch.tv. We recruited 15 individuals to participate, with 10 being put into pairs and asked to play the game via “couch co-op” – i.e. in our lab on an Xbox One, playing together in collocated space, and the remaining five participants live streamed their play via Twitch.tv on a lab PC that allowed them to chat live within a twitch channel with anyone viewing their stream, all with the game Dragon Age: Inquisition. Based on data collected we define tandem play as: “when two or more players engage with a single-player game together, moving through the game with a variety of potential motives.” Tandem play occurs when players come together to play, although not perhaps necessarily to progress in, a game. Players may have different goals for the play session, but must take account of who else is playing with them, or witnessing their play. Tandem play can force players to revisit their goals for a particular gameplay session, and may or may not be appropriate for a particular type of game. Players admitted to us afterward that seeing how another person played made them question their own taken for granted style; it also allowed them to think about how play can be a social activity and what goes into making a game enjoyable for multiple people.",Best Papers in Game Studies Division,Game Studies

This study moves beyond time displacement logic and argues that the effects of video game use on school performance are not the same for all types of gamers and are moderated and/or mediated by socio-economic, psychological and contextual factors. Thus, this study investigates how gaming patterns (frequency, time of day) and psychological characteristics (sensation seeking, aggression) influence academic performance for schoolchildren. A total sample of 507 students from five primary and four secondary schools in Singapore participated in a paper-pencil survey study. Results showed that overall time spent on video games is negatively associated with primary school children’s and active gamers’ school performances. There is no significant effect for secondary school children. For primary school children who play games in the morning and afternoon video game use is negatively associated with school performance.

To prevent against an oversimplifying attribution of problematic gaming behavior merely based on invested time, the present study highlights a conceptual differentiation between desirable enthusiasm and undesirable addictive tendencies by focusing on individuals’ gaming motivation and experience. For this purpose, we recruited 340 players (f = 183; age M = 43.54, SD = 12.75) of the mobile trivia game QuizClash including 140 of the game’s top 1000 players to examine mediations of negative gaming experience by players’ addictive tendencies. Results provide evidence that negative outcomes are often prematurely attributed to intense gaming, since effects of high engagement disappear after controlling for addictive tendencies. Predominance of negative experience in otherwise enjoyable activities therefore might serve as a signal for problematic tendencies and could be established as an in-situ indicator in diagnostic practice.",Best Papers in Game Studies Division,Game Studies

This exploratory study employs a qualitative research approach using case studies of two local companies and three MNCs operating in Ho Chi Minh City. The findings reveal that MNCs in Vietnam view CSR as a strategic opportunity to access and spread the ‘perfume’ with community stakeholders, thereby basking in the aroma of goodwill. Locally-owned businesses focus their CSR activities through employee welfare, or the provision of ‘bread’, and favourable employment benefits and policies.

Content analysis of 242 news articles and 200 corporate websites showed that both agents primarily provide a generic CSR coverage that ignores current issues and challenges relevant to the Indian society. However, there were also indicators of tensions between moral and strategic intent that previous studies argued define CSR in the Indian context. Implications for international CSR research and practice in the context of sociocultural and media environment are discussed.",Empowering the World: Global Public Relations,Public Relations

Yet, it is not researched as much as it deserves, often giving the erroneous impression that public relations is all about ""mass"" media and communication. In the few instances when public relations body of knowledge discusses personal influence, the impression is given that personal influence is only used in developing countries mostly located in Asia. This study sought to allay both these myths by studying the use of personal influence among public relations practitioners in Italy.

To test the model, a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was conducted using data from the 2012 Annenberg National Health Communication Survey (ANHCS) (N = 3,285). Findings suggest higher social support from family predicts higher trust in health information from family members, which is positively related to health information seeking from all three sources with the path linking trust to family information seeking being the strongest. Effect of social support on information seeking from family is partially mediated by trust, while effect of social support on information seeking from the Internet/doctors is fully mediated by trust.

With the advent of the Internet and social media, more and more people are receiving information related to healthy behaviors in an online context. With social media, this information can come in the form of communication from family, friends, and others in a person’s social network. The importance of social support in helping to encourage healthy behaviors has been well-established in health communication literature. However, little research has examined the role of online social support in helping to encourage healthy eating behaviors. With the theory of planned behavior as a framework, this research used a survey of 525 respondents to examine the relationship between online social support and healthy eating behavior intentions. Through multiple regression, we found that online social support is positively associated with healthy eating behavior intentions and that online social support can moderate the relationship between perceived behavioral control and healthy eating behavior intentions.","Social Support for Health: Information Seeking, Obesity/Eating, Cancer",Health Communication

Online-mediated self-help groups represent an opportunity for obese persons to support each other. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether and how the use of and active participation in online self-help groups is associated with perceived informational and emotional support among obese adults. We conducted an online-based questionnaire (N = 230) with users of online self-help groups for obese adults in Germany. Findings revealed that forum activity is significantly correlated with perceived informational and emotional support. While asking questions was strongly correlated with both types of social support, sharing opinions and answering posts were more strongly correlated with perceived emotional support. The level of social support in online communities depends on an individual’s forum activity. Our findings offer a foundation for professionals in the health care sector to enhance their understanding, make recommendations, and further develop online self-help groups.","Social Support for Health: Information Seeking, Obesity/Eating, Cancer",Health Communication

The findings support a mediating model of communication networks where social undermining has a direct and negative impact on HRQOL and an indirect effect mediated through communication efficacy, which has a direct and positive impact on HRQOL. Contrary to prior research, social support, disclosure, and network structures did not impact HRQOL in this sample.

Moreover, the contribution of online peer support on top of other relevant “offline” factors is unknown. The current manuscript addresses these two issues with a longitudinal 3-wave study (three surveys in a period of ten months) among breast cancer patients participating in a peer-led online support community. Results showed a significant effect of intensity of online participation (wave 2) on depression (wave 3). Physical well-being affected breast cancer related concerns (from wave 1 to 2 and from wave 2 to 3). Intensity of online participation was mainly caused by disease status. Hence, participation positively affected psychological well-being, rather than the other way around, and this finding was significant on top of the influence of other factors. With caution, patients could be encouraged to look for support from their peers online.","Social Support for Health: Information Seeking, Obesity/Eating, Cancer",Health Communication

Using relational dialectics, we uncover tensions in use around connecting with others, sharing information, and being predictable or novel.

Two experiments were conducted to examine (1) if perspective taking could mitigate the negative influence of threat on explicit and implicit intergenerational attitudes and, if so, (2) whether this buffering effect would be stronger for participants who embodied an elderly person in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) compared to those who engaged in a traditional perspective taking exercise via mental simulation (MS). When intergroup threat was presented without intergroup contact (Study 1), the negative effect of threat on ageism dissipated when participants engaged in a perspective taking exercise. Differential effects were found depending on the perspective taking medium. However, when participants were exposed to a concrete and experiential intergroup threat (Study 2), neither modality of perspective taking (IVE and MS) buffered negative intergenerational attitudes.

On the Relevance of Web Search Engines' Search Results When People Google for Suicide,3,"While suicide rates may increase after being reported by the mass media, appropriate depictions of suicide can help people overcome suicidal crises. A similar ambivalence may be postulated for online suicide-related search results. Importantly, the filter-bubble hypothesis (Pariser, 2011) states that search results are biased by algorithms based on a person’s previous behavior. We investigated whether suicide-related search queries influence subsequent search results which in turn might protect or harm suicidal users. We utilized a 3 (search history: harmful, helpful, suicide-unrelated) × 2 (reactive: clicking, no clicking) experimental design applying agent-based testing. While findings show no influences of search histories or of reactivity on search results in a subsequent situation, the presentation of a helpline raises concerns about possible detrimental algorithmic decision-making: Algorithms ""decided"" whether to present a helpline.

Data on the audience’s risk factors for suicide and knowledge about suicide were collected before the experiment, immediately after website exposure and one week later. We stratified the sample into two groups by the median of suicidality at baseline. We investigated the impact of websites further with qualitative interviews of 12 participants. Educative websites on suicide resulted in a short-term deterioration of mood across all participants, and there was a sustained reduction of suicidal ideation among participants with comparatively higher baseline suicidality. There was also a sustained increase in knowledge of suicide.

Causal modeling was used to track the effects of life events on aggression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts with the use of personality proxy variables. The results suggest that aggression has a small positive effect on suicide although they share the common causal antecedents of self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Verbal aggression from others as social undermining appeared to be a trigger for depression-based physical aggression whereas drug dependence as hindered needs appeared to be a trigger for neuroticism-based suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.",Suicide and Stigma Studies in Health Communication,Health Communication

Social media and smartphone technologies within the military offer a unique environment in which to investigate the ways individual’s position themselves within certain axes of institutional and cultural identities. Concurrently, the convolutions, mediatory practices and mundane social media rituals they employ through their smartphones resonates widely with, for example, youth culture, digital mobile cultures. Combined this suggests nuanced and complex mediations with social and mobile media that draw on and extend non-military practice into new (increasingly normative) terrains. Furthermore, the sociotechnical affordances of the particular Apps and social media they utilise, and drawing on research around gender and sexting practices, suggests that contrary to their experiences being unique to masculine and misogynistic military culture they are in fact endemic of a wider gendering of mobile culture that is shaping normative communication practices.",Mobile Social Media,Mobile Communication

To understand the mechanisms in mobile use of Facebook, first, we propose a new set of measures designed to quantify the extent to which individuals use Facebook on PCs vs. mobile devices. These measures, validated across two different samples, allow us to examine how these patterns of use relate to user’s motivations and experiences, and to test whether mobile users of Facebook appear to have greater bonding social capital, as would be projected by the tele-cocooning hypothesis. Findings demonstrated that goals for social media use did not differ across mobile and non-mobile usage, but that mobile social media practices were consistently associated with perceptions of a more immersive Facebook use experience. Further, mobile and social use were similarly related to measures of social capital, in contrast to tele-cocooning expectations.",Mobile Social Media,Mobile Communication

By examining the distribution of users’ attention between urban settings and screen-based activities, this video-ethnography highlights how these notifications affect the organization of visual forms of social coordination in urban settings. We analyze how social forms of visual coordination are not only structured by internalized social norms but also according to rhythms of smartphone apps, how they display relational stress and perform hyper-connected relational practices.",Mobile Social Media,Mobile Communication

In contrast to theorizations of an “electrical sublime,” we see an “electrical banal.” Rather than a disruptive technological impact, in many ways new flows of electricity were accepted into lives, economies, and bodies in a quotidian fashion. Electricity, illumination, telephony, and other technological phenomena were integrated into multiple facets of daily life.

This essay offers a partial answer to these questions, focusing on the student left of 1960s America — the so-called New Left — and its position within the contemporaneous technosocial landscape. I argue that the widespread rejection of mass media and the wholesale embrace of the underground press enabled the movement to construct a radical worldview, however tentative and internally inconsistent.

Drawing on archival sources that reveal extensive negotiations among the producing sides, we find that Our World’s claimed creation of “global presence” was indeed a fantasy of modernization tied to spatial hierarchies of modernization, as Lisa Parks has argued, but one neither exclusive to the West nor uncontested by the show’s socialist participants.
      
Producing “Our World” required the constant assertion of spatial hierarchies, based on unequal and unpredictable material infrastructures, personal relationships, and rival symbolic claims.

A mediated moderation regression model revealed that FCP were significant predictors of parents’ influence over their emerging adult children’s consumer skills, preferences, and attitudes. Results also indicated that parents who exhibited higher conversation and conformity orientations had more influence on their emerging adult children’s consumer behaviors than did those who exhibited lower conversation and conformity orientations. Further, the influence of parental communication on emerging adult consumer skills was mediated by emerging adults’ consumer preferences and attitudes. These findings – derived through the use of an updated and more analytically robust application of FCP than used in previous consumer socialization research - provide a more complete understanding of parents’ influence on their emerging adults’ consumer reasoning.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Participants included 215 emerging adults who had experienced an adverse life event within the past year. Overall, the results largely supported the theory of motivated information management, as uncertainty discrepancies positively predicted negative emotions about the adverse event, which in turn predicted outcome expectancies, but not efficacy assessments. Outcome expectancies were predictive of efficacy assessments, which in turn were predictive of a willingness to seek information about the event from a supportive parent. Collectively, uncertainty management behaviors predicted post-traumatic growth and included significant indirect effects for uncertainty discrepancies through communication and target efficacy, respectively.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2016-1187,2016,Paper Session,When Communication Accommodation Backfires: Interpersonal Effects of Social Power and Linguistic Style Accommodation in Computer-Mediated-Communication,4,"Within Communication Accommodation Theory, social power is an important influence upon the likelihood of accommodation in communicative behaviours. Across two studies, we explore if the influence of power extends to a non-conscious aspect of accommodation, linguistic style, and to computer mediated forms of communication. We manipulated social power experimentally to create a series of instant messaging conversations between high and low power participants. Low power induced greater likelihood of linguistic style accommodation, whilst in a low versus high power role (study 1) and when participants undertook both roles (study 2). Notably, linguistic style accommodation by individuals in a high power role ‘backfired’: greater accommodation was associated with a negative impression formed by their conversational partner. The results show robust effects of power in shaping language use across CMC. Further, the interpersonal effects of linguistic accommodation depend upon a complex interplay of social context, social norms, and the communication medium.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2016-1188,2016,Paper Session,“So That’s How She Do”: Supportive Messages Female Offenders Receive From Parole Officers,6,"More than a million women are on probation and parole in the United States. Their sentences often stem from alcohol and drug use, and substance abuse is a key predictor of recidivism. One protective factor against both recidivism and relapse to substance use is the receipt of social support. Unfortunately, women on probation and parole with a history of substance abuse often have small, criminogenic social networks and lack social support from family members and friends. Recent research indicates that probation and parole officers (POs) may serve as important resources of social support for such women; however, little is known about the actual supportive messages POs provide their female clients. This study examines the content of supportive messages women on parole and probation receive from their POs regarding avoidance of drugs and alcohol as well as the perceived effects of those messages. Female offenders (N = 326) recalled communication from their PO regarding avoidance of drug and alcohol use. Messages were coded for supportive communication content and its effects. Results indicate that all forms of supportive communication were viewed as mainly positive, with informational support most commonly reported. Implications of this study include identification of helpful message strategies for POs as well as support gaps in female offenders’ social support resources.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Results suggested significant differences in reporting dominant topics among newspapers based in urban vs. rural regions of China. Findings also indicated that legal barriers, medical distrust, cultural concerns, social norm of family disapproval and communication barriers positively associated with news framing of organ shortage. In examining the relationship in a multivariate logistical regression model, communication barrier, cultural concerns about preserving intact body, considerations of Chinese traditional culture, and lack of laws and regulations emerged as significant predictors to the presence of donation shortage frame. The portrayal of family and friend’s support reduced the likelihood that news stories reported the donation shortage frame.

This paper presents two studies testing these claims by comparing reliably coded nominal and ratio coding of framing in four texts to independent participant ratings of frame prominence in those texts. The first shows that the ratio level measures explain more than twice as much variance in participant ratings as their nominal counterparts. The second shows that the ratio measures are able to discriminate texts in a cluster analysis, whereas the nominal measures are not. We conclude that ratio level measures should become the default method for coding framing in media texts, unless there are defensible reasons to do otherwise.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Health,Mass Communication

To examine the role of depression news coverage and address barriers in communicating with Chinese college students about the risk of depression and the importance of providing social support to depressed individuals, a 2 (episodic vs. thematic framing) x 2 (individual vs. societal attribution) between-subjects experiment was conducted among 187 students in a large research university in China. The findings provide insights that can inform future depression news coverage in Chinese media: 1) Episodic framing in depression coverage triggered more sympathetic feelings toward depressed individuals; 2) Individual attribution in depression coverage led to higher self-efficacy in detecting people’s depression symptoms; and 3) Female participants felt more sympathy toward depressed individuals depicted in the new story regardless the framing or attribution.

2016-1193,2016,Paper Session,Decoding Xiao Hong in The Golden Era (2014): A Reception Analysis of Chinese Women Audience Members’ Film-Viewing Experiences,1,"The issue that this study addressed was the unprivileged status of women audience members and women directors in the male-dominated Chinese film industry. To investigate this problem, the purpose of this study was to explore how Chinese women audience members produce different meanings concerning gender identity and gender relations through viewing The Golden Era (2014), directed by a female filmmaker Ann Hui. This qualitative research project was designed as a reception analysis. To gather data, interviews with 18 Chinese women with viewing experiences of this film were collected from December 2014 to January 2015. Under the framework of feminist cultural studies, the portrayal of Xiao Hong in this film incited various reactions and reading practices of Chinese audience members throughout these data. Through feminist standpoint theory, these findings were useful for subtly recognizing how Chinese women’s multiple reading practices problematize and complicate the oppressor/oppressed binary of the power relations regarding gender.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship
2016-1194,2016,Paper Session,Smashing Patriarchy With Cell Phones? Technofeminist Critique on Mobile Phone-Enabled Women’s Empowerment Programmes in Bangladesh,2,"This study problematizes the relationship between ICTs, gender and development, informed by the gap between high ambitions, and disappointing outcomes of ICT-enabled development programmes aiming for women’s empowerment. Using a critical discourse analysis approach, this study scrutinizes interpretations of ‘women’s empowerment’ in the context of two Bangladeshi mobile phone programmes targeting women: the Grameen Village Phone Programme, and Maya Apa. This study is juxtaposed against Western-centric technofeminist scholarship, extending technofeminist insights beyond its Western scope. Informed by our analysis, we firstly identify a gap in ICT4D scholarship regarding women’s roles as ICT designers and active users, and recommend more attention to women’s active engagement with ICTs. Second, we advocate for an expansion of technofeminist theory to go beyond the Western lens and recognize this is not normative across cultures and contexts. Last, we highlight the usefulness of low-cost, participatory forms of new ICTs to forward women’s empowerment in developing countries.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship
2016-1195,2016,Paper Session,Gendering ‘Authenticity’ of Military Experience: How Male Audiences of Korean Celebreality Show Real Men Reconstruct Hegemonic Masculinity,3,"This study investigates the ideological implications of Real Men, a celebreality show that portrays Korean military experience, and explores how male audiences in particular discursively reconstruct the meaning of military and their hegemonic masculinity. We treat Real Men and its online board not as an idiosyncratic text but as part of television programs and online communities that recurrently display discourses about male dominant visibility, reverse-gender discrimination, political conservatism, and misogyny. Through analyzing the audiences’ responses to Real Men in the online bulletin board, we suggest that male audiences endowed themselves an eligibility to talk about ‘real’ military to reconstruct themselves as ‘authentic male’ who has already fulfilled the military duty, thus silencing and other-izing people who did not complete military service. We argue that this perception of the Real Men is problematic since it reduces the possibilities for critical interrogation of military culture which arouses many social problems.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship
2016-1196,2016,Paper Session,South Korean Hostess Film and Censorship During the Military Regime (1960-1979),1,"Park Chung Hee’s military regime (1960-1979) is notorious for state-operated censorship which exerted unprecedented power over film studios and directors. The military government purportedly used film censorship to distract the public from political consciousness by controlling political materials in films while condoning censorship control on sexual content. As a result, the production of soft-core adult films soared and became popular among Korean audiences. One of such films that thrived during this period, so called, Hostess Film (prostitute films) is worthy of attention because this strand of films is characterized not only for the exploitive employment of female sexuality but more importantly for the filmic representation of poverty, rape, and other lower-class issues which the state censorship board particularly sought to regulate.
In viewing such dynamics between state censorship and film, the following questions are inevitable: how was it possible that the state was willing to turn a blind eye on the explicit sexualization of women in hostess films when film censorship was at its peak? Why were the social and political aspects of this group of films about female sexual workers not seriously considered socially relevant by the government at a time when censorship was so high?
This articlw aims to unravel the above issues by scrutinizing the interplay between Park’s state censorship and hostess films using censorship records and notes. Furthermore, it offers an analysis of a hostess film, The Rose that Swallowed Thorn (Cheong, 1979) as a case study to show how this film strategically orchestrates visual and thematic elements to circumvent state censorship enforcement.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship
2016-1197,2016,Paper Session,What Happened to Those Tomboys Several Years Later? Empowerment From Super Girls’ Voice for Girls in China (2007-2015),2,"This longitudinal study aims to understand the popularity and social significance of the highly prominent Chinese television show Super Girls’ Voice (2005 season), a talent show largely modeled on “reality shows” such as Pop Idol in the United Kingdom, on gender issues. Based on three focus group studies of young females who were audience members in 2007, 2010 and 2015, we contend that the Super Girls who appeared as tomboys, specifically Li Yuchun, were perceived as “handsome” girls by most of the discussants and designated as androgynous girls. Most of the discussants regarded androgyny as a flexible gender identity that integrated the most favorable traits of femininity and masculinity in terms of appearance and personality. Most of discussants also applied this meaning to their social lives. While the discussants who were of school age in 2005 deemed these traits to be resistant to normative femininity and applied them both to their social lives and to their construction of gender identity. From a time-related view, however, we suggest that some discussants relinquished their resistance to appearance by the standards of normative femininity several years later and subsequently renegotiated their identity in alignment with normative femininity. We also observed a ‘single polarization’ of the discussants’ constructed meanings of androgyny.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship
2016-1198,2016,Paper Session,"Communication for the Empowerment of Women in China: Group Actors, the Internet’s Communicative Affordances, and Collective Civic Action",1,"This article aims at exploring the relationship between the Internet and women’s empowerment in China, by examining websites produced by 17 women’s groups regarding to different organisational types – two government agencies, nine civic associations, three university-based centres and three online communities. Considering women’s empowerment in the context of China as a type of collective civic action, the article focuses on the communicative affordances of the 17 group actors’ websites regarding the mobilisation of individuals and the consolidation of collectives and networks of organisations. Empirical data are derived from a features analysis of the selected websites and a social network analysis which is used to reveal the 17 group actors’ relational patterns based on their hyperlinks, as well as in-depth interviews with 22 board members. The findings demonstrate that women’s groups mainly use the Internet to increase their visibility, to mobilise individual participation and to maintain inter-organisational relationships, though they do not fully realise the Internet’s potential to consolidate the collective. In addition, the study identifies that Internet censorship and state control constrain women’s groups as a collective from promoting the process of women’s empowerment.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship

The empirical data used is derived from features analysis of selected female blogs and from in-depth interviews with seven female bloggers. This data is complimented by discourse analysis to investigate the communicative purposes of these blogs. Overall, the findings show that weblogs help women to become social agents by bringing personal, private and intimate issues onto the public agenda, as well as engage in the process of self- reformation. However, such empowering process is constrained by commercialisation and by traditional norms and gendered cultural stereotypes.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship

Dagongmei Tongxun publishes articles regarding life and working situations of rural-to-urban female migrants in Beijing. Drawing upon Bourdieu’s field theory and Gibson-Graham’s “local politics of possibility”, I analyzed how different social agents, including NGO staff members, volunteers and female migrant story-writers, participated in producing gendered migration narratives. I argued that the publication of Dagongmei Tongxun was a political intervention which mobilized often silenced women as active agents. Yet, simply bringing voices did not guarantee transformative social change.","Focus on Asia: Media Receptions, Productions, and Activisms in China, South Korea, and Bangladesh",Feminist Scholarship
2016-1201,2016,Paper Session,Knowledge System Coherence as a Moderator of Organizational Change and Learning,2,"Disaster response organizations (DROs) confront unpredictable and irregular periods of socio-ecological change. This study identifies two alternative models to explore the relations between properties of a knowledge system and the potential for changes in that knowledge system that result from an organization’s confrontation with rapid change in its social ecology. The study provides a field-based case study to explore a DRO in two states of time- before and after a disaster event response. Employing the concept of coherence in organizational knowledge systems, this study explores the consequence of the disaster event on the study site’s organizational knowledge system and organizational learning.
A multi-sited research case design of a DRO employing Vayda’s (1983) progressive contextualisation, with data from ethnographic observation and 51 interviews collected over an 18-month period during both activated (disaster response) and non-activated states. The findings suggest that rapid modifications derived from an ecological event to an organizational knowledge system bear important consequences for both the nature and processes of internal knowledge and subsequent learning from those periods of rapid environmental change.",Knowledge and Expertise in Organizations,Organizational Communication
2016-1202,2016,Paper Session,Obstacles for Knowledge Sharing in a Multinational Organization,2,"Research in the knowledge sharing literature has demonstrated the importance of communicative interactions in obtaining knowledge and building social capital in the workplace. Traditionally research has placed a strong emphasis on identifying interaction patterns that are beneficial in terms of performance, innovation, and other outcome measures. Counter to the traditional focus, this study aims to understand the obstacles that arise in the advice seeking and knowledge-sharing network of a multinational organization. We examine hierarchical position, gender, proximity, and perceived expertise to see whether they are obstacles for effective advice seeking. Using exponential random graph modeling on a dataset consisting of 46 employees’ advice seeking network in a consulting firm, obstacles in advice seeking interactions were analyzed. The findings indicated that gender was an important consideration in the formation of the advice seeking network, as organizational members had strong preferences for reaching out to same-sex individuals for advice. It was additionally found that people were more motivated to seek advice from individuals they perceived as having high expertise, potentially reducing their breath of knowledge acquisition. The results contribute to the literature on advice network by demonstrating how demographic and socio-contextual factors influence tie formation in a multinational context and how these tendencies can be understood as obstacles to diverse advice seeking.

This study is one of the first comparative studies on whether American and Chinese people use the same communication styles as social cues for competence. Using data collected from 348 Chinese and American students, we found that confidence, relaxedness, task-oriented communication, relationship-oriented communication, and language proficiency were universal (i.e., etic) and significant indicators of expertise for both Chinese and Americans cultures, with roughly identical measurement structures. Furthermore, Chinese participants are more likely to use relationship-oriented communication as an expertise cue than American participants. An etic measure of dominance was achieved in both subsamples, but it was a significant indicator of expertise only for Chinese participants.",Knowledge and Expertise in Organizations,Organizational Communication
2016-1204,2016,Paper Session,"Technical, Arcane, Interpersonal, and Embodied Expertise",3,"Expertise matters at work in part because it has implications for functional outcomes (e.g., having the knowledge needed to get the work done), but also because it has implications for the meaning and legitimacy of work. Expertise confers power. Building on previous work that has compartmentalized the expertise differences according to discrete knowledge areas or knowledge typologies, we enumerate a taxonomy of expertise forms: technical, arcane, relational, and embodied. This taxonomy illuminates how the practice of expertise involves knowledge about the technical properties of work; the policies, standards, and laws that govern it; the people involved; and a material sense of the spaces in which work takes place. We argue that experts must negotiate the multiplicity of their expertise in their interaction with different audiences and that these forms of expertise involve differing standards of legitimate performance, differing encumbrance on the work of others, and differing sources of authority.",Knowledge and Expertise in Organizations,Organizational Communication

How do cultural minorities “communicate with power” through creative uses of physical and mediated spaces? The study examines how increasing online media use may be influencing the nature of minority activism, and in turn, how physical protest cultures manifest in or are sustained by online mobilization strategies. We also explore how this hybrid space of physical and virtual cultural activism influence shifts in representation, target audiences, goals, identity, and commitment. The study is based on observations of indigenous and LGBT protest cultures in the Philippines. The artefacts of physical and digital culture are examined in context, with focus on understanding complex linkages between the visual and textual modalities, and their interplay with the lived realities of the cultural activists who engage with them.",Top Faculty Papers in ERIC,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2016-1206,2016,Paper Session,Entrapment as a Threat to Community Peace in the Global War on Terror: An Analysis of Discourse in Local Press,3,"The Global War on Terror (GWOT) doctrine disregards contemporary discourses of multiculturalism (Hall, 2006), by not being able to foment global Peace or Freedom (Butler, 2006; Zizeck, 2011). The GWOT entrenches discourses of fear and terror in the collective consciousness, through serial reportage of news and entertainment (Altheide, 2006). Since 9/11 the FBI budgets have increased manifold to reflect pre-emptive security tactics whose main method is entrapment by locating terrorists in mostly urban communities rich in immigrant populations. Our study tries to understand the phenomenon of Entrapment which is an outcome of a)security discourses that prioritize pre-emptive community strategies; b) the ongoing military initiative of GWOT; c) and the increased budgetary convergence of state agencies of NSA, FBI and the military, resultantly impacting the legal and court processes that indict “homegrown” terrorists.
We offer a critical discourse analysis of the events that led to the arrest and trial of Mohamed Osman Mohamud covered in local newspapers, Oregonian and Willamette Week, after he was held for the intent to use a weapon-of-mass-destruction during a customary Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Portland on November 26, 2010. The press and defense lawyers call this case an FBI entrapment. Entrapments, of which there are hundreds documented in the US alone, pose a serious threat to community Peace and to contemporary understandings of multiculturalism. The coverage of Mohamud’s story does not create a critical shift in the tenor of public debate that has learned to harshly judge any event that has overtones of the GWOT. Our high alert status about domestic terrorism, post 9/11, does not allow us as the reading public to be a fair and compassionate jury. Nor does it make the public overly alarmed about a judicial system that sentences race-d youth of few means, to maximum life imprisonment, as they are in keeping with extant incarceration trends among African Americans and immigrants of color.",Top Faculty Papers in ERIC,Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2016-1207,2016,Paper Session,Problematizing Japanese Nationalism and Racism in Everyday Communication,1,"This essay explores the interrelationship between Japanese nationalism and racism as everyday practices in order to elucidate critical issues for a more inclusive Japanese society. Despite a recent increase in publicly expressed verbal and behavioral aggression against people of Korean and Chinese descent by ultra-right groups, racism still tends to be downplayed as a foreign issue in Japan. This limited public awareness of racism in Japan is closely connected to the two Japanese concepts of race—jinshu and minzoku—and to the idea of Japan as a single- racial/ethnic nation. In this essay, I engage in three conceptual discussions: the relationship between nationalism and racism; the Japanese concepts of race that impact the relationship in Japan; nationalism and racism as everyday practices. Then using examples from the interviews that I conducted with people of Korean and Chinese descent in the course of multiple research projects, I examine how nationalism and racism are intersected in everyday communication.",Top Faculty Papers in ERIC,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Based on semi-structured interviews with 23 LGBTQs living in Belgium, two groups are distinguished: voluntary migrants, who chose to move, and forced migrants, who (felt they) had to leave their country because of their sexual orientation. Comparing their familial and ethno-cultural connections, it becomes clear that both groups – for varying reasons and to varying degrees – feel disconnected from their countries of origin, families, and ethno-cultural communities in Belgium. For all participants, digital media are a key tool to maintain some connections, but particularly for the forced migrants 'context collapse' on social media leads to a sense of insecurity. Overall, this research illustrates the importance of intersecting variables in research on the e-diaspora, as well as the impact of 'offline' legal and material conditions on online media uses.",Top Faculty Papers in ERIC,Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Interestingly, in recent years there is a growing number of female audience following mega-sporting events. This paper therefore explores watching motives of women and men across three mega-sporting events (FIFA World Cup 2006, UEFA European Championship 2008, and FIFA World Cup 2010) and compares intensities of the three central motives 1) thrill, 2) entertainment, and 3) information, with special regard of the general interest in sport. Results indicate that with increasing interest in sport the differences of motives between women and men decrease. Consequently, these findings provide first valuable insights for explaining the phenomenon of mega-sporting events being more and more important and attractive even for women.","Fandom: Behaviors, Attitudes, Values",Sports Communication
2016-1210,2016,Paper Session,Coping With Dilemma: How Sport Media Users Respond to Sport Megaevents in Autocratic Countries,4,"In recent years sport mega events have been more frequently awarded to autocratic countries whose regimes violate democratic values. Based on the theory of cognitive dissonance we assume that this is a potential source of internal conflict for viewers, especially for sports enthusiastic and politically aware recipients. We conducted an online survey among 711 German respondents to examine how recipients cope with their dilemma using the forthcoming FIFA soccer World Cup 2018 in Russia serves as an example. We subsequently address the consequences this recipient behavior has for relevant stakeholders such as the host country and the media. We found that the awareness of sociopolitical issues in the context of sport events in autocratic regimes is arguably low. Recipients try to elude their dilemma by preferring sports broadcastings without coverage on the event’s negative circumstances, and by boycotting products and sponsors associated with the event.","Fandom: Behaviors, Attitudes, Values",Sports Communication

Media coverage has magnified the centrality of sport in contemporary life and, across platforms, is available 24/7 to young and old alike. More often than not, we become a fan of something – a player, team, school, league, sport, event. For fans, sport carries great meaning: It shapes daily life, influences relationships, and affects their sense of well-being. Those of us who are fans personally, viscerally, understand the important role sport plays in our lives. At the same time, fanship may not be static. Instead, it may ebb and flow as the tides of work, family, friendships – and health – wash over our journey through life. In this paper, we argue that sport fanship is likely to decline over time and then use survey data to assess the validity of that assertion.","Fandom: Behaviors, Attitudes, Values",Sports Communication

2016-1217,2016,Paper Session,Cross-Pressuring Conservative Catholics? The U.S. Public’s Reaction to Pope Francis’ Encyclical on Climate Change,5,"This year, Pope Francis created cross pressure on Catholics who identify with their Church’s pro-life, traditional marriage doctrines by releasing an official church statement casting the need to address climate change as a moral imperative. To examine the effects of this cross pressuring on Catholics, we conducted two nationally-representative phone surveys with Catholic oversamples. Rather than change their views on climate change or on the Pope wholesale, respondents seemed to selectively exaggerate or denigrate the Pope’s credibility according to whether his message agreed with their beliefs. Although one might expect Catholics to be more influenced by the Pope, patterns were similar for Catholics and non-Catholics. Even among those cross pressured by a credible leader of one's own religious institution, political ideology remains a strong predictor of attitudes about climate change. Furthermore, communications about climate change may be more likely to result in polarization than in overall shifts.",Messages That Move,Theme Sessions

The ultimate goal of the study is theory building by challenging and revising the localization model with a case study of a multilateral organization intervening in a multinational health crisis. Global public relations and communications management theories are not the norm and more theory building is needed to explicate multinational phenomena. The case study is developed with phone and online interviews, news coverage, campaign’s materials, documents of the AU commission, and social media posts. Results indicate that a sequential and almost prescriptive process for localization’s execution missed the reality of resistance in complex environments, which demands the refinement of the model.

Using a health crisis scenario, a 3 (one hour vs. one day vs. one week after the crisis) × 2 (emotional vs. rational appeal) between-subjects experiment (N=502) found that a crisis response posted one day after the crisis on Facebook elicited greater trust towards the hospital in crisis compared to a response posted in one week. The one-hour response and one-day response did not show differential effects on trust towards the hospital. The effect of timing was mediated by perceived credibility of the crisis response. In addition, an emotional appeal triggered greater trust, perception of reputation, and intention to “like” the post; whereas, a rational appeal elicited greater intention to share and comment on the post.

2016-1225,2016,Paper Session,Consumers’ Prosocial Engagement in CSR: Why Should They Care and What Does it Mean to Them?,2,"Public relations practitioners worldwide are attempting to enhance the overall organization-stakeholder relationships by applying strategic communication techniques and skills to CSR management and communications. In this light, the current study is a part of a seminal effort to build a consumer- and social cause-oriented CSR communication model, which maximizes the impact of CSR investments on both consumer relationship building, business bottom-line, and social causes. First, drawing on the prosocial motivation literature, this paper investigates people’s implicit and explicit motivations for prosocial behavior, and how these two motivations interact to affect consumers’ willingness to contribute to CSR activities. Second, through the lens of sense-making theory, this study evaluates the influence of successful prosocial behavior engagement on consumers’ perceptions of both self and companies’ prosocial identities, CSR authenticity, and company evaluations.",Crisis Communication in the Health Contexts,Public Relations
2016-1226,2016,Paper Session,"What We Need is Communication, Done Well: Vernacular Globalization in Hungarian Citizens’ Assessments of Political “Communication”",1,"The study uses a combination of ethnographic methods developed by Katriel & Philipsen (1981) and cultural discourse analysis to investigate the cultural meanings of the term kommunikáció (“communication”) as a discursive resource available to Hungarian citizens for the purpose of assessing political communication. The term’s use was organized around three semantic domains: a distinction speakers made between “good” and “bad” communication, communication’s effects on Hungarian society, and its effectiveness. These three domains implied a set of standards for assessment and a vision of ideal social order. Metadiscourse about “communication” also pointed to its dual character as a means to an end with instrumental value and as an end in itself with intrinsic value. Analysis and interpretation showed that Hungarian citizens’ use of the term combined local and translocal (mobile) meanings and, as a result, it allowed insight into the complex process of vernacular globalization (Appadurai, 1996).","Exploring the Meaning of Sharing, Citizenship, Communication, and Complaining in Cultural Discourses",Language & Social Interaction
2016-1227,2016,Paper Session,When Sharing Became Caring: A Historical Analysis,1,"When did sharing become caring? The answer to this question can shed light on the cultural underpinnings of a contemporary keyword. To this end, I offer an analysis of the word ‘sharing’ based on 4417 instances in texts spanning two centuries. A key insight on which this paper rests is that the particular configuration of meanings that constitute the word ‘sharing’ today make it both a term with special power in contemporary culture, and a term through which to understand our world. It is able to do a great deal of cultural work precisely because ‘sharing’ is a word that enfolds within it a group of meanings that both reflect and reproduce important aspects of contemporary society. Unlike 150 years ago, say, today ‘sharing’ implies equality, mutuality, and a relationship freely entered into. This paper traces the emergence of these associations throughout the twentieth century.","Exploring the Meaning of Sharing, Citizenship, Communication, and Complaining in Cultural Discourses",Language & Social Interaction

Data including observations of naturally occurring talk, interviews, online, and broadcast content was collected during 2012. A brief discussion of the main findings from the dissertation is followed by a piece of journalistic programming (rubric) examined through cultural discourse analysis (Carbaugh, 2007). The “rubric” is examined for the critical dimensions (Carbaugh, 1989/90), with particular attention to the natives’ problematizing of oplakvane. The lexical elements of the term oplakvane (mourning, lamenting, and complaining) deter the participants from labeling the enactments of oplakvane as such, thus leading the commonly intelligible practice to transgress and overtake other ways of speaking, and get in the way of productive political discourse. Thus, what constitutes oplakvane and its identification as such becomes of crucial importance to the existing political discourse.","Exploring the Meaning of Sharing, Citizenship, Communication, and Complaining in Cultural Discourses",Language & Social Interaction

However, no data exists regarding the temporal order and predictive value of these variables in pre-adolescents’ development of an objectified self-concept. The present two-wave panel study (N = 1612, Mage = 11.30) addressed this issue by examining the applicability of the three-step process of self-objectification, as well as interpersonal predictors (peer appearance conversations) of this process in an integrated model linking appearance media exposure with pre-adolescents’ objectified self-concept over time. Structural equation analyses demonstrated that pre-adolescents’ development of an objectified self-concept followed a three-step process, in which appearance media exposure positively predicted the internalization of appearance ideals, which, in turn, positively predicted self-objectification and body surveillance. Moreover, we identified a reinforcing role for peers in this process, in that peer appearance conversations were both predictive of and arising from media internalization",The Study of Adolescents in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

At first, media effects on the occupational orientation of adolescents are scrutinized. At second, media effects on cognitive accessibility are focused in this context. At third, survey data from panel analysis of 3,300 pupils in Germany is presented. The results indicate that occupational related television use (e.g. watching television programs related to health occupations) enhances the probability of related occupations to be part of the cognitive set of occupations as well as to occupy more prior positions in the cognitive set of occupations. Finally, the cognitive set of occupations supports developing occupational aspirations which in the literature is regarded as beneficial factor for a successful occupational orientation.",The Study of Adolescents in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

Establishing information habits is thereby closely related to political identity formation. Based on the observation of an overall growth in news exposure in adolescence, but a gap between news avoiders and news seekers, the present study deals with the development of news attendance during the transition from early to middle adolescence. By analyzing data from a two-wave panel study, we investigate change and stability in news attendance and explore to what extent it can be traced back to family and peer influences. Results further support the notion of a great heterogeneity in the development of adolescents’ news exposure, with only some adolescents showing an increase in interest in news and politics. Both parent and peer influences were positively related to changes in young people’s news attendance by enhancing political interest.",The Study of Adolescents in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

From the Toxic Avengers and Swamp Thing to Gak and Floam, mass media offered children a variety of ways to metaphorically and at time literally consume slime In this essay I explore the utility of slime to American children during this time period, suggesting that the copious amounts of slime present during this time period were more than just an entertainment fad and served a greater use value than simple grossing-out adults. Drawing from the works of Gramsci and Althusser I argue for understanding the properties of mediated slime as functioning as a form of compensatory fiction for children who had recently lost significant accesses to public space. As compensatory fiction, slime provided children with imaginary solutions to their real-life problems, helping to maintaining hegemonic equilibrium in the face of shifting rights of children.",The Study of Adolescents in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

My findings reveal that gender is highlighted as a socially constructed category in news reporting about political leaders. By prefacing nouns like candidate, leader or prime minister with adjectives such as woman, female, mother or lady, news coverage highlights gender distinctions and suggests they are politically meaningful and consequential. Yet by noticing the gender of a political leader, media coverage exposes power imbalances and gendered assumptions about who should exercise political leadership. I find that competing and contradictory meanings often coincide in gender marking of leaders’ political careers and activities.",Gendering Politics and Political Activisms,Feminist Scholarship
2016-1235,2016,Paper Session,Gendered Campaign Tweets: The Cases of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,2,"Social media have emerged as the major digital public relation tools in politics. Twitter, in particular, has become an essential part of political campaigns, benefiting those traditionally disadvantaged with less media visibility. Female politicians tend to actively utilize new technologies such as campaign websites to counteract damaging gender stereotypes. Studies have found female candidates are more likely than male candidates to have Twitter accounts and actively post messages describing their issue stances and personality traits, with a particular emphasis on masculine traits. The present study examined how gender-role stereotypes are reflected in the strategic ways male and female front runners for the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election – Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump – present themselves on their websites and Twitter. The content analysis of the two candidates’ websites and tweets revealed significant differences in many aspects: their emphasis on traits and issues, main content of tweet, main source of retweet, multimedia use, and the level of civility. Compared to Trump, Clinton significantly more stressed her masculine traits and feminine issues. While she used interactive, inviting wording and multimedia messages more frequently in her tweets, Trump used significantly more citizen sources to retweet.

Analysis shows that women are seen as engaging in what might initially be considered as gaze aversion for purposes of feminine submission. Yet, when placed in the context of an image’s color and spatial orientation, the interplay of the gaze of the women in the graffiti and the audience of the graffiti creates a powerful sense of Cairene women’s agency. Specifically, this analysis extends the meaning of agency from simply being self-determination to “interhuman responsive action responsible for the Other” (Arnett, 2003, 39).",Gendering Politics and Political Activisms,Feminist Scholarship

It also examined how individual differences such as political interest and political cynicism moderate the impact of positively and negatively valenced frames in traditional and alternative media respectively. The study employed an experimental design and found that positively valenced frames in non-competitive traditional media messages exerted more influence on support for public policy compared to the competitive condition.

By employing two survey experiments, a student sample (N = 259) and a nonstudent sample (N = 507), this paper traces the effects of both metaphorical frames. Our results show that individuals take over the metaphorical frame elements in their evaluation of the Euro crisis. Participants in the war conditions significantly more often referred to war when answering the open questions. Alternatively, when the Euro crisis was framed as a disease, participants were more likely to use words and sentences containing disease frame elements. This finding implies that these metaphors and wordings may also be used in their future evaluations.",The Effects of Frames,Political Communication

This study investigated how alternative temporal frames used to inform inequality potentially influence preferences on policy efforts to reduce it. An analysis of U.S. news media (N=3,822 articles; Study 1) found that inequality was mostly described through linguistic cues pertaining to the past, rather than the future perspective. A between-subjects experiment (N=581 Americans; Study 2) found that the future framing condition, compared to the past and no message conditions, led to greater support for redistributive policies among conservatives, who have historically shown opposition to such policy initiatives, by an increased valuation of individualizing moral intuitions (concerns for harm and fairness).",The Effects of Frames,Political Communication

As the topic of community policing reemerges, the philosophical appeal remains, yet it has been used as a form of face saving and as a means to fund tactical units. On a subtler level, this study proposes that police subculture in the United States contrasts the general populace significantly, which could explain tensions between the police and public. Examination of the characteristics of this subculture shed some light onto the policing paradigm and on how communication unfolds inside and outside of police organizations. Through this synthesis, the appropriateness of a quasi-military paradigm and its resulting structure, language, and behavior, is brought into question.",National and Organizational Culture and Communication,Organizational Communication

My article advances understanding of neoliberal subjectivity through discourse analysis of how the ideology is articulated by Japanese ‘salarymen’ in work-focused interviews. This illuminates the ongoing successes and struggles of neoliberal inculcation in less native soil, traditionally less amenable to ‘free-market fundamentalism.’ The analysis is divided into three main sections, each exploring the predominant orientation articulated by respondents towards the neoliberalization of Japan: affirmation, ambivalence, and neoliberalism qua neoconservatism. Attention is focused on the ideological ambivalences or ambiguities participants explicitly or implicitly voice – for example, neoconservative sentiments that ostensibly reject ‘Americanization’ yet align with neoliberal work intensification; or the simultaneous advocacy of neoliberalism and more progressive liberalization. Examining such lines of ideological entanglement identifies rhetorical pressure points in any socio-cultural sphere for political, public critique of neoliberalism’s hegemonic hold on work and self-identity.",National and Organizational Culture and Communication,Organizational Communication

A new trend that has emerged recently in authoritarian China, however, indicates that the state could enhance its political legitimacy and governance through coopting protests, rather than direct suppression. This study examines the government’s handling of the anti-incineration protests in Guangzhou from 2009 through 2012, and explores how a successful authoritarian cooption of the protests was realized through communication and PR strategies. Through textual analysis and in-depth interviews, it shows that while urban protesters have been relying on the media to amplify their causes, government’s PR strategies made the media gradually become either voluntarily or passively favorable toward the government, and increasingly indifferent towards the protesters. Meanwhile, as protesters became alienated among each other, the appeal of their protests became vague and their capability of mobilization was undermined.

We argue that Chinese official microblogs heavily invest in propaganda practices that intend to guide the public opinion and uphold the Party ideology. Drawing inspiration from Brady's analysis of the overarching principles of Chinese propaganda, the paper highlights that the specific propaganda tactics vary distinctly between different microblogs. The microblogs of People's Daily, CCTV, and Xinhua demonstrate three distinctive models of propaganda, as we term 'positive energy engine', 'image promoter and repairer',and 'implicit anchor of propaganda' respectively. The considerable diversity in propaganda practices of the three official microblogs challenge the dominant analytical framework of considering official microblog as monolithic.

The resulting analyses shed light on how television exposure during childhood and adolescence may have long-term impacts on adult attachment dimensions (i.e., attachment anxiety and avoidance). Through the use of an online survey, responses from 695 students from a large Midwestern university were obtained. Findings indicate that early overall and genre-specific television exposure can directly promote both secure (lower attachment avoidance) and insecure (higher attachment anxiety) attachment above the influence of parent and peer attachment; however, these relationships are complex when dimensions of perceived realism and romantic self-efficacy are also considered. These patterns of findings contribute to the body of literature on both attachment theory and cultivation analysis, and offer many directions for future research.","Language, Behavior, and Cognition and Their Influences on Perception and Communication Behaviors",Interpersonal Communication

This study compares characteristics of the illness and characteristics of a patient’s romantic relationship as factors that predict coping behaviors for individuals with type 2 diabetes. We identify illness uncertainty (Mishel, 1990) as a feature of chronic illness that influences coping and, drawing on the relational turbulence model (Solomon & Knobloch, 2004), we identify relational uncertainty and interference from partners as relationship characteristics that affect coping. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we recruited 500 participants who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and involved in a romantic relationship to complete an online survey about the experience of their illness in the context of their relationship. Structural equation model results showed that relational uncertainty and partner interference were both positively associated with the perceived threat of discussing the illness, whereas the effect for illness uncertainty was nonsignificant; thus, relationship characteristics were a more robust predictor of perceived threat than illness characteristics. In turn, the perceived threat of discussing the illness was negatively associated with treatment compliance and positively associated with topic avoidance about the illness. Treatment compliance was also negatively associated with topic avoidance. Implications for health and relationships are discussed.","Language, Behavior, and Cognition and Their Influences on Perception and Communication Behaviors",Interpersonal Communication

MABS specifies the organization of psychological components: a schematic frame (or working model), motivation, and emotion. These patterns of experience mediate between attachment situations and the communication strategy employed. The model shows how self-regulatory processes respond to interpersonal outcomes and how, over time, these responses can lead to chronic biases in communicating.","Language, Behavior, and Cognition and Their Influences on Perception and Communication Behaviors",Interpersonal Communication
2016-1260,2016,Paper Session,The Circulation of Communicative Objects,2,"Increasingly ubiquitous digital infrastructures are significantly altering the ways in which journalistic content acquires social value. A key argument is here that processes of circulation, contrary to the analogue landscape, are becoming much more integrated with the construction of social meaning, e.g. via social media. In order to approach this confluence of circulation as technology and hermeneutics we introduce the term communicative object, which merges a digital (“material”) object and an epistemic object through which knowledge and meaning are created and transferred. What needs to be understood are thus the processes through which communicative objects circulate in a digital landscape; and the argument put forward in this paper is that approaching the circulation of journalism through the duality of the communicative object allows for a more nuanced starting point for understanding how contemporary journalism becomes embedded in a variety of divergent social contexts.",Digital News: What It Is and How To Understand It,Journalism Studies
2016-1261,2016,Paper Session,Mapping Digital Journalism: Comparing 48 News Websites From Six Countries,2,"Online journalism has been celebrated for potentially revolutionizing political reporting due to its new technological possibilities: It is able to increase transparency by providing hyperlink sources, increase understanding by providing further background information, and add to deliberation and follow-up communication by providing a platform for interactive exchange.
A comparative content analysis of 48 news websites from six countries (France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain and United States) examines the degree to which these three potential strengths are fully exploited and maps media systems and organizations in order to identify characteristic types of digital journalism. We find three different types of news websites: (1) outlets promoting the usage of links to make their sources transparent (“transparency model”), (2) outlets focusing on the provision of tools to enable a wider understanding of the reported topic (“background model”), and outlets that mainly avoid the adoption of new technologies (“print-oriented model”). These findings show that different structural developments and professional orientations lead to the adaption of different technologies in digital journalism.",Digital News: What It Is and How To Understand It,Journalism Studies
2016-1262,2016,Paper Session,Connect and Engage: Civic Journalism Values and Newsroom Norms in the Digital Era,4,"The relationship between audiences and journalists has changed rapidly and dramatically as audiences have become more active creators of content and participants in news making. This in-depth case study explores the impact and interplay of interrelated changes in technologies, work practices, and media output on attempts to shift journalists’ normative orientation from an inwardly facing newsroom to an externally facing community one. This study draws on lessons from experiments in civic journalism, which sought to focus journalists’ attention on understanding and addressing community issues and concerns from the perspective of citizens rather than officials and other elites. Focusing on one converged news organization, this paper explores how civic goals are faring in a newsroom environment that is increasingly focused on digital content. Our study offers unique insight into newsworkers’ understanding and acceptance of these civic journalism goals, as well as their perceived relevance to the newsroom practices, norms, and products.",Digital News: What It Is and How To Understand It,Journalism Studies

We ask whether the dynamics of news flows arising from the timing of publication decisions are associated with newsroom opportunity structures resulting from orientation towards user habits, news factors, and topics. Based on a machine-based content analysis totally comprising 480,727 online news articles, we reconstructed the dynamics of 95 news diffusion processes among 28 German news sites. We find diffusion processes starting during the day compared to starting during the night and society news compared to political news to be positively associated with rapid dynamics of news flows. For single news factors, we find both positive and negative relationships with news diffusion dynamics. The results suggest that primarily event properties contributing to unambiguity and deviance promote patterns of burstiness during digital news flows.",Digital News: What It Is and How To Understand It,Journalism Studies

A scene from a popular comedy was manipulated to end with a character continuing to eat (ongoing) or finish eating (completed). Viewers ate more after watching the ongoing version compared to the completed version, but only among those manipulated to identify with a character. Viewers were more likely to choose savory food after viewing the ongoing version, but sweet food after viewing the completed version. The results extend the notion of media influence on unconscious goal contagion and satiation to movie eating, and raise the possibility that completing a goal can activate a logically subsequent goal.

This study seeks to understand adolescents' motivation in the reduction of obesity and promoting healthier lifestyles in low-income communities. Data were gathered among adolescents (n=410) in three U.S. States - Kansas, Ohio and South Dakota. Results show motivation for health to be associated with adolescents' perceptions of support for physical activity in their communities and with their outcome expectancies. Other identified predictors for motivation include their perceptions for physical activity and for peers' motivation to stay healthy. Predicting nutritional factors include their perceptions on food availability and efficacy for food choice but efficacy for healthy eating was insignificant.

The results demonstrated a variety of sources were attempting to educate the public about the benefits of eating healthy and ways to make better food choices, but different sources put different emphasis on contents. All the four elements drawn from HBM model were presented in PSAs but not on equal basis. The use of persuasive message appeals appeared to be matched with content elements.

The current examination compares the impact of three different types of consequence framing (emphasis on health consequences vs. social consequences vs. financial consequences of physical inactivity) on health-related perceptions and intentions of different population subgroups, differing in terms of age, sex, and education. To this end an experiment with a one-factorial between subjects design was conducted. 348 respondents (quota sample) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions and read an accordingly manipulated newspaper article. The results demonstrate that interactions between sociodemographic characteristics and differently framed health messages are complex and deserve further attention from health communication scholars.",Obesity and Promoting Healthy Eating,Health Communication

In our research we focus on parents’ information seeking as parents are highly relevant for children and adolescents. The theoretical framework of our research is provided by the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM). In total 353 parents participated in an experi-mental online questionnaire and were randomly assigned to one out of four manipulated web-sites featuring information about overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. Our findings show that a higher perception of susceptibility significantly influences the need for information concerning health related issues. Moreover, our findings show that individual coping style affects the need for health information. In line with the premises of the EPPM our findings also indicate that perceived efficacy as well as perceived susceptibility determine parents’ intention to promote their children’s health.",Obesity and Promoting Healthy Eating,Health Communication

Yet, the proliferation of scholarship with different operational definitions, ontological foundations, and analytical approaches makes it difficult for scholars to compare findings and advance communication theory related to affordances. In this paper, we review the history of affordances work in human computer interaction (HCI), information systems, and sociology. We delineate how affordances frameworks have been used, and address the types of research questions and phenomena on which these traditions tend to focus. We conclude by presenting an agenda for how affordances can facilitate research on communication technologies. Specifically, we describe how these traditions emphasize actor, technology, and action orientations, and how these orientations connect with perceived, functional, and social affordances perspectives. By using an interdisciplinary, historical approach, this work offers scholars multiple paths for incorporating affordances into research on communication technologies.",Exploring Technological Affordances,Communication and Technology
2016-1270,2016,Paper Session,"Social Media, Relational Closeness, and Interpreting Social Support From Paralinguistic Digital Affordances",3,"Many social media facilitate paralinguistic digital affordances (PDAs): one-click tools for phatic communication to which senders and receivers alike ascribe meaning. This research explores the nature of social support perceived from the receipt of PDAs within social media, seeking to understand how individuals ascribe supportive meaning to PDAs based on (1) their goal in the post to which the PDA was used as a reply, (2) relational closeness with the PDA provider, and (3) the perceived automaticity of the PDA received. A national survey (N = 325) explored the receipt of PDAs across five social media, and facilitated cross-platform analysis. Analyses reveal both main and interaction effects among the three proposed antecedents, so that intentional PDAs from relationally close providers to messages seeking social support were perceived as most supportive. Findings reveal individuals heuristically make idiosyncratic sense of the same cue from different senders in different situations.",Exploring Technological Affordances,Communication and Technology
2016-1271,2016,Paper Session,Technological Affordance-Based Gratifications and Their Impact on Media Selection,3,"This study examines how technological affordances introduce new gratifications and whether these gratifications influence media consumption behaviors. An online survey was conducted to examine whether individuals perceive technological affordance-based gratifications for different devices (TV, laptops, tablets, & smartphones) and whether these gratifications influence media consumption. Results show that technology do cultivate a variety of new gratifications (e.g., being there, community building, interaction). We also found individuals use different devices to consume different media content in order to receive different affordance-based gratifications. Our findings show the power of communication technology in cultivating individuals’ psychological needs. It also broadens the U&G research by identifying new gratifications. Practical implications of our study include 1) recommendations for designing technological features that can better satisfy individuals’ psychological needs; 2) benefiting advertisers and markets in that they can learn how to highlight technological features that appeal to individuals.",Exploring Technological Affordances,Communication and Technology
2016-1272,2016,Paper Session,The Affordances Test: A Conceptual Model for Understanding Affordances in Communication Research,4,"This study examines how affordances terminology is being used in communication research, particularly in recent empirical research on communication and technology. Through an analysis of articles in 11 leading communication and new media journals, in combination with a convenience sample of recent empirical articles, we identify three primary inconsistencies regarding the use of affordances. First, much research describes a particular affordance without engaging with other scholarship that addresses the same affordance. Second, research exists that identifies “lists” of affordances, without conceptually developing the individual affordances. Third, the affordances perspective is evoked in situations where the supposed affordance does not in fact meet commonly accepted definitions of an affordance. We conclude with a framework we call the “Affordances Test.” This framework can aid communication scholars and those in other disciplines in testing their assumptions about affordances in order to facilitate a more consistent approach to conceptualizing and applying this concept.",Exploring Technological Affordances,Communication and Technology
2016-1273,2016,Paper Session,"College, Mental Health, and a Violent Student: Employing Numerical Formats to Communicate Risk on Campus",1,"Non-experts, including administrators, professors, and students are often faced with risk assessment decisions on campus. Despite this fact, there are few accepted professional standards for presenting statistical risk and far fewer recommendations for the communication of violence risk. Existing systematic reviews are both incomplete and limited in scope. More troubling are the contradictory conclusions and competing recommendations for the communication of information that is essential to decision making. In this article, three concerns in the violence risk communication literature are addressed. Non-experts are asked to make risk estimates using information from an expert source. This project also moves research attention to a new and important domain, campus violence. Finally, multiple outcomes are assessed in an effort to extend the scope of research beyond Bayesian reasoning. Outcomes include: risk judgements, linguistic features, and affective processing as put forth by the affective processing theories. The effect of estimating or communicating risk as a probability is compared to the effect of estimating or communicating risk as a frequency.","Health Risks: Ebola, Polio, Violence, Emergencies",Health Communication
2016-1274,2016,Paper Session,Exploring Factors That Influence the Speed of Public Response to Health Emergencies on Microblogging Sites,2,"Online public response to health emergencies is a major and complex public health issue. This study employs hierarchical linear modeling to investigate the speed of online users’ response to health emergency information on Chinese microblogging sites. The response times for all posts are unevenly distributed in a manner known as power-law distribution. We further examine the effects of the characteristics of original messages and information sources as well as factors of reposted messages and information transmitters in determining the response time of messages on health emergencies. Original messages with different topics and emotional orientations have different response times. In addition, homophily of geographical location among dyadic information transmitters, addressivity of reposted messages, and degree of activity and popularity of information transmitters shorten the response times. This study expands the theory of social amplification of risk model to an online context and contributes to the literature on information diffusion by identifying the effects of dyadic relationships among information transmitters.","Health Risks: Ebola, Polio, Violence, Emergencies",Health Communication
2016-1275,2016,Paper Session,Measuring Perceived Susceptibility: Conditional Versus Unconditional Phrasing,1,"The Extended Parallel Process Model was used as a guide to investigate the potential advantages of measuring perceptions of susceptibility conditioned on possible future actions. A survey of 398 undergraduate students examined participants’ existing perceptions of the threat of Ebola and the efficacy of then-newly-announced possible Ebola treatments. Participants reported their perceptions of base-line, or absolute, susceptibility (e.g., “I will probably get Ebola”) and conditional susceptibility (e.g., “If Ebola patients are brought to [state] for treatment, I will likely be exposed to Ebola.”) Both bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis demonstrated that conditional measures of susceptibility are more predictive of participants’ willingness to endorse a number of potential public-health related public policies. The data suggest that using conditional phrasing in perceived susceptibility measures is an improvement over unconditional phrasing.","Health Risks: Ebola, Polio, Violence, Emergencies",Health Communication

Specifically, we tracked and coded polio-related references on Hebrew news websites, blogs, forums and Facebook posts. Overall, 24,388 polio-related references constituted our sampling frame. The findings suggest that there is a moderate-level correlation between the platform and the type of sources chosen by users. Beyond the differences between various platforms, we found that online information platforms rely not only on popular or pseudo-scientific sources, but also on high quality information. In fact, the analysis indicates that online news websites, forums, blogs and Facebook posts create a unique blend of information, including scientific literature, medical professionals, government representatives, as well as pseudo-scientific research. These findings suggest a more optimistic view of the Internet as a source for health-related information in times of crises.","Health Risks: Ebola, Polio, Violence, Emergencies",Health Communication

The Role of Psychological Proximity in Public Attention and Fear for Ebola,3,"Previous studies have shown the potential of Twitter as a tracking medium for epidemics, but these analyses have not yet yielded generalizable insights about human responses to health crises. Building on Construal Level Theory, this research examined how public attention and fear for the 2014 Ebola outbreak responded to gradual changes in spatial and social closeness of the outbreak, and to the severity of the outbreak. Number of tweets, Ebola infections and fatalities were tracked across 7 months, as the outbreak spread from West Africa to Europe and the US. Twitter content was coded for psychological closeness, and for fear for self and others across a time frame of 3.5 months. Findings show that, even though the vast majority of Ebola infections and deaths occurred in West Africa, public attention and expressions of fear mostly responded to the psychological proximity of Ebola. Especially fear for self was related to psychological proximity. These findings point to the limits of the human condition in caring for psychologically distant others.","Health Risks: Ebola, Polio, Violence, Emergencies",Health Communication

A comprehensive search for studies and several rounds of screening yielded a total of 66 peer-reviewed articles that met our inclusion criteria (reporting on 55 unique studies). Diverse technologies are being used to support psycho-educational interventions and different therapeutic goals. Mostly, communication technologies were used to sustain contact with providers during treatment, which brings to question whether provider contact is an essential element for technology-based psycho-educational interventions to be effective. ICT-feature-rich interventions that provided multiple modalities for supporting patient interaction were highly efficacious. However, we cannot discount the importance of clinician involvement. More controlled experimental studies and meta-analyses may help to unpack the combined effects of specific technology features and reveal ways to automate some aspects of clinician input.",Understanding Digital Health,Communication and Technology
2016-1279,2016,Paper Session,Technologies of Self-Persuasion: Mobile Apps for Health Behavioral Change,3,"Despite the widespread appeal of mobile interfaces for health information search or health behavior tracking, recent evidence indicates that we may be lagging behind on creating apps that can actually motivate users to change their health-related behaviors. A possible explanation for the lack of sustained use of health apps pertains to the motivational and persuasive approaches they typically employ. In particular, the vast majority of these apps utilize traditional persuasive approaches, involving a rather didactic, top-down educational component whereby an external source delivers an account for why adopting a health behavior is important. Increasingly, scholars recognize that this approach is largely ineffective in improving health and motivating preventive behaviors. The present paper employs a 3 (mobile persuasion: self-persuasion, other-generated persuasion - narrative, other-generated persuasion - non-narrative) X 2 (health topic: physical exercise vs. healthy diet) in order to determine how health mobile apps that encourage self-persuasion fare in comparison to those that rely on other-generated persuasion in the context of motivating specific health behavioral change.",Understanding Digital Health,Communication and Technology

A cross-sectional online survey was launched on Mechanical Turk in 2013. There were 156 participants recruited in the present study. Structural equation modeling was performed with EQS 6.2 for data analyses. Results revealed that, firstly, slacktivism was found to greatly and directly contribute to several health outcomes in terms of awareness, psychological wellbeing, and behavior adoption, indicating that slacktivism is actually conducive to health behavior change. Second, findings were consistent with the TransTheoretical Model, suggesting that behavior changes unfold in a temporal sequence of stages. In addition, slacktivism was found to be an important mediator of self-presentation and issue-involvement to all health behavior outcomes in the model. Lastly, time constraints and financial constraints were found to be moderators of one’s slacktivism activities. To conclude, it is not necessary to hold a skeptical view about slacktivism. Individuals’ minimal efforts put into online activism can actually be translated into increased awareness, better psychological wellbeing, greater behavioral intention and behavior adoption. In other words, engaging people who are only willing to effortlessly “share” or “like” a cause can be very valuable for health interventions and promotion.

Participants exposed to attractive models used more words relative to those exposed to unattractive models. Participants exposed to attractive models were less oriented to others based on reduced function words and pronouns, and also used fewer discrepancy words (e.g., could, would) compared with exposure to unattractive models. Fewer discrepancy words use may reflect upward social comparisons or thin ideal priming (i.e., dieting worked for her). Additionally, participants exposed to obese and unattractive models used more pronouns and perception words (e.g., weight, thin), which may reveal downward social comparisons or priming of unhealthy stereotypes that increased attention to others and their shape. The findings supported social comparison and priming predictions and suggested that words of advice are affected by website images and persuasive posts.",Understanding Digital Health,Communication and Technology

Theoretically, based on psychological consistency theory, we argue that a combination of the political leanings of journalists and perceptions of failure to achieve subjectively important aspects within the journalistic profession will engender both directly and indirectly the acceptance of questionable reporting practices. A mediation analysis shows that the perceived achievement of an active journalistic role explains to what extent journalists accept questionable reporting practices. We highlight the perceived role achievement as an important variable bridging the gap between journalists’ political leanings and their professional working practices.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies

Yet GamerGate was a unique journalistic scandal in that it at once questioned journalistic ethics and was the banner for a witch-hunt against women in game development and gaming criticism. Gaming journalists thus found themselves managing a debate on two fronts. This research explores how gaming journalists undertook paradigm maintenance through interviews with journalists (n=17) in the midst of the controversy as well as a discourse analysis of the texts produced by their publications in responding to GamerGate (n=32). Although gaming journalists operate within a form of lifestyle journalism (Hanusch, 2014), the journalists repaired their paradigm by linking their work to traditional journalism and emphasizing a paternal role.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies

This paper begins to address some of these gaps. Drawn from a larger project based on in-depth interviews with 83 private citizens who found themselves named, quoted, or featured in mainstream news stories in the United States, here I summarize my main findings as a set of four key differences between the way ordinary news subjects and journalists tend to view the news process. I find subjects’ and journalists’ perspectives differ strikingly in a number of important ways, including who has rightful ownership over a news story; what constitutes fair reporting of a controversy, how important the repercussions of a news story really are; and journalists’ relationship to power. In the discussion of my findings I explore how subjects’ perspectives can shed light on broader questions about public opinion of the press.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies

The present study investigates how journalists’ attitudes towards climate change predict its representation in the mass media. As heuristic, it draws on Shoemaker and Reese’s conceptual model of the individual communicator. Methodologically, we individually match a survey among 62 climate journalists from leading news outlets in five countries (DE, CH, IN, UK, US) with a content analysis of their news stories (N = 747) and conducted a multilevel analysis. We detect a modest but robust partial correlation between the journalist mindsets and their news stories. Besides, we provide evidence for the influence of the journalist’s political orientation and editorial support on the depiction of climate change.

Indo-Fijian diaspora known for having maintained an ‘Indian’ identity is presently, due to socio-political reasons in the process of emigrating. As Indo-Fijian diaspora becomes the ‘twice-removed’ diaspora, first from India and now from Fiji, it faces several threats to its community structure, strength and identity. Bollywood viewing, often hailed as an emblem of Indian values, is intertwined with Indo Fijian identity. This paper establishes a link between Indo-Fijans and hindi cinema and reflects on cultural implications as the Fiji-Indian diaspora’s consumes more western media and weakens its link with Bollywood? The paper concludes that Indo-Fijian identity will transform into a symbolic ethnicity as the new migrants engage in banal globalization.","Postcolonial Interrogations of Global Media, Culture, and Space",Global Communication and Social Change

Bias-induced anger, but not anxiety, motivated participants to want to read additional identity-threatening information. Perceived issue novelty elicited greater anger and anxiety and enhanced bias-induced anger’s effects on identity-threatening information preferences. The findings have implications for the relationship between exposure to identity-threatening news and information seeking in a democratic society.",The Study of Biases and News,Mass Communication

This study explores how networks interact with each other to articulate, describe, and identify their ideal audience. Through looking at Fox News Channel’s and Comedy Central’s coverage of the War on Christmas, this study identifies discourses surrounding each network’s audiences and interpretation of holiday festivities. It concludes that both networks use the War on Christmas to identify their audience and push ideological frameworks that support and criticize political orientations. Further, it explores how television hosts interact with hosts from other networks to build reputations as protectors of the silent majority and alternative journalists.",The Study of Biases and News,Mass Communication
2016-1295,2016,Paper Session,What Comes After the First Click? A New Way to Look at Selective Exposure,3,"In this study we experimentally test the effects of news exposure to pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal and mixed news content on subsequent information seeking behaviors in the context of the relationship between science and religion. Using a sample drawn from two large organizations that focus on issues of religion and science, and a nationally representative sample from an online panel, we tested and compared different measure of selective exposure. Our research aims to advance knowledge in the area of selective exposure by further examining factors that may encourage or reduce selective exposure, by extending research about it into a new topical domain, and by examining measurement issues within this line of research. Our findings suggest that there is a tendency of attitude-consistent exposure when people select the first article to read, but people also search for counter-attitudinal information in the subsequent information seeking. Our graphical measure of selective exposure questions the robustness of selective exposure phenomenon.",The Study of Biases and News,Mass Communication
2016-1296,2016,Paper Session,Communication Strategies Predict Success of Crowdfunding Campaigns,2,"Crowdfunding (CF) is a form of fundraising monetary contributions from a large number of people via the Internet, to support a specific goal. CF as a means of alternative financing is growing globally. Thus, CF research has gained increasing interest in recent years. However, the relationship between multimodal communication strategies and success in CF campaigns has not been analyzed. Here, we analyzed CF video campaigns and explored the effect of a wide range of communication strategies including verbal and nonverbal communication, and the interrelation of both communication modes in explaining success in CF campaigns. The study contributes various measures for success and failure (both financial and backer involvement). The findings present strong and significant predicting power of CF success based on communication strategies. The study expands the theoretical and analytical research on CF campaigns and develops models for communication success, which vary for each measurement of CF success.",The Study of Media and Persuasion,Mass Communication
2016-1297,2016,Paper Session,Does Nonnarrative Message Engagement (NNME) lead to Persuasion? Effects of Distraction on Engagement and Attitudes,2,"Prior research found persuasive effects of message engagement with an expository message, and this effect was mediated through a decrease in reactance and counterarguing (accounting for other measures of issue involvement). In a follow-up study, we test the effects of distraction on non-narrative message engagement (NNME), using a distraction task employed by Green and Brock (2000). The study objective was to test whether the effects of NNME on message-consistent beliefs in the context of expository messages are akin to the effects of distraction on transportation for narrative messages. Undergraduate students (n = 57) were exposed to messages supporting mandatory retirement (a new topic), and were randomly assigned to the distraction condition or a control condition. Results show that distraction reduced engagement, and that message engagement is positively associated with message-consistent post-exposure attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of their potential relevance to understanding the role of message engagement in persuasion.",The Study of Media and Persuasion,Mass Communication
2016-1298,2016,Paper Session,The Influence of Source Information on Psychological Reactance,1,"This study investigates the indirect effect of source information on attitudes toward anti-smoking campaigns through perceived bias and psychological reactance by employing a survey experiment. Findings demonstrate that an editorial advocating anti-smoking campaigns from ideologically congruent media is perceived as less biased than the same editorial from hostile media. The perceived bias is linked to perceived threat to freedom, which, in turn, is linked to psychological reactance against the editorial, resulting in less favorable attitudes toward anti-smoking campaigns. Smokers are more likely to show the linkages than non-smokers. These findings suggest source factors may have indirect impacts on audience attitude through perceived bias and psychological reactance.",The Study of Media and Persuasion,Mass Communication

The question who plays the dominant role in this relationship is still subject to a lively debate, and beyond the dynamic perspective of media-parties interactions deserves more attention. In order to analyze such dynamics, we rely on temporal pattern analysis. The data was collected by means of a content analysis of a) press releases published by parties and b) coverage of two leading newspapers per country 12 weeks preceding the elections. We find that most public discourses are started by the media. However, on issues which parties engage with during the campaign, a real interplay takes place between media and parties, supporting the notion that neither media nor politics dominate each other but their logics and strategies overlap und reinforce each other.",Parties and NGO's as Strategic Actors,Political Communication
2016-1300,2016,Paper Session,Issue Competition in Election Times: Parties’ Issue Strategies in Different Channels and Their Media Coverage,3,"Issue competition is a central activity during election times. Parties strive to dominate the political agenda with their favored issues. Their strategic choices are driven by two questions: Who owns an issue? How salient is it in the public discourse? In this paper, we develop an expanded model of issue competition by taking both questions into account. The new model assumes that the two strategies are dependent rather than independent from each other. In order to test the model, we conducted a quantitative content analysis on the election in Switzerland in 2011. We analyzed and compared statements from political parties in party owned and media-owned channels, namely paid advertising (n=1’697), election manifestos (n=132), press releases (n=341), and newspapers (n=534). The results reveal that the strategies vary across channels but not among parties. Moreover, established and unestablished parties solely differ in the media coverage they receive.",Parties and NGO's as Strategic Actors,Political Communication
2016-1301,2016,Paper Session,NGO Publicity and Parallel Path Dependencies: Explaining the Persistence of Media-Centered Publicity Strategies,1,"Research finds that NGO publicity strategies – despite the development of new technologies – continue to focus heavily on garnering coverage in the mainstream news media. Drawing on theories of path dependence and interviews with NGO professionals, this paper identifies three factors that explain why this should be so. First, donors see media coverage as a mechanism for measuring advocacy impact on public discourse. Second, political officials see media coverage as a way to learn about advocacy demands. Third, NGOs occupy a position that is socially proximate to journalism, which leads the former to see the latter as an ally in the pursuit of publicity. Together, these factors create a process of parallel path dependence: the tendency for present actions to be constrained in one field as a result of path dependent actions in related ones. This concept helps to explain why NGOs continue to persist in their media-centered publicity strategies.",Parties and NGO's as Strategic Actors,Political Communication
2016-1302,2016,Paper Session,Offline Advantages Online? Contrasting Activities of Swiss Politicians and Parties on Different Social Media Platforms,2,"Differences between Facebook and Twitter become evident when we investigate their use by political actors. In particular when we scrutinize how structural advantages of parties and politicians offline – such as their financial resources – are reflected online: Facebook should represent offline social networks more closely than Twitter increasing the relevance of offline structural advantages (normalization), while Twitter’s topical focus might improve opportunities for structurally disadvantaged political actors (equalization). The empirical study contrasts all 246 individual members and eleven parties represented in the Swiss parliament regarding their structural advantages offline and their online activities. 24,234 Facebook posts of 80 pages and 99,579 tweets of 117 accounts were analyzed. Whereas on Facebook normalization tendencies are stronger, on Twitter equalization can also be found. Political actors are able to transfer their supporters: from offline to online. But the structurally disadvantaged are online just as active as the more advantaged and generate as much resonance.",Parties and NGO's as Strategic Actors,Political Communication
2016-1303,2016,Paper Session,Online Communication Repertoires of International NGOs: An Analysis of Organizational Characteristics and Online Activities,2,"This study examines the influence of political and social factors on the online communication repertoires of international NGOs (INGOs). To be more precise, this study explores the issue of which organizational characteristics influence an INGO’s presence on the web and the intensity and style of its online activities. On the basis of a sample consisting of 466 NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations Organization, it is investigated whether the organizations are present on nine different online platforms, including websites, blogs, and social media. Moreover, a structural content analysis of websites and Facebook pages is conducted. Findings show that INGOs with headquarters in countries with a high human development standard and organizations with close relationships to the political center display elaborate online communication repertoires.

It asks how critics navigate the ever-multiplying and expanding intersections of the quantifiable (rankings and numerical ratings) and the qualitative (taste, quality, artistic merit, ekphrasis) that characterize criticism in a digital environment. I explore this relationship through a combination of interviews and online participant observations with online critics as they produce the year-end music list for a single music website in 2014 -- an aggregation of hundreds of individual critics’ lists. I propose two interrelated concepts that guide critics’ listmaking: the authority of aggregation, or the belief that the subjectivity of individual critics’ tastes can be corrected for through aggregation and averaging; and personal numeracy, or the uniquely subjective way critics understand and utilize numerical rankings and ratings.",Media Work in the Digital Age,Popular Communication
2016-1305,2016,Paper Session,The Mediatization of Fashion: The Case of Fashion Blogs,2,"Since the late 20th century, digital media have reconfigured fashion communication. Spurred by digital media logics – such as immediacy, interactivity, democratized access and distribution – new media genres, e.g. blogs, have challenged the fashion industry and its mass media portfolio of fashion magazines as authoritative intermediaries of fashion. Digital technologies have made fashion ubiquitous, contested the fashion world’s aura of exclusiveness and put pressure on the logics of fashion as an institution with its own rules and resources. To illustrate this argument, the paper investigates how fashion blogs as a distinct type of fashion communication are influenced by the formal and informal logics of the blog as a media technological and generic hybrid – with consequences to the logics of fashion. Based on case-studies we argue that fashion blogging challenges the authority of fashion as an institution and transforms previously important ways of fashion communication and the status of fashion itself.",Media Work in the Digital Age,Popular Communication
2016-1306,2016,Paper Session,The Practice of Parodying on YouTube,1,"Parodies are central to digital culture in general, and to the YouTube sphere in particular. Nevertheless, little is known about the individuals that create parodies. Focusing on music video parodies, this paper is based on interviews with 22 YouTube parodists who discussed their motivation to engage in parody, practices of identity and audience management and definitions of masterful parody. Entering the realm of parody production was typically determined by strategic or by passionate motivations. These were associated with different perceptions of self and audience, namely, the quantified self, the community builder and the Auteur. Despite differences in motivation and identity, parodists tended to agree on two desirable features for parodies: form fidelity and positivity, thus indicating a distance from modernist literary definitions of the genre. The various aspects related to the practice of parody are discussed in light of the possibilities and limitations of “participatory culture”.",Media Work in the Digital Age,Popular Communication

2016-1308,2016,Paper Session,Two-Way Communication Between Scientists and the Public: A View From Science Communication Trainers,6,"Communication between scientists and the public has become more and more common. The traditional model of science communication, which is anchored in one-way knowledge transfer from experts to non-experts, has been vociferously derided by an amalgam of conceptual and theoretical work. These efforts have, simply put, attempted to re- orient the nature of science communication toward two-way engagement that seeks to build mutual understandings between science communicators and their publics. The current study applies the concept of two-way symmetrical communication and interviewed science communication trainers who they have regular interactions with scientists. The results showed that Trainers perceived that scientists generally communicated about their work in order to “educate” or “share their knowledge” with the audiences, which is more likely to be interpreted as one-way communication. Also, many trainers appear to emphasize more on the education skills training, other than the importance of two-way communications.",Understanding the Power of Stakeholders,Public Relations
2016-1309,2016,Paper Session,The Determinants of the Amount of Donation: Membership Association Case,2,"Abstract
Nonprofit organizations depend heavily on charitable giving. Using survey data of 5004 nonprofit organization members, this study examines the factors influencing the donation amounts given to those organizations. The results of a step-wise regression analysis suggest that length of membership and members’ level of satisfaction with their organizations are predictors of their decisions about how much to donate. Furthermore, the donation amount is also influenced by individuals’ intrinsic motivation. However, extrinsic motivation does not predict members’ extent of generosity. This study offers empirical evidence of the positive effects of nonprofit organizations building mutual relationships with their members in terms of donation amounts. In addition, this research contributes to further understanding about the factors that drive the amount of donations.",Understanding the Power of Stakeholders,Public Relations

Mediating Roles of Perceived Interactivity and Transparency in Increasing Word-of-Mouth,2,"The sensitive nature of CSR communication necessitates its strategic planning and implementation. This study examined how corporations can increase publics’ perceptions of interactivity and transparency to better maintain a good reputation through its CSR communication using social media. Data from a 2 (type of CSR program) × 2 (tone of user comments) × 2 (corporate replies) experiment indicate that the type of CSR program did not affect publics’ evaluations of CSR communication. However, the positive tone of user comments and the presence of corporate replies significantly increased publics’ perceptions of interactivity and transparency. Perceived interactivity appeared to mediate the effects of tone and replies on perceived transparency and WOM intentions. This study provides meaningful insights for theory and practical guidelines for corporations’ decision-making process regarding CSR communication using social media.",Understanding the Power of Stakeholders,Public Relations

However, there has been relatively little systematic assessment of the shareholder activists and their public relations strategies and tactics. This research project focuses on the emerging influence of coalition networks among shareholder activists on specific issue-areas. Through a network study, this paper analyzes coalitions led by shareholder activist groups formed around corporate environmental responsibility issues. Our findings showed that the structure of shareholder activist networks is shaped by four features: organizational type, organizations’ human resources, media visibility, and history. Second, activist organizations with high centralities are more effective in achieving their advocacy goals.",Understanding the Power of Stakeholders,Public Relations
2016-1313,2016,Paper Session,G.I.F.T.S.

After lecture or discussion about genre and formula and their role in the efficient production of Hollywood products, and a brief tutorial on the “three-act” structure of films, each group is assigned a genre, then crafts the title, setting, key characters, and major plot points of a movie.

Students tend to find that they are very capable of quickly conceiving a realistic sounding movie. This helps them recognize how well they already know Hollywood formulas, and understand how predictably structured many such movies are, and why. Students also gain an appreciation for the defining characteristics of different genres (e.g. how rom-coms work), and for the fact that, even when they have just quickly come up with a movie script, they sometimes very much want to see the movie anyway.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Snapchat is a vanishing video messaging application that allows users to take photos or short videos. The structure of Snapchat creates some logistical complications for classroom use. Because content disappears once the message is read, it makes grading difficult. Despite challenges, the results of the campaign were overwhelmingly positive. The vanishing nature of “Snaps” made students more comfortable engaging and asking questions. One of the most innovative uses of Snapchat was use of the geotag feature available on the application.

Protection Motivation Theory says there are four factors to self-protection: 1) perceived severity of the situation, 2) the perceived vulnerability of the threat, 3) perceived efficacy to adapt to the threat, and 4) perceived self-efficacy (Rogers, 1975). PMT has been used to set the framework for different health protection behaviors ranging from food recalls (Clare & Huddleston, 2014), sun protection behaviors (Ch’ng & Glendon, 2014), health efficacy (Lwin, Stanaland, & Chan, 2010), and risk perception in beach swimming safety (McCool, Ameratunga, Moran, & Robinson, 2009).

Most experimental studies and survey studies did however not take media-party-parallelism into account, which is selective exposure of partisans to like-minded media, also labeled as the Friendly Media Phenomenon. Even reports in partisan media of one’s choice may however been perceived as hostile, especially when a wedge issue is at stake that is orthogonal to the factors that shape media choice and media-party parallelism. The study is based on content analysis data about media content and on survey data on media choice, media perceptions, and party choice in the 2014 European Elections in the Netherlands.

2016-1330,2016,Paper Session,"Negativity Biases in Reactions to Network News: A Cross-National, Psychophysiological Pilot Study",3,"There is mounting evidence that people react more powerfully to positive than negative information. Bad news is viewed as more salient, or vivid, or memorable than good news. This negativity bias is evident across a variety of topics, and across disciplines in both the social and physical sciences. That said, most work focuses on the US, and relies on photo-based stimuli that are rather disconnected from our political world. These limitations have real consequences for our understanding of the sources of negativity (i.e., cultural versus evolutionary accounts), which are of real significance, particularly for those interested not just in the nature of political communications and behavior, but also in the possibility that institutional design might be able to enhance, or mitigate, weaknesses in decision-making and information processing. This paper reports preliminary results from what will be an 18-country study, examining psychophysiological and survey-based reactions to televised news content.

As for research method, a paper-based survey was conducted to collect data, and the final sample size was 1,000. The university student sample was created from a stratified sampling procedure with proportionate allocation among the nine universities in Dalian in Northeast China. Factor analyses showed different aspects of Internet literacy and various symptoms of Internet addiction. This study found that Internet addiction had some negative influence on the university students’ quality of life. Moreover, the findings showed that Internet literacy has a significant influence on Internet addiction and quality of life among these young people. Basically, those university students with higher level of Internet literacy showed lower degree of Internet addiction and higher degree of quality of life.",Advances and Challenges in Media Literacy Scholarship,Children Adolescents and the Media
2016-1335,2016,Paper Session,Social Media Communication Preferences Among Stakeholders of Business-to-Business Companies,2,"To date, almost no research has investigated stakeholder preferences in the social media communication of business-to-business companies. Previous studies have focused mainly on the general importance of social media within business-to-business by investigating the perspective of corporate representative. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the preferences and needs of stakeholders. An online survey among the clients of these Swiss companies was performed to investigate the social media communication preferences among the stakeholders of these companies. This study later reveals that despite the popularity of social media communication within the business-to-consumer landscape, business-to-business stakeholders are of a more conservative nature. Within the investigated population, there was no hard evidence of different preferences for marketing-related communication compared to public-relations-related communication.",The Power of Discussion Among Public Relations Scholars,Public Relations
2016-1337,2016,Paper Session,Clients in Interaction: An Alternative Perspective on Public Relations Consulting,1,"The paper offers an alternative perspective on public relations consulting by focusing on the client's role. By turning to the neighboring field of management consulting, a theoretical framework to describe client-consultant-interaction is built. It includes elements of the theory of social systems, agency theory and symbolic interactionism. Findings from role research complement the theoretical approaches. Finally, three ideal types of public relations consulting are constructed. In order to test the theoretical framework, 179 public relations clients from Germany’s 500 biggest private corporations were questioned using an online survey design. Clients were asked to rate their approval to the three ideal types. Furthermore, they were questioned on possible influencing factors, such as their opinions on and experiences with success and conflict, reasons to work with consultants and their perception of distribution of power in the interaction with the consultants. A cluster analysis finally suggests four client roles in public relations consulting.",The Power of Discussion Among Public Relations Scholars,Public Relations
2016-1338,2016,Paper Session,Hybrid Strategy: Integration or Interference? How Corporate Communication Impacts Consumers’ Memory and Company Evaluation,2,"This study aims to investigate the conditions under which hybrid corporate communication strategy would be an appropriate choice for companies to employ, as compared to corporate social responsibility/CSR strategy regarding the impact on consumers’ memory and company evaluation. It uses a two (prior corporate associations: prior corporate ability/CA associations vs. no prior associations) by two (corporate communication strategy: CSR strategy vs. hybrid strategy) between-subjects experiment. Based on the cognitive psychological theoretical foundation of memory and interference, it will show prior CA associations will create proactive interference for consumers to recall subsequently presented CSR information, but hybrid strategy can mitigate the interference by integrating CA and CSR information, leading to more positive company evaluation. When prior CA associations are not formed, the hybrid strategy will result in interference caused by the co-occurrence of CSR and CA components, leading to less positive company evaluation.",The Power of Discussion Among Public Relations Scholars,Public Relations
2016-1339,2016,Paper Session,Communicating Tobacco-Free Policies in the Tobacco Belt: The Influence of Culture on Public Relations,2,"Policy implementation and follow-through are frequent public relations points of concern for organizations in all industries—particularly when public health and health risks are on the line. For healthcare organizations, the implementation of tobacco-free policies has become standard practice in the United States. However, some heath organizations—particularly those located in the tobacco-belt—continue to receive pushback from employees and the public. Thus, public relations efforts can help bridge the gap between a presented policy and its acceptance by employees, patients, and visitors. Through the lens of the cultural theory of risk, this case study examines the public relations challenges to the implementation of a campus-wide tobacco-free policy on the University of Kentucky’s medical campus. Specifically, this case study explores the unique ways in which public relations efforts are challenged by cultural and societal norms influencing the publics’ risk perception.",The Power of Discussion Among Public Relations Scholars,Public Relations
2016-1340,2016,Paper Session,The Impact of Trust on Online News Consumption and Participation,2,"Trust in news is an important factor that influences an individual’s access to, consumption of, and interaction with news. The increased volume of information that is available online has led online news consumers to change their relationship with the news. Using Reuters Institute Digital News Report data from 11 countries (N=21,486), this study aimed to explore how the levels of trust in news affect consumers’ news participation behaviour, including sharing and commenting, and the differences between those who prefer mainstream and non-mainstream new sources. The results show that those with low levels of trust tend to seek non-mainstream news and participate more after consuming news. Socio-demographic variables other than age did not have a consistent impact. Seeking alternative sources of news and trying to validate the credibility of news were identified as motivations for new approaches to news consumption and participation.",Credibility and Trust in News,Journalism Studies
2016-1341,2016,Paper Session,"Effects of Editorial Media Bias Perception and Media Trust on the Use of Traditional, Citizen, and Social Media News",2,"Citizens’ levels of mistrust towards the media have consistently increased in past years. Similarly, people also seem to perceive that the media is biased. However, as these negative observations on journalism have developed, citizens have also enjoyed novel avenues and opportunities to actively engage in news consumption and production. Given this rather complex media context, this study seeks to explore how people’s trust in the media and perceived media bias may influence their news consumption habits. It does so by specifically looking at traditional, citizen, and social media news use. Drawing on two-wave U.S. panel data, results suggest that media trust and perceived bias relate to media consumption differently. Trust in social and citizen media positively predicts use of news via social media, but has no effect on traditional or citizen news use. Additionally, perceived media bias is associated with decreased news use overall.",Credibility and Trust in News,Journalism Studies
2016-1342,2016,Paper Session,The Depiction of Problems of Trust in the News: An Explorative Study to Disclose Trust Frames,1,"Although trust problems contribute to the functioning of society and are often created through the news, no empirical analysis of the media’s depiction of trust problems has yet been undertaken. This study therefore breaks new ground by analyzing how problems of trust are selected and highlighted in order to frame social problems in the German weekly publications Der Spiegel and Die Zeit in 2013. To this end, a concept of trust-frames is developed deductively by conjoining insights from trust literature and framing literature. The quantitative content analysis (n = 144) demonstrates that trust-frames are fairly common in news coverage. While general tendencies within the trust-frames’ structure are discernable, these tendencies differ depending on the topical context and the framed social problem. A discussion of the results is followed by remarks on the trust-frames’ potential impact on the recipients and an outline of future avenues for journalism studies research on trust-frames.",Credibility and Trust in News,Journalism Studies

Verification of claims has historically been linked to increased credibility ratings. This experiment (N=186) attempted to demonstrate that variations in a message via additional information generated by a prototype fact-checking tool (Truth Goggles) that told the reader whether a claim was true when the highlighted portion was clicked or in the form of “facts” in a list at the bottom of the article would increase ratings of credibility and quality.

2016-1344,2016,Paper Session,When Politicians Go Native: Consequences of Political Native Advertising for Citizens’ Trust in Political News,2,"Declining revenues from offline and online ads has led publishers to pursue new avenues, such as native advertising: camouflaging ads as news. Critics of native advertising claim that this blurs the boundaries between editorial and commercial content, and can reduce the audiences’ trust in editorial content. However, little research has assessed the possible effects of native ads regarding the audiences' trust in news. Within an experimental setting (N=733), this study empirically explores the consequences of political native advertising for citizen’s trust in political news. The present paper discusses how political native advertising poses a challenge to the boundary between journalism and advertising as well as the boundary between journalism and politics. We employ a survey experiment to examine the effects of political native advertising on audience trust. Our study examines 1) how prominently native advertisements should be labelled in order for readers to recognize that it is an ad, and 2) whether exposure to it reduces readers trust in political news. Our most important finding shows that, when explicitly labelled, native advertising by political parties reduces people’s trust in political news.",Credibility and Trust in News,Journalism Studies

Using the culture-centered approach, this paper engages with issues of food insecurity, health, and poverty among the low-income community in Singapore. Through 30 in-depth interviews, the narratives of the food insecure are privileged in articulating their lived experiences of food insecurity and in co-constructing meanings of health informed by their sociocultural context, in a space that typically renders them invisible. Arguing that poverty is communicatively sustained through the erasure of subaltern voices from mainstream discourses and policy platforms, we ask the research question – What are the meanings of food insecurity in the everyday experiences of health among the poor in Singapore? Our findings demonstrated that the meanings of health among the food insecure are constituted in culture and materiality, structurally constrained, and ultimately complexifies their negotiations of health and health decision-making.","Communication and Health Disparities in Migrant, Low-Income, and Digital Communities",Health Communication
2016-1346,2016,Paper Session,"Health, Communication, and the Digital: Untangling Digital Communication in Contemporary Health-Related Practices",1,"The role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in health-related practices has long been primarily studied – in the contexts of telemedicine, eHealth, and mHealth – as functional to ease the delivery of health services. This paper shifts this focus by looking at digital communication as possibly enhancing patients’ agency at different levels of action. It suggests theoretical frameworks and research questions for future investigation into the role of digital communication in three types of bottom-up health-related individual and social action: self-care, health discourse and health activism. Finally, this work advances that the study of digital communication in health democratisation processes should be carried out by applying a critical perspective that specifically addresses issues of power, technology and online ethics.","Communication and Health Disparities in Migrant, Low-Income, and Digital Communities",Health Communication
2016-1347,2016,Paper Session,Listening and Health: Voice of Bangladeshi Expatriate Workers From the Middle East,2,"Increasingly, health scholars have started paying attention to the health experiences of immigrant communities, particularly in the backdrop of the increasing global flows of goods, services, and people across borders. In spite of the increasing public health emphasis on health outcomes of immigrants within the Middle Eastern countries, immigrant communities are often constructed as monoliths and the voices of immigrant communities are traditionally absent from mainstream health policy and program discourses. The health experiences of immigrants, their access to resources, and the health trajectories through the life-course followed by them and their descendants influence the deep-seated patterns of ethnic health disparities documented in the Middle East (ME). Based on the culture-centered approach, we seek to understand how low income Bangladeshi expatriate workers in a ME country, who live at the borders of mainstream Arab society, define, construct, and negotiate health issues through co-constructions of their localized experiences of health.","Communication and Health Disparities in Migrant, Low-Income, and Digital Communities",Health Communication
2016-1348,2016,Paper Session,The Support Relationship Between Caregivers of Dementia Patients and Live-In Foreign Domestic Helpers in Singapore,2,"Caregiving for persons with dementia often falls on family members. According to the World Health Organization dementia patients are expected to grow worldwide. Long term caregiving is associated with caregiver burden, which is used to describe the stress and frustration of caring for individuals with dementia (Etters, Goodall, Harrison, 2008). Coping with caregiver burden is dependent on the coping resources available to the caregiver. In the context of Singapore, many caregivers often employ (foreign) domestic help to provide care for dementia patient and this availability of informal domestic support is unique to Singapore (Yeoh and Huang, 2009). The explored how caregivers of dementia patient cope with caregiving burden by means of hired support and how this employer-employee relationship affects the support-seeking experience. The findings reveal the impact of hired help can be found in physical support and emotional relief as well as the need to establish mutual support between the employer-employee during this caregiving process for coping. This major implication from this study is the necessity to formalize this informal support system to one that protects and supports the caregiver as well as the hired help.","Communication and Health Disparities in Migrant, Low-Income, and Digital Communities",Health Communication

By examining the narratives collected from immigrant populations living in Japan, the current study aims to deepen our understanding of these individuals’ sensemaking process for treatment avoidance despite experiencing illness, disease, and injury. The transcriptions of 13 in-depth interviews (486.2 minutes; M = 37.4 minutes; SD = 12.0) were analyzed with constant comparative analysis. The researcher identified that individuals avoid seeking medical treatment by (a) predicting troubles, (b) predicting prejudice, and (c) predicting discomfort. These concepts are also categorized based on certainty and uncertainty about the consequences that participants predict.

However, in autoscopic phenomena patients may experience their sense of self within an illusory body in extracorporeal space or even within the illusory and the real body simultaneously. While previous studies have shown that healthy individuals can feel located in an illusory body, it is unclear if healthy human minds can bi-locate in two bodies. For that, we developed a setup with a humanoid robot and mirrors to artificially create a reduplication of the own body. We observed that when individuals view their real body through the embodied robot, they experience an illusion that strongly resembles heautoscopy, a type of autoscopic phenomena. The findings demonstrate that a healthy human mind is able to mentally bi-locate in two different bodies at the same time and contribute to a better understanding of the nature of the self.",Experimental Studies of Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology
2016-1351,2016,Paper Session,"Look Into My Blinking Red Eye! The Effects of Humanlike and Robot-Specific Nonverbal Behavior on Perception, Emotion, and Behavior",2,"Research demonstrated that humans are able to interpret humanlike nonverbal behavior (HNB) in artificial entities (e.g. Bente, Krämer, Petersen, & de Ruiter, 2001; Mutlu, Shiwa, Kanda, Ishiguro, & Hagita, 2009; Beck, Canamero, & Bard, 2010). However, some robots lack the possibility to produce HNB. Using robot-specific nonverbal behavior (RNB) such as different eye-colors to transport emotional meaning might be a fruitful mechanism to enhance HRI experiences, but it is unclear whether RNB is as effective as HNB. We experimentally tested the influence of HNB and RNB on users’ perception of the robot (e.g. Likability, Animacy), their emotional experience, and self-disclosure. Users (n=80) interacted with either a) a robot displaying no nonverbal behavior, b) a robot displaying RNB, c) a robot displaying HNB or d) a robot displaying HNB and RNB. Results show that HNB, but not RNB, has a significant effect on the perceived animacy of the robot, and participants’ emotional state and self-disclosure. However, RNB still slightly influenced participants’ perception, emotion and behavior, because planned contrasts revealed having any type of nonverbal behavior significantly increased perceived animacy, positive affect, and self-disclosure. Moreover, observed linear trends indicate that the effects increased with the addition of nonverbal behaviors (control< RNB< HNB< HNB+RNB). In combination, our results suggest that HNB is more effective in transporting the robot’s communicative message than RNB, however, RNB can add to the effectiveness of HNB.",Experimental Studies of Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology
2016-1352,2016,Paper Session,Touching a Mechanical Body: Tactile Contact With Intimate Parts of a Human-Shaped Robot is Physiologically Arousing,3,"A large literature describes the use of robots’ physical bodies to support communication with people. Touch is a natural channel for physical interaction, yet it is not understood how principles of interpersonal touch might carry over to human-robot interaction. Ten students participated in an interactive anatomy lesson with a small, humanoid robot. Participants either touched or pointed to an anatomical region of the robot in each of 26 trials while their skin conductance response was measured. Touching less accessible regions of the robot (e.g., buttocks and genitals) was more physiologically arousing than touching more accessible regions (e.g., hands and feet). No differences in physiological arousal were found when just pointing to those same anatomical regions. Social robots can elicit tactile responses in human physiology, a result that signals the power of robots, and should caution mechanical and interaction designers about positive and negative effects of human-robot interactions.",Experimental Studies of Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology

In a between subjects experimental setting, 79 participants interacted with a virtual agent who either displayed nonverbal rapport behavior or not. Results demonstrate that although there was no main effect of rapport behavior on participants´ subjective experience of rapport and on connectedness with the agent, those people with a high need to belong experienced less desire for further contact after the interaction with a virtual agent – but only if the agent displayed rapport behavior.",Experimental Studies of Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology

A survey with 158 college students found that both self-centered (e.g., existing attitudes toward playing exergames, self-efficacy) and environment-driven factors (e.g., perceived benefits, perceived norms) differed depending on students’ existing behavioral routines for exercise and exergame experiences. Our findings imply that exergames currently available in the market neither saturate regular exercisers’ high expectation toward workout experiences nor immediately appeal to potential users due to the lack of extremely playful elements compared to other video games.

However, little research has focused on the support of physical training. Furthermore, few studies payed attention to the characteristics of the media in the applications. The present study addresses this gap and investigates the use of hypervideo for the support of physical exercise. In order to gain insights into the long-term utilization, usability and resulting competence we conducted a one year trial in a clinic. The control group used a preexisting flyer for the training. The study shows that the hypervideo was used more intensively than the flyer. The users experienced less cognitive load and gained more knowledge about the exercises. The logged data reveal that patients used the consecutive structure and the interactive functions of the hypervideo to adapt the training to their individual needs.",Gaming and Health Communication,Health Communication
2016-1356,2016,Paper Session,Cancer Survivors Who Play Recreational Computer Games: Motivations for Playing and Associations With Beneficial Psychological Outcomes,4,"Recreational video games are a multibillion-dollar industry, and playing them is an increasingly common activity in everyday life. People who have experienced illness may well turn to games for temporary distraction, stimulation, and other benefits. Yet little is known about the potential role these games may play in people’s lives and the extent to which motivations for playing them may also support well-being. To explore this issue, we conducted a survey of cancer survivors who play recreational games (N=794) and assessed motivations for playing and markers of psychological health and well-being. Motivations to play for intrinsic rewards (such as stimulation and a sense of accomplishment), for development of intellectual abilities and other aspects of self, and for the experience of being in a community were related to positive psychological outcomes. Findings offer insights into the potential benefits of recreational games and also implications for development of ""serious"" games for health.",Gaming and Health Communication,Health Communication

Unfortunately, children’s motivation to play AVGs decreases quickly, underscoring the need to identify novel methods of maintaining player engagement. The immersive properties of narratives may be an important mechanism for motivating continued game play, but their role in AVG play has not been explored. A feasibility study was conducted to explore the motivational effect of adding a narrative cutscene to an originally non-narrative AVG. Children in the narrative group had significantly more steps during play in terms of average number of steps per 10s period and in total across the entire play period when compared with the non-narrative group. These results provide preliminary evidence of increased engagement with AVGs with narratives.",Gaming and Health Communication,Health Communication

To understand what drives recurrent Facebook use, this study utilizes the gratification discrepancy approach, which suggests that the gap between gratifications sought from Facebook use and gratifications obtained may be one mechanism underlying frequent returns to Facebook. In addition to capturing in-situ data about gratifications at the beginning and at the end of Facebook sessions, the custom-built software developed for the study captured data about the length, number, and intervals between sessions over a weeklong period. The findings indicate a quadratic relationship between gratification discrepancy and time lag between Facebook sessions suggesting that feeling both under-gratified and over-gratified drive frequent returns to Facebook. Facebook session duration was positively associated with gratification satisfaction.

We also examine how college students’ origin (whether they are from the same state as the college or from out of state) moderates the indirect effect of social media network heterogeneity on satisfaction with campus life via social self-efficacy. The results show that social media network heterogeneity significantly influences individuals’ social self-efficacy, leading to increased levels of satisfaction with campus life. Most importantly, social self-efficacy mediates the relationship between social media network heterogeneity and satisfaction, and this indirect effect is stronger for those who are going to college in their home state compared to students from other states and outside the US.",Social Media Gratifications,Communication and Technology

We follow up on this research and analyse positive and negative outcomes of Internet use in the United Kingdom, applying structural equation modelling to data from a large Internet survey. We find that highly educated users and those with higher income benefit most from using the web. No significant age and gender effects on benefits are detected. Next to demographic characteristics, self-efficacy is a key predictor of online benefits. The harms from using the Internet are structured differently, with educated users and those with higher levels of self-efficacy being more susceptible to harm. This runs counter to intuitions from digital divide research, where those at the margins should be most at risk. The consideration of harms suggests that positive and negative outcomes might be associated rather than mutually exclusive.",Social Media Gratifications,Communication and Technology

Korean media emphasizes the importance of postnatal care: not only the importance of nutrition, but also the importance of professional postpartum care. On the other hand, postnatal care in the U.S. requires finding a family doctor, and a pediatrician for the baby. American mothers cannot find formal organized program for postpartum support anywhere. This study looks at how media in the U.S. and South Korea frame the postnatal care subject differently. The study compare the number of postnatal care related news articles in both countries which shows a huge gap.

Frame analyses of video-recorded, semi-structured interviews (N=25) reveal paradigms of knowledge as vision and knowledge as flow privilege epistemologies of seeing and connecting to situate women as co-producers of knowledge discourses. Women articulate agency and control by moving between strategies of grasping/enacting and anchoring/bridging to negotiate conflict during changes in literacy, or during loss and geographical transition. Constituting knowledge as vision accomplishes grasping and enactment through innate processes that are proximal, protective, and collective in form, while constituting knowledge as flow accomplishes anchoring/bridging processes that connect across genealogical lineage, social relationships, and social practices. The analysis offers theoretical and pragmatic insights contesting the hegemonic nature of knowledge production in maternal health discourses.",Negotiations and Portrayals of Motherhood in Media Discourses Around the World,Feminist Scholarship

By using critical discourse analysis, the major recurring features identified by the analysis can be regarded as indications of advertising's ability to mobilize the patriarchal ideology of motherhood while using different thematic motifs. This happens in the case of anti-essentialist messages regarding motherhood as well as in the case of an essentialist stance.

The Israeli campaign was part of the global “Campaign for Real Beauty” launched by Unilever in 2004. The Israeli campaign was run primarily on two Internet platforms that appeal to women, and was based mainly on the talk of ""ordinary"" mothers and daughters on online videos and blogs.
The current paper continues an interesting and thought-provoking feminist debate regarding the Dove campaign and the complex connections it produces between social activism, feminist agency and consumerism. Based on feminist critical discourse analysis of the campaign on the two online platforms, this article thus examines the way in which the campaign reflects and constructs the role of mother-daughter relations in structuring girls’ body image while critically exploring its feminist messages.",Negotiations and Portrayals of Motherhood in Media Discourses Around the World,Feminist Scholarship

We examine this phenomenon by providing two empirical examples. The first example examines mainstream news reports about buying sprees of potassium iodide in March 2011. We suggest that this example illustrates how the mainstream media seeks to rationalize and contain emotional public reactions during a disruptive media event. In the second example we explore how Japanese Twitter users turned official press conferences into a carnivalesque display of emotion through a hashtag #edano_nero (“Go to sleep, Edano!”) in March 2011. We suggest that this particular case illustrates how a disaster marathon mode of broadcasting can take on ceremonial features and produce a shared experience.",Changes in Broadcasting and News Systems,Global Communication and Social Change

The Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), the largest television network in Korean society, has been instrumental in the development of national culture during past decades. Through analysis of historical documents and in-depth interviews with members of the network, this paper examines the ways in which the public network has implemented the globalization plan of the government in the music industry.

2016-1370,2016,Paper Session,"The Social, Political, and Economic Contexts Shaping the FM Dial in Amman, Jordan",1,"Taking up the lens of political economy to view the FM dial in Amman, I will analyze how historical, political, economic, and cultural forces shape radio broadcasting practices in Jordan and investigate how these contexts shape the reception and engagement experiences of radio audiences, particularly community radio audiences. In this paper, I begin by reviewing the various contexts that impact media practices on the FM dial in Amman and the state’s regulation of media in Jordan. My analysis of these developments is enriched by data collected in interviews with random radio listeners and FM broadcasters. This approach allows me to distinguish community radio practices at Radio al-Balad from the practices of private and state broadcasters. This paper reveals how local contexts shape broadcasting policies and practices on the FM dial in Amman that create a radio environment that amplifies state power, cultivates national identity, and maintains the status quo.",Changes in Broadcasting and News Systems,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-1371,2016,Paper Session,Why Audiences Stay Loyal to National Broadcast Television,4,"This paper explores the evolution of the theory and cultural trend referred to as cultural proximity, which predicts that audiences will prefer national or, next, regional programming. It is examined in terms of television preferences for national and regional programming in Latin America, 2004-2014, based on a series of annual surveys conducted in eight Latin American countries by Kantar Media, the Miami-based parent company of IBOPE and other national ratings services in Latin America. The first, major prediction of cultural proximity, that audiences will tend to prefer local or national programming is confirmed, from the strong, fairly stable preference that the overall regional audience shows for national programming, 2004-2014. However, counter to the second major prediction of cultural proximity, that Latin American audiences would favor regional programming next, we found instead that U.S. programming was their second choice, ahead of regional. Implications of these results for the overall theory are considered.",Changes in Broadcasting and News Systems,Global Communication and Social Change

Users can engage in regulation by flagging such posts. The paper investigates influences on flagging behavior by integrating research on bystander behavior. It presents two experimental studies that examine the effects of availability of intervention information, of characteristics of response comments by other users and of the type of victim attacked in a comment on flagging likelihood of an uncivil comment and on future intervention intention. Results indicate that intervention information motivates flagging in most conditions. Users do not to rest their decision to intervene on responses of others.

2016-1373,2016,Paper Session,Communicating Policy to the Public: Influence of Online News Coverage and User-Generated Comments,1,"This study explores how user-generated commentary together with editorial decisions like news framing influenced online news readers’ perception of a controversial health policy. The overall opinion climate on the comment board to news articles is an important determinant of news readers’ approval of the policy under debate. In this study supportive comments were found to elicit higher level of policy support than dissenting comments, but the supportive comment condition did not outperform the no-comment control group. Comment framing and news framing are not equally powerful in shaping readers’ thought diversity. Comments can stimulate people to think more when news is narrow and can confine people to think less when news is thorough. Conservatives tend to post comments if the opinion climate is overly positive, but liberals did not show interest in posting when the opinion climate is overly negative.",The Study of Online Opinion Expression,Mass Communication

Comparing the findings from scenarios to those obtained from real, analogous situations revealed that the use of scenarios could not accurately identify some existing phenomena. Scenario and website experiments returned incongruent predictions regarding the roles of age, fear of isolation, and the votes climate as well as the contribution degree of issue knowledge (to posting intention). In particular, trait fear of isolation, which has been pointed out as the primary culprit behind silencing minority opinion holders, played a completely opposite role.

However, the uncivil comment behaviors carried out in the sites draw a question mark on the optimistic claim. In this regard, this study applies the spiral of silence theory (SOS) to examine the mechanism that operates in the willingness of outspokenness in the context of news comment websites. In particular, the study juxtaposes the two dimensions of online comment features by employing a 2 (civil versus uncivil) by 2 (congruence versus incongruence) between-subjects experimental design to test the essential components of the SOS theory on the issue of childhood vaccines. It reveals that those who found themselves in the majority were less likely to post a comment online when they were exposed to uncivil comments. This finding implies a new line of research to study whether and how the Internet attenuates the SOS effect through the lens of online incivility.",The Study of Online Opinion Expression,Mass Communication

For political candidates, these media may be used strategically to enact unique forms of public intimacy that are influenced by the norms of relational labor and self-disclosure that govern social media. These arguments are illustrated through a case study of Hillary Clinton’s Twitter account, which shows that she is able to use the political feminine style to great effect by softening her image through digital intimacy and interactivity while still preserving elements of her traditional forensic style. In this way, Clinton enacts a second-wave feminist persona that is substantively political without being seen as extreme or strident.

We use the lens of Symbolic Convergence Theory (SCT) to explore the fantasy themes incumbent in images shared through Michelle Obama’s Twitter account. Since first ladies have long been perceived as representing the American ‘everywoman’ (Finneman & Thomas, 2014), understanding the fantasies built into the social media image of the current first lady extends knowledge about the perception of American women more broadly. Our findings indicate that Michelle Obama’s Twitter images are strategic in that they reflect the visual themes that the media traditionally use in their coverage of first ladies. Specifically, Michelle Obama’s social media messaging portrays her as an activist mother and a non-partisan figure with deep familial ties who espouses non-controversial causes such as education and children’s health.",Politicians on Social Media,Political Communication

We employed a 1x3 experimental design, using a sample of 126 high school students (15 to 20 years). Participants either saw a Facebook profile with no posts (control condition), non-participatory posts, or participatory posts. While non-participatory posts did not affect participants’ political efficacy, participatory posts exerted distinct effects. For those high in trait evaluations or low in cynicism, we found significant positive effects on external and collective efficacy. By contrast, for those low in trait evaluations or high in cynicism, we found significant negative effects on external and collective efficacy. We did not find any effects on the more robust attitude of internal efficacy.

2016-1379,2016,Paper Session,Thanks for (Actually) Responding! How Citizen Demand Shapes Politicians’ Interactive Practices on Twitter,1,"Social media are frequently touted for their potential to strengthen democratic processes by bringing politicians and citizens into direct dialog with one another. But is this potential being realized? Previous research has concentrated on the politicians’ side of communication processes. This study, in contrast, highlights the impact of citizen demand for politicians’ attention, arguing that politicians’ choice about when and how to engage citizens interactively is conditioned by both the volume and character of requests they receive for such engagement. Using an original dataset comprising the Twitter activity of randomly sampled members of the lower legislative houses in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States, as well as all tweets directed at these legislators during the latter half of October 2013, this study demonstrates that citizen demand plays a crucial role in determining the presence, as well as the extent, of politicians’ reciprocal engagement with members of the public.",Politicians on Social Media,Political Communication
2016-1380,2016,Paper Session,The Social Media Logic of Political Interaction: Exploring Citizens’ and Politicians’ Relationship on Facebook and Twitter,3,"This article examines citizens’ interactions with politicians in social media in what is referred to as an everyday context. Through a representative survey, we compare the influence of a series of socio-demographical variables such as political interest, age, gender and education on the interaction levels between citizens and politicians. The article argues that the social media logic of connectivity can be operationalized into “connected affordances” – Redistribution, Interacting and Acknowledging – which are the three types of user practices on Facebook and Twitter. The study finds that Facebook is a service where “ordinary” people engage in political interaction with political actors – and receiving replies from politicians - while Twitter is mostly used by a small group of the population for these purposes. Hence, the popularity of Facebook could be seen as allowing for new connections between citizens and political actors without mass media as a mediator. Our results suggest that the stronger political interest the citizens express, the more use of connective affordances – such as commenting and sharing – is undertaken. Political interest also impacts what response citizens receive from political actors in social media.",Politicians on Social Media,Political Communication
2016-1381,2016,Paper Session,Direct and Mediated Intercultural Contact: A Study of Attitudes Towards North Korea,2,"North Korea has seen a slow yet steady opening up in recent years: domestic media have been made available online, incoming tourism is increasing and trade is on the rise. Against the backdrop of increased direct and mediated opportunities for intercultural contact, this paper presents results from two studies: an online questionnaire measuring attitudes towards North Korea of individuals who have not been to the country (n = 159) and a quasi-experiment, in which tourists were surveyed before and after visiting North Korea (n = 40). Data shows that direct contact with North Koreans, even if limited, has a positive effect on individuals’ attitudes towards the country in general, its people and, also, towards the country as a tourist destination. We also present evidence that increased use of non-traditional sources of information has an effect on attitudes. Findings are discussed in the context of intercultural communication and tourism studies.","Culture, Politics, and Religion",Intercultural Communication

Xuanchuan, propaganda’s counterpart in China with a master metaphor of “seeder,” however, has different histories and traditions that do not fit into the ideology-charged theoretical framework. Drawing upon Chinese thought and scholarship on xuanchuan/propaganda and informed by a comparison to the Western history of propaganda studies, the author demonstrates a deep conceptual and perceptual gap between propaganda and xuanchuan. And that gap is cultural. Revelation of the gap is of paramount importance for studying China’s propaganda both theoretically and empirically.","Culture, Politics, and Religion",Intercultural Communication

Previous studies have highlighted the complex webs of relations between laïcité, culture, and religion and their respective normative powers. Drawing on Critical Intercultural Communication literature, this study examines (1) how the concepts of culture and religion are utilised in discourses of laïcité and (2) what power structures this may suggest. Recent articles (2011-2014) published in the leading French newspaper Le Monde concerning laïcité were analysed using Qualitative Content Analysis and a drawing on a Foucaultian approach to discourse. Results indicated dichotomous views of our cultural practices and their religious practices. Overall, culture tends to be understood as normal and taken-for-granted, which enhances its potential as a discursive resource to legitimise practices and sustain existing power relations. Implications regarding the concept of laïcité, minorities’ participation to the public sphere and their status in society are discussed.","Culture, Politics, and Religion",Intercultural Communication
2016-1384,2016,Paper Session,En-countering Governmentality: The 'Quality' of Neoliberalism in China,1,"The Chinese discourse of quality (suzhi) has been a core area of interest for the burgeoning field of China governmentality studies. This body of literature has helped to map the discourse of ‘quality’ as a key intersection between neoliberal changes in government policies, popular social dispositions and individual subjectivity. The resulting analytical insight offers little, other than informing modernization scholars on the failings of the Chinese state and society in mitigating the contradictions of neoliberal ideology -naturalizing China’s lower position in the structured coherence of global economic and moral orders. Responding to this problem I present Foucault’s notion of ‘counter-conduct’ as a theory to develop awareness of other coexisting practices and values in Chinese society which complicate the inevitability of neoliberal expansion and the actuality of its entrenchment.","Culture, Politics, and Religion",Intercultural Communication

Frequently referred to as parental differential treatment in research literature, favoritism can be associated with low self-esteem, emotional difficulties, and negative dispositions toward other family members. Past research has mostly ignored how favoritism is communicated and how families communicate about favoritism. The research presented here employs a grounded theoretical approach to develop a communicative theory of familial favoritism. Drawing from two research studies, we offer a participant-driven definition of familial favoritism; a typology of communication behaviors indicating favoritism; and motivations or personal qualities that encourage parents and children to engage favoritism behavior. These are combined into a theoretical model. Directions for future research are offered.",Interpersonal Communication in Families,Interpersonal Communication

This study uses Family Communication Patterns Theory to test the relationship between how families communicate, how parents discuss sex with their kids, and how those children discuss sex with their partner(s) in college. One hundred and ninety-nine college students completed surveys about their family’s communication and how they talk to their partner(s) about personal sexual history and condom use. The findings indicate a positive relationship between how frequently families facilitate open communication and how the participants from those families talk to their partners about condom use and sexual histories.

Dōjinshi Creation, Anime Fansubbing, and Copyright Laws in Japan and the United States",1,"Fans of manga (comics), anime (animations), and games, both within and beyond Japan, have engaged in a number of creative and communicative practices to sustain their interests and passion. This paper focuses on two practices which raise significant questions concerning the current intellectual property right regime: dōjinshi creation (the production of self-publication that often features characters from existing works) and anime fansubbing (the unlicensed translation and distribution of anime). It argues that the current copyright legislation in Japan and the United States have resulted in legal precarity for fans involved in these practices. It also challenges assumptions on fans and their works that legal scholars made in their attempt to construe fans’ practices as legally acceptable, as they fail to account for the complex realities of fandom. The paper suggests that existing legislation remains incompatible with fans’ practices, unless notions concerning characters, works, and narrative-worlds are considered and revised.","Copyright, Digital Cultures of Use, and Democracy",Communication Law & Policy

Thirty-four undergraduate female students participated in an EEG-based experiment using a 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA design. In the experiment, each of the subjects who were assigned to either the morphed face condition or the non-morphed condition was exposed to two types of image presentation of the counterpart (photo image vs. avatar image). The self-report data analyses indicated that the subjects felt significantly higher senses of being together with the counterparts whose faces were morphed with their own faces than those whose faces were not morphed.

Specifically, scholars tend to address discrete features of identification under the banner of the broader construct, rather than addressing the multiple mechanism catalyzing identification. To this end, this study integrated several such mechanisms to develop a more comprehensive, polythetic model of identification in which actual and desired similarity, homophily, psychological merging, ownership, perspective-taking, liking, and embodiment are all sufficient (but not independently necessary) second-order dimensions of player-avatar identification. This polythetic model of identification suggests the construct to be more complex than is currently engaged in scholarly literature, and a multidimensional approach to measuring and understanding identity is most appropriate for scholars wishing to more intricately understand the manner in which gamers relate to and through their on-screen avatars.

Departing from an extensive literature review on different notions and accounts, we suggest to organized the heterogeneity of PARs by a distance/closeness continuum. Five types of PARs were identified in respondents’ self-reports that were labelled functional PAR, empathy-based PAR, intense dyadic PAR, selective identification, and shift of identities. While MMOs were found to enable or stimulate the greatest diversity of PAR qualities, shooter games seem to prescribe high distance modes of PAR, the treating of an avatar as functional object in particular. In sum, the interview-based typology is able to classify PAR across different gamers and game genres while incorporating much previous conceptual and terminological work.

The present study seeks to demonstrate how exposure to alcohol-involving content on SNSs and offline drinking experience were associated with college students’ perceived drinking norms. A two-wave online survey using a national sample (N = 151) was conducted. Results demonstrate that while exposure to alcohol-involving content on SNSs was related to injunctive drinking norm, offline drinking experience was associated with descriptive drinking norm. In addition, attention to social comparison information functioned as a covariate in the assessment of both norms, and moderated the relationship between offline drinking experience and both drinking norms.

Restricted data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to assess a weighted path analytic model (N = 3,684). High parental control, low parental warmth, parent alcohol use, and expectancies regarding their children’s alcohol use were associated with higher incidence of adolescent underage drinking. In turn, control, parent alcohol use, and underage consumption were associated with binge drinking during young adulthood. Warmth, parent expectancies, parent alcohol use, binge drinking, and teen use were linked to respondents’ likelihood of being arrested 8-14 years later.

2016-1401,2016,Paper Session,"The Influence of Affective, Cognitive, and Overall Attitude on Adolescents’ Intention to Drink Alcohol",5,"Underage drinking has serious negative short-term and long-term consequences. Interventions aiming to reduce underage drinking often target cognitive attitude, but fail to influence behavior or behavioral intention. This failure may suggest that cognitive attitude is not, or only weakly, related to behavior. However, attitude also has an affective and overall component that may have stronger relations with behavior. This study examines these relations to find the most promising component of attitude to target. This study used a sample of 324 students (age 11-14) from the lowest level of the Dutch secondary education system. Analyses were conducted through path modeling. Results showed that affective attitude had a strong significant influence on intention, while cognitive and overall attitude had no effect. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of interventions aiming to reduce adolescents’ underage drinking could be increased by targeting affective attitude instead cognitive attitude, which is currently a common strategy.",Antidrinking/Antialcohol Health Communication,Health Communication

While social drinking could be seen an enjoyable activity across cultures, the Chinese cultural belief about alcohol use is different from that of its Western counterpart. Specifically, Chinese college students may consider social drinking as a venue for practicing an important social skill and preparing for life after college. Using Hofstede’s concept of indulgence-constraint cultural dimension as a guide, this project introduces and tests the concept of “drinking as preparation for adulthood.” A cross-sectional survey and a panel study were conducted with separate groups of college students in Southern China. An event history analysis confirms that “drinking as preparation for adulthood” is a significant predictor of college drinking behavior.

Political Implications of Public- vs. Private-Oriented Social Network Sites in China,2,"Political communication researchers, in particular, have shown that SNS use and online network characteristics can impinge on people’s political attitudes and behavior. Nevertheless, individual SNSs have varying site architecture and basic design features, which may influence usage and network characteristics. Specifically, this article conceptualizes the distinction between public-oriented and private-oriented SNSs. It contends that the two types of SNSs may have varying impact on political behavior through the kinds of online networks that it tends to sustain. Analysis of a survey of university students in Guangzhou, China (N = 897), shows that respondents using public-oriented SNSs tended to have a relatively more “public” online social network – larger in size, more heterogeneous, and with more connections to public actors. Some of these network characteristics in turn affected political discussion behavior. The analysis thus demonstrates how SNS architecture can indirectly impinge on individual-level political outcomes.",The Politics of Social Media in China,Communication and Technology
2016-1405,2016,Paper Session,Political Information Use on Mobile SNS and Political Discussion in China: The Role of WeChat Users’ Social Networks,2,"Applying an online survey, this study tests the relationships between political information use on WeChat (a Chinese mobile SNS), political discussion, political attitudes, and WeChat users’ social network structural features. The results show that WeChat users’ political information use on this platform affects their political discussion and political attitudes. Further, both positive and negative WeChat political discussions mediate the effect of political information use on political attitudes. Additionally, WeChat users with large size networks are more likely to engage in positive political discussion. WeChat users with diverse social networks are more likely to engage in positive and negative political discussion. The implications of this study are discussed.",The Politics of Social Media in China,Communication and Technology
2016-1406,2016,Paper Session,WeChat as a Semipublic Alternative Sphere: Exploring the Use of WeChat Among Chinese Older Adults,1,"In China, the emergence of WeChat—a comprehensive mobile application—not only provides a new social network platform for young people. It also has introduced millions of older adults to the digital world. This study aims to conceptualize the use of WeChat among Chinese older adults from the theoretical perspectives of the digital divide and alternative media. Four focus group discussions were conducted in Shanghai, China with a total of 35 adults aged 51 to 71 to explore their experiences and thoughts of using WeChat. Overall, the study suggests that WeChat has become many older adults’ first social networking site as well as their first alternative media platform. The study maintains that it is the mobile application, rather than the availability of smartphone or mobile Internet, that narrows the age-generated digital divide. Moreover, the research demonstrates how WeChat facilitates a unique way of civic participation in China’s political context.",The Politics of Social Media in China,Communication and Technology
2016-1407,2016,Paper Session,Business and Breakthrough: Framing (Expanded) Genetic Carrier Screening for the Public,3,"Recent studies examining expanded carrier screening (ECS) have noted the role of the mass media in driving public perceptions about such testing, giving particular attention to ways in which coverage of genetics and genetic testing broadly may drive public attitudes and choices concerning the morality, legality, ethics, and parental well-being involved in genetic technologies. Drawing on health-related framing studies that have shown in varying degrees the impact particular frames such as gain/loss and thematic/episodic can have on the public, this study examines the frame selection employed by online media in its coverage of ECS. This analysis—combined with an analysis of the sources and topics used in such coverage and how they relate to selected frames—helps to clarify how mass media are covering an increasingly important medical test and offers considerations of how such coverage may inform mass media scholarship as well as health-related practices.","Framing Health Risk: Environment, Cancer, Genetics",Health Communication
2016-1408,2016,Paper Session,Illness Uncertainty and Uncertainty Management in Carriers and Individuals With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,3,"Illness uncertainty and uncertainty management theories guided the investigation of strategic uncertainty management associated with efforts to feel in control and hopeful regarding a genetic diagnosis. Participants included 137 carriers and individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) recruited from the Alpha-1 Research Registry who were surveyed about their anxiety about math, perceptions of unpredictability, illness uncertainty, negative affect regarding the genetic testing, and desire to manage uncertainty. Results revealed that experiencing more fear and worry contributed to the desire to manage uncertainty. The inability to predict the symptoms and course of events related to a genetic diagnosis, to understand the implications of the diagnosis, and to understand math all heightened fear and worry. This research takes an important step forward in integrating UIT and UMT to understand the role of illness uncertainty and subsequent uncertainty management in genetic testing situations.","Framing Health Risk: Environment, Cancer, Genetics",Health Communication

Study 1 analyzed the content of cancer news stories, using a representative sample (N = 1,438) in South Korea from 2008 to 2012. Study 2 examined the effects of exposure to a cancer news story in an experimental setting (N = 717). Study 1 demonstrated that threat was more prevalent than efficacy in cancer news coverage; uncertainty was less frequent, and when included, it was more about threat uncertainty than efficacy uncertainty. Study 2 showed the positive effects of threat in cancer news on perceived risk, as well as of efficacy in news on perceived efficacy and intention for preventive behaviors; exposure to threat uncertainty had a positive effect, whereas efficacy uncertainty had negative effects.","Framing Health Risk: Environment, Cancer, Genetics",Health Communication

Using the 2014 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) data, analyses suggest that happiness, family cancer history, fatalistic beliefs, education, and different generations were significantly predicted for cancer risk perception.

2016-1411,2016,Paper Session,Who is to Blame? Media Framing of Responsibility for Pediatric Environmental Health and Mothers’ Perceptions of Accountability,2,"How the media frames issues of environmental health may affect mothers’ views of who is responsible for addressing environmental risks to pediatric health, and ultimately, their behavior to mitigate these risks. This article presents findings from two studies that describe how media attributes responsibility for mitigating such risks and examine associations between mothers’ routine media exposure, or scanning, and perceptions of responsibility. First, a content analysis was conducted with a sample of 474 media stories (i.e., Associated Press (AP), parenting magazines and websites) about childhood exposures to specific chemicals over a 6-month period (September 2012 – February 2013). These media stories attributed responsibility most frequently to parents, though significant differences were observed across media sources and chemicals. Next, we conducted an online survey of mothers (n = 819) and revealed media scanning during the prior 6 months was significantly associated with perceived personal responsibility, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Understanding media framing of these issues highlights opportunities for health communicators to offset pressure placed on mothers by encouraging greater social and policy support in certain media.","Framing Health Risk: Environment, Cancer, Genetics",Health Communication

Despite there being many strategies proposed on improving the effectiveness of virtual collaboration, there still appear to be conflicting views on how social dynamics can be managed in computer-mediated collaborative learning (CMCL) teams to improve the effectiveness of learning. This study reviews literature that offers strategies for building an effective collaborative virtual team, focusing on different theoretical clusters about virtual communications and the strategies each perspectives offers for improving effectiveness of collaboration through social dynamics. It investigates the rationale and empirical support for each theoretical perspective, and from each perspective, spotlights different guidelines that are suggested based on each position for improving effectiveness of CMCL.

2016-1413,2016,Paper Session,Investigating the Factors in Recruiting Participants to CSR Online Communities,4,"Companies realize there are a variety of benefits stemming from corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs. An increasingly popular vessel to communicate and engage participants in CSR programs is through online communities. Although companies have made large investments in CSR activities, a major challenge is recruiting and keeping participants active in these online communities. Very little research exists that examines how companies can encourage employees and customers to engage in CSR activities through online communities. To address this important gap in the literature, the present study explores the factors that help recruit participants to a CSR online community using social capital theory and person-environment fit theory as the theoretical foundations. A survey methodology is used and analyzed using PLS. Our results show that all three dimensions of social capital and members’ perceived fit with an online CSR community play a significant role in a member’s intention to engage in CSR activities.",Exploring Online Communites,Communication and Technology

Failure to do so successfully leads to confusion and alienation among newcomers. This paper presents a novel system, The Wikipedia Adventure, an interactive tutorial that orients newcomers to the process of editing Wikipedia. The system offers a structured experience that introduces a form of institutionalized socialization to Wikipedia that has been shown to be effective in other organizations and communities. We also present the results of a field experiment that tests whether the system increased users' subsequent contributions to Wikipedia. Our analysis of data from thousands of users fails to reject the null that there is no effect of being invited, or of visiting the tutorial conditional on receiving an invitation. We find that this null effect is well estimated, and discuss several possible reasons for this surprising result.",Exploring Online Communites,Communication and Technology

This includes withstanding attempts of social engineering aimed at manipulating people into divulging confidential information. However, many users are lacking awareness of the risks involved with, for example, password security. In a field survey that tested reciprocal behavior in social interactions, 1,208 participants were asked to reveal their personal password. More than one third of the participants shared their password with an unknown interviewer. In line with the social norm of reciprocity, people were more willing to do so when they received a small incentive (i.e., a piece of chocolate) before they were asked to reveal personal information. Elicitation was even more successful when the incentive was given right before asking for the password. The results, including moderating factors (e.g., age, gender), are discussed in the light of security awareness of ICT users and the mechanisms of psychological persuasion.",Framing and Logics Surveillance and Privacy,Communication and Technology
2016-1417,2016,Paper Session,Framing the Field of Online Self-Disclosure in Mainstream News Media,2,"The intensification of online self-disclosure, coupled with the ability to link personal information to those who disclose it, pose important questions regarding the benefits and risks associated with online self-disclosure. This study focuses on news media representations of issues regarding self-disclosure of personally identifiable information. Guided by analytic constructs from media framing theory it asks: What are the prevailing frames regarding personal information sharing, and how such framing facilitates critical debate on issues related to the risks and benefits associated with online self-disclosure. Articles that address these issues (n=609) published in the three top Israeli online newspapers were analyzed. Findings indicate that users are portrayed as players who lack agency and lose more than gain from online self-disclosure acts. We argue that no discourse has been constructed within which users are construed as agents who manage to promote their interests, and play a significant role in designing mechanisms for information sharing.",Framing and Logics Surveillance and Privacy,Communication and Technology

These efforts are influenced by “accompanying discourses”, or mass mediated “meta-communication”.
This article investigates through a content analysis how the German press has represented the question of privacy in the internet era over ten months until February 2015. The period included several major news events such as the European Court of Justice ruling on the “Right to be Forgotten” and the “Celebrity Hack” on iCloud accounts. Findings show that these events marked not only the media awareness of privacy, but also the level of privacy perceived at a given time.

The logic of connective surveillance is constituted by a collection of strategies by which distributed social movements may be proactively and efficiently monitored by exploiting the latent surveillance capacities of centralized digital communications networks. These strategies dramatically reduce the costs of surveillance, enable monitoring of entire populations, and facilitate retroactive surveillance of networks and individuals. The theory is applied to a case study of online protests against police violence in the United States, revealing that over 90% of more than 6,000 protest-related webpages are surveilled by U.S. companies with known ties to the NSA.",Framing and Logics Surveillance and Privacy,Communication and Technology

Drawing on Norman Fairclough’s intertextual analysis approach within the paradigm of Critical Discourse Analysis in an online discursive context, this study examines the role of intertextuality in the discursive construction of social movements. It does so by conducting analysis of how different social groups employ discursive strategies to construct political positions and identity in their online commentaries of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Focusing on discourse, genre, and style, this study aims to show how online texts draw on different intertextual resources and how they echo the larger nationalism discourse in China. In addition, the paper also hopes to reveal how the circulations and combinations of these intertextual resources in particular contexts construct specific understanding of the Umbrella Movement.","Interactional Affordances of Mediated Communication: The Analysis of Mobile Phones Use, Web TV Interviews, Webcast Football Talk, and Microblog Posts",Language & Social Interaction

We focus on what we call ""mobile-supported sharing activities,"" in which participants use mobile phones to share text, images, or video with others by voicing text aloud from their mobile or providing others with visual access to the device's display screen. Drawing from naturalistic video recordings of everyday conversations, we focus on how mobile-supported sharing activities invite assessments by providing access to an object that is not locally accessible to the participants. Such practices make relevant co-participant's assessment of these objects and allow for different forms of co-participation across sequence types. The analysis of these practices illustrates the relevance of embodiment, local objects ,and new communicative technologies to the production of action during co-present interaction.","Interactional Affordances of Mediated Communication: The Analysis of Mobile Phones Use, Web TV Interviews, Webcast Football Talk, and Microblog Posts",Language & Social Interaction

The show involves four participants and is an an example of how professional broadcasters are rethinking television content and exploring new web-based communicative modes of address accustomed to the web’s interactive affordances and the context of multiple screens. The ways the participants interact and relate to the web-users is distinctly different to traditional TV-performances. In this paper I analyse these differences more in detail. For this purpose I will connect to Tolson (2006) who distinguishes between three key qualities of traditional broadcast talk that makes it ‘sociable’: interactivity, performativity and liveliness. How is the talk organized so it can relate to the web-TV-audience? How is it designed to appear familiar and sociable in this particular context?","Interactional Affordances of Mediated Communication: The Analysis of Mobile Phones Use, Web TV Interviews, Webcast Football Talk, and Microblog Posts",Language & Social Interaction

It will be shown how web TV interviews produced by non-broadcasters such as tabloid print media constitute concrete examples of what Thompson (2005: 42) more generally describes as ‘a new and distinctive kind of fragility’ for politicians. Web interviews are explored as fuzzy ‘communicative activity types’ or CATs (Linell 2009) where it is not clear which communicative contributions are allowed and disallowed, i.e. there is no obvious understanding among the participants as to what it is that is really ‘going on’ within them. To illustrate this point I will analyze how one particular producer/interviewer came to exploit the fuzzy CAT’s conditions and its relative messiness in order to achieve a ‘poking prank’ with party leaders.","Interactional Affordances of Mediated Communication: The Analysis of Mobile Phones Use, Web TV Interviews, Webcast Football Talk, and Microblog Posts",Language & Social Interaction

More specifically, we explored the role of state emotions, trait empathy, and personal experiences in narrative transportation in an effort to demonstrate that the audience fluctuates between identification and spectatorship; between immersion and self reflection. While the specific findings varied by show to some extent, an overall pattern emerges that self-referencing and real-world-referencing are positively related to overall transportation and enjoyment, and self and real-world-referencing also occur in close temporal proximity to emotion sharing and perspective taking in real time.

2016-1425,2016,Paper Session,Narrative as a Moral Trainer: Building Moral Character Through Stories,2,"This study investigated whether exposure to television series might work to build viewers’ moral character. A social-cognitive approach (Lapsley & Narvaez, 2004) was used in order to measure moral character as the activation of moral schemas about virtue and vice. Series’ exposure was predicted to activate moral schemas to the extent that viewers engage with the story and its characters. In addition, we expected that viewers’ reception of the series needs to be challenged in order for their moral schemas to become activated. Two manipulations therefore attempted to hinder viewers’ automatic affective disposition formation: the narrative portrayal of the antagonists’ immoral history (present, absent) and viewers’ perspective taking (protagonist, antagonist, or none). The results of a between-subjects experiment revealed no mediation of engagement processes, but a significant interaction between the two manipulation factors. The implications of the results for communication studies and moral education efforts are discussed.",Transportation and Media Entertainment,Mass Communication

Using the Neo-Kohlbergian approach (Rest et al., 1999a), the study measured effects of genre exposure on the strength of personal interest reasoning, maintaining norms reasoning, and postconventional reasoning, taking into account television viewing habits and three personality traits (empathy, sympathy, narrative engageability). Results indicate some effects on reasoning schemas: While exposure to crime drama had no influence, medical drama raised ‘maintaining norms’ reasoning and lowered ‘postconventional’ reasoning. Exposure to comedy raised ‘postconventional’ reasoning. Television viewing habits, empathy and sympathy showed no consistent influence, while narrative engageability lowered ‘personal interest’ and ‘maintaining norms’ reasoning, and increased ‘postconventional’ reasoning.",Transportation and Media Entertainment,Mass Communication

Horror film enjoyment seemed to be paradoxical if the evil characters are too powerful and can not be defeated. Transporting to the horrified and dark side provides self-escaping and alternative experiences without real costs, and therefore leads to enjoyment. In order to explore conditions of transporting to horror movies, college students (N = 71) participated in a horror movie seeing experiment under different conditions. Results indicate that prior information disclosed is a significant negative predictor of transportation. Transportation is positively related to fear responses and enjoyment of horror movies. Other conditions like environmental conditions, transportation ability and relationship between fear responses and enjoyment are discussed.",Transportation and Media Entertainment,Mass Communication

In an effort to increase the quality of user comments, news organizations are starting to participate actively within the comment sections by responding to uncivil postings, providing facts and trying to enforce civic behavioral rules. However, no study has analyzed the effects of such ‘active moderation’. We argue that active moderation as well as different response styles (objective vs. humorous) to uncivil comments will positively affect the discussion climate, the credibility of the news organization and the quality of their stories as well as observers’ willingness to join the discussions. However, results of an experiment by majority do not support these assumptions.

This study found that the four news organizations considered audience preferences in their editorial decisions, but the extent to which they did so depended on the institutional arrangements surrounding how embedded their social media teams were in their news production. Though all four news organizations had social media teams, they differed in how involved these teams were.

Based on a combination of survey data and results from a content analysis we show that a poor macroeconomic context substantially strengthens citizens’ pro-European attitudes. Additionally, the specific presentation of the Euro crisis in terms of the attribution of roles (primary victim, treatment responsibility) to single countries or to the EU as a whole proves influential. Finally, our results suggest that citizens’ pro-European attitudes are based on a complex interplay between citizens’ perception of the job market and the media discourse on the role that specific countries play during the crisis.",Survey Research and Media Effects,Political Communication

This study examines the over-time reliability of two self-reported political discussion frequency measures and explores factors that might contribute to measurement unreliability, including contextual survey factors and individual difference variables. Analyses focus on a quasi-experiment and an experiment from two waves of a three-wave panel study. The quasi-experiment demonstrates that including a number of issue-relevant questions prior to assessing talk frequency leads to higher reports of political and economy talk frequency; the size of this effect is positively related to political and economic interest, respectively. The experiment demonstrates that an open-ended thought-listing question about the economy leads to higher reports of economy talk frequency, but only among those who have relatively expansive conceptualizations of the economy. These results have important implications for the survey-data-reliant political discussion literature.",Survey Research and Media Effects,Political Communication

We argue that even in state-of-the-art media effects studies which combine measures of media content and media use, measurement error in both the media content analysis and the media use self-reports will typically lead to severely downward-biased effect estimates. We demonstrate this phenomenon using a large Monte Carlo simulation with varying parameters of the content analysis and the survey study. Results show that random and systematic errors in the content analysis and media use variables do indeed lead to smaller effect estimates, especially when the topics of interest are relatively rare, as is often the case in political communication.

2016-1437,2016,Paper Session,The Dual Factor Relational Framework,3,Individualist and collectivist cultural frameworks have been the dominant research paradigm in cross-cultural studies in management research despite evidence of conceptual and measurement problems with collectivism. This paper describes the development and empirical testing of a new theoretical model of psychological functioning that captures some of the useful elements of collectivism without its drawbacks. The proposed framework takes into account the variety of relations in an individual’s social and cultural environment by including a structural-relational factor and a rational-relational factor. The structural factor is grounded in sociological structuration theory and relational orientation characteristics. The rational factor captures important aspects of agency and is based on social exchange theory. We describe in detail the procedures used to validate the dual-factor relational orientation framework’s dimensionality and validity. We discuss the model’s role in providing an alternative to methodological individualism and application in exploring differences among Confucian societies as well as cross-cultural differences.,Cultural Identity and Social Identity,Intercultural Communication

2016-1439,2016,Paper Session,Subject of a Difference: Regional Cinema in India and the Margins of National Imaginary,2,"This paper attempts to address the issues of cultural-linguistic identity as represented in regional cinema in India, while it negotiates to locate itself in relation to increasingly globalized popular Hindi cinema. What was commonly accepted as Indian national cinema was a linguistically specific (Hindi), geopolitically distinct (North India), socio-economically discrete (commonly upper-caste, middle or upper-middleclass) expression that clearly established a hegemonic cultural domination within the rhetoric of an imaginary ‘national culture’ in a multicultural, multiethnic country. Such hegemonic, exclusionary nationalistic-cultural imperialism takes a distinct shape alongside globalization. This paper takes up the specific case of Bengali cinema. Particularly following the economic liberalization in 1990s, the paper argues, Bengali cinema contending with the globalized albeit authentically ‘national’ Hindi cinema has rendered itself as a cultural mimic— “as a subject of a difference that is almost the same, but not quite”. Hence in the context of Indian cinema, the question is not whether regional cinemas disintegrate and disappear as a result of the influence of globalization but how globalization changes the already disintegrating and increasingly ‘nationalized’ ethnic, linguistic identities, parallel to the hegemonic nationalistic-cultural imperialism?

Diaspora. These young men and women vary in age from 18 to 30 and serve in fully integrated units
within the Army hierarchy comprised of Israeli conscripts. Understanding the
underlying motivational factors of these lone soldiers, testing their levels of bicultural integration
during and after military service, and identification of variables that limit their integration and
bicultural identity post-release are the cornerstones of this research. Diasporic Jewish identity and
Israeli-American relationships are evaluated to compare and contrast these volunteers from their
counterparts.
In depth interviews and surveys were given to n=64 lone soldiers in Israel as well as n=87
former soldiers recently leaving the service, some in Israel and others back in the Diaspora. The results showed that while multiple domains of identity and differences between current and
former soldiers exist, the largest predictor of both high level bicultural integration and the decision to
stay in Israel after military service is dictated by language skills. A best practices guide is provided as a
compilation document to provide the IDF and State of Israel guidance as to ways to improve

The results suggest that media coverage of terrorist incidents was specifically interpreted by Ethiopian students only in view of their personal and cultural spheres, and was not integrated into their Israeli identities or social and national public dialogues. Consequently, media consumption by Ethiopians of terrorism acts both mirrors their integration process and reinforces their marginal status in Israeli society.",Cultural Identity and Social Identity,Intercultural Communication
2016-1442,2016,Paper Session,"""Please Send us Your Money"": The BBC’s Evolving Relationship With Charitable Causes and Fundraising",1,"BBC has broadcast weekly charitable appeals since 1923. As a public service broadcaster unable to advertise, ‘promoting’ causes was strictly policed. A new style appeal arose in 1963 via the Disasters Emergency Committee where broadcasters negotiated with aid NGOs to organize emergency appeals. These were high profile and transmitted at peak times, but sometimes caused controversy.
1985 saw further development in the aftermath of the Ethiopian Famine with Geldof and celebrity charity fundraising, which attracted widespread support, but led to BBC anxieties about the suitability of celebrity led appeals on a public service channel. Internal documents reveal that senior BBC figures worried about insufficient awareness and education of audiences on the nature of the cause, considering it inappropriate that celebrities had become intermediaries between audience and charity. Wider concerns arose about the BBC’s impartiality. This paper explores how a public service broadcaster navigated these issues and confronted the ensuing conflicts.","Histories of Television: Practices, Cultures, and Institutions",Communication History
2016-1443,2016,Paper Session,Television in Ireland: A History From the Mediated Centre,1,"This article identifies and critiques a dominant narrative in the history of Irish television, which is too often passed off for, or accepted as, the history of television in Ireland. The history of television in Ireland has been written within an institutional framework and depends on the cultural binary of tradition and modernity, ‘old Ireland’ and ‘new Ireland’. This dominant narrative fails to interrogate television as a medium. It provides an account of the Irish broadcaster RTÉ rather than an account of the arrival of a new medium. Ironically this narrative which hinges on the role of television in opening up Irish society is itself quite closed in terms of the stories it tells and the questions it asks. The prevalence of this narrative can be explained by an academic dependence on institutional sources and in flawed ideas on the relationship between media and society. It will be argued that it is necessary to turn to non-institutional sources to complement and balance the factual and ideological blindspots in the dominant narrative.","Histories of Television: Practices, Cultures, and Institutions",Communication History

Although specific television content was rarely addressed, Playboy did regularly critique the television industry and its regulation, the formulaic nature of content, the sometimes negative effects of the introduction of television into American homes, and innovations in television and home video technologies. Playboy was not strictly anti-television; rather, it was against those aspects of the medium that could be considered overly commercial, feminizing, aimed at mass tastes and audiences, politically safe, and/or puritanical. Although Boddy, Spigel, and other scholars have thoroughly detailed the ways in which such critiques of television as mass culture contributed to debates over gender roles, Playboy provides a site in which these critiques were explicitly tied to gender, sexuality, and leisure competence.","Histories of Television: Practices, Cultures, and Institutions",Communication History
2016-1445,2016,Paper Session,Early Japanese Television Discourse in Kinema Junpō 1953 – 1958,1,"This paper looks at early discussions of television in the world’s longest running film magazine Kinema Junpō from 1953 to 1958, the first five years of its development. The relationship between film and television is often narrated as one of rivalry. However, an exploration of television related articles in Kinema Junpō reveals how it was not so. Kinema Junpō engages with television through special issues and regular columns on television that discuss a wide range of topics such as issues of medium specificity and terminology, regulation and issues of education, television history/development in and outside of Japan, and the relationship with the film industry. In other words, programming on early Japanese television was closely tied to the filmic medium and its industry as a core structural element. Therefore early television programming is about this negotiation as its new capabilities of live broadcasting.","Histories of Television: Practices, Cultures, and Institutions",Communication History

While critical PR studies have focused on the negative power of PR (e.g., hegemony, manipulation), limited attempts seek to explore whether the power of PR can be positive and how. To address this gap, this study applies a theoretical lens of “institutional agency” – actors’ initiative and capacity to exert influence on institutional environments – to examine how PR enacts institutional agency in authoritarian China and with what, if any, positive outcomes. Based on 46 in-depth interviews and participant observation, results suggest that Chinese PR serves as changing agents to aid organizations overcome various institutional constraints and create a favorable environment in which they operate. This study contributes to enriching extant PR scholarship on power by presenting a refreshing view of constructive institutional agency.","Power [and, in, of] Public Relations",Public Relations

Through an exploration of the links between electronic word of mouth (eWOM) consumer behaviors and source credibility, organization-public relationships (OPR) quality and organizational reputation, this study introduced eWOM as a relevant concept for public relations. eWOM is a trusted source of information that could increase users’ perception of peer credibility, strengthen two-way dialogue between an organization and its publics, and potentially be used to strengthen or spread the reputation of an organization. An online survey of 326 participants supported the hypotheses, showing that eWOM has an impact on important indicators of organizational effectiveness. [93 words]

Interviews with Asian American community organizations and community members (n=52) revealed best practices of community engagement and empowerment. Community engagement in health context was most fruitful when taking into consideration both organizational and community needs. The relationship-focused engagement included: information, primarily through health education; consultation at the message, program, and community levels; collaboration with community through joint decision-making and resource attainment. Community organizations empowered members through relationships ranging from intimate to pragmatic ones. Regardless, trust was the most important factor and trust building needed to be culturally appropriate. Community empowerment was illustrated through basic, personal empowerment, health empowerment at the individual level, political/civic empowerment, and community-level empowerment.
Findings indicate several key implications for the theoretical development in stakeholder engagement and community empowerment as well as for advancing ethnic organizations’ engagement with community members.","Power [and, in, of] Public Relations",Public Relations
2016-1449,2016,Paper Session,When CEOs Cry: How CEOs’ Emoting Impacts Stakeholder Perceptions of Organization,7,"An enduring image from the Sichuan earthquake in China in May 2008 which killed more than 69, 000 people and left 4.8 million people homeless was that of the country’s leader visiting the destruction sites and weeping openly with the victims. As a result, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao became known as the “crying prime minister” (Jacobs, 2008). What impact on stakeholder perception would it have when the leader or CEO freely express their emotions? In this paper, we propose the CEO Emoting Model to examine the influence of expressed affect by the CEO on stakeholder perceptions of the CEO and the organization. A pre-study using participant observation and a main study involving 302 participants were undertaken. Findings show that when CEOs as spokespersons express affect during crises via verbal and nonverbal cues and these factors influence how the public perceives the CEO and the organization. These relationships are influenced by the gender of the CEO. The expression of affect by the CEO was also found to elicit empathetic emotions from stakeholders. However, perceived trustworthiness, rather than empathetic response, was found to mediate the relationship between spokesperson cues and organizational reputation. These findings present significant implications in how practitioners should counsel their CEOs in terms of emotional display or restraint when addressing their stakeholders during crises.

Taking a phenomenological approach and making use of ethnographic data collection methods involving observations and filming over a month in two public relations offices, this paper analyses verbal and non-verbal actions in context. Based on the findings, the authors suggest that power is ambient, i.e., located in the most commonplace interactions, and that it can be found in the experience of that interaction and relationship. The authors subsequently introduce the concept of ambient power as an alternative way of thinking about power in public relations.","Power [and, in, of] Public Relations",Public Relations

2016-1452,2016,Paper Session,Political Fact Checking on Twitter: When Do Corrections Have an Effect?,3,"Though often criticized for aiding in the spread of misinformation, social media offer a great potential for fact-checking interventions, in which refutations of false information can be easily identified and shared with those promulgating misinformation. Unfortunately, previous research suggests that these interventions are likely to have minimal effects.
However, this research has not considered the way in which variations in social context can alter individuals’ motivations for engaging with facts. Using theories from the study of accountability and social networks, we argue that when rumor spreaders have a strong social connection to the individual correcting them, they are more likely to accept the correction.
We test this argument by observing real examples of these interventions on Twitter between April 2012 and April 2014. We identify cases where one individual, a “snoper,” replies to another individual, a “snopee,” with a link to a fact-checking website (Snopes.com, PolitiFact.com, and FactCheck.org) or “snope.” We then code the response of the snopee for whether they accept the correction as true as well as whether they attempt to justify or defend their original statement. As hypothesized, we find that snopees who follow and are followed by their snopers are significantly more likely to accept the correction, and less likely to defend their original statement, than snopees confronted by strangers. Snopees who share more followers in common with their snoper are also more likely to accept corrections. Implications of these findings are discussed.",Check It Out: Fact Checking on Old and New Media,Political Communication

While encouraging, questions persist as to why and how corrective messages diminish political misperceptions. To address these important questions, this study conceptualizes fact-checking as a form of persuasion and tests three possible mechanisms through which corrections may effectively reduce inaccurate beliefs. Using two online experiments with demographically diverse samples of adults in the United States, this study examines whether corrective messages are effective by reducing the perceived argument quality of the original misinformation, diminishing the credibility of the misinformation’s source, or changing individuals’ attitudes toward the focal political issue. Results indicate corrections change the perceived quality of the misinformation and at times discredit the source of false claims, which subsequently improve belief accuracy. The findings suggest that corrections should not attempt to change attitudes but instead seek to discredit the misinformation and its source.",Check It Out: Fact Checking on Old and New Media,Political Communication

Specifically, we examine the relation between advertising exposure and life satisfaction (aim 1) and the mediating roles of materialism (aim 2) and psychological well-being (aim 3). Three-wave panel data were collected among 1,133 8 to 12-year-olds. Psychological well-being was measured overall and per dimension (i.e., environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, autonomy, and positive relations with others). We found no direct effect of advertising exposure on life satisfaction, but did observe indirect effects via materialism (negative) and overall psychological well-being (positive). Further analysis revealed that environmental mastery, personal growth, and autonomy were positive mediators, and purpose in life a negative mediator. This research sheds light onto the ethical debate surrounding child-directed advertising, showing it might stimulate children’s sense of control over their environment, openness to new experiences, direction in life, and sense of self-agency.","Distracted, Dissatisfied, Drunk, and Other Disorders: Youth, Media, and Well-Being",Children Adolescents and the Media

Computer-based multitasking was observed for a ten minute period among large samples of children (N = 164) and adults (N = 160). The findings indicate that individuals find it indeed difficult to focus their attention on a main activity in the presence of appealing media distractors. A main effect for age was qualified by an interaction effect between age and attention problems. The findings indicate that children and adults without attention problems do not differ in their multitasking behavior. However, children with attention problems engaged more frequently in computer-based multitasking in comparison to children without attention problems and adults.","Distracted, Dissatisfied, Drunk, and Other Disorders: Youth, Media, and Well-Being",Children Adolescents and the Media

They form part of a documentation project, which was conducted by Abraham Idelsohn. Idelsohn, a European Jewish ethnomusicologist, arrived to Jerusalem in 1907 and heard eastern Jewish melodies, which were very different from the ones he had known from European Jewry. Realizing that the western notation system would not suffice to represent the eastern musical nuances, Idelsohn used a phonograph to capture the melodies he encountered. His project yielded an orientalist thesis, according to which eastern Jewish communities preserved authentic tunes from antiquity.
The essay studies the complex intersection between two aspects of Idelsohn’s project: the convergence of modern sound technology and Jewish tradition, and its orientalist framework. Focusing on the function media technologies had in sustaining orientalism, I argue that the phonograph had a significant role in nourishing Idelsohn’s ideology and in placing him in an intermediary position between west and east.",Capturing Sight and Sound: Histories of Documentation,Communication History

In addition, we examine whether perceived control over one’s work situation and trait procrastination are antecedents of employees’ checking habit and cyberslacking behavior. A theoretical model was tested with structural equation modeling among 297 knowledge workers. Results revealed that checking frequency fully mediated the relationship between checking habit and perceived work efficiency, indicating that checking frequency and the resulting productivity loss is mostly habitual. Moreover, control over one’s work situation and trait procrastination positively predicted checking habit. In sum, our results show that checking behavior is mainly habitual.

Data from surveys, collection of social media posts, and interviews with participants shows that artists use social media to communicate with potential customers, often building a sense of intimacy that can eventually translate into sales. On its surface this claim indicates a transactional utilitarian process. Yet rigorous qualitative analysis of a data set from 39 surveys, 15,000 social media posts and an additional 25 hours of interviews suggests that a connected lives approach—a theoretical perspective that embraces the interconnectedness of economy and intimacy (Zelizer, 2005)—better explains how artists and customers build personal relationships that often include or result in one or more economic transactions.","CAT Hybrid Session 4: Collaboration, Work, and Organizations",Communication and Technology

Our findings suggest these companies strategically frame their efforts as humanitarian/development aid, portraying “connectivity” itself as a basic human right at the expense of other internet policy concerns.

We found clear evidence of the press and television news sharing similar policy-orientated agendas, with more stories emanating from right-wing newspapers and moments when major newspaper splashes dominated the television news coverage. Our more qualitative angle to intermedia agenda-setting revealed that while many broadcasters were editorially comfortable with covering stories originating from newspapers, this was justified by supplying further context and counter-balancing views. Since news values are not politically neutral, we argue that if journalists or editors routinely rely on newspapers to help shape the political agenda it compromises their ability to make impartial judgements about news selection.",Journalism as Political Communication,Journalism Studies

2016-1473,2016,Paper Session,"Mediatization as an Indicator of Convergence of Media Systems: Campaign Coverage on Austrian Television, 1983–2013",2,"From a long-term perspective, television can be regarded as the medium which has furthered 'mediatization' of politics the most. Nevertheless, long-term studies on the role of television in the mediatization process are rare and mainly focusing on countries with a liberal media system (according to Hallin and Mancini’s classification). However, if mediatization is closely related to globalization (as usually assumed), convergent developments in different types of media system should be observed. Therefore, the paper endeavors to test the mediatization thesis and the associated assumption of increased interpretive capacity of journalism using Austrian television campaign coverage since 1983 as an example, because Austria can be taken as typical for the democratic-corporatist model with its high media-party parallelism, which can be regarded as a powerful counterforce to the mediatization of politics. Working on basic assumptions of mediatization research, all hypotheses were able to be confirmed at least in principle in the direction predicted.",Journalism as Political Communication,Journalism Studies
2016-1474,2016,Paper Session,New Parties in the News: The Effect of New Parties Entering Parliament on Their Visibility in News Media Coverage,3,"In every democracy, new parties emerge every now and then. New parties need news media attention to survive. In order to get attention, obtaining representation in the national parliament may help. To what extent are new parties more visible in the media once they have gained access to parliament? To answer this question we cannot simply compare new parties that have made it into parliament to those that have not. Instead we address this question using a regression discontinuity approach based on data from eight established democracies since 1987. We perform an analysis of all new parties in the Netherlands, and an eight-country analysis. Results from our analyses suggest that surpassing the electoral threshold in a country increases the media visibility of parties that have a clear left-wing or right-wing profile, not of other parties. Our findings will further our understanding of why some new parties survive while others die.",Journalism as Political Communication,Journalism Studies
2016-1475,2016,Paper Session,A Longitudinal Study on the Reciprocal Relationship Between Health Anxiety and Online Health Information Seeking,4,"The current study is the first to investigate the relationship between online health information seeking and health anxiety longitudinally. More specifically, we investigated the possible reciprocal relationship between these two constructs. This relationship has often been dubbed cyberchondria. It entails that individuals who are health anxious go online to find health information, e.g. to reassure themselves in order to decrease anxiety. Going online, however, is expected to increase rather than decrease health anxiety, which in turn will reinforce online seeking again. We investigated this so called spiral model by means of a state-of-the-art cross-lagged panel model: the random intercept cross-lagged panel model. Results of the present study strengthen previous findings by demonstrating that online health information seeking and health anxiety are related cross-sectionally. The findings, however, do not support the hypothesis of a reciprocal relationship over time.",Online/Internet Health Information Seeking,Health Communication
2016-1476,2016,Paper Session,An Examination of the Gatekeeping Process of Health Information on Weibo,1,"Weibo, a microblogging platform that has attracted more than 200 million users in China, has a great potential for the distribution of health communication. However, it also provides challenges for health communicators in terms of information credibility and attraction of users’ attention. In order to look into these two issues, this article conducted a case study on Life Times, one of the largest health-related forums with more than 1.6 million followers, to investigate the determinants of the two-step gatekeeping process, which contains content producers’ initial gatekeeping and users’ redistribution, of health information on Weibo. Interviews and a content analysis were conducted. The results show that health contents that are timely, practical, and readable, and come from credible sources with appealing formats are more likely to pass the initial “gate”. Moreover, health-related microblogs with well-designed formats, practical guidance and high readability are more likely to get high visibility through users’ re-dissemination.",Online/Internet Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Specifically, this study examines how trusts in health information (i.e., from physician and from the Internet) determine individuals’ use of online health-related activities. The study further examines how the use of such online activities improves patient-provider relationships such as discussing online health information with doctors, and satisfaction with healthcare. Utilizing a web-based survey in South Korea, the findings indicated that trust in health information from doctors was negatively related to communication activities, while trust in online health information was positively related to both communication and information activities. In addition, both communication and information activities were positively associated with discussion about online health information with doctors. Further, discussion with doctors about online health information was positively related to satisfaction with healthcare.",Online/Internet Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Research has begun to explore the relationship between social media and negative psychological health outcomes, but to date we know very little about how or if adolescent teens are using social media to obtain health information, a key task of normative adolescent development. Data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents (ages 13-18) indicate that adolescent interest in health, as well as experience with health issues, predict using social media for health information seeking. Additionally, these data suggest that using social media for health information seeking is related to both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes, such as less stress and riskier behaviors like drinking and smoking. These data suggest that adolescents use social media to find out information about health, and that these searching behaviors are related to both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes in adolescents.",Online/Internet Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Though a ethnographic study exploring female IT engineers relationships with identity and technology, it was found that the respondents constructed a range of shifting identities which referenced the “informational” and “cultural” dimensions of being immaterial labour. The respondents' personal narratives were found to contain the dialectical discourses of “professionalism/precarity” and “esteem/segregation”, as well as a discourse of femininity relating to the performance of affective labour in the workplace. These discourses highlighted the precarious position occupied by women engineers within the IT industries but also female engineers' power to create their own identity within IT. The research suggests further implications for the study of immaterial labour particularly regarding the relationship of identity with gender and technology.","Sex, Gender, and Technology",Communication and Technology

2016-1481,2016,Paper Session,Sexual Selves on Social Media: Contextualizing Facebook Uses by Diasporic Gay Men,2,"Social media create new opportunities but also pose new challenges for the ways people negotiate their online selves. As noted by boyd (2011), social media are characterised by unique dynamics such as collapsed contexts, implying that one's distinct offline social worlds meet online. This creates particular challenges for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, or LGBTQs, at least those who find it crucial to maintain distinct contexts in which they disclose or conceal their gender and/or sexual selves. However, the existing scholarship on social media use by LGBTQs is predominantly anchored in English-language Western contexts and tends to lose sight of the cultural specificities of internet use. Therefore, in this paper, we build on the scholarship to further investigate the role of context for disclosing or concealing gender and/or sexual selves online. More specifically, we ask: How do social, cultural and material contexts affect the ways LGBTQs navigate their selves on social media? To investigate this question, we analyze in-depth face-to-face interviews with gay men who themselves, or whose parents, migrated to Belgium. Because their migration background forces them to negotiate different social, cultural and material contexts, our focus on diasporic gay men helps to bring out the issue of context in social media use.","Sex, Gender, and Technology",Communication and Technology
2016-1482,2016,Paper Session,Reputational Economies and the Business of Online Shame: A Case Study of Revenge Porn,2,"The phenomenon of revenge porn is a prominent form of online shaming involves exposing private and sensitive information online for a wide, unsympathetic audience. Revenge porn consists of the public posting online of photos of sexual activity that were originally meant for exclusive viewing by an intimate partner. This paper analyzes the U.S. based revenge porn website MyEx.com, featuring both a textual and visual analysis as well as an information traffic analysis. Our analysis reveals that with networked communication processes, shaming tactics become ways of both exerting social power through informational violence and of generating revenue in diverse ways: from extortion business models to setting up advertising networks to providing customers to reputation management companies. Such means of monetizing shaming is made possible by the current online social media context, which is dominated by reputation building through profiling and personalization.","Sex, Gender, and Technology",Communication and Technology

We conducted a content analysis of the food frames in major US newspapers and on web pages in a hyperlink network induced by NGOs fighting for food safety. A hierarchical cluster analysis yielded five central frames: food manipulation, profit seeking food industry, insufficient regulation, effects of an unhealthy diet, and food contamination. We found these frames to be pronounced to different degrees in the focused discourse arenas: while the press strongly emphasizes the problems of an unhealthy diet and individual consumer responsibility, civil society organizations look at food as a collective good and call for a stronger regulation of the production and distribution of food to sustain a system where healthy nourishment is available for everyone.","Mediated Views of Health: Food, Size, Weight",Health Communication
2016-1484,2016,Paper Session,"Food Reasoning: The Influences of Emotional Framing, Food Knowledge, and Media Exposure on Food Judgments",2,"The study presented here examines how valence framing of food attributes interacts with individual differences in food knowledge and media exposure to influence judgments about food. Results indicate that negative valence frames were more powerful overall. Further, food knowledge interacted with valence framing and food genre in an interesting way. Individuals with high food knowledge tended to use heuristic processing to make judgments about controversial foods, while individuals who were low in food knowledge were more susceptible to framing effect when dealing with non-controversial food information. Furthermore, we also found that individuals with higher media exposure were less susceptible to framing effect. These results are significant and meaningful given the prevalence of obesity issue in the U.S. This study also has implications for health experts working with college students as results suggest healthy eating campaigns should focus on develop two separate strategies when framing controversial and non-controversial foods.","Mediated Views of Health: Food, Size, Weight",Health Communication

Female participants exposed to attractive model pictures showed higher intention to lose weight compared to unattractive models. This effect was qualified by an interaction effect between model body size and attractiveness. Participants who were exposed to thin and attractive model pictures indicated highest intention to lose weight while the one exposed to thin and unattractive model pictures indicated the lowest. However models’ body size alone did not affect participants’ intention to lose weight. Furthermore, weight-related messages moderated the effect of model appearance (body size and attractiveness) on weight-loss intention. These effects are discussed in the light of social comparison and stereotype activation models.","Mediated Views of Health: Food, Size, Weight",Health Communication

The findings from an experiment conducted in an actual movie theater (N = 188) demonstrate that the new screen technology enhances the feelings and perception toward the advertisements, with physical presence presenting the mediating effects. Of note is that the effects of 3-W screen were presented differently depending upon the types of the advertisements, the dynamic one and the static one. The impacts of 3-W screen were mostly applied to the dynamic advertisement, but not in the static one. Given the high cost of installing 3-W screen in movie theaters and producing movies adaptable to the new screen technology, the findings of the present study call for more elaborate designs of advertisements to enhance the applicability of 3-W screen.

Journalists’ Interpretations of Framing and Newsroom Strategies of Counterframing,2,"The aim of this paper is to grasp the influence of the newsroom on frame-building processes. Firstly, journalists’ own understanding of “frames” and “framing” is investigated. Secondly, from an academic interpretation of these concepts, journalists’ framing practices are studied. To this end an ethnographic study was conducted at a Belgian and a Dutch newspaper newsroom. The findings reveal that while the noun “frame” is sporadically used as a tool, the verb “framing” is considered as something from which a journalist should refrain. This is explained by the associations journalists make with “strategic framing” from sources as well as by the newspapers’ explicit attempt to no longer view the world from a single “ideological” frame. Their frame-building processes are understood in terms of counterframing, in which one newsroom strives to disprove existing frames (deframing) and the other to create new frames (reframing) by consciously avoiding common clichés and initiating own stories.",Framing the News: International Perspectives,Journalism Studies

Through the usage of specific and reoccurring narratives and frames journalists contextualize what is happening outside the realm of our ordinary life. This paper examines the contextualization of the foreign news in quality newspapers with the help of a qualitative, explorative methodological approach that simultaneously analyzes the narratives and frames. In addition, the paper investigates if there are some differences in the usage of narratives and frames depending on journalism culture. Therefore two British and two German quality newspapers were analyzed. The analysis revealed two different types of generic narratives: (1) reoccurring structural dimensions and (2) reoccurring textual themes. Since the analysis suggests that German journalists act more as advocates than their British colleagues, the analysis furthermore shows some differences with regard to journalism culture in the foreign news coverage.",Framing the News: International Perspectives,Journalism Studies

Drawing on the notion of frame building, this study examines some of the factors that can affect newspapers’ selective use of frames. A content analysis of three national newspapers and six regional newspapers indicated that marijuana legalization has been discussed largely as a public policy issue such as regulation and legislation, rather than a health or science issue. The findings also showed that the medical effect – benefit or risk – of marijuana use has been the key reason in debating the issue. Overall, the story tone was neutral, but positive stories were more than negative.

Our analysis takes the example of condemnations concerning the maltreatment of Palestinians by the Israeli state as voiced by a variety of institutional actors who vary in the degree of their cultural-political proximity to the transgressor: B'Tselem, BDS, UN, and EU. Examining their discourses of condemnation, we ask: What are the discursive features that characterize political condemnations? How does the condemning party’s relationship to the transgressing party affect their stylistic choices? And how are condemnations linked to culturally inflected modes of speaking, universal and particular moral scripts, and institutional rhetoric? Our analysis traces stylistic and functional differences among the four organizations' epideictic of blame while confirming the centrality of condemnations as public speech acts.","Discursive Features of Condemnation, Blame Avoidance, Stancetaking, and Positioning in Political Communication",Language & Social Interaction

Therefore, government communication professionals routinely adopt various blame avoidance strategies, the linguistic aspects of which are yet to be studied by discourse analysts.
I contribute towards filling this gap in knowledge by showing how written professional guidelines for government communicators could be subjected to a discourse-historical inquiry and interpreted as complex discursive devices of anticipative blame avoidance.
I bring concrete examples from the recent propriety guidelines of the UK government communicators to illustrate how the use of certain discursive strategies (calculated ways of arguing, framing, denying, representing social actors and actions, and legitimising) limits the possible perceived blameworthiness of officeholders and allows them to bypass propriety boundaries without attracting disapproval. I conclude by explicating the discursive underpinnings of two common 'operational' blame avoidance strategies in government.","Discursive Features of Condemnation, Blame Avoidance, Stancetaking, and Positioning in Political Communication",Language & Social Interaction
2016-1499,2016,Paper Session,Online Discourse of Radical Movements: Exploring Stance in Nigerian Islamist Groups’ Web Discourses,2,"This study examines the features of stance in online discourse of two Islamic militant groups in Nigeria, namely Boko Haram and Ansaru. The data are made up of tweets and online media publications by these groups. Qualitative analysis is adopted within the appraisal framework of the systemic functional linguistic theory and the broader paradigm of critical (cultural) discourse studies. Findings show that the Nigerian Islamists utilize the Internet not only as a medium for expressing their religious and cultural ideologies but also to construct a positive identity for themselves and justify their campaign against the assumed enemies. Stance in the online digital discourse of the two groups is expressed through hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mention. Affect commonly express anger, hate and triumph. This study also shows that stance in this context reflects evaluative strategies that are employed to persuade or radicalize the reader.

Drawing on communication for development and social change principles and social norms theory, Government, international organizations, disability rights NGOs, parents associations, media and private sector mobilized in order to increase awareness about the rights and abilities of children with disabilities and stimulate inclusive attitudes and practices towards them. The percentage of citizens who find it acceptable for a child with disability to attend the same class with theirs increased from 35% in 2010 to 80 % in 2013, and it remained at 78% two years after the campaign ended. Similarly, the percentage of Montenegrin citizens who find it acceptable for a child with disability to be the best friend of their child increased from 22 % in 2010 to 51% in 2013, and it increased further after the end of the campaign reaching 60% in 2015. Results suggest that influencing social norms can accelerate changes in inclusive behavior but sustainability of communication efforts remains a key ingredient to facilitating long term change.","New Contexts and Methods for Social Change: Crises, Campaigns, and Corporate Social Responsibility",Global Communication and Social Change

Within the context of an increasingly globalizing business world, and underpinned by the concept of sustainable development, stakeholder theory, and issues management, this paper proposes the Corporate Sustainability Framework (CSF) as an alternate conception of CSR. It argues that the CSF does not only bring conceptual clarity to the CSR idea; it is a dynamic and nuanced framework that is sensitive to the power imbalance between global businesses and the local contexts in which they operate. Applications and utility of the Framework for global business, communication, policy, and research are discussed.","New Contexts and Methods for Social Change: Crises, Campaigns, and Corporate Social Responsibility",Global Communication and Social Change

The response to Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013, represents the most systematic implementation of initiatives aimed at empowering local communities to hold agencies into account. Drawing on a year-long ethnography of the Haiyan recovery and 139 interviews with humanitarian workers and affected people, our paper explores the link between humanitarian accountability and technology. Our findings reveal a narrow interpretation of accountability as feedback which is increasingly captured through mobile phones. We observe that the digitized collection of feedback is not used to improve the delivery of services, but as evidence of ‘impact’ aimed at donors. Despite noble intentions the intensification of feedback mechanisms and metrics do not democratise humanitarian action nor do they empower affected people while they may even have negative consequences.","New Contexts and Methods for Social Change: Crises, Campaigns, and Corporate Social Responsibility",Global Communication and Social Change

In this study, we examined how Facebook use for scientific purposes may influence two important antecedents of public participation— scientific knowledge and perceived efficacy to communicate science. Moreover, in light of the torrential amount of information in the social media environment, users may not be able to fully process what they see. Therefore, we also examined two factors that may contribute to the clarification of information; they are information literacy and interpersonal discussion. Based on an online sample of 800 people, we found that Facebook use was positively related to both self-efficacy and knowledge. More importantly, both information literacy and interpersonal discussion served as important moderating variables for knowledge, although not for self-efficacy.

The different groups of actors’ intentions to mention uncertain aspects of biotechnological research in public are guided by different rationales. Scientists and company representatives’ intentions to point out uncertainty are strengthened by their hope to promote biotechnological research and weakened by their fear to increase public criticism.

This study revisits the cognitive mediation model in the context of nanotechnology by examining perceived familiarity as a separate outcome variable in addition to factual knowledge. The results showed that elaboration was positively associated with both factual knowledge and perceived familiarity, while interpersonal discussions about science was only associated with familiarity. This study also showed that traditional and new media platforms have different effects on individuals’ information processing, such that attention to science newspaper and science television programs were associated with elaboration while media attention across all platforms were associated with interpersonal discussions. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

The current investigation explored the interplay among such news cues as type of source, type of news frame, and language complexity on attitudes and behavioral intentions toward self-driving technologies (SDTs) via two experiments. In study 1, a 2 (type of source: specialist vs. generalist) x2 (type of frame: pro-SDT vs. anti-SDT) factorial design revealed that a pro-SDT news frame elicited positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward SDTs. Study 2 attempted to shed further light on these findings by including a third news cue—language complexity (simple vs. complex) in a 2 (type of source) x 2 (type of frame) x2 (complexity of language) factorial design. Results revealed that across all conditions, language complexity added to the perceived credibility of the media, but reduced message memory. In addition, a three-way interaction showed that a pro-SDT message employing simple language and emanating from a specialist source was most effective in encouraging desire to experience SDTs. Theoretical, applied, and policy implications are discussed.",Advances in the Study of Science Communication,Mass Communication
2016-1510,2016,Paper Session,"Friends in Books: Figure Attributes, Reading Experience, and Their Influence on Parasocial Relationships and Romances",2,"Although research has been conducted on parasocial relationships (PSR) for nearly 60 years across multiple media contexts, it has never been examined in books. This study investigated PSR with book figures, focusing on coherence between different dimensions of reception and PSR, especially parasocial romance (PSROM). A sample of 493 adult readers completed an online survey, including questions about their reading experience, their favorite book figure, and that figure’s attractiveness and similarity to them. The results indicated that ease of cognitive access had an effect on PSR that was mediated by reading pleasure and the experience of presence, while personal relevance mediated the effect of degree of reality on PSR. Perceived similarity, as well as physical and character attractiveness, conclusively influenced PSR; in contrast, for PSROM only physical attractiveness had a direct influence on relationship intensity.",Advances in the Study of Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1511,2016,Paper Session,"Generation Me in the Spotlight: Linking Reality TV to Narcissism, Materialism, and Entitlement",2,"Today’s youth, the Generation Me, is deemed narcissistic, materialistic, and entitled. Individuality has become an important value in child rearing and is cultivated in the media – especially within the reality TV genre. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adolescents’ and emerging adults’ preference for MTV reality shows fosters narcissism, materialism, and entitlement. To this end, an online questionnaire on television use, possessions, and happiness was administered to a sample of 527 15- to 21-year-olds. Our findings indicate that the more reality TV adolescents view, the more narcissistic, materialistic, and entitled they are. No such patterns were found for emerging adults. We presume adolescents’ idolization of reality TV celebrities may cause them to mimic their behaviors. Future research should indicate whether teaching adolescents about the scripts in reality TV decreases worship of reality TV celebrities and, subsequently, reality TV’s effect on adolescents’ beliefs and values.",Advances in the Study of Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1512,2016,Paper Session,Quality TV and Social Distinction: An Experiment on How Quality TV Series Distinguish Their Users,4,"This paper addresses the question whether quality TV series as a cultural activity have the potential for social distinction. We understand quality TV as a culturally bound, discursive construct that functions as a meta-genre with implications for selection, experience, and possible effects, mainly symbolic ones. To address our research question we draw on Bourdieu’s theory of distinction arguing that taste is related to social position. Social position, in turn, depends on capital resources. We assume that the demonstrated preference for a specific cultural taste functions as a distinctive sign in general and as a sign of distinction within an adept group. These assumptions were tested via a 3x1 experiment with between subject design plus control group (N = 389). We found that favoring quality TV offers the profit of distinction, especially within a certain group of connoisseurs. Implications are discussed with regard to the theory and the object of investigation.",Advances in the Study of Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1513,2016,Paper Session,"“Glued to the Tube”: The Interplay Between Self-Control, Evening Television Viewing, and Bedtime Procrastination",2,"Prior literature has implicated media use as a risk factor for sleep displacement, but studies on the underlying mechanisms are largely absent in the literature. Recent work on bedtime procrastination, which also entails bedtime delay and shorter sleep duration, has identified self-control as an explanatory mechanism, but has not examined how electronic media use plays into this process. This study aims to integrate two strands of research by examining the interplay between self-control, evening television viewing and bedtime procrastination. Findings demonstrate direct relationships between all television viewing outcomes and bedtime procrastination. Of seven possible indirect paths between self-control and bedtime procrastination through three television viewing outcomes, only evening television viewing did not mediate the relationship. Finally, a stronger television viewing habit may help to avoid bedtime procrastination. Results support the hypothesis that self-control is a central mechanism in explaining the association of television viewing and bedtime procrastination.",Advances in the Study of Entertainment Media,Mass Communication
2016-1514,2016,Paper Session,"Detachment From Surveillance Needs: Effects of ‘News Finds Me’ Perception on Political knowledge, Interest, and Voting",2,"The ubiquity of social networks, news apps, internet access, and cable television news, might lead individuals to believe that they no longer need to actively seek information. Instead, this environment can stimulate the perception that the ‘news will find me’ anyway (NFM). This study examines the effects of the NFM perception on pro-democratic indicators. Political knowledge, political interest, and electoral participation have long been considered prerequisites of a well-functioning democracy. This study tests how the NFM perception influences these benchmarks of the political realm. Drawing on a nationally representative, two-wave panel survey from the U.S., this study finds that the NFM perception is negatively associated with both political knowledge and political interest in time. NFM has no direct impact on voting, but rather an indirect, negative impact through political interest and knowledge. The findings shed light on the ability of information networks to adequately inform and engage the public.",Political Information and News Exposure in Election Time,Political Communication

Taken together, our findings revealed statistically significant two-way interaction effects of regulatory focus and message frames on all dependent measures, including attitude toward ads, message preference and voting intention; however, neither regulatory focus nor message frames exhibited primary effects on those dependent variables. Further, issue involvement was found to have a statistically significant main effect on dependent measures, which negated our expectation of both its interaction effect with message frames and its moderating role between regulatory focus and message frames.",Political Information and News Exposure in Election Time,Political Communication
2016-1516,2016,Paper Session,Opportunity Structures for Selective Exposure: Investigating Selective Exposure and Learning in Swedish Election Campaigns,3,"The transition from low choice to high-choice media environments has raised new concerns about selective exposure. In this context, two types of selective media exposure are relevant. One is selectivity based on political ideological preferences and the other is selectivity based on political interest. Evidence for both has been found primarily in an American context, while there is less research on selective exposure in European contexts. Against this background, this study investigates both types of selective exposure in relation to televised party leader interviews in Sweden. Based on panel survey data, the findings show that selective exposure based on political interest is substantially more important than selective exposure based on ideological preferences in explaining exposure to party-leader interviews. To substantiate this finding the results are replicated with partisan learning as the dependent variable.",Political Information and News Exposure in Election Time,Political Communication
2016-1517,2016,Paper Session,Political Information for Closed Minds: Effects of the Need for Cognitive Closure on Political Interest and News Consumption,2,"Political information is a key ingredient of healthy democratic life, and one that in recent years has increasingly been studied from a personality perspective. Most studies in this domain have examined effects of basic dispositional traits (the Big Five) on citizens’ consumption of political information. In this paper, we step beyond this broad approach and examine the effect of a more directly relevant dispositional construct, the need for cognitive closure (NFC), on citizens’ political interest and news consumption. Using a new measure of NFC in two national surveys in Germany (2012) and Sweden (2014), we demonstrate that NFC has a strong and cross-nationally robust negative effect on people’s interest in politics which, in turn, depresses their overall consumption of political information. We also find that NFC has more strongly negative effects on the use of cognitively demanding media channels (online media and printed non-tabloid newspapers), while it has little or even positive consequences for the use of less cognitively demanding sources of political information (television, tabloid newspapers).",Political Information and News Exposure in Election Time,Political Communication

The study analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data collected through a survey and focus group interviews. Results from the analyses of the two different sets of data indicated that people with physical disabilities viewed smart devices as a necessity rather than a lifestyle choice, and intended to continue use of smart devices mainly for practical purposes—e.g., information-seeking, emergency contact, financial support—rather than for entertainment or social purposes. Particularly, results from the focus group interviews suggested that the sense of autonomy obtained through smart device use was an important motivation for use in this specific group, suggesting that smart devices play a crucial role in elevating the quality of life of disabled persons. These findings primarily indicate the necessity to further encourage use of smart devices among the disabled as well as to understand new media use in the context of its users.",Use of Mobile Services in Different Contexts (High-Density),Mobile Communication

The qualitative methodology of grounded theory was selected to understand on the basis of interviews with in total 42 participants used functions, changes in visual perception, communication patterns, and the overall experience of this kind of human-computer interaction. A quantitative media diary was asked to be kept in parallel.

2016-1520,2016,Paper Session,Mobile Phones for Coordination in Violent Conflict,2,"The arrival of mobile phones has influenced the way human actors to interact in everyday life, through the creation of space for both mediated and face-to-face communication. A large body of literature on mobile communication and coordination has focused on daily activities. This research aims to expand the focus by investigating the use of mobile phones for coordination in the violent conflict in Ambon, Indonesia. Using interviews and observations, this research finds that those actors involved in information coordination utilized SMS, mobile Facebook groups and Blackberry Messenger (BBM) for sharing conflict-related information. These platforms served as a hub for coordination, whereas face-to-face communication was the input for the mediated communication. Although both communication modes complemented each other, a substantial use of mobile phones for coordination was apparent during the violence. Exchanging mobile numbers started the mobile coordination, the numbers shifted from a technological artifact to an embodiment of social capital. The actors reproduced a closed coordination network that resulted in bonding and bridging social capital. Rather than maximizing bonding social capital for creating exclusiveness, the coordination actors encouraged bridging social capital by sharing information to non-members of the network.",Use of Mobile Services in Different Contexts (High-Density),Mobile Communication

Inayan loosely refers to the community’s don’ts. The phrase “ay, inayan!” is culturally thick, invoking all of the tribe’s ancestral values and history.
Ethnographic data from three Igorot villages show how their indigenous code inayan permeates their mobile phone use, from simple “Do not bring your mobile phones on the table” to more morally imposing “Do not use your mobile phone to philander”. This concept of inayan remains integral to the Igorot culture although elders account that the younger generations have a somewhat shallower understanding and therefore a lesser sense of accountability to the code.

It examines the uses and gratifications derived from the mobile phones used by migrant parents to communicate with the children they leave behind. Data were gathered from a sample of 378 migrant workers who worked in factories in southern China. The results showed that migrant workers used their mobile phones to assist in distance parenting. They were motivated by the desire for instantaneous communication (i.e., immediate access and reassurance), online transactions, affection, mobility, relaxation, and information. The demographical results showed that the migrant workers tended to communicate with their older male children via calls and text messaging, whereas they tended to use audiovisual interaction to communication with their female children. When migrant parents called, texted, or interacted with their children via audiovisual functions, they were motivated by the need for affection and relaxation. The study found that in predicting the perceived quality of their involvement, the significant motives of the migrant workers for using their mobile phones were the ability to parent the children they had left behind through instantaneous communication, the ability to show affection, and the ability to conduct online transactions. The theoretical and practical implications of the results of the study are discussed.",Use of Mobile Services in Different Contexts (High-Density),Mobile Communication

Ethnographic research in a fruit can factory in Paotai Economic Development Zone, Wafangdian, China between July and August, 2015, with thirty five rural-urban female migrant workers as respondents, illustrates that mobile phone use can either facilitate these workers to display agency to transform patriarchy, or expose them further to patriarchal oppression and restriction, thus hindering their agency display.

2016-1525,2016,Paper Session,Classifying Social Media Audience Management Strategies Through Writers’ Room Twitter Accounts,1,"Since television-related Twitter use has become a significant contemporary audience practice, it is unsurprising that television producers often use the social media technology to foster interactivity with audiences (Johnson, 2007). But like other forms of industrial audience engagement, Twitter interactions are easily deployed to demarcate boundaries around appropriate participation (Chin & Hills, 2008). This study investigates the television Twitter practice of a show’s writing staff engaging with fans collectively via a writers’ room Twitter account. Using self-presentation and fan management strategies similar to those employed by traditional celebrities, these accounts interpellate particular versions of fan subjectivity, producing and policing appropriate forms of fan identity. Though the ideal fan hailed by these accounts is not uniform, a number of consistent and clearly identifiable strategies of self-presentation and engagement, designed to produce particular forms of fandom emerge across accounts.

While during his 2008 campaign Romney talked openly about being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in 2012 he was reticent to discuss it. Political analysts and journalists alike nevertheless framed both campaigns in terms of his religion. However, in order to fully understand the differences between these two campaigns it is important to examine popular culture alongside political discourse. I argue that the proliferation of diverse representations of Mormonism from 2008-2012 affected the ability of the public to seriously consider a Mormon candidate for president. I challenge the binary separation of political and cultural public spheres, suggesting that both political discourse as well as cultural representations play a role in shaping public attitudes.

Findings of a summative content analysis among college students from a Southwest university suggest that ethnicity is salient for audiences when they address stereotypical ingroup content, but generally, media figures are evaluated on interpersonal qualities (e.g., trustworthiness, emphatic, attentive, pleasantness) away from ethno-centric traits. Such findings continue speak about the marginalized treatment of ethno-racial minorities in the media – particularly television and film, but more so, they shed light into the parasocial engagement process where media enjoyment is dependent on personal identities more so than social modes of identification with media figures. When audiences do incorporate empathetic social identities in their media engagement with media figures, it is more likely to happen through gender subjectivities, which women tended to make.",Four Square Pegs: Understanding Popular Communication,Popular Communication

This research examined the e-commerce crisis initiation and management by analyzing negative customer reviews and corresponding seller responding strategies at Taobao.com, the biggest consumer-to-consumer e-commerce site in the world. The results indicated that negative customer reviews were overwhelmingly competence-based, one-side accusations with little evidences but a medium-to-high level of extremity, customers and sellers had strong disagreements about the identification of crisis situations, and sellers tended to take crisis response strategies based on the crisis situations identified by themselves rather than by consumers.

On the basis of cognitive appraisal theory, the current study assumes that social norms and visual irony amid an online firestorm will serve as two important sources of cognitive appraisal of emotion for the situation. Then the emotion arising from the situation will guide subsequent coping behaviors such as boycott intentions. To test a paracrisis development model, an online experiment was conducted simulating a real-world paracrisis situation in which a user’s Facebook commentary regarding a company’s billboard ad sparked a social media outcry.

Using the method of iconographic tracking, the author specifically follows Shepard Fairey’s now iconic Obama Hope image, which became the national emblem for the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign due to its prominent role in helping Barack Obama become the first African American president of the United States. In tracing how this single image communicated power in diverse ways, the author identifies how the strategies of leveraging social networks, generating metaculture, stimulating affective contagion, and designing for rhetorical velocity can help boost an activist campaign’s success. The author concludes by exploring how collaborative efforts between scholars and community activists can create productive opportunities for making visual communication scholarship more prominent and meaningful in local and global communities.","Models, Tools, and Methods for Visual Communication Research",Visual Communication Studies

In the light of presumably increased public exposure to and awareness of a series of threats to privacy, in particular the Heartbleed security bug, the European ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling and public debate and the Edward Snowden revelations on mass surveillance, this paper aims at investigating users’ awareness of privacy violations and threats online and their ways of negotiating their internet use, in particular of social networking sites. Drawing on the concept of legal consciousness, this paper investigates through focus group interviews the ways in which social media users respond to privacy and security breaches and what role their understanding of privacy laws and policies (or lack thereof) might play in their strategies of negotiation. Thereby, the paper’s findings are threefold: first, privacy is understood almost universally as a matter of controlling one’s own data, including information disclosure even to friends, and is strongly connected to issues about personal autonomy. Second, the paper finds that there coexists a form of resignation as to control over private data with a recognised need to protect one’s private data, yet respondents describe conscious attempts i.e. tactics to circumvent systems of monitoring or violation of privacy. Third, the paper finds that despite widespread coverage of privacy legal issues in the press, respondents’ concerns about and engagement in ‘self-protecting’ tactics derive largely from being personally affected by violations of law and privacy.",Intervention and Privacy in Online Behaviour,Communication Law & Policy

The call to balance suggests that something is skewed, the scale is tipped to far to one side or another; something is out of whack. To interrogate this claim, this paper focuses on two questions: what is the role of the internet in radicalizing individuals and does the internet provide the know-how for those individuals to make improvised weapons. After providing a brief overview of internet radicalization this paper proceeds by examining three dimensions of the data on homegrown terrorism: the quality/nature of the data, the theories into which this data is inputted, and how particular government conduct affects the data that is available for us to think through the problem of internet radicalization. Ultimately, this paper shows that the first concern listed above – that of a mutable enemy lurking within America’s borders – is intimately tied to policy debates, and marks the limits of effectively using data to inform policy debates concerning the internet and terrorism.",Intervention and Privacy in Online Behaviour,Communication Law & Policy

While these studies have made commendable progress in outlining the conditions and consequences of negative campaigning, they have typically disregarded the complex interdependencies of multi-actor communication environments. To rectify this shortcoming, the present paper focuses on network-structural determinants of the negative campaigning behaviors. We examine patterns of candidate communication during the 2013 Austrian federal election, relying on an extensive manual coding of the mediated campaign communication. Employing Exponential Random Graph Models to investigate the targets of negative campaigning and the individual incentives to partake in such communication behavior, we find that – above and beyond common determinants of negative campaigning outlined in previous literature – indicators of network structure are important predictors of campaign communication. This suggests that network models are crucial for accurately representing patterns of communication in multi-party systems.",Negative Campaigns and Campaign Negativity,Political Communication
2016-1543,2016,Paper Session,Disproportionality in Media Representations of Campaign Negativity,3,"This study explores mediated representations of campaign communication. Actors in multi-party systems are faced with a complex communication environment that enables them to engage with different actors on various issues. One crucial aspect of such engagement is the element of negativity – voicing criticisms of other actors' policy proposals. This contribution suggests that campaign negativity is not faithfully represented by media organizations. Instead, media systematically exaggerate patterns of negativity, specifically attacks that target or originate from issue owners. We analyze a broad sample of news content from the 2013 Austrian national election with Exponential Random Graph Network Models to capture the complexities of campaign negativity in multi-party system communication. To control for non-mediated campaign negativity we incorporate information on actual attack patterns in party press releases. The results show that issue owners are much more likely to be featured as attackers and targets in owned policy domains.",Negative Campaigns and Campaign Negativity,Political Communication
2016-1544,2016,Paper Session,"The Impact of Advocacy, Contrast, and Attacks in Political Advertising and News Coverage on Political Efficacy: Evidence From a Panel Study in a Direct-Democratic Campaign",4,"The present study simultaneously investigates the impact of negative political advertising and news media coverage in a political campaign on political efficacy. Specifically, the impact of advocacy appeals, contrastive messages, and plain attacks on political opponents or their program is examined. Advocacy appeals was the most widely used strategy in the news and in ads to communicate in the present campaign. Attacks and contrast appeared only in news stories and even there their prevalence was low. Based on a combination of a news and advertising content analysis and a two-wave panel survey in the context of a political campaign it is shown that frequency of exposure to attacks in news coverage decreases political efficacy in the public. Additionally, frequent exposure to contrastive messages in the news increases perceived responsiveness of political actors among the audience. Finally, advocacy appeals in political advertising, but not in news media coverage, enhanced political efficacy.",Negative Campaigns and Campaign Negativity,Political Communication
2016-1545,2016,Paper Session,Tweeting the Attack: Predicting Gubernatorial Candidate Attack Messaging and its Spread,5,"Political campaign scholars have long been concerned about the nature and effects of the tone of messaging by political campaigns. Although much research has examined the nature and effects of advocacy and attack advertisements, more research is needed to understand attack messaging on Twitter. We conducted a systematic content analysis of Twitter messages by the major and viable minor party candidates that ran for governor in 2014 in the United States. We examine the tone of messages and variables that relate to tone (party, incumbency, competitiveness, Twitter use by state, candidate account popularity), and also the relationship between tone of message and degree of spread through retweeting. Analysis suggests that challengers are significantly more likely to attack, there are partisan differences in terms of posting attack tweets, and that incumbents attack messages are more likely to spread than advocacy messages. Implications of the results are detailed.",Negative Campaigns and Campaign Negativity,Political Communication

However, little is known about the actual content of peer support, partly due to limitations inherent to survey, interview or focus group research. The current study therefore examined online peer support sought and provided with regard to cyberbullying, by performing thematic analysis of cyberbullying message threads in two online support group fora for adolescents. Applying Tardy’s (1985) social support framework, including social support categorisations by House (1981), we found that peer support sought and provided involved informational support on coping strategies, and appraisal support on (cyber)bullying as a phenomenon, on the actors involved and on the victim’s specific (cyber)bullying situation. In addition, online fora members provided victims with various subtypes of emotional support. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of different types of peer support, particularly regarding advised coping strategies.",Online Harassment and Bullying,Children Adolescents and the Media

We hypothesized that negatively regulating feelings of victimization-based anger and frustration would increase the effect of anger on cyberbullying behavior. In addition, we expected that positively regulating these emotions would result in a decrease in the effect of anger on cyberbullying behavior. These hypotheses were tested using longitudinal data (N = 1005; three waves during one school year). Using Structural Equation Modeling, the results showed that applying negative emotion regulation increased the effect of anger on cyberbullying at waves 1 and 2, but not across waves. Furthermore, positive emotion regulation did not decrease the effect of anger on cyberbullying behavior. This study indicates that discouraging adolescents to negatively regulate their anger might result in a decrease in cyberbullying rates, at least in the short run.",Online Harassment and Bullying,Children Adolescents and the Media

In the digital age, adolescents engage in online social interaction beyond the traditional physical boundaries of families, neighbourhoods and schools. This study concerns how young people negotiate their social interaction and how it is related to their experiences of bullying and cyberbullying. Based on a comparative face-to-face survey of adolescents (12 to 15 year-olds) in Korea (N=520) and Australia (N=401), this study examines how young people in the two countries experience and perceive of their friendship networks and experiences of cyberbullying. We test how online and offline connections to friendship networks are related to various cyberbullying experiences as victims and perpetrators. Results reveal cultural differences in the impact of friendship networks on bullying and cyberbullying. In general, online and offline networks are more effective at predicting bullying and cyberbullying experiences in Korea than in Australia. In particular, the number of friends in cliques was positively related to victimisation in both online and face-to-face settings.",Online Harassment and Bullying,Children Adolescents and the Media

A two-wave panel study with a 6-month time interval was conducted among a sample of 1,412 adolescents aged 10-13. Cross-lagged panel analysis was used to investigate relationships over time between being a bystander of cyberbullying, empathy, and attitude, while taking into account involvement in cyberbullying as a victim or a perpetrator. The results indicate a negative relationship between standing by and empathy. Exposure to cyberbullying as a bystander at Time1 predicted subsequent lower levels of empathic responsiveness at Time2. The attitude at Time2 was not influenced by seeing more cyberbullying acts at Time1.

However, many studies still lean on conventional, threshold-based classification approaches that often underestimate the connection between the groups. In the present study, latent transition analysis (LTA) using a three-wave panel survey among high school pupils aged 12 to 15 years (n = 1802; M = 13.3 years) indicated five distinct involvement patterns. Apart from a large group of noninvolved pupils (T1 = 81%; T2 = 73%; T3 = 70%), there were four different moderately to heavily involved cyberbullying classes, all characterized by particular patterns of perpetration and victimization. We also found two content-specific forms of cyberbullying: gossiping and insulting.

Moreover, since online prosocial and antisocial behavior have rarely been assessed simultaneously, it is hard to obtain a balanced view of adolescents’ online behavior. Therefore, in this study, we examined both dimensions of online social behavior and how these are related to adolescents’ experienced emotions and their uses of digital media. Findings indicated that participants performed and received more prosocial than antisocial behavior online. Experiencing negative as well as positive emotions was related to online social behavior, and these associations were mediated by adolescents’ use of social and audiovisual media, but not by gaming or functional internet use. The social sharing of emotions and mood management theory are used to discuss the results.",Online Harassment and Bullying,Children Adolescents and the Media

The lack of depth in female characters has long been the norm (Dickerman, Christiansen & Kerl-McClain, 2008), however, an increasing number of female protagonists are headlining games. This study used feminist theory and narrative theory to examine depictions of four female protagonists in four 2013 Game of the Year digital games: The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider and Beyond: Two Souls. Studying these media depictions provides context for how women’s stories are recorded in society. Although the depictions of women in games are improving, change is incremental.

Based on prior work in mass media research, this study examined the inclination to play characters of both genders in a third person action game. The results of an online survey with 245 respondents strongly suggested that the actual gender of the game character per se might not necessarily be indicative of its appeal to players, but rather players’ perceptions of the character’s gendered attributes, that is, how masculine or feminine they perceive the respective character. Findings prompt further research on perceptual and cognitive determinants of characters’ appeal for potentially shedding light on the gender gap in video game usage.",Beyond Lora: Female Gender in Games,Game Studies

This research considered the historical context that shaped regional game design approaches as well as the ways in which ideologies of femininity in Eastern and Western cultures influence character design. Additionally, popular female archetypes within Japanese and U.S. media, such as kawaii (cute girl) and femme fatale tropes, are considered to provide qualities from which to make predictions about playable female protagonists in video games. Playable female characters in video games developed by U.S. firms in the data set were more likely to violent, sexualized, and physically capable than their Japanese counterparts. Female protagonists in Japanese games were more frequently depicted as virginal in appearance (e.g. as princess-like or as a schoolgirl).

2016-1557,2016,Paper Session,Play Mechanics of Sexy Female Characters in Video Games,1,"Video games are often criticized for their depictions of female characters. As graphics have gotten more sophistication, character models have grown more detailed, and developers have pushed the boundaries of sexualization. While previous research has shown that female characters are sexualized at far greater rates than males, researchers have not focused as much on how sexualized female characters actually play. This paper studied the game mechanics behind popular, sexy female characters to uncover a more holistic view of how these characters operate in their game worlds. This project analyzes the appearance, outfits, and movement of female characters, character attributes, and ways in which games both empower and disempower female characters and the player. By taking the focus off appearance and putting it on game mechanics, this perspective reveals that female characters are more nuanced and empowering than they are often given credit for.

A nuanced and detailed examination of how gender identity and threatening experiences tap into their play practices has hitherto been lacking however. The present study fills this gap by examining how female players express a gamer identity and how this relates to perceptions of threat and stigmatization. Based on a large-scale survey directed at female players, a statistical model is specified taking into account how respondents attribute a gamer label to their self-concept. Results suggest that the cognitive, evaluative, and affective dimensions of female identity predict gamer identification in distinct ways. Moreover, rather surprising, perceptions of stereotype threat and stigma consciousness are positively related to women’s gamer identification. An opposite relation is however observed for women’s awareness of being stigmatized by male players.",Beyond Lora: Female Gender in Games,Game Studies

Contrary to the existing assertions, we find that the media are not necessarily losing. On average, from 1993 to 2013, the success rate of news media in Chinese defamation courts was 42%, and this rate has been increasing since 2005. We also find that government officials, and party organs had consistent advantages in court, while ordinary plaintiffs, magazines and websites had less success. The medium of the media (i.e. print, broadcast, Internet) makes a difference, as do the government policies governing the media. In addition, local protectionism exists, but it is less rampant than expected.

President Vladimir Putin’s grip on Russian media has tightened in the last few years. The road to democratisation has not only been thorny but also appears to have taken a turn for the worse. In addition to the physical threats and attacks, journalists in Russia experience a range of pressures from the state - overt and covert practices of censorship, persecution and harassment of journalists who voice alternative views, and a great degree of self-censorship. Freedom House’s most recent report states that “Russia’s occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine helped to drive an increase in propagandistic content in the Russian news media and tighter restrictions on dissenting views in 2014.” Most Russian news media do not just support the government “with biased news” but they are also increasingly “participating in an ‘information war’ with its perceived adversaries” both at home and abroad. This paper will outline the most commonly used tactics by Russian authorities as well as the coping strategies adopted by journalists. It will present the findings of a semi-ethnographic study of Russia’s most influential “independent” national news outlets – Novaya Gazeta, Radio Echo of Moscow and Radio Free Europe/Liberty.

2016-1561,2016,Paper Session,Understanding News Media Censorship in China,1,"This study investigates the most frequently censored news in China. Existing studies show that the Chinese propaganda authorities are most likely to censor news considered harmful to the legitimacy of the central state yet allow news with negative consequences for local levels of government to be published. A content analysis of official propaganda notices (n = 728) reveals that the propaganda authorities indeed engage in selective news censorship. The selective censorship practice also reveals a structural difference: The central propaganda authority focuses more on news challenging the legitimate ruling of the Communist Party, including news related to social stability and the image of the central state, whereas local propaganda authorities focus more on news harmful to the image of the local levels of government. The central authority is found to be more tolerant than its local counterparts, as it allows news media to report a considerable amount of news that have negative consequences for local levels of government – news which, on the other hand, is heavily censored by the local propaganda authorities.",Journalism in Authoritarian and Postconflict Societies,Journalism Studies

In order to do so, the researcher will analyse twenty-five semi-structured interviews with Cuban media workers and academics in order to understand the way socio-economic, diplomatic and technological changes are affecting the articulation of popular and journalistic demands. The paper draws on Ernesto Laclau’s (2005) conceptualisation of populism as a specific articulation of the Cuban pure people, vis-à-vis ‘them’, an external enemy, through media discourse. This paper argues that the Cuban Revolution has become ‘an empty signifier’ in Laclaunian terms, able to integrate disperse popular demands into a whole, while remaining fluctuating. The two main mechanisms of legitimisation of the Revolution have been the paradigm of ‘unity’ and the paradigm of ‘society under siege’, constructed and articulated through the Party hegemonic control of the news media. However, the data indicates a progressive erosion of these paradigms in the mind of Cuban revolutionary journalists, bloggers and media scholars. According to the interviews, media actors are increasingly organising their demands outside of state-controlled channels, asking for a change of focus from the external to the internal threats of the Revolution, and defending the media visibility of citizens’ plurality of views about a post-embargo, post-Castro Cuba.",Journalism in Authoritarian and Postconflict Societies,Journalism Studies

The findings from this study show that citizens participate in the daily work of the media through commentaries and by serving as news sources. However, citizens have not yet had a tangible impact on the functioning of the two media where self-censorship and gatekeeping are widely practiced. Democratization of these radio stations appears to be more theoretical rather than an established practice.

Building upon the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study investigates if additional normative factors and confidence in one’s safe driving ability can help enhance the theory’s ability to predict the intention to send, read or initiate text messages behind the wheel. The findings suggest that moral norm and confidence in one’s safe driving ability are the only two factors that consistently predict the intention to engage with text-related cellphone use while driving. The implications of these findings for developing interventions against texting and driving, one of the most pressing public health issues of our time, are subsequently discussed.","Mobile Health Communication: Health Apps, Activity Tracking, Texting, Online",Health Communication

Their patterns of language used were assessed using LIWC, a text analysis software. A logistic regression model was built to predict likelihood of engaging in risky drinking within a year based on language use in the discussion board, while controlling for baseline characteristics and utilization of the mobile system. Results show that whereas baseline characteristics and system use explained little variance in relapse, a small number of linguistic features including swearing and cognitive mechanism words contributed over two thirds of explained variance. The model achieved 84% accuracy in classifying relapse. As online communication expands, models that leverage user-submitted text toward predicting relapse will be increasingly scalable.","Mobile Health Communication: Health Apps, Activity Tracking, Texting, Online",Health Communication

Research on various issues related to this phenomenon has been conducted in diverse academic disciplines. Nevertheless, such research is still in the burgeoning stage. Therefore, this study explored the cross-cultural variations in the adoption of diet/fitness apps as a specific category of health apps, based on the technology acceptance model (TAM).
Purpose: Despite significant previous research on health apps, few studies have focused on the post-adoption behaviors of using these technologies. To address and fill the gaps in health app research, this study has developed and tested a model to explain the micro-mechanism that determines the continuance intention to use health apps, theoretically relying on the post-acceptance model (PAM) and the technology acceptance model (TAM).
Methods: A sample consisting of 343 Korean adults who were currently using health apps on smartphones participated in an online survey. A path analysis was conducted to test the proposed model composed of the main factors from PAM and TAM.
Results: The results from the path analysis indicated that the following perceptual and emotional factors—perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, confirmation, and satisfaction—were significantly associated with the continuance intention to use health apps on smartphones.","Mobile Health Communication: Health Apps, Activity Tracking, Texting, Online",Health Communication

2016-1568,2016,Paper Session,“Social Networkout”: Boosting Physical Exercise Through Social Features of Wearable Fitness Trackers,3,"Despite widespread understanding of the benefits of physical activity, many adults in the United States do not meet recommended exercise guidelines. Burgeoning technologies, specifically wearable fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Jawbone), bring new opportunities to influence physical activity by encouraging users to share physical activity data and compete against their peers. However, little is known about the psychosocial processes that mediate the relationship between the use of wearable fitness trackers and intention to exercise. In this study, we extend the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) by incorporating two communicative aspects of wearable fitness devices: social sharing and social competing. Drawing upon surveys among office employees, we found attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control mediate the relationship between social sharing and competing and intention to exercise. The results indicate communication mechanisms tied to sharing and competing exercise data through wearable fitness devices significantly influence an individual’s intention to engage in exercise.","Mobile Health Communication: Health Apps, Activity Tracking, Texting, Online",Health Communication

Yet the ramifications of Facebook use in this population remain understudied. Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, this study examines Facebook usage divides between younger (< 65) and older adults (65+), as well as the social benefits associated with the latter’s Facebook use. Findings show older users have different network structures, but the frequency of their visits and engagement in Facebook Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (FRMB) do not significantly differ from those of younger users (n = 2003). Moreover, our results suggest that among older users (n = 98) the number of “actual” friends on Facebook and FRMB positively predict perceived support, while FRMB contributes to perceptions of access to useful information. Overall, the study highlights unique usage patterns and social benefits associated with Facebook use among older adults. As such, its findings provide insights for the future design of technological interventions to help older adults better access social benefits associated with SNS use.","Facebook Studies: Effects, Meanings, and Prominence",Communication and Technology
2016-1570,2016,Paper Session,The Algorithmic Imaginary: Exploring the Ordinary Affects of the Facebook Algorithm,1,"This paper reflects the kinds of situations and spaces where people and algorithms meet. In what situations do people become aware of algorithms? How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people’s use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this paper examines people’s personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this paper develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary - ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function - is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.","Facebook Studies: Effects, Meanings, and Prominence",Communication and Technology

2016-1574,2016,Paper Session,Implementing Communication Infrastructure Theory-Based Strategies in Community Health Access Interventions: Lessons Learned From Two Projects,2,"Communication infrastructure theory (CIT) offers a framework for conducting community-based health communication interventions. Communities’ communication infrastructures consist of micro- (e.g., residents) and meso- (e.g., community-based organizations and healthcare providers; local media) storytelling actors that are enabled or constrained by the communication action context. This paper examines two community-based health interventions that used strategies proposed by previous CIT-based research to address health access disparities. Each project diagnosed and strengthened the respective community’s storytelling network; identified, utilized and, as necessary, created communication hot spots and comfort zones; and explored the respective fields of health action. Lessons learned about the applicability of communication infrastructure theory to health interventions in different contexts (e.g., different sized cities/communities) are offered.",Cultural and Community Variables in Health Communication Studies,Health Communication

Whereas much of the current literature has been restricted to individual-level concerns, the current study provides longitudinal evidence for behavioral outcomes in the context of the California drought, advancing our theoretical knowledge regarding the underlying processes that lead self-affirmed individuals to address societal risks and collective concerns. The results of a three-wave experimental study (N = 91) indicated that relative to nonaffirmed counterparts, self-affirmed participants reported on higher levels of support for water conservation policies, as well as on reduction of water use that endured for 30 days following the self-affirming manipulation. In both cases, the effects were mediated by collective-efficacy but not by self-efficacy.

In areas where cultural identities are being negotiated, examinations of how such identities relate to health behaviors and possible barriers can be especially beneficial. This study looked at the Republic of Kazakhstan where the Kazakh cultural identity is on the rise, along with a rise in non-communicable diseases related to lifestyles. By examining the reports of patients regarding their perceived barriers to lifestyle changes, this study found patients perceiving barriers to healthy lifestyle changes as they construct their cultural identities in relation to other groups. These barriers are largely being ignored by doctors attempting to counsel these patients on necessary lifestyle changes.",Cultural and Community Variables in Health Communication Studies,Health Communication
2016-1577,2016,Paper Session,"Social Support, Social Control, and Dietary Acculturation Among Asian Immigrants Living in the United States",1,"Research has consistently shown the healthy immigrant effect: immigrants in North America are generally healthier than the native-born. This effect is clearly evidenced by the fact that immigrants’ overweight rates are significantly lower than that of the native-born. Immigrants who quickly adopt unhealthy eating patterns may lose their health advantages. Receiving adequate social support and social control from strong ties (i.e. family and friends) is an essential strategy for immigrants to monitor and regulate their dietary practices. This paper reviews the role of social support and social control in promoting healthy eating behavior among Asian immigrants living in the United States. It starts with an overview of the overweight prevalence and dietary acculturation among Asian immigrants, followed by a review of the impact of social support and social control, which are important functions of social relationships, on dietary behavior. This paper also discusses the costs associated with social support and social control as well as the limitations of applying individualistic assumptions to study the two constructs in Asian immigrants.",Cultural and Community Variables in Health Communication Studies,Health Communication

Specifically, this study aims to (1) inquire the diversity of what information HR professionals gather online by using different information seeking strategies, (2) investigate how this accounts for regular use of social media for personnel selection, and subsequently, may lead to a higher level of certainty. We furthermore (3) explore the antecedents of these information seeking behaviours to cover the organizational context and the individual factors. In an online survey with 333 HR professionals, we tested information seeking behaviour on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. The results indicate that a passive information seeking strategy is still mostly used. However, only regular use of LinkedIn was related to a higher level of certainty about the job applicant.

First, it provides an alternative to survey-oriented work by utilizing in-depth interviews and the “life history” approach (Watson & Watson-Franke, 1985) for a cross-national examination of journalism student motivations in the United States and India. Second, it draws on Bourdieu’s (1977) concept of habitus to explore not only journalism student motivations but also the origins of those motivations.

This research compares two survey data sets collected among mainland China and Hong Kong J-school students in 2008 and 2014 to investigate how journalists-to-be within different socio-political contexts perceive the role of their future profession. This study introduces the role of consonance as the sixth journalistic role perception variable besides that of interpreter, adversarial, populist mobilizer, disseminator, and culture and entertainment. The data shows that both groups of students’ perceived journalistic role of consonance, the degree of patriotism and the perception of the journalism education’s aim as for the country all declined from 2008 to 2014.

This study reveals that the two competing sets of norms struggle differently according to the changing situations of the conflicts, shaping the news discourse and the development of the social conflicts in the following pattern: (1) Objective reporting competing strategic reporting in exposing the breach. (2) Investigative reporting prevails in crystallizing the crisis. (3) Strategic reporting dominates the construction of a fair judicial redress.

In-depth interviews with 61 representatives of the three nations revealed that, in the public eye, the breaches of journalistic independence and integrity are frequent and take different forms. The participants from Serbia, Macedonia and Croatia thought that journalists from their countries often succumb to pressures from politicians, owners, and advertisers, that they receive direct bribery for positive coverage and even extort money from people; that news media are engaged in hidden advertising and journalists are engaged in nepotism. The results show astonishing similarity of public perceptions with academic and professional findings, and are discussed using the Attribution Theory in the context of audiences’ use of situational and trait characteristics in understanding journalistic ethical norms.",Global Journalistic Cultures and Practices,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-1590,2016,Paper Session,Is Journalism a Transnational Field? Asymmetric Interactions and Symbolic Domination in Online News,1,"Are all transnational exchanges ‘fielded’? This article explores the limits of the concept of transnational field by focusing on the case of journalism. At first glance, journalism might seem to be the perfect example of a transnational field. The frequency, speed, and extent of international exchanges between media outlets has increased dramatically with the development of online news, leading media scholars to develop the concept of ‘global news.’ Yet I argue that such international exchanges do not necessarily constitute a field.
Using ethnographic methods, I analyze the circulation of online news between the United States and France, two countries with strikingly different journalistic traditions. Specifically, I compare two editorial partnerships between U.S. and French websites, one linking prestigious online magazines across the Atlantic and the other connecting tabloid-oriented news sites. I find that editorial content does not circulate seamlessly between the two countries. Based on this study, the article proposes three criteria that must be met for transnational fields to exist: competition over the legitimate definition of the field, reciprocal field effects, and the existence of common stakes. More broadly, the article contributes to defining the limits of the concept of ‘transnational field’ for the study of international exchanges.",Global Journalistic Cultures and Practices,Global Communication and Social Change
2016-1591,2016,Paper Session,Making Brands Symbolic: How Self-Construal Affects Brand Endorsements on Social Media,4,"Recent research increasingly highlights that consumers engage in online brand endorsements (e.g., Facebook likes) to signal their identity, but has failed to explain why different consumers use this type of signaling to differing degrees. This paper addresses this gap by looking at a culturally constructed individual difference variable, namely self-construal. Self-construal, which can be independent or interdependent, refers to the extent that people define themselves in terms of the relations they have with others. In four studies, this research shows that consumers’ self-construal is related to their intention to endorse brands online. In particular, high levels of interdependent self-construal positively affect consumers’ intention to endorse brands online (studies 1A & 1B). This effect is mediated by an increased perception of brands’ symbolic value (study 2). Moreover, this positivity bias towards symbolic brand cues is conditional upon consumers’ brand attitude (study 3). These findings demonstrate that consumers’ identity plays a central role in their brand perception and brand-related social media use.",Advances in the Study of Advertising and Branding,Mass Communication

This study investigates conditions under which explicit persuasive intent may not cause resistance to persuasion. Specifically, the study examines the interplay between persuasive intent and regulatory-framed messages, as well as brand attachment in a marketing communication context. The results show that the negative impact of explicit persuasive intent is less pronounced in promotion-focused than prevention-focused messages. When persuasive intent is explicit, participants in the promotion-focused condition report higher persuasiveness and brand evaluations while those in the prevention-focused condition show resistance to persuasion. The research, however, shows somewhat limited effects for brand attachment as a moderating variable. Additional mediation analyses also reveal that the effects of persuasive intent are mediated by perceived manipulativeness of the message.",Advances in the Study of Advertising and Branding,Mass Communication

The most positive attitudinal effects appeared for male actors matching with an implicitly endorsed object (d = 1.28). The most negative effects were with female models not matched with an explicitly endorsed object (d = -1.28). Furthermore, celebrity endorsements performed worse compared to endorsements of quality seals, awards, or endorser brands. No publication bias was detected.

The Relationship Between Online Self-Disclosure and Attitudes Toward Gay Men,5,"Intergroup research has employed the contact hypothesis to examine ways of reducing prejudice toward gay men and lesbians. However, only a few studies have examined self-disclosure strategies over computer-mediated communication (CMC) despite the potential benefits CMC holds for the contact process, and how it presents a real-world platform where gay men sometimes reveal their sexual orientation to others. A controlled experiment (N = 261) was designed to test whether self-disclosure over a text-based online platform influenced attitudes among heterosexuals, and whether a direct form of such disclosure was perceived more negatively than indirect. Attitudes toward self-disclosure and relational intimacy were also measured, as were participants’ social harmony values. During a cooperative online interaction research, confederates disclosed a homosexual orientation either directly, indirectly, or not at all (control group). ANOVA models revealed no significant main effects or interactions. As a result, follow-up focus groups were conducted to understand participants’ experience.","Quantitative Inquiries: Stereotypes, Attitudes, Parasocial Relationships","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Among them were culturally-linked values related to filial piety, belief that homosexuality is a choice and empathetic concern. The frequency of interactions with gay men and lesbians was assessed, as was the quality of those interactions, as a way of testing contact theory (Allport, 1954). Results indicate that younger people tend to have less negative ATLG and express greater acceptance, and there is an inverse relationship with aspects of filial piety and belief that homosexuality is a choice. The influence of contact was significantly positive, and this was driven mainly by the quality of the interactions.","Quantitative Inquiries: Stereotypes, Attitudes, Parasocial Relationships","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

The objective of the present study was to examine the parasocial relationships (PSR) that exist between sexual minority youth and media personae. A survey of heterosexual (n = 316) and LGB adolescents (n = 104) was conducted to compare their PSR. Results suggested LGB teens were more flexible in identifying with media personae of the other sex. There was also a positive correlation between loneliness and PSR strength among LGB teens that did not exist for heterosexual youth and that challenges previous PSR studies. LGB youth also noted that they would turn to their PSR for information and guidance significantly more than heterosexual youth, who were more likely to rely on friends and family for information and guidance.","Quantitative Inquiries: Stereotypes, Attitudes, Parasocial Relationships","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

The previous study also looked at how ijime influenced social interactions outside of the classroom, how it affected the construction of self, and what could be done to decrease the number of cases of ijime in schools. The study found that gender stereotypes and notions of sexual orientation were among the reasons victims suffered from ijime (e.g., if boys are more “feminine” and girls are more “masculine”). Therefore, this follow-up study will focus explicitly on the relationship between gender stereotypes and notions of sexual orientation, and ijime at Japanese schools. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with students, as well as with school administrators and educators.","Quantitative Inquiries: Stereotypes, Attitudes, Parasocial Relationships","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Less work has examined the potential effects of AR displays on people’s perception and attitudes, particularly content that might induce negative feelings (fear, anger, etc.). This study examines how AR displays of crime information, now possible on consumer applications, might affect people’s fear, emotions, and perceptions of crime. Through a pre-post experimental design with an experimental condition (AR crime information) and a control condition (SMS crime information), we found that people in the AR condition reported higher estimates of crime, more negative emotions, and lower confidence in law enforcement. As new types of AR content emerge, experimental studies linking content, space, and experience will be increasingly important for mobile communication scholars to understand people’s spatial practices, spatial perceptions, and spatial interactions.",Visual Aspects In Mobile Media,Mobile Communication

Throughout these differences, one point remains apparent—camera phones are at the intersection of photography, digital media and the everyday. They provide playful, ambient and reflective ways to remap places and spaces across co-present platforms, contexts and subjectivities, and in doing so inevitably have emerged as the new ‘boring’ in visual culture. That is they have become the markers of our mundane everyday lives. Genres such as the selfie have become an omnipresent barometer for contemporary networked global culture (Senft and Baym 2015; Cruz and Meyer 2012) which represent new configurations between photography, digital culture and what can be called ‘kinesthetic sociability’ (Frosh 2015).

With online experiments, this study investigated how the use of digital filters influences viewers’ perceptions of temporal distance, spatial distance, realism and aesthetic appeal in photos. Results demonstrated that both black-and-white and film-style filters led people to position photos in a more distant past. Film-style and HDR filters also let people perceive the photo as taken in a more distant place. All three filters examined led people to evaluate the photo as less realistic and less of good quality. Our study suggests that digital filters may not enhance the aesthetic value in photos, but are able to construct a distance between viewers and photographs, enabling users to counter the ordinariness of their mobile photos, thus transcending their daily experiences.",Visual Aspects In Mobile Media,Mobile Communication

The results reveal that exposure to cross-cutting information on social media can motivate participation in the former type better than the latter. Moreover, the mobilizing effects of cross-cutting exposure are mediated by anger and anxiety, as suggested by affective intelligence theory and appraisal theories of emotion. The mediating effects of anxiety are also moderated by online incivility. Implications are discussed in terms of the role of social media use and cross-cutting exposure in participatory democracies.",Political Conversations Online: Disagreement and Incivility,Political Communication

In this paper we argue that there are further factors concerning discussions in comments under online newspaper articles, relating to forum design, article content and users’ issue stance, which have an effect on the salience of different identities, which we propose influence user incivility.
In order to test our hypotheses, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of user comments relating to the debate surrounding educational reform in Germany. Using multilevel binary logistic regression, we find significant effects for user anonymity, issue stance, article content, method of comment ordering, civility of previous users and users’ issue stance.",Political Conversations Online: Disagreement and Incivility,Political Communication

Since civility is viewed as one fundamental condition for an open-minded deliberation, it is necessary to ask for the consequences in a debate if the ideal is violated. The paper is therefore concerned with the effects of incivility on readers who are confronted with comments on online newspaper articles. In an online experiment, we measured the effects of incivility on attitudes towards the opposing opinion, attitude certainty, negative emotions as well as willingness to participate online and offline. The results show that incivility mainly causes detrimental effects, especially when comments do not support the reader’s opinion.

Results demonstrate the mediating functions of political ambivalence in that exposure to proattitudinal news reduces ambivalence and thereby promotes political participation, whereas exposure to counter-attitudinal news increases ambivalence and thereby discourages participation. Importantly, the effect of exposure to counter-attitudinal news on ambivalence was moderated by heterogeneity of discussion network on SNSs, such that the combination of exposure to counter-attitudinal news and to heterogeneous SNS discussion amplifies ambivalence additively, and thereby augments the tendency toward demobilization.

2016-1608,2016,Paper Session,The Politics of “Unfriending”: User Filtration in Response to Political Disagreement on Social Media,3,"This article examines exposure to political disagreement on social media and user filtration in response to it. Popular arguments suggest that social media sites prevent exposure to political disagreement either through algorithmic filtration or selective affiliation. Another popular argument says that when users are exposed to political disagreement on social media, they filter it from their feeds by “unfriending”/ “unfollowing” or “hiding” the author. We put these narratives to the test by examining (a) the relationship between social media use and exposure to political disagreement and (b) the factors that predict user filtration in response to political disagreement. Results from analysis based on a nationally representative sample of Colombian adults in urban areas show that (a) engagement with news and public affairs content on social media is positively associated with exposure to political disagreement and (b) the amount of disagreement users are exposed to is not related to user filtration in response.",Political Conversations Online: Disagreement and Incivility,Political Communication

The fundamental concern that elites will use their resources to skew the flow of information and interpretation to reinforce their position of advantage is, of course, as worthy of attention as ever. But the reliance on the traditional critiques of corporate media and the need for a beefed up regulatory regime may be counterproductive strategies.

This forward-looking focus encourages what I call industrial amnesia – a collective forgetting on the part of the technology industry about past projects and failed initiatives. In this paper, I draw on a research from a larger project on the history of the consumer privacy industry to advocate for the importance of studying failed industry actors. I argue media industries research should resist the seductive pull of the popular or new that prevails in Silicon Valley to occasionally focus on those companies that have failed. Through a brief examination of the rise, decline, and reemergence of the infomediary model, I reveal the possible interventions available to media industries research when attend to industrial failure.",Theories and Practices in Media Industry Research,Media Industry Studies
2016-1611,2016,Paper Session,"Rethinking Chinese Internet: Social History, Cultural Forms, and the Industrial Formation",1,"Current accounts of the formation of the Chinese Internet, like those on global Internet, dominantly emphasize political economic relationships that constitute technological and infrastructural developments. Very few to date have attended to the roles of technical alternatives, meanings associated with technologies, and popular enthusiasm. This essay examines vernacular online practices preceding and constituting the massive rise of commercial online video portals in the early to mid-2000s in China. It particularly focuses on online parody video making, and fansubbing as a variant of p2p network-based online piracy. It examines social energies propelling the formation of these practices, their unfolding, and the process in which these practices eventually converged with the formation of the video industry. These online practices and the resulted user-generated content of the day appeared as major constituents of early video portals in terms of content, and both were intricately associated with a pre-Internet cultural piracy in China.",Theories and Practices in Media Industry Research,Media Industry Studies
2016-1612,2016,Paper Session,A Critical Media Industry Analysis of John Oliver and the Regulation of Net Neutrality,2,"Scholars argue the use of alternative journalism in media regulation is an important lens for the future of communication. This research adds to that body of work by analyzing the role played by John Oliver and Last Week Tonight in the fight for network neutrality. In a now infamous 13-minute segment Oliver presented the facts of net neutrality and concluded with a plea to his viewers to take direct action in the form of contacting the FCC. Using a critical media industry approach, this study identifies how YouTube commenters reacted to Oliver’s segment and his impact on the FCC’s decision. It identifies three discourses (comedy, alternative journalism, and engagement) to look at the socio-cultural response of the public’s meaning making process in industry regulation.",Theories and Practices in Media Industry Research,Media Industry Studies
2016-1613,2016,Paper Session,The Monetization of the Social Value and Cultural Impact of Basque Media: A Study of Two Cases: Goiena and Berria,3,"The purpose of the present research was to measure and monetize the social value and cultural impact of the Basque media Goiena and Berria. In the 1990s, organizations realized that the value of an business cannot be established based solely on accounting, and some organizations began research in the assessment of social value.
What are the social value and cultural impact generated by the Basque media? The measure of social value rests on three pillars: the social impact of the economic value, the money that enters the community, and the social value itself. The method is to identify the stakeholders of the organization in order to determine what value the groups receive from the company.
The values recognized by stakeholders are: standardization and prestige of the Basque language; cohesion for the community; promotion of Basque culture… The social value of Goiena is 2.691.676 euros and of Berria is 5,226,173 euros.
The measure of social value rests on three pillars: the social impact of the economic value (employees, suppliers, etc.), the money that enters the community through contributions and taxes, and the social value itself, which is more difficult to measure quantitatively. The method is to identify the stakeholders of the organization in order to determine what value the groups receive from the company.
The values recognized by stakeholders are: normativization, standardization, and prestige of the Basque language; cohesion for the linguistic community; promotion of Basque cultural activities; training center for students… The social value of Goiena is 2.691.676 euros and of Berria is 5,226,173 euros.",Theories and Practices in Media Industry Research,Media Industry Studies
2016-1614,2016,Paper Session,Polyphony in Employee Narratives: An Insightful View of Organizational Change,1,"This paper proposes to address the question of organizational change from a communication-centered perspective. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the ways by which polyphonic narratives reveal some information about the employees and managers' experiences during a process of organizational change. The employees’ stories were analyzed through a polyphonic perspective, that is, an approach that highlight the existence of multiple voices that can also represent different sources of power and authority in the organization. In order to identify these multiple voices, we analyzed the employees and managers’ narratives. Through their narratives, we tried to empirically illustrate the way narratives are constitutive of organizational change. Furthermore, we sought to bring to light employees and managers' preoccupations that feed and are constitutive of the change process as well as the organizational entity. To help us investigate these stories, our theoretical framework was based on the ventriloquist approach, as proposed by Cooren (2012, 2013). These preoccupations were analyzed as several voices animating and authoring these narratives, hence creating a polyphonic narrative that we attempted to identify and categorize in our interviews. Also, to demonstrate the empirical value of the ventriloquial approach, we use it to analyze three excerpts from a one-year study in a governmental agency and thus show how concerns about the change process shape organizational members’ realities of this phenomenon. Our findings suggest that all the employees and managers' preoccupations and concerns provide a global picture of their experiences during the process of organizational change.",Individual and Interpersonal Dynamics in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-1615,2016,Paper Session,Support me in a Stressful Workplace: Understanding Social Support Processes Under Different Stresses,2,"This study aims to investigate the social support’s effect in the job stress process in Chinese workplace. Specifically, the study tested the chain of stress-emotional exhaustion-job satisfaction and highlighted the role of social support in this process. A convenient sample of 93 employees across a variety of professions was collected in Beijing. Multiple regression models were applied to test the impacts of job stress on job satisfaction and social support seeking intention, with emotional exhaustion as mediating factor and expectation of social support as moderating variable. Overall, the findings supported the stress-emotional exhaustion-job satisfaction chain and suggested the expectation of social support as a crucial component of job context, however, the effect of social support is contingent on the type of job stress. Implications for theory and practice were discussed.",Individual and Interpersonal Dynamics in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-1616,2016,Paper Session,Warm but Incompetent? The Processing and Consequences of Mixed Media Stereotypes of Older Workers,4,"This study brings in the Stereotype Content Model to examine how mixed news media stereotypes about older workers affect the implicit activation and application of competence and warmth stereotypes. Using a 2 x 2 experiment, we show that a news article portraying older workers in a stereotypical manner, i.e. as high rather than low in warmth, and as low rather than high in competence, both inhibits and evokes negative employability perceptions, resulting in a net negative effect on intentions to hire an older worker. Our findings indicate that mixed media portrayals have stronger effects on implicit stereotype activation compared to stereotype-application. To combat discriminatory responses towards older workers, a tailored media-based stereotype reduction strategy is suggested, in which the negative component of older workers’ stereotypes (i.e. low competence) is replaced by positive, counter-stereotypes.",Individual and Interpersonal Dynamics in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2016-1617,2016,Paper Session,Flows in Reflux: The BRIC “Mockbuster” as a Glitch in Mediatic Hegemony,1,"Amid a global cultural landscape defined both by the ambiguities of deterritorialisation and the persistent impact of established geopolitical hierarchies, the idea of cultural reflux offers a potent tool to conceptualise and lend context to the study of nascent peripheral and semi-peripheral media industries. Dialoguing with Thussu and Iwabuchi’s work on media flow as well as Curtin’s concept of media capitals, this project proposes to analyse “mockbusters” — derivative copies of established metropolitan media properties. I specifically look at the output of the Brazilian studio Video Brinquedo, infamous in the 2000s for its blatant, low quality copies of established children’s media properties. In examining the BRIC mockbuster as a case study of opportunistic media counter-flow, the idea of cultural reflux complicates debates over where we should situate our analytical objectives with respect to mediatic peripherality, and how we can more concretely examine the relationship of media flow to transnational imperial frameworks.","Boundaries: Questioning the Local, Global, and Transnational",Media Industry Studies
2016-1618,2016,Paper Session,The Secret of the Magic Gourd: The Transformation of Disney's Localization Strategies in China,1,"This paper aims to examine the new localization strategies in the film, The Secret of the Magic Gourd, the first Disney-branded film made outside Hollywood. It also looks into how these strategies posit the interaction between Disney, a transnational media conglomerate, and Chinese kids' media industries, the local emerging industries, in the context of globalization. Through analyzing the film and industrial discourses, the paper argues that the mutually beneficial relationship between Disney and China not only indicates the transformation of Disney's development in China but also can be applied to the discussion of co-production between transnational media conglomerates and local emerging industries. When the emerging media industries of developing countries turns the co-production with Hollywood into an opportunity to promote themselves to the global stages, it may indicate the new power dynamics of global media ecology and further create more collaborative possibilities between transnational media conglomerates and local emerging industries.","Boundaries: Questioning the Local, Global, and Transnational",Media Industry Studies
2016-1619,2016,Paper Session,"The ""Responsible Adult"": On Media Responsibility, Off-Screen Activities, and Commercial Preschool Television",1,"The establishment of local television networks for preschool children since the 1990s can be conceptualized as a response to the twin dynamics of commercialization and globalization. This paper examines this response through the case of the Israeli preschool channel Hop!, using media responsibility and corporate social responsibility as analytical frameworks for the network's off-screen operations. Ethnographic research revealed three types of off-screen activities: 1) activities geared at maintaining a relationship with the public; 2) ongoing, non-publicized activities; and 3) activities responding to national emergencies, enhancing the network’s “local” image and reinforcing ties with its viewers. Together, these activities reveal the conflict between the commercial imperative for a private channel to turn a profit, and the ethical responsibilities entailed in broadcasting to children, as well as some of the advantages of local over global networks in the preschool context.","Boundaries: Questioning the Local, Global, and Transnational",Media Industry Studies
2016-1620,2016,Paper Session,Rethinking the Korean Wave: The Political Dimensions of Transnational Media Culutre,1,"This paper explores the relationship between cultural policy and transnational media culture. Examining the case of the Korean Wave phenomenon, the transnational flow of Korean popular culture, this paper focuses on how nation-states are involved in shaping global cultural flows. Analyzing governmental policies and industrial reports during the past two decades, this study proposes that governmental policy is an essential factor in the transnational flow of Korean media products. In addition, this paper attempts to rearticulate the Korean Wave by dividing the phenomenon into three stages according to the nature and direction of cultural hybridization.","Boundaries: Questioning the Local, Global, and Transnational",Media Industry Studies
2016-1621,2016,Paper Session,Border Crossing: A Case Study of Industrial Logics and Discourses in International Television Adaptation,1,"“There are two side to every border” is one of the taglines for FX’s crime drama The Bridge. It suggests that there are “two sides” to borders, but in the case of The Bridge the process of adapting one border to another is more complicated as it is guided by industrial logics that have gained ascendance in the “post network” television era. Through an analysis of trade and popular press that include interviews given by key members of the production team and actors, three distinct industrial discourses are apparent: localization, differentiation, and authenticity. In examining these logics, this case study more broadly asks questions of the importance of place and the nation within transnational media flows and the product that ends up on screen.","Boundaries: Questioning the Local, Global, and Transnational",Media Industry Studies
2016-1622,2016,Paper Session,"Conceptualizing Political Protest Communication: Theories, Models, and Methodology for Researching Social Activism in a Digital Dimension",2,"Social movements are an omnipresent phenomenon in our society which has become an important subject of research in the field of political communication. However, conceptualizing political protest communication, especially in times of rapid technological changes, is a difficult endeavor. This paper aims at supporting communication scientists to overcome this barrier by presenting a structural as well as an analytical way how to deal with political protest communication. Firstly, we conceptualize a model which shows how to elucidate the nature of political protest communication and the symbiotic relationship between media and protest groups at a meta level by referring to systems theory of Luhmann. Secondly, we transfer our theoretical insights into a matrix of theories which offers an attention to the concrete. By referring to Bourdieu’s theory of fields, this paper illustrates an adequate empirical approach for analyzing political protest communication at a multi-dimensional level in the field.",Digital Media and Political Protest,Political Communication
2016-1623,2016,Paper Session,"Digital Media, Cycle of Contention, and Sustainability of Environmental Activism: The case of Anti-PX Protests in China",1,"Although scholars have studied issues arising from digital activism, most have failed to scrutinize the possible interconnections that might be found within digitally mediated political contention. To advance such an understanding, this study employs the concept of “cycles of contention” to investigate recurrent mechanisms of protest in contemporary society. This study takes as its case seven anti-petrochemical (anti-PX) protests in China from 2007 to 2014, during which 54 in-depth interviews are conducted. Whereas traditional media coverage legitimizes and modularizes anti-PX protests, facilitates the adoption of digital media as part of the repertoire of contention, and sustains political contention in a long run, the use of digital media enables protestors to diffuse contention widely and quickly, and allows them to learn from the experiences of the past. This study concludes that the sustainability of digitally mediated environmental activism is shaped by the specific communication ecology in China.",Digital Media and Political Protest,Political Communication
2016-1624,2016,Paper Session,From Twitter to the Streets: A Mixed-Methods Study of Contemporary Activist Practices,4,"This study investigates activist campaign and namesake hashtag #ReclaimMLK, circulated on Twitter over the 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday weekend. Phase I consisted of investigating content characteristic(s) of the most retweeted tweets and profile characteristics of users who posted the most retweeted content. In Phase II, we designed and distributed a survey to examine the relationship between the hashtag and offline #ReclaimMLK-related actions. Phase I findings suggest the inclusion of multimedia significantly predicts the number of retweets, Twitter verification is positively correlated with a higher number of retweets, and Twitter users whose #ReclaimMLK tweets were the most retweeted are more categorically diverse. Phase II findings suggest a heavy overlap between participants’ use of Twitter for activist-related causes and involvement with traditional repertoires of contention. These findings present an interpretation of online activist engagement pertaining to the use of social media toward activism and social justice-related ends.",Digital Media and Political Protest,Political Communication
2016-1625,2016,Paper Session,I Shield Myself From Thee: Selective Avoidance on Social Media During the 2014 “Umbrella Movement” in Hong Kong,3,"This study examines the phenomenon of politically-motivated selective avoidance on Facebook in the context of the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement in 2014. We conceptualize selective avoidance as individual choices that users make to shield themselves from undesirable dissonant views, by removing unwanted information and breaking social ties that transmit such information. Given the political turmoil and polarization, we argue that selective avoidance is related to the socio-psychological factor of perceived out-group threat. We present an analysis of a street-intercept survey of 769 students from eight public tertiary institutions in Hong Kong in November 2014 at the height of street protests. We find that 15.6% of the respondents removed content and/or unfriended a Facebook friend during the movement. Active use of Facebook for protest-related information and expression is associated with high likelihood of selective avoidance, which in turn predicts actual participation in the street protests. The level of perceived out-group threat strengthens the positive relationship between Facebook use and selective avoidance.",Digital Media and Political Protest,Political Communication
