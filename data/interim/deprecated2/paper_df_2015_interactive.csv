2015-0000,2015,Paper Session,A Prophet Not in His (or Her) Own Land: The Effect of Distance Traversed on Social Influence,3,"Although research has found that the greater the distance between individuals, the less they are attracted to each other, persuaded by the distant other, or form friendships, the current research proposes the prophet not in his (or her) own land hypothesis. It looks at a potential positive side of distance: That being from afar may result in a person being perceived as having more honor, which translates to greater credibility as compared to a person who is local. Therefore, we test whether someone who is from far away is more persuasive than someone who is local. A structural equation model (N = 269) was used to test this general hypothesis, which found that distance has indirect effects that support our hypothesis. Distance affected perceptions of honor (praise to the agent and the expected attractiveness of the agent), which, in turn, caused belief change. Limitations and possible future research are discussed.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0001,2015,Paper Session,A Laboratory Investigation on Predictors and Consequences of Experiencing Social Closeness During the Usage of Social Networking Sites,2,"In the last decade, scholarship provided a series of insights on how and why using social networking sites (SNS) can be socially and psychologically beneficial for individuals. The present research extends this evidence by focusing on the concept of social closeness as a feeling people experience in the situation they use SNS. In a laboratory setting (N = 60), participants logged in on Facebook, spent ten minutes on the platform and reported their experiences during this session. Analyses of participants’ usage behavior and the experiences revealed that the more time users spent on interacting with other users (e.g., by commenting on updates), the closer they felt to other people. Interacting with others also predicted user’s well-being after Facebook usage, this effect was mediated by the perception of social closeness. This study is one of the first employing momentary measures, offering a further theoretical link between active SNS use and well-being.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0002,2015,Paper Session,Blending In or Standing Out? Investigating the Impact of Selfies and Social Comparison and Individuals’ Self-Concept,5,"The selfie concept, which refers to ‘digital self-portraits,’ has become particularly popular among teenagers and celebrities across the world (Block, 2014, Wortham, 2013). The increasing use of selfies, however, has raised various concerns such as whether social media has exacerbated narcissistic tendencies among young adults (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2014). The preponderance of these posts begs the question of how such activities and shared information is connected to one’s tendency to socially compare and ultimately influence one’s conception of the self. In this study, using a popular photo sharing platform, Instagram, we investigate the ‘selfie’ concept within the context of social comparison, narcissism, and physical attractiveness. We incorporate a mediator-moderator approach to measure the predictive power of different types of selfies on an individual’s satisfaction with his/her own personal image. Results of this research will provide insights into mediator - moderator relationships on social psychological research addressing digital media usage.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0003,2015,Paper Session,Parasocial Relationships as Meaningful Relationships: An Exploratory Study of PSRs’ Relationship With Companionship and Emotional Support,1,"Countless studies have examined the purely hedonic, pleasurable experiences and benefits entertainment viewing can elicit. However, more recent theorizing in entertainment effects has shifted to explore a “two-factor” model of entertainment (Vorderer, 2011) in which mixed affect and more complex experiences such as feeling elevated, inspired, touched, and feelings of poignancy that focus more on intellectual and moral virtues and connecting to the human experience are integral parts of an entertainment experience. Rieger, Reineck, Frischlich & Bente (2014) recently found that such entertainment fare can influence one’s overall well-being, creating a form of media-induced recovery from life stresses (see also Reinceck, 2009; Rieger, Reinecke, Kneer, Frischlich, & Bente, 2013). The present study explores the beneficial effects parasocial relationships may have on one’s well-being. More specifically, this suggests one’s motivation to seek out entertainment is related to strength of parasocial interactions which may lead to either companionship or emotional support.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0004,2015,Paper Session,Romantic Jealousy 2.0: Facebook Jealousy as a Three-Component Conceptualization,2,"Facebook jealousy is traditionally conceptualized and measured as a unidimensional construct. This study examined the multidimensional nature of Facebook jealousy by testing a three-component conceptualization of Facebook jealousy and analyzing how Facebook use (i.e., time and intensity) are associated with these three constructs. Results from a survey of 351 emerging adults from Belgium supported the presence of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral Facebook jealousy as distinct constructs. Further analysis tested mediation models of Facebook intensity and time with the Facebook jealousy dimensions. Facebook intensity was positively associated with behavioral Facebook jealousy both directly and indirectly through emotional Facebook jealousy. Cognitive Facebook jealousy was not a significant mediator of Facebook intensity and behavioral Facebook jealousy. No significant mediation or direct paths emerged for Facebook time and behavioral Facebook jealousy. Overall, these findings highlight the complex nature of Facebook jealousy and the roles of Facebook intensity and time spent on Facebook.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0005,2015,Paper Session,The Role of Source Identification and Credibility in the Social Media Impact Hypothesis,4,"A 2 X 2 multi-factorial experiment (N=211) examined the impact of source identification and perceived credibility on the effects of risk messages about a food safety issue conveyed using different contexts (Facebook, online news site) and different story formats (narrative, non-narrative). Drawing on the heuristic systematic model (HSM), the differential impact hypothesis, and narrative persuasion theory, we examined responses to online news stories conveyed on social media and news sites. Social media formats tended to increase perceptions of identification with message sources contributing to greater personal level risk perceptions and perceived effects on self—thus minimizing third person effects. The narrative format also increased the persuasive impact of the messages. The effects of the risk stories, however, was significantly mediated by the perceived credibility of the source--online news and Facebook sites.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0006,2015,Paper Session,"Twitter, Twitter on my Screen What Opinion Can be Seen?",1,"The rise of social networking sites (SNS) like Facebook or Twitter creates a forum for discussions and shared space of experiences (Lochrie & Coulton, 2012a). Independent of the enduring and lasting changes in the media landscape, TV shows create a desire for recipients to be part of the group experiences (Lochrie & Coulton, 2012c). While in the beginnings of TV consumption, the joint reception was restricted to the people present in one room, the development of social media enables communication and interaction via SNS or microblogging platforms between physically separated persons while watching TV. This leads to a new form of mass participation (Lochrie & Couton, 2012b). This study will seek to close a research gap to a certain extent by examining the climate of opinion in tweets while watching TV. Furthermore, it was of interest for analyzing data if an algorithm enables an automatical and faster classification of valence.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0007,2015,Paper Session,Zero Likes: Virtual Thumbs Down for Belongingness and Self-Esteem,3,"On Facebook, status-updates including pictures, videos, or links can be liked by friends and acquaintances. The presented research investigates the influence of those likes for a status-update on feelings of belongingness and self-esteem and assumes that the absence of likes to status-update poses a need threat to the user. The predictions were tested in a 3 (number of likes zero/two/thirty) x 2 (relationship friends/acquaintance) between-subjects online-experiment (N = 805). Receiving no likes on a status-update had meaningful impact on the participant’s self-esteem and feeling of belongingness. The presented study concentrates on the meaning of not receiving likes on Facebook as temporal need-threat. The experimental manipulation showed that likes are a currency for self-esteem and belonging. It offers distinct data on phenomena like partial ostracism, showing that few likes boost self-esteem and belongingness lesser than many likes.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems

2015-0009,2015,Paper Session,Jimmy Carter and the Emerging National “Malaise”: Letters to the Editor in America’s Political System,2,"On February 23, 1976, one day prior to the New Hampshire primary, Washington Post editor Philip L. Geyelin published Lothar H. Wedekind’s letter. Wedekind of Annandale, Va., praised Washington Post ombudsman Charles B. Seib’s column, “Missing the Election Story,” and further critiqued a presidential “horserace handicapped by the media.” Wedekind’s letter is reminiscent of hundreds published at the nation’s leading newspapers for its acknowledgement of the national malaise surrounding the first post-Watergate presidential election and its critique of the era’s political system. Taking a cue from historians James Carey and Raymond Williams, this study of a census of more than 625 letters to the editor published in the nation’s top six circulation-leading newspapers seeks to understand the material trace of America’s “structure of feeling” surrounding presidential politics, in general, and the candidacy of Jimmy Carter, more specifically, during the first post-Watergate presidential election.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0010,2015,Paper Session,"Starting a Family: Brand Journalism and Ford Times, 1908-1917",1,"This article closely examines an early example of brand journalism by telling the “birth story” of Ford Times, a company magazine created by the Ford Motor Company from 1908 to 1917 for dealers and consumers. This study describes why the publication emerged in 1908 amid an era of reform and improvement, examines content found in the magazine’s first issues, and discusses how the magazine circulated narratives about the ‘corporate family’ among dealers and then consumers. The magazine detailed more than new models for sale; it combined narratives about automobile use, food, farming, rural life, nationhood, and family with the Ford brand in order to build a reader community, interest in travel, and inspire loyalty to a brand that secured the automobile’s place in American culture and shaped Ford’s corporate communication for most of the twentieth century.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0011,2015,Paper Session,"""A Traitor to His Class"": Race and Publisher W.E. ‘Ned’ Chilton III, 1953-1984",1,"This study looks historically at the role of the press in the public sphere, using as a case study the evolution of the views of publisher W.E. “Ned” Chilton III on race issues during his career at The Charleston Gazette, West Virginia’s largest newspaper. Chilton, born into privilege, was as an unquestioning member of the white power structure. However, over time he became extremely vocal on Civil Rights issues, often using The Gazette’s editorial pages and reporting resources to do so. In examining Chilton’s publishing career, this study reveals how a single newspaper publisher became the most vocal and possibly the most effective voice for change in West Virginia during the civil rights movement, illustrating the dynamic role of even a single press outlet in providing access to information for debate in the public sphere.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0012,2015,Paper Session,Marshall Plan Films In/About Turkey (1948-1952): Birth and Development of “Development Discourse” in Turkey,1,"Since its implementation the Marshall Plan (MP) has become a model or rhetorical device for exhorting planned external intervention elsewhere, to do what the MP is alleged to have done so ‘successfully’ for Western Europe after the crisis of World War II. Respectively, MP communication campaign in general, and MP films in particular frequently have been hailed to ‘sell Europeans on’ democracy, shared economic goals and the hope of a new, peaceful Europe built on the ashes of the ruined old one. However, it is impossible to talk any of these two aspects, when it comes to the Turkish case.
Although not involved in WW2, Turkey was one of the countries, which not only benefited from Marshall Aid, but also became the audience/theme of some Marshall Films, such as Yusuf and his Plough (1951), The Village Tractor (1951) and Turkish Harvest (1952). Predominantly illustrating the transformation of the “backward” conditions under which Turkish urban-people live, to a “productive and normalized” social environment thanks to Marshall Aid, these movies, as well provide with valuable insights about the regimes of representation that place Turkey into a certain discourse, namely development. Since then, development discourse has historically been such a dominating one in the country, in economical, political, social and cultural spheres.
In this paper, the images of Turkey as they reflect on the representations Marshall Plan planners and experts utilized as they design and carry out their program is analyzed in detail to show the connection between the creation of visibility in discourse, and the exercise of power. The study of employed communication techniques, namely The Marshall Movies about Turkey, problematizes the birth and development of “development discourse” in Turkey, the mechanisms and institutions that were agents in making of development discourse, and, the kind of subjectivity it fostered on Turkish people.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Our goal with this paper is to contribute to understandings of the construction of race through visual media, both in news coverage and in citizens’ creation and disseminationof images on social networks.

2015-0014,2015,Paper Session,"Producing a Crossover Fail: A Case Study of Latin Pop Star ""Nigga""/Flex",1,"This paper highlights a Latin pop star known as “Flex” in the US and as “Nigga” across Latin America. As part of the Latin music industry’s global launch of this artist, Internet fan outreach and viral marketing strategies were devised to divert attention from the “Nigga” moniker by rebranding and repackaging him as “Flex.” Yet, the use of a racially charged moniker and dual marketing strategies worked against his global branding appeal and produced a crossover fail. Through Internet discourse analysis, I examine four social networking fan pages maintained (2007-2008) under each moniker. This case study is particularly compelling, as it analyzes how representations of Blackness and Latinidad are produced in a hegemonic system that depends on uneven access to power. Extending critical work on Latin popular culture, it also interrogates the pressures of race, nation, and commodification on Latin crossover artists producing and globally circulating representations of Blackness and Latinidad.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0015,2015,Paper Session,Testimonies of Race-Based Suffering: Individual Differences in Openness to the Other,1,"The present study employed a variety of existing measures to assess openness to the other in the ecologically valid context of listening to real-life testimonies of race-based suffering. Variation in symbolic threat, as well individual differences in Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), were all investigated for their impact on respondent openness. Among 39 student volunteers it was found that a woman's testimony featuring a high degree of symbolic threat engendered less openness to the other across cognitive and affective measures than less threatening testimony offered by a man. Additionally, participant levels of RWA and SDO explained a significant amount of variance in their openness to the other. This study quantitatively confirms that testimonies of race-based suffering- utterances that have great potential to interrupt master narratives and invite deep learning- are likely to be met with a complex pattern of resistance that must be more fully understood.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Scholars have long used the media to study the identity formation and the society’s perception of the minority group. This paper adopts the content analysis methodology and Clark’s model of four-stage minority media representations to analyze the portrayal of the Malays in Singapore’s The Straits Times print newspaper, followed by a comparison with the dominant Chinese’s media representations for further insights into practical nation building strategies.

In this paper, we present a qualitative case study of a service-learning program that aimed to enable media and journalism undergraduate students to enhance their cultural competence and sense of citizenship while simultaneously empowering working-class high school Latina/o students. We discuss the program’s conceptualization as a social justice empowerment effort grounded in Paulo Freire’s critical pedagogy.

Thus, the article shows that an epistemic community can move beyond its mainly “informational” role to enter into the shaping of more egalitarian media policy, regulations and administrative practices. The article examines the work of the Institute for Public Representation (IPR), at Georgetown Law Center, and Howard Media Group (HMG), at Howard University, since 2003 to show how two university-based public interest groups have expanded the notion of epistemic roles for women and people of color.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

By focusing on just the academic conspiracy theories of GamerGaters we are able to see how this movement embodies trends that are of particular concern to all scholars. Many of the GamerGate critiques of academia tap into broader anti-intellectual trends in U.S. culture. We also show that GamerGate discourse draws on a long history of connecting feminism to communism in the United States (Storrs, 2007). As feminist scholarship practice increasingly attempts to make academic work more widely accessible, it allows feminist work to be available for critique and harassment in a way other scholarship rarely is. At the same time, this also means that feminist scholarship is uniquely positioned to speak for itself when it is mischaracterized and to change minds even as it is attacked.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0021,2015,Paper Session,Beyond Sex Differences: Using Testosterone to Investigate Communication During the Post Sex Time Interval,3,"The goal of the present study is to complicate research on sex differences in communication and offer physiology as a possible alternative for understanding differences in communication during the post sex time interval (PSTI). In line with feminist critiques of research involving sex differences, this study does not assume that all females and males are similar, but instead focuses on sources of intrasexual variation. More specifically, this study hypothesized that testosterone would be a better predictor than biological sex when investigating individuals’ positive relational disclosures after sexual activity. The findings of this study provide preliminary support for the role of physiological markers as better predictors of communication behavior during the PSTI than biological sex, as testosterone levels predicted individuals’ positive relational disclosures after sexual activity while biological sex did not. The findings of this study suggest that the binary categories of “female” and “male” may not be sufficient (and may, in fact, be problematic) for understanding post sex behavior and that intrasexual variation needs to be considered when investigating communication after sexual activity.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

By closely examining female workers’ everyday routine in a beauty salon near a factory, the current research proposes a typology of embodiment of migrant bodies, namely: commoditized, professional, conformed and naked body, to articulate the struggles that the rural body meets to transform into modern dwellers, and the power and domination embeds into the discourses. It is revealed that no fixed categories can be attributed to the body, and the transition among different types is a tactical response to the compulsory external and internal power that cultivates the body. The fluid body is not determined but affected by a combination of wider historical, social-political, economic-cultural conditions and personal particularities.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Three of them, namely public-private conflict frame, western-Chinese conflict frame, class conflict frame, were employed to show opposed attitude. Only one feminist frame was adopted to show support. Feminism in China is found to be conceived as morally deviant, foreign-rooted, and intertwined with issues like nationalism, social polarization, and modern-tradition contradiction.

We contribute to feminist inquiry by showing how this popular cultural text portrays mothering as a contested site in which women can explore how intensive mothering processes can be destructive-transformative, affirming-disconfirming, and self-focused-community-oriented when not carried to extremes and when situated amidst other possibilities. Our reading of Mad Men delineates transgressive mothering as those gendered processes that disrupt intensive mothering “ideals” by modeling alternative lifestyles, advocating for others’ children, and engaging in anti-mothering practices. In our critique, we consider the broader historical context dominated by significant changes in consumerism, medicine, technology, and politics. Engaging in critique and actions resulting from a difference lens can help make visible how intensive mothers’ sole focus on their own children undermines not only possibilities for their own personal fulfillment but also community well being.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The Internet allows individuals to engage in discourse about a range of topics, but women may not always feel welcome to participate in these public forums. Indeed, some women, including journalists, have faced hostility when presenting their perspectives online.

Interpreting this metajournalistic news discourse about what it means for war journalists to report from conflict zones, journalists can be understood sometimes as cultural imperialists, sometimes as hybrid actors in the production of knowledge, but both critical positions insufficiently explain why news discourse persistently positions journalists as a special class deserving of special treatment by governments engaged in conflict. This article argues that journalists should be understood to be part of a corporatist professional-managerial stratum, through which they claim exception to conditions that should be understood as Agambenian states of exception. Thus, war journalists are revealed to be agents of global capital as seen in corporatist terms, and their deaths and injuries are considered threats to the field of journalism and to the corporatist system itself.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Building upon previous research and using agenda setting, framing and agenda building as a theoretical base, a content analysis was conducted to examine how business news sources portray CSR, whether they adopt a positive, neutral/mixed or negative tone, and investigate whether corporate sources influence business news coverage of this topic. The ultimate goal was to see if business news outlets were still heavily influences by corporate sources and whether most adopt a positive tone, as previous research has shown, or if financial journalists are taking a more a skeptical approach after receiving criticism for not predicting the financial crisis.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

What influences students to choose journalism versus another major? A survey of students (N=2401) examined whether there is a cultivation or other media effect at work. Independent variables of news consumption, media exposure, technology use and the influence of salient referents were used to predict choice of major. Salient referent refers to two kinds: personally known influencers like family (unmediated referents) and media figures like news anchors, magazine writers and professional bloggers (mediated referents). Results show mediated referents and news consumption predict choice of journalism as major. Unmediated referents, by contrast are factor in choice of other communications majors. Technology use and video and Internet exposure were relatively ineffective at predicting journalism major choice. Implications for curriculum and advising and future media effects research are discussed.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0035,2015,Paper Session,Multiple Media or Multiple Modalities? Redefining Multimedia as a Framework for Journalism Scholars,1,"Together with other buzzwords like interactivity and hypertext, multimedia is one of the most studied online features in contemporary journalism studies. However, the concept of multimedia is too ambiguous to adequately analyse contemporary journalism platforms. The concept of multimedia is used both as the combination of media as well as a mix of modalities. This paper questions the current definitions of multimedia and argues that multimodality, a concept stemming from linguistics and semiotics, more adequately grasps the integrated use of different forms of presentation. Grounded in theory, a distinction is made between both concepts, and the argument is put forward that multimedia may be referred to when describing the combined action of multiple online media platforms. It is argued that future research in the domain of journalism studies may benefit from taking this difference between multimedia and multimodality into account.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Specifically, researchers identified and analyzed the region’s online-native sites, exploring their influence and “alternativeness” – in terms of ownership, funding, content, degree of activism, and organizational goals – and their “digital-ness,” in terms of the sites’ inclusion of multimedia, interactive, and participatory digital features. In general, this quantitative and qualitative analysis of the media sites’ websites shows that the most influential online-native sites are attempting to renovate traditional, outdated modes of journalism, serving as alternatives to mainstream media and aiming to change society, even if the sites do not necessarily self-identify as “alternative” per se.

Four themes emerged from the analysis. First, traditional news organizations demonstrate ambivalence in defining BuzzFeed. Second, traditional news organizations invoke journalistic doxa in their representations of BuzzFeed, to some extent demonstrating how they recognize BuzzFeed as having entered the journalistic field. This is consistent with the third theme, where traditional news organizations problematize BuzzFeed’s forms of economic and cultural capital. Finally, despite some degrees of uncertainty, traditional news organizations seem to positively welcome BuzzFeed’s entry into the journalistic field, both as a transformative force and as a potential ally for preservation.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, scholars have brought new attention to the US business press, much of it critical, raising concerns about its close relationships with financial elites, pro-business bias, and failure to perform a watchdog role. This paper aims to contribute to this growing literature by examining a key period of growth for business journalism. From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, the amount of business coverage presented in US news media increased dramatically, and understanding the causes of this trend--including claims of anti-business bias by business leaders, news organizations’ desire to reach affluent audiences, and a growing conviction that economics and finance were of vital importance to all Americans, not just business professionals--provides important context for recent work on the contemporary business press.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Homophobia is found to cause anti-gay violence. Research has endeavored to examine correlates and causation of homophobia to better understand and to effectively intervene.
This study used online surveys to examine whether or not social identity theory (SIT) predicted male and - previously underexplored - female homophobia, whether or not there was a gender difference in homophobia and gender role beliefs, and whether or not homophobia and gender role beliefs were correlated. The results showed that social identity theory predicted only female homophobia (RQ1) but not male homophobia (H1), there was a gender difference in homophobic attitude (RQ2a) but not in gender role beliefs (RQ2b), and homophobia and gender role beliefs were positively and significantly correlated with homophobia in both males and females (RQ3).","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Paper Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Grounded in the media practice model, the purpose of this study was to examine the mediating role of sexual identity commitment in the relationship between CMC engagement and well-being among a sample of LGB adolescents. Results indicate that LGB teens engage in approximately four hours of CMC a day. Results also suggest that CMC is positively correlated with well-being and that said relationship is partially mediated by sexual identity commitment, but only for LGB female adolescents. No relationship existed between CMC and sexual identity commitment or well-being among males.

The results show that the unintended consequences that characterise not just the conventional market but also the systems of moral production and consumption cause conflicts between different ethical concerns, making it impossible to make choices that are perfectly moral. Regarding the moral market the analysis shows that because consumers and producers are not able to predict, assess and anticipate the outcomes of their choices and because they can't know what information they can trust, ideologies are constantly re-evaluated. New insights lead to adjusting of ideologies. In this context of constant and endless reflexivity, ideologies become intrinsically unobtainable and reflexivity becomes a non-formative of ideology.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

These evangelicals espouse a free-culture ethic that mirrors that of the FOSS and Creative Commons movements, but is sharply contrasted with previous norms in evangelical media use. I interrogate the question: How does the emerging Christian understanding of free culture online intersect and diverge with the secular understanding, and what do these intersections and divisions reveal about the social imaginaries (Taylor, 2002; 2004) that inform these movements? Furthermore, what do they reveal about the social imaginary of the internet in American culture, broadly conceived?","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

However, we lack a typology of antagonistic structures that exist online, and particularly of the ways they are represented on websites. Social structures can be represented formally (manifestly) or informally (in open verbal or visual forms), or remain latent—a distinction that, in our view, has not received much scholarly attention in the analysis of computer-mediated communication. Based on an interpretative analysis of relational structures and types of acts, we distinguish structural elements that lead us to empirical typologies of antagonistic structures represented online. We finally develop theses why some structures are formally represented more often than others and theorize the consequences of this selective formal representation.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Implementing grounded practical theory, idealized reconstructions are made of the instructional communication practice, instructor-facilitated collegiate classroom discussion (IFCCD), on three levels: interactional dilemma, situated ideals, and talk/discourse techniques. In the reformulated participation structure, the instructor retains the first and third-turns, but the conversational work done in these turns is qualitatively different. The first-turn accomplishes invitation rather than initiation and the third-turn is primarily dialogic follow-up accompanied by evaluation and feedback rather than being primarily the latter two. These instructor turns are examined in depth in two classrooms where the instructors consistently facilitated engaged and participatory discussions. These case studies show the theoretical, practical, and life skills relevance of this scholarly approach and discussion-based teaching.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

An overarching critique runs across all essays: I believe that the concept of identity is inadequate to cover the full range of linguistic expression in the practice of argumentation. I propose another interpretation to the cognitive stance toward logic: that intuition is the basis of judgment and moral belief, of intelligence and motivation.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

I propose applying such a theoretical framework to a series of seven instances wherein the performance of popular music scripts in which sacred forms have been embedded stands to reveal much about popular music’s role in enriching and/or problematizing collective experience.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

A comparative content analysis was conducted across communication from elites who have been internationally recognized as having played some kind of leadership role for in-groups that have committed acts of violence against out-group(s). Data stretching across two decades from four different cases - the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka and Myanmar - were examined. A thematic coding scheme was developed using themes identified in the previous literature, Susan Benesch’s proposal on dangerous speech (2012) and perspectives from Social Identity Theory (1981). Coding and analysis revealed that across countries and temporal spans, elites use a combination of themes but greatly bolster in-group and out-group distinctions and identity through their language choices, but typically avoid outright dehumanization as commonly assumed. Moreover, they excessively create non-falsifiable statements about current, past, or future events; and employ allegations against the intentions, plans and activities of the out-group. These non-falsifiable statements make a bulk of their speech or broadcasts. Several additional themes were identified as well.

In general, science fiction/fantasy fans were perceived as less socially and physically attractive compared to sports fans, particularly male science fiction/fans. However, there were no differences between the groups in task attractiveness. Results are discussed in light of both critical fan studies and intergroup psychology fan research.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0069,2015,Paper Session,Producing Public Intellectuals: Shifting Scales in Moroccan Cinema (Top Poster in Popular Communication),1,"This paper argues new Moroccan cinema cannot be understood in purely national terms anymore, that modes of production, distribution, and discourse show it to be an industry integrated into what I call a regional “EuroMed” mediascape. Using Kraidy’s conception of a “deterritorialized industry” and Curtin’s theory of “trajectories of creative migration”, I demonstrate a key dimension of the new Moroccan cinema is its situation within a new Moroccan mediascape that has shifted in scale from national cinema to something more regional in terms of distribution and global in terms of financing. In doing so I contend that cinema has become a transnational space for cultural activism by public intellectuals seeking more autonomy to challenge Morocco’s traditionally centralized media discourses, as well as well as an attempt to integrate political norms and participation with those of global civil society in a way that is inclusive of, yet not specific to, Morocco.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0070,2015,Paper Session,United in Nostalgia? A Content Analysis of Personal and Historic Nostalgia in Flemish Magazine Advertisements,3,"While the vintage and retro trend in consumption cannot be overlooked in times of economic turmoil, this study examines the way advertisers have tapped into this global trend by implementing nostalgia in magazine advertisements. A sample of 1,116 advertisements published in 9 major consumer magazines between July 2012 and June 2013 served to analyze the prominence of both individual and historic types of nostalgia across product categories and target groups. In accordance with Davis’ discontinuity thesis (1979) the results indicate first a higher occurrence and prominence of nostalgic cues in times of crisis compared to previous studies. Second, nostalgia is particularly found in soft sell advertising strategies for food and clothing. Third, nostalgic advertising are female oriented, whereas no common ground or differences according to age can be found. Implications and opportunities for both mainstream and targeted advertising are discussed while drawing a tentative research agenda.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

As pedagogical instruments, the discourses proffered in celebrity interviews help reinforce and naturalize hegemonic views of consumerism and social behavior. This analysis of three televised talk show interviews with the actor Jennifer Lawrence sheds light on the “common sense” of the celebrity interview and challenges the dominant discourses of the genre. It is argued that film actors, who play a pedagogical role in the public sphere, should engage more directly with the often pointed social themes represented in their films.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

I also explore how abjection is contextual—set in terms of time space, place and gaze. Currently, within the United States, our lens of abjection has turned to fatness. In academia, however, using a critical lens to fat is relatively new. Size is not seen as an identity vector imperative to explore when using an intersectional lens, yet we look to race, gender, and nationality (to name a few). By leaving body size out of this conversation we then assume that all sizes are privileged equally. While Critical Fat Studies is often situated in Gender Studies, shifting our research into Communication Studies allows us to examine specific bodies and popular culture artifacts as texts.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

While sometimes supportive of a rhetor’s intended roles, we found that circulating personae can disrupt the first persona, complicate the invitations and control exerted over the second persona, propel fractal oppressions where strategic and non-strategic authorships deflect or silence a third persona, and provide an undertow of multiple meanings and codes supplementing a fourth persona. Several implications are drawn from this analysis, including how circulating personae may neuter roles important to political rhetoric and public culture.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The intricate connections among national brands, the emotions they evoke and the various branded nations themselves seem to be taken for granted or overlooked in existing literatures. I propose a heuristic account that theorizes their interrelationships. By tracing the branding efforts made by China and, what I call, the de-branding efforts made by Falun Gong, I argue that these “authentically” Chinese cultural presentations elicits certain emotions. The emotional works are different for Chinese audiences and for international audiences. Thus, I propose a duplex model to account for the emotional processes in these two groups of audiences. I argue that four operating emotions—pride, shame, liking and contempt—solidify into various political attitudes toward China. In the conclusion, I discuss the contributions of the affective logic in branding and the limitations of this paper.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Chinese diaspora, who acted as global purchasing agents (GPAs), help to buy products overseas and sell them back to consumers in China. Through the back-and-forth communication and cultural products exchanges, GPAs provides their consumers multicultural experience and transnational visions as imagination. This practice blurs the essential national boundaries and complicates the mentality of diaspora that might assume a dichotomy of homeland and host country. As the study reveals, it is the mundane practice of online shopping that links to lived and imagined experience of cosmopolitanism. In conducting online shopping and global purchasing, diasporic subjects become cultural brokers that help people in homeland make their way into other’s culture, be appreciatively open to divergent cultural experiences, and consume the sense of cosmopolitanism as a daily activity.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

I combine three theoretical frameworks, namely Turner’s (1983) liminality, flow and communitas, Goffman’s (1969) dramaturgy, and Bourdieu’s (2006) concept of capital to examine Sze-ying events. I suggest the study of photography has to go beyond the meaning of textual level. Thus I propose “Sze-ying” is more than the production of female images. It is a kind of liminoid cultural performance, which allows participants to mimic a social status that they can hardly achieve in the reality, and within this event dramaturgical capital is realized. Dramaturgical capital is used to distinguish the status of the participants in a less-than-ideal liminoid experience. In this Hong Kong local photographic subculture, dramaturgical capital is consumed as charisma, such constellation is an affective remedy to the pessimistic life in a capitalist society.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

On the one hand, advertising is understood as an institution, which influences socialization processes and social cohesiveness. On the other, it is also and a carrier of social meaning. Thus, it both reflects and shape the culture in which is embedded. Based on this, and using a socio semiotic and a visual perspective, we have analyzed Chilean advertising in newspapers during the 90s, specifically 1997, in order to find out how advertising reflected/ shaped the sociocultural sphere of that time. Preliminary results showed three main prevailing discourses that are in tune with the socio economic changes present in the Chilean of the 90s: (1) Sales, Offers and Price Reductions; (2) Abundance, and (3) Payment Delay (“buy now, pay later”) that reflect, form, and expand the growing Chilean market-oriented culture.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In the contemporary news environment with mostly-skimming audiences, visual frames as well as frames communicated via headlines give particular impact. This study examines the visual and headline framing of marijuana prior to and following legalization in Colorado, concentrating on valence. Further, this study investigated whether political disposition of the outlet impacted valence framing of visuals and headlines. Finally, this study examined whether certain visual depictions of the marijuana plant are associated with particular valences. Results show 1) marijuana is visually and textually framed as a mostly negative issue, 2) legalization of marijuana increased the positive valence of headlines only, and 3) liberal outlets depicted marijuana more positively than others.

Moreover, the presence of a disability has at times relegated individuals into a status of undesirability. Abiding in the realm of disableism, or discrimination of disabled individuals, Colombian magazines provide evidence of the denied rights and discriminatory attitudes faced by individuals with disabilities. This study benefits from theoretical triangulation in order to gain deeper understanding of the impact of the invisibilization of individuals with disabilities. Via a semiotic analysis of the Colombian visual magazine, Revista Semana, a leader in the field, images of individuals with disability were examined. Findings indicate that by obviating the disabled, individuals are in turn systematically consigned to hidden history. Further, the study will contribute to existing literature on the impact of the invisibilization of minority groups in Latin America.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Data was collected between December 15th, 2013 and February 15th, 2014. Photographs were analyzed using Richard Chalfen’s (1987) event-component framework of visual anthropology. Findings showed visual portrayals of personal identity through use of selfies, food shots and leisure shots. Visual indicators of relational identity were conveyed through nostalgia posts, tagging and aesthetic relationship signifiers (black and whites photos, picstitches and screenshots). Lastly, community identity was conveyed through Instagram language and site-specific hashtags (#motivationmonday, #throwbackthursday and #selfiesaturday). I concluded by proposing Lim and Bowers’ “Face wants” as a necessary framework for understanding how visual identity is shaped on photo-sharing sites.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The objective is to determine the meanings that the logo has had for Apple, Inc.’s identity, mission, and relationships, as well as the messages that the logo conveys to viewers (i.e., mostly customers). The semiotic model used in this analysis is Charles Sanders Peirce’s semiotic framework. Peircean semiotics is made up of a three-part paradigm of signification: the representamen (or the sign itself), the object (or “referent” – what the sign refers to), and the interpretant (the effect on the viewer, or the viewer’s interpretation). An important conclusion is that the communicative intent of Apple, through its logo, tends to take a long time to develop. Apple’s ideal identity has been built over a long period of time, which makes the notion of logo improvement ""evolutionary"" in nature.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Prior research suggests that BYAF is more effective in individualist countries where personal freedom is important, as compared to collectivist countries where personal freedom is less emphasized (Pascual et al., 2012). Three studies were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the technique in the United States (US), an individualist country. Study 1 simply sought to replicate the BYAF effect in the US. Results indicated that the BYAF and a direct request did not differ in effectiveness. Study 2 sought to attempt another replication, however, with a slight variation to the type of request. Results indicated that the BYAF’s effectiveness was moderated by gender of participants. Study 3 was conducted in order to assess whether the type of request, the topic of the request, or the placement of the BYAF phrase affected BYAF effectiveness. Results indicated that there were no differences in effectiveness between the BYAF and a direct request.

It is assumed that people who tend to base their attitudes on affect are more likely to be persuaded by an emotional as compared to a rational communicator. In contrast, people who tend to base their attitudes on cognition should be more susceptible to messages from a rational communicator than from an emotional communicator. To test this communicator matching effect, a total of 115 participants took part in an experiment. Participants read an interview about a fictitious medical study that was supposedly set out to test a new malaria medication. On top of the stimulus page, the interviewee was either described as an emotional (n = 62) or a rational (n = 53) expert. Results clearly show the expected communicator matching effect.

Results of an online experiment show that the presentation of weak arguments in favor of a political project reduces the persuasive effects of a strong argument. The paper also focuses on possible mechanisms to explain this effect. However, neither an averaging, nor reactance triggered by recognizing the persuasive intent explain this effect sufficiently. In addition, the study shows that the presentation of weak arguments lowers participants’ attitudes compared to presenting no arguments at all. This effect is based on both an averaging pattern and an intention to counterargue.",Persuasion I: Strategies,Information Systems

The Jena Six case, an incident that carried many racial tensions and cultural overtones, was used as the context for the tested processes. Results indicated that prior attitudes and motivations at time one predicted the message processing aspect of perceived story quality at time two. Perceived story quality then interacted with message frame (episodic or thematic) to predict subsequent beliefs. These results indicate that framing is highly important in predicting how a message will be received in a complex issue such as the Jena Six case, but that prior attitudes and motivations will also play a role in how those frames are processed.",Persuasion I: Strategies,Information Systems

Their most important predictor is the perceived undesirability of media messages (Perloff, 1999). Later, Eveland and McLeod (1999) were first to link the social desirability of pro- and antisocial media messages and perceptions of being persuaded within TPP. Nevertheless, persuasion research clearly links persuasion knowledge with reactance (Brehm, 1966), but there is almost no research on the role of persuasion knowledge and reactance within the theoretical framework of TPP.
To shed light on this important antecedent of TPP we conducted a series of two independent experiments on two different topics.
Results of the experiments confirm the assumptions of Eveland and McLeod (1999): social desirability influences TPP via persuasion knowledge. Moreover, the present study adds another mediator, reactance, to this indirect effect.",Persuasion I: Strategies,Information Systems

We test this “backfire effect” in the context of journalistic coverage and examine how to counteract it. In an online experiment, we find evidence for a systematic backfire effect, leading participants to misremember corrected misinformation as true more often than facts as false. The effect occurs after a few minutes and strengthens after five days.

We conducted three experiments to investigate how a positive or negative emphasis of only one of these dimensions (i.e., of only warmth or only competence) affects the perception of the other (complementary) dimension, and how voting intentions are influenced by these emphases. The results show that when a politician is described positively in only one of the two dimensions, people assess the complementary dimension more negatively. In addition, the negative emphasis of only one of the two dimensions also leads to a more negative assessment of the complementary dimension. Furthermore, we explore how these one-dimensional person descriptions affect the assessment of the speakers uttering them. Politicians who describe their opponents in negative terms are also evaluated negatively.

Indeed, results from a cross-sectional survey among 226 adolescents indicate that crime drama viewing and scary world beliefs are only correlated among high NTE individuals.

This ability to detect social cues and retain visual social records has been tested mostly with static facial images in laboratory settings. Findings point to better memory for social objects (e.g. other people), especially among women. Because media consumption has become irreversibly entangled with the way social life is navigated, the present study tested gender differences in visual information processing of audiovisual news, using social and non-social memory measures. Women recognized human faces better, men non-facial images. Cued recall measures--testing the salience of visual memory--showed that women mentioned more social images than men. Yet, no gender differences were found for cued recall of non-social images. Education level and time emerged as noteworthy factors in assessing these gender differences.

But what drives consumers to make online endorsements? Based on the assumption that online brand endorsements serve identity-signaling goals, and that people with different self-construals seek to signal their identity in different ways, this research explores the relation between self-construal and people’s intention to endorse brands online in three studies. As brand endorsements are a way of signaling group membership with similarities among its members, and people with high interdependence seek to express similarity to and connectedness with others, we propose that interdependence has a positive effect on people’s intention to endorse brands online. Using two different measures, we demonstrate that a high level of interdependent self-construal indeed positively affects consumers’ intention to endorse brands online (studies 1 & 2) and that this effect is mediated by an increased perception of brand symbolism (study 3).",Research Exploring Individual Differences,Information Systems

In addition, it was the first to examine the mediating role of ad-specific persuasion knowledge and the moderating role of mood. An experiment (N = 127) showed a moderated mediation effect: advergame disclosures increased ad-specific persuasion knowledge, which resulted in higher brand recall, but also in more negative brand attitudes. This mediated effect was only significant for people in positive moods: a disclosure raised awareness of the advergame’s persuasive nature which subsequently led to more critical processing. People in negative moods already processed the advergame in a critical manner.

Part of this successful message propagation depends on the intention of speakers to promote their ideas, particularly by thinking about how listeners will receive those ideas. Previous fMRI studies show that neural activity within brain systems associated with mentalizing about others can predict the ability of a speaker to persuade a listener to rate a product or object as they do. Using this speaker-listener recommendation paradigm, the current study investigates whether this mentalizing activity in speakers can be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive, portable and flexible tool for neuroimaging.

Furthermore, theoretically-derived differences are hypothesized about the inferential mechanisms underlying the TPP targeting specific gendered perceived audiences. The time participants took to respond to the TPP questions were collected in 151 participants. The results support the predicted differences in response latency to the TPP questions, in line with SCID and gender-specific stereotypical schemas.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems
2015-0103,2015,Paper Session,Self-Affirmation Alters the Brain’s Response to Health Messages and Subsequent Behavior Change,11,"Health communications can be an effective way to increase positive health behaviors and decrease negative health behaviors; however, those at highest risk are often most defensive and least open to such messages. For example, increasing physical activity among sedentary individuals affects a wide range of important mental and physical health outcomes, but has proven a challenging task. Affirming core values (i.e., self-affirmation) prior to message exposure is a psychological technique that can increase the effectiveness of interventions; however, the precise mechanisms of affirmation’s effects remain unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural processes associated with affirmation effects during exposure to potentially threatening health messages. We focused on an a priori defined region of interest (ROI) in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region associated with self-related processing and positive valuation. Consistent with our hypotheses, those in the self-affirmation condition produced more activity in VMPFC during message receipt and went on to increase their activity levels more. These findings suggest that affirmation of core values may exert its effects by allowing at-risk individuals to see the self-relevance and value in otherwise threatening messages.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems
2015-0104,2015,Paper Session,Social Exclusion Increases Susceptibility to Persuasion Strategies That Appeal to the Need to Belong,3,"Two experiments tested whether social exclusion increases people's susceptibility to persuasion strategies that appeal to the need to belong. Socially excluded (vs. socially accepted) participants appeared to be more vulnerable to persuasion by advertisements using social proof tactics, arguably because they were on the hunt for social connection. Indeed, tactics that did not connote social connection (e.g., expert endorsement) were moot. The present work reveals how one of humans’ most fundamental motivations, the need to affiliate, influences people's vulnerability to persuasive communication, thereby contributing to a growing body of knowledge on social motivations driving consumer behavior.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems
2015-0105,2015,Paper Session,When Forewarnings Backfire: Self-Control Depletion Increases Persuasion by Brand Placements After Disclosure,3,"In our advertising-cluttered environment it has become common marketing practice to subtly integrate branded products in the content of mass media programming. To protect consumers against hidden advertising, European broadcasters are required to disclose the presence of brand placement in their television shows. Recent studies have shown that disclosures increase viewers’ persuasion knowledge, however, the circumstances under which disclosures may affect brand evaluations are still unclear. Two studies demonstrate that disclosures result in less favorable brand evaluations and increase resistance to brand placement influence for viewers high in self-control, but do not affect resistance, and even result in more, instead of less favorable brand evaluations when viewers’ self-control is low. Since a state of low self-control is perceived as the ‘couch-potato’ mindset in which people are likely to expose themselves to entertaining television content, the present findings imply that disclosures may be counterproductive in protecting viewers against hidden persuasion attempts.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

Regulations by the Federal Trade Commission require advertisers to explicitly inform consumers about the commercial nature of these posts. This study addresses the effects of sponsorship disclosures by means of an experiment with a 2 (no disclosure vs. sponsorship disclosure) x 2 (source: celebrity endorsers vs. brand) between subjects design. Results showed that 1) overall consumers persuasion knowledge of advertising on Facebook is well-developed; 2) a sponsorship disclosure only influences the use of persuasion knowledge when the posts is disseminated by a celebrity; and 3) a disclosure starts a process in which the recognition of advertising (i.e., the activation of conceptual persuasion knowledge) causes consumers to develop critical beliefs about the post (i.e., use of attitudinal persuasion knowledge), and in turn, decreases their intention to engage in electronic word-of-mouth.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

Across two experiments, utilizing different ways of manipulating cognitive abstraction, we demonstrate that participants who receive an induced bridging technique are more likely to produce cognitive bridging outputs and have more abstract responses than participants who did not receive a bridging technique. Alternatively, we do not find these results among participants who experience an integrated bridging technique. Theoretically, this provides evidence for the induced process, rather than the integrated process, of construal level influence on cognitive bridging. This article replicates and extends earlier work on cognitive bridging, and it concludes with implications for the design of persuasive messages.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

Failure to Demonstrate a Benefit of Stereoscopic 3D for User Experience and Performance in Digital Games",4,"With the mainstream availability of stereoscopic 3D display technology, there is a strong interest in its potential added value in user experience, especially for games featuring three-dimensional virtual environments. We conducted a total of three experiments: The first two studies investigated whether displaying a game in stereoscopic 3D, compared to HD and SD, would enhance basic user experience variables (e.g., enjoyment and presence). A third study was carried out looking into potential benefits of depth cues contained in stereoscopy on performance in a game requiring visuospatial abilities. The analyses of all three studies yielded no substantial impact of display mode on most of the subjective experience variables or objective performance measures. We conclude that stereoscopic 3D does not seem to be an important predictor of game enjoyment, perceived challenge, performance, presence, or character identification, but that there might be potential benefits when employing it to fulfill particular functions in gameplay.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

In order to provide a common ground for further interdisciplinary research, we propose a general model of experiencing virtual environments. The model builds upon automated and controlled processes of attention allocation and different modes of information processing. In line with this more general approach we propose a definition of presence, defining it as a psychological state that is attributed by an observer and characterized by focused attention allocation towards the virtual environment’s stimuli. The model assumes that virtual stimuli are processed similarly to real stimuli in that innate processing capacities are utilized. The relevance of research on breaks in presence is discussed as a methodological implication of the model.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

The present research employed a mail survey of inner city residents of a Midwestern state to analyze the sufficiency of the social cognitive theory (SCT) model of broadband adoption by testing it against variables drawn from the Model of Adoption of Technology in Households, Diffusion of Innovations, and the Unified Theory of the Acceptance and Utilization of Technology-2. The variables tested explained little additional variance in broadband intentions after accounting for SCT and demographic variables, arguing for the superior parsimony of the SCT model.

A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Immersive Technology on User Presence,2,"The concept of presence, or “being there” is a frequently emphasized factor in immersive mediated environments. It is often assumed that greater levels of immersive quality elicit higher levels of presence, in turn enhancing the effectiveness of a mediated experience. To investigate this assumption the current meta-analysis synthesizes decades of empirical research examining the effect of immersive system technology on user experiences of presence. Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies, it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized effect on presence. Additionally, results show that increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are significantly more impactful than improvements to most other immersive system features, including quality of visual and auditory content. These findings are discussed in light of theoretical accounts of the presence construct as well as practical implications for design.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

The present experiment manipulates normative information to be antisocial in a violent driving video game, through the use of experimenter instruction (game objectives) and confederate behavior (peer pressure). Results suggest that game objectives have the strongest influence on in-game behavior, but that this effect was strengthened or tempered by confederate pressure. In-game behavior mediates the manipulations’ influence on perceived norms and attitudes toward being a safe driver and passenger. Perceived norms and attitudes predict behavioral intentions to drive antisocially in the real world. Results indicate that communication of norms through media violence is a potentially important mechanism in antisocial media effects, and that focus on media behaviors with direct real-world corollaries may be a fruitful area of research.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

2015-0116,2015,Paper Session,Digital Manipulation in Advertising: Effects of Photo Retouching Disclosures on Consumer Responses,2,"Photo retouching in advertising has raised serious concerns for public health and the general issue of truth in advertising. In response, parties in society, propose that digitally enhanced advertisements should carry a label, informing consumers whether the image has been manipulated. The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge on the effects of photo retouching disclosures and literacy treatments on the processing of digitally manipulated advertisements and persuasion outcomes. The results of two experiments show that 1) photo-retouching literacy treatments attenuate persuasion by advertisements including manipulated images, 2) photo-retouching disclosures are only effective when people have not received a literacy treatment. Theoretically this implies that increasing people’s knowledge of a persuasion technique (i.e., photo retouching) raises their defenses against persuasion. Practically, our results imply that literacy treatments can be used to offset unfair persuasion by photo-retouched images in advertising, but that disclosures can be just as effective.",Processes Underlying Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Information Systems

Previous research indicates that advertisements featuring gay imagery may have a negative influence on audiences in terms of purchasing behavior and attitudes towards the brand. The current study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which consumer attitudes are affected through the use of psychophysiological measures. In a within subjects design, participants were exposed to conceptually matched advertisements featuring same-sex couples or different-sex couples while heart rate and facial EMG activity were collected and time-locked to the ads. Self-report data were collected following each ad and an Implicit Association Test was conducted after all ads were viewed.

2015-0118,2015,Paper Session,Effect of Interactive Advertising on Large Display,3,"This paper describes current research in the field of interactive advertising on a large public display with interactivity (gesture interaction) and self-representation (avatar self-presence). The core of this research is based on an interaction concept of a large display like digital signage. The emerging means of interacting with these screens usually employ gesture interactivity and self-reflection in conjunction with media in public spaces; the gesture interactivity and self-reflected image are independent variables, and attitudes toward advertising, brand, and purchase intention are dependent variables for this study. Consequently, this research explores the following hypotheses: 1) experience with interactive advertising improves users’ psychological effects, including presence, emotions, and attitude change; 2) interactive advertising is significant to the advertisement’s effectiveness; 3) in interactive media, gesture interactivity produces stronger psychological effects and advertisement effectiveness than avatar self-representation; and 4) psychological effects mediate between display advertising and advertisement effectiveness.",Processes Underlying Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Information Systems

Creative media advertising may be the solution they are looking for. Only a few studies have examined the effectiveness of this advertising type, though with promising results. This study extends previous findings on the persuasive impact of creative media advertising and, based on Schema Theory, tests three potential underlying processes (i.e., perceived: surprise, persuasive intent, and humour). In a field experiment, 78 participants were exposed to one of the media advertising conditions (creative vs. traditional). The results revealed a positive direct effect of exposure to a creative (vs. traditional) media ad on cognitive responses (i.e., brand recall and recognition). Also, was the creative media ad perceived as more surprising, persuasive, and humorous.

The results revealed that while behaviorally targeted online ads do have a positive direct effect on purchase intention, exposure to behavioral tailoring also sets off a negative indirect effect on purchase intention that attenuates the positive direct effect. This reduction of purchase intention can be attributed to the creepiness factor –the sense that marketers are tracking an individual’s personal information or online activities. Exposure to behaviorally tailored ads led to increased perceived creepiness, which led to increased threat, increased reactance, negative attitudes toward the ad, and ultimately negative purchase intention toward the featured product. The overall effect on purchase intention was reduced by five percent, indicating that the creepy aspects of behavioral tailoring have a real cost for marketers.",Processes Underlying Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Information Systems

Eating while using media is one of the most commonly reported multitasking activities, regardless of age. Research on multitasking and food intake has found that such inattentive eating has important effects.However, another possibility is that emotional arousal from the multitasking stimuli can be carried over to the eating behavior (Wang & Lang, 2012), causing more mindless or heuristic eating behavior.

Likewise, estimated time duration in minutes also was longer in the high-entertainment condition than the low-entertainment condition. In addition, activity-switching had a significant effect on time passage and time duration. In comparison to the low-entertainment condition, participants perceived time to pass quickly and estimated longer time duration when switching between the low- and high-entertainment activities. Further, individual differences in multitasking habits and preferences were found to be negatively correlated with time duration estimation, suggesting automatic cognitive adjustments by chronic multitaskers to offset time distortions associated with multitasking.

In a sample of college students, we examined positive affect, arousal and productivity as motivations of multitasking. Further, we introduced a fourth construct, passage of time, which was evaluated on a continuum from “time stood still” to “time flew by” (Gable & Poole, 2012). Time passage was introduced to examine absorbing multitasking experiences that create the sensation of loss of time, which is typical in flow experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

Multitasking and task-switching are demanding and complex behaviors that can be measured more accurately in real time.

We investigate how using pornography is related to masturbatory practice as well as to couples’ sexual interaction to shed light on how exactly relationship status influences the frequency of pornography consumption. The results show that the frequency of masturbation predicts that of watching pornographic material. However, masturbation does not decline among women in committed relationships and it only slightly declines among men. A committed relationship marked by intense sexual interaction can even contribute to increasing the frequency of masturbation and hence the consumption of pornographic material.

2015-0140,2015,Paper Session,A Mixture Model of Global Internet Capacity Distributions,2,"This paper develops a preferential attachment based mixture model of global Internet bandwidth and investigates it in the context of observed bandwidth distributions between 2002 and 2011. Our longitudinal analysis shows, among other things, that the bandwidth share distributions – and thus bandwidth differences – exhibit considerable path dependence where country proportions of international bandwidth in 2011 can be substantially accounted for by a preferential attachment based mixture of micro-level processes. Interestingly, our preferential attachment model, consistent with empirical data, does not predict increasing concentration of bandwidth within top ranked countries. We argue that recognizing the strong, but nuanced, historical inertia of bandwidth distributions is helpful in better discriminating among competing theoretical perspectives on the global digital divide as well as in clarifying policy discussions related to gaps between bandwidth rich and bandwidth poor countries.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2015-0142,2015,Paper Session,Factors Driving Adoption and Diffusion of Multiscreen Services,3,"As convergence technologies undergo swift advancement, multi-screen services are rapidly gaining popularity. The emergence of multi-screen services, and users’ simultaneous and sequential engagement with multiple devices throughout the day, has challenged marketers to develop effective communication strategies. In light of such rapid development, this study analyzes user behavior with regard to multi-screen services, focusing in particular on the antecedents of user intention. It also examines the diffusion model with regard to market dissemination of the multi-screen. A multi-state analytic approach was also proposed, whereby the research model was tested using structural equation modeling; the results were used as inputs for a neural network model to predict multi-screen adoption. The findings indicate that multi-screen quality significantly influences usability, which subsequently affects adoption of the technology. The policy and managerial implications of multi-screen development are discussed based on models of acceptance and diffusion. This study provides in-depth analysis and heuristic data on user drivers, market dynamics, and policy implications within the multi-screen ecosystem.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Two experiments demonstrate that choice environments offering options in smaller sets lead users to be more likely to select news content, in particular “hard news” content such as stories related to international politics. A third study incorporates theories of information processing to explain the observed effects of choice environment. The study provides evidence that smaller sets of options lead users to compare the merits of each option while larger sets prompts users to quickly scan the environment for an acceptable option. A consideration of the selection behavior observed in these studies reveals that greater numbers of available options in the media environment actually decrease the diversity of selection behavior among a population. These findings suggest that subtle changes to the media choice environment, such as a change in the number of headlines presented on news websites, can have large effects on news selection behavior.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0144,2015,Paper Session,"Incidental and Deliberate Cues, Credibility, and Impression Formation on YouTube",3,"Modern web pages, particularly social network sites (SNS) continue to prominently display user-data. Research in the fields of communication technology and interpersonal communication have explored effects of numerous system-generated cues (e.g., Facebook friends, Amazon star ratings, YouTube view counts). However, despite the prevalence of system-displayed, aggregate-user representation cues, there is little research that differentiates and compares their effects. This study utilized YouTube's behavioral and evaluative system-generated cue sets and found support for bandwagon effects and heuristic processing (MAIN Model). The 4 [view count] x 4 [thumbs up proportion] factorial experiment showed that message credibility, website credibility, and a target's trustworthiness, competence, and task attractiveness increased as the thumbs up proportions increased. No effect was found for manipulations of view count. These results suggest that system-generated cues may only affect judgments via the direct signal of the information, and that more complex inferences may not be used in interpreting cues online.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Three newspapers (one elite; two popular) were investigated: one daily issue every six months -- over 6000 news items. Seven dependent variables were scored (testing seven hypotheses): number of news items & pages; information vs. analysis/commentary; item length; number of visuals; frequency of future/speculative news; soft/general/hard news; internet motifs (e.g.""links""). Ten journalists/editors were surveyed as well. The Findings show a clear pattern of adaptation, although not always in the direction hypothesized.

targeted at young users, an important question is to what extent children are able to perceive
S3D and which factors determine this ability. To answer this question, we conducted an

variables such as age, gender and experience with S3D, we considered cognitive variables
including interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) and anthropometric variables including
interpupillary distance (IPD) and head circumference. In line with previous findings, our
results suggest that older children are better at perceiving S3D. Moreover, a stepwise
regression analysis revealed that IHTT, rather than age or IPD, explains most of the variance
in S3D accuracy rates. Our findings suggest that at early ages, the ability to perceive S3D
seems to be largely mediated through developmental cognitive factors such as IHTT, rather than anthropometric variables.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

A Conceptual and Empirical Comparison Between Television Viewing Rates and Twitter Data for TV Audience Research,6,"Social media platforms, such as Twitter, are changing the way people consume broadcast television media. For producers, social media metrics provide new insights and challenge incumbent measuring instruments, such as viewing rates. Within academia, Twitter’s relevance for audience research has developed only recently, whereby both opportunities and pitfalls are defined. In this paper, we depart from the idea that viewing rates and Twitter data enrich one another. We provide a conceptual and empirical comparison between both measures. Twitter data deepens our understanding of the viewing audience and viewing rates concurrently allow us to account for the relative importance of the tweeting audience. The data shows interesting inverse relations between ratings and Twitter traction for particular television programs, revealing low ratings in conjunction with high traction on Twitter and vice versa.

The Influence of Social Motives and Expected Outcomes on the Usage of Social TV Applications",4,"Social TV applications have become increasingly popular. Building on first results on motives for usage, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of factors that influence the likelihood of using Social TV applications. A special focus lay on the identification of the relative impact of social variables such as social motives as well as expected social outcomes in the sense of social gratifications. An online survey of Social TV users (N = 101) demonstrated that frequency of Social TV usage is not predicted by socio-demographic variables like gender and age, nor by personality aspects like extraversion or need to belong. However, the motives to communicate with others, to inform oneself and to be entertained as well as the perceived social gratification of increased enjoyment were influential. When predicting usage frequency of specific platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp, however, different patterns emerge.

The goal of our study is to analyze how terms of privacy are interactively negotiated in cases of mobile phone calls in the presence of others. In contrast to previous studies, our focus lies on the embedding of phone calls into social situations. This does not only entail the phone call itself and what happens meanwhile, but also interaction before (prequel) as well as after (sequel) the telephone conversation. Within a grounded theory approach, we combine theories about telephone conversation with Irwin Altman’s (1975) privacy concept and study privacy behavior with the help of conversation analysis and participant observation.

In this study we distributed an online survey to 70 participants in search of differences between relationship type (long-distance vs. geographically close) across the frequency of media use, perceived intimacy and media utility, and affect. Our results suggest that individuals in long-distance relationships send more text-messages, videos through photo messaging, and spend more time video chatting and on the phone with their significant others than those in geographically close relationships. Those in long-distance relationships also viewed texting, emailing, and video chatting as more useful in maintaining and building their romantic relationship than did geographically close counterparts. A disclosure task and subsequent language analysis found that individuals in long-distance relationships tend to use more negative affect, sad words, anger terms, and third-person pronouns, but fewer “we” words when asked to describe their feelings about their relationship based on communication activities.

The first aim of this study was to test how gender composition affects self-disclosure in CMC. Furthermore, this study aims to compare text-based CMC and audiovisual CMC to test whether there is more self-disclosure in text based CMC compared to audiovisual CMC or face-to-face interaction and whether there is an interaction effect of communication condition and gender composition on self-disclosure. Therefore, 132 dyads (female-female, male-male, cross-sex) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: text-based CMC, audiovisual CMC, and face-to-face communication. Preliminary results showed a direct effect of gender composition on intimate self-disclosure and an interaction effect for intermediate self-disclosure: within the cross-sex dyads, those who communicated via text-based CMC, disclosed more personal information than same-sex dyads communicating via audiovisual CMC or face-to-face.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Others, however, have expressed skepticism that online deliberation can achieve these goals, and still others have viewed online methods as amplifying inequalities in participation. Additionally, there are a number of other variables that can affect participation equality in different deliberative modes, such as education, age, group size and group composition. This paper presents a quantitative analysis and comparison of the volume of face to face and online contributions by participants in a large-scale, data-rich random assignment national deliberation experiment that allows for within-group and cross-modal comparisons. We find no negative online effects on participation equality related to gender, age, or educational level.

Using structural equation modeling, the study investigated the effects of two main characteristics of the network society - social network and empowerment - on subjective well-being. To construct a model of well-being, 2199 respondents of the U.S. population were sampled from the 2010-2012 World Values Survey data. Responses to the selected fifteen questions in the survey were then incorporated into the structural equation system to predict one's subjective well-being. SPSS, PRELIS, and LISREL 9.1 were used to perform data analyses under the assumptions of maximum likelihood estimates.

They have to adapt to a constant (re-)invention of ICTs which means to continuously cope with new media technology, formats, communication dynamics and content. This paper elaborates on how individuals are coping with media change in regard of nostalgic engagement with their media past. Results of an online survey show that an active and social way of coping leads to a positive assessment of media change and does not facilitate media nostalgia. The contrary appears when individuals are denying change and are avoiding the problems they are facing in processes of media change. In these cases media nostalgia paves the way for disengaging coping strategies that help to turn away from the problem to comforting nostalgic memories treasured in one´s past life span which explains a negative attitude towards media change.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

In this way, it is hypothesized that using traditional media of Nordic countries is negatively correlated with sex bias while using traditional media of East Asia is linked with more and using ICT reduces bias. To examine these hypotheses, data from the 5th wave of World Value Survey collected from 2005 to 2008 are analyzed.

As evidence demonstrating the anthropogenic influence on the Earth’s climate has steadily grown stronger, climate change has come to be seen as a pre-eminent challenge of the 21st century. Until recently, most discourse regarding potential responses to anthropogenic climate change have focused on two categories of response options 1) emission mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and 2) human adaptation to a changing world (Mercer, Keith and Sharp, 2011). Geoengineering, a set of proposed large-scale technological fixes to reduce or neutralize greenhouse gas emissions, is a third emerging category of response to global climate change. This study seeks to understand which factors contribute, or alternatively, subtract from public acceptance of geoengineering through predictive hierarchical OLS regression modelling of public perceptions of a variety of factors including socio-demographics, value predispositions, and media use.

It was predicted that framing an environmental risk as a human health risk would improve persuasive outcomes of a message. Further, it was expected that similarity between the audience and the people and places depicted in the message would also improve message outcomes. Two types of similarity (demographic similarity and scene similarity) were manipulated in a 2 (risk frame: health, environmental) × 2 (demographic similarity: high, low) × 2 (scene similarity: high, low) between-subjects experiment (N = 568), in which participants were exposed to a message about drought framed as either a health or an environmental risk. Scene similarity interacted with message frame (health vs. environmental) for narrative persuasion and behavior-related variables. Specifically, high (versus low) scene similarity resulted in better persuasive outcomes for the health frame than for the environmental frame, whereas low (versus high) scene similarity resulted in better persuasive outcomes for the environmental frame than for the health frame. Additionally, the study found that framing an environmental risk as a health risk increased behavioral intention and behavioral expectation. Furthermore, high (versus low) personal relevance improved risk perception, narrative persuasion, behavioral intention and expectation, and response efficacy. The study has implications for health and environmental risk communication, particularly for impersonal risks that people perceive to be of low personal relevance, and opens up new avenues for research and practice in areas such as climate change communication and entertainment-education.

2015-0172,2015,Paper Session,"Hybridizing ""The Holy Space"": The Cultures of Unity and Dissent in the Cuban Media",1,"Much has been reported about the economic reforms currently underway in Cuba under the leadership of Raul Castro. Although the state continues to assert significant regulatory authority through licensure and taxation, certain swaths of the Cuban economy that were previously administered solely by the state are now operating in response to market variables. One sector of the economy conspicuously exempt from these processes of economic liberalization is Cuba’s state-run media. Understanding media production and consumption as sites of cultural contestation, this paper seeks to investigate the state of the contemporary Cuban media, including its political commitments and cultural imperatives. Based upon structured in-person interviews with key informants within the Cuban government, the paper seeks to address the central research question of whether, and in what ways, the Cuban government’s continued pursuit of its revolutionary national identity is jeapordized by the changing economic and cultural logics of Cuba’s media system.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This intentionally developed regional cuisine is analyzed through the work of three chefs who are noted practitioners of HRC. Linking the backgrounds of these chefs with their recipes examines the impact of global cultural flows on the production of cosmopolitan cuisine. A number of “cosmopolitanizing strategies” are interrogated that position HRC concurrently within multiple registers: global, regional and local. Examples of these crosscutting strategies include disruption, performance, and hybridization. The hybridity present in HRC, as a central cosmopolitanizing strategy, both incorporates but also reaches beyond the local. HRC is discussed as a contact zone where waves of commodity, culture, and tradition collide to form an engineered regional cuisine to wash up along global shores.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2015-0175,2015,Paper Session,One World and Still Many Gaps: A Topological Analysis of Audiovisual and Digital Developments in the Mercosur Region.,1,"This paper relates questions of power in governing communications to space and place. The argument developed is that policy documents contain a geographical dimension and thus reflect border-crossing practices of policy-making as shaped through existing international power constellations. The first part of this paper deals with the question of how geographical content is traceable in documents and brings to the fore underlying power geographies. A new framework of ‘rooting’ policy documents geographically and identifying ‘routed’ policy texts, ideas and settings is established for that purpose. In the second part, the documents from the Audiovisual (AMP) and the Digital (DMP) MERCOSUR Program are ‘geographically rooted’ and that way shown how space, nation-state and power interrelate in the design of the texts. These two cases are particularly interesting for this type of analyzes as they are first, international by nature and second, display the development of both regional audiovisual and digital policies in the MERCOSUR (Common Southern Market). Herby, the AMP stands for the cultural shaping of the MERCOSUR, whilst the DMP represents the drive for technological and economic development of the region. The analysis reveals the structure of border-crossing interactions in the development of communication policies in the MERCOSUR and displays their different scales of influence for the implementation of the ideas promoted through these inter-regional programs. The diffusion of certain understandings regarding communication policies from one geographical setting into others becomes evident as mode of multi-level governance of communicative spaces in the MERCOSUR. The regional level promotes the construction of communicative spaces through principles from outside the region and the necessity to implement these to foster the development of the audiovisual and digital sector. The analysis of each program brings to the fore different scales, as well as the missing links to policy developments in other emerging regional settings and reveals the still existing opportunity gap for the governance of communicative spaces all over the world.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Youth participation in the production of public culture is analyzed as a performance of cultural citizenship and, thus, a means of affecting social change. Such change is mediated by the creation of discursive social spaces of consuming and producing satire, as this social space (or public) becomes the site of forging new identities of political dissent. I argue that the emergence of the web as a participatory medium and a competing cultural form is giving rise to new articulations of dissenting political culture through the enabling of (counter)publics, and the invitation of glocal, cosmopolitan practices of cultural citizenship.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

From this rubric, one video detailing a clinic visit was produced, screened for a diverse audience and evaluated for its efficacy. This video utilized only images to convey information in an attempt to circumvent the confusion that may result while viewing media in a foreign language. Communication theories and strategies such as the Sabido method of edutainment and social cognitive theory guided the filmmaking process. Although, it is impossible to create a universally comprehensible text, the development of potentially transcultural media helped identify key issues that should be carefully considered. Effective intercultural communication strategies and an awareness of cultural concerns factored into decisions on representations of gender and nationality, shot composition and editing, as well as the use of positive, negative and transitional characters. This task resulted in both a rubric for media production as well as a reflection on transcultural communication in a broader context. Post-screening results across varying cultures showed an improvement in knowledge of clinic procedures and protocol.

It uses a communication infrastructure approach and argues that place-based communication resources, including neighborhood interpersonal conversation, geo-ethnic media, and local organizations, have the potential to promote multiethnic intergroup contact and increase perceived interaction quality by forging a sense of neighborhood belonging. Using survey data collected from a multiethnic community, structural equation modeling is employed to test the relationship paths among residents’ connection to place-based communication resources, their level of neighborhood belonging, out-group contact frequency and perceived interaction quality across six interactional dyads. Findings suggest an ethnicity-based divergence in terms of how place-based communication impacts multiethnic intergroup interaction.

This study used structural equation modeling to examine background homophily and global shared social identity and teacher credibility as potential mediators between teacher communication behaviors and instructional communication outcomes. In terms of teacher credibility, results indicated that teacher credibility was positively associated with learner empowerment and affective learning. Teacher clarity and confirmation behaviors positively predicted perceptions of teacher credibility, while teacher self-disclosure negatively predicted teacher credibility. In terms of teacher communication behaviors, content relevance positively predicted students’ perceptions of background homophily and global shared social identity, but self-disclosure negatively predicted perceptions of background homophily and global shared social identity. In terms of mediation, teacher credibility mediated the relationship among teacher clarity and confirmation to learner empowerment and affective learning.

This project adds to the intergenerational communication literature by examining the modern workplace from the perspective of young adults who organizationally outrank chronologically older co-workers. Through 30 qualitative interviews, we found a tension that emerged regarding younger employees who manage older co-workers. Contributing to this tension were discussions regarding off-time career progression, respect, and professionalism.

However, researchers have only recently started to explore whether mediated contact with one group can affect attitudes towards other groups that a recipient was not exposed to (Joyce & Harwood, 2014). This effort seems to be of utmost relevance as such an attitude transfer might help to improve intergroup relations in contexts with high levels of self-imposed segregation. I aim to extend the initial findings from Joyce and Harwood (2014) by conducting the first two observational studies on Secondary Transfer Effects of Mediated Intergroup Contact.

However, research in Psychology shows the opposite--that most self-report measures are noncongeneric and can yield spurious correlations between construct variables. In this study, the PRCA-24 was submitted to confirmatory factor analysis to test these assumptions. Results show that the PRCA-24 stands out as one of few self-report measures to meet the criteria for congenericity.

This investigation examined the cues that untrained persons used when attempting to detect lies and compared their subjective observations to the objective cues observed in videotaped lies. The results suggest a vast number of different cues were judged to be diagnostic of deception, most prominently hesitations (or lack thereof), the amount of detail provided, eye contact, and a general truthful demeanor.

Given Wikipedia’s model of open editing and open contribution, it would be logical to expect that definitions of globalization across different languages reflect variations related to diverse cultural contexts and collective writing. Results show, however, more similarities than differences across languages, demonstrated by an overall pattern of economic framing of the term, and an over-reliance on English language sources.

This study examines the challenging sides of volunteerism for social change in its analysis of the ways in which institutional forces pose difficulties to meaningful volunteerism. Drawing on institutional theory, this essay reports results from several types of data: semi-structured interviews with the volunteers of a U.S. food pantry, observations from the visit of a local food bank, and observations from a meeting of local food assistance organizations. Data analysis revealed that: (a) institutionalized mentalities challenge meaningful volunteerism through mainstream cultural discourses, (b) institutions contest volunteerism by creating complex dependencies for the volunteer organization, and (c) institutional endurance limits creative solutions to the problems of the volunteer organization. The results reveal that institutions contest volunteer meanings by complicating volunteer-related communication processes.

Twitter, Media Visibility, and Electoral Support in the Last Luxembourg National Election",1,"In many ways Luxembourg constitutes an interesting test lab for the role of social media: There is only a one national TV Channel, the few newspapers are aligned to party positions. The parliament has only 60 seats. In such an environment, it is easy to track the social media activities of all candidates and parties. Adding to that, Luxembourg shows the highest degree of internet penetration in the European Union, more than 93% of the population are online.
Recent studies suggest, that internet activities in general and social media activities in specific foster electoral success. It seems that especially twitter is an effective tool to mobilize voters to vote for specific candidates against the order of party list. Likewise it is a channel of communication, that enables the candidates to bypass the journalistic gatekeepers, especially in the given media landscape, characterized by a substantial degree of political parallelism.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0207,2015,Paper Session,Who Cares About Privacy? The Relationship of Internet Skills and Attitudes About Online Privacy,1,"While research has looked at people’s understanding of privacy in digital environments, most of this research has relied on survey data. Such methods are helpful for identifying general trends, but they are less well suited to understanding at a greater depth how people think about privacy issues, and how their approaches may or may not influence their online behavior. To address this gap in the literature, we draw on focus group interviews we conducted in summer 2014 with college undergraduates and graduate students about their Internet uses and how they think – or not – about privacy issues in this context. We will present a poster with our findings.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology

The purpose of this work is to develop and test an interactive cognitive task delivered through mobile technology that shifts construal level, or how abstractly an individual is thinking. The task is called mCL (mobile construal level). While, construal level has been manipulated in the laboratory (Freitas, Gollwitzer, & Trope, 2004; Wakslak & Trope, 2009), this is the first study to develop and test an application designed to shift construal level through mobile technology in the field.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0209,2015,Paper Session,Digital Media Use and Participation Leadership in Social Protests: The Case of Tiananmen Commemoration in Hong Kong,2,"During the process of social mobilization for contentious collective actions, some ordinary citizens may play the role of participation leaders by making an early participation decision and calling upon others to join the collective action. This study extends the literature on the impact of digital media on political participation by examining if digital media can influence not whether individuals would participate in a protest or not, but whether people would take up the role of participation leaders. Using the annual rally in Hong Kong commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen movement in China as a case study, usage of Facebook, microblogging services, and online alternative media are found to contribute to online political communication activities, which in turn lead to participation leadership. Further analysis shows that the impact of online political communication activities on participation leadership exists only among the young rally participants. Implications of the findings are discussed.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0210,2015,Paper Session,Far-Right Extremist Online Discussions of Government Actions,5,"Far-right extremism in the United States has received relatively little research attention, even though far-right extremists have committed a high number of violent crimes and law enforcement officials consider far-right, specifically anti-government, movements among the most serious terrorist threats. Using the online communities of practice concept, we conducted qualitative analysis of how members of two online forums affiliated with the militia movement and the sovereign citizen movement discussed three government actions that explicitly or implicitly targeted these movements. We found evidence of group identity enhancement, violence justification, information sharing, and leadership—traditional indicators of online communities and/or extremist online communication. Additionally, we developed the concept of community sustainment, or efforts and means through which online communities maintain themselves. Most significantly, we found evidence to support perhaps the first theoretical framework for understanding how extremist online communities function when discussing government actions against movements, which may aid future online extremism research.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0211,2015,Paper Session,Abstract Message Construal: A Situated Cognition Approach,1,"Research on abstract mental representations relates the abstraction of concepts, actions, and objects to abstract evaluative dimension like morals, ideologies, and higher-order categories such as desirability and goal-orientation. From a situated cognition perspective the current research predicts that positive mood, individual propensity for abstract action identification, and collectivistic and long-term oriented cultures show more abstraction of a persuasive message that supports blood donation and consequently more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions to donate blood. In an experiment participants from the U.S. and Germany (N =152) were mood induced and read a short message in support of blood donation. The German subsample showed more message abstraction and abstract action identification levels. Cultural difference also related to attitude outcomes in the hypothesized manner. The cultural impact was mediated by the action identification level but not by how abstract participants construed the message. Perspectives for media effects research and methodological issues are discussed.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems
2015-0212,2015,Paper Session,Are Virtual Embodiments Perceived Distinctly From Sources? The Bifurcation of Visual and Verbal Processing During Viewer Evaluation of Online Messages.,4,"There is some debate about how people process information online, particularly when it is associated with a virtual embodiment. This study utilized a 2 (advocate sex) X 2 (advocate image credibility) experimental design to examine the relative influence of the visual characteristics of the advocate associated with a persuasive message about illegal music downloading. The process model is tested with causal modeling techniques. The results are consistent with predictions showing that people process visual characteristics of images first and that this influences subsequently processed information such as associated text. Specifically, image characteristics influence attributions of anthropomorphism and sender credibility, which drive processing of subsequently processed information. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems
2015-0213,2015,Paper Session,Attentional Capacity and Flow Experiences: Examining the Attentional Component of Synchronization Theory,3,"Several decades of research has shed considerable light on the positive effects of flow experiences resulting from media exposure. However, little is known about the cognitive processes that result in flow. This may be due in part, by an over reliance on self-report measures of flow. In two experimental studies, we seek to overcome these issues by developing and validating the use of secondary task response times as an unobtrusive measure of flow. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our results show that response times are longest under the condition of flow compared to conditions of boredom and frustration. Consistent with the assumptions central to the synchronization theory of flow, this finding indicates that flow experiences during media exposure are indeed characterized by a process of highly focused attention. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the implications for the future development and application of media research on flow.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems

2015-0216,2015,Paper Session,Formally Modeling Attention Allocation in a Dynamic Media Environment,2,"Typical media multitasking takes place in dynamic and complex environments. These environments present communication researchers with a host of difficulties when attempting to understand how attention is allocated between different environmental tasks in the pursuit of multiple goals. In order to understand these complex task environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop formal (i.e., mathematical) models to account for the dynamic relationships between self-driven goals (endogenous motivations) and motivation activation attributable to the task environment (exogenous motivations). In order to begin developing these formal models for communication, the proposed paper will apply a variation of the channel changing model (ChaCha; Wang, 2014; Wang, Busemeyer, & Lang, 2006), to begin understanding how attention is dynamically allocated during media multitasking.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems
2015-0217,2015,Paper Session,Seducing Society: An Embodied Motivated Cognition Study in the Motivated Processing of Sexually Objectifying Content,1,"In recent decades, there has been a proliferation of sexually objectifying advertisements. The Internet has become a venue for these explicit ads, making it easier to access this content. This content has potentially damaging implications for both society’s treatment of women and branding’s attempts to reach its consumer in a meaningful way. This study examines the differences in processing of advertisements with varying levels of sexually objectifying content between men and women. The study employs a 2 (Gender of participant: female vs. male) X 3 (Level of sexual objectification: high, medium, low) X 4 (Commercial, repeated measures) x 3 (Order) mixed repeated-measures design to uncover psychophysiological and self-reported differences in the viewing experience.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems
2015-0218,2015,Paper Session,Reducing Resistance to a Loss-Framed Narrative Message About Binge Drinking,2,"The present study explores how activation of the self-concept and drinking habits (heavy-drinkers vs. light-drinkers) influence resistance to anti-binge drinking narrative PSAs. Four forms of resistance in narratives processing are conceptualized: counterarguing, challenging the realism of the story, psychological reactance, and negative emotions to message quality and content. The results indicate that in general, heavy drinkers are associated with more counterarguing compared to light drinkers. However, activating the self can decrease psychological reactance and negative emotions among both heavy and light drinkers. Self-activation also leads people to perceive the story as more realistic, but only among heavy drinkers. Mediation analysis reveals that the impacts of self-activation and habitual drinking behavior on one’s risk perception of binge drinking are fully mediated by psychological reactance and counterarguing. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems

Effects of Crowdsourcing on Perceived Credibility of Online Health Information,2,"Conceptualizing crowdsourcing as the system that allows users to collectively serve as the source of the content, this study examined the effects of crowdsourcing and an additional professional source layer on credibility judgments and behavioral intentions toward health messages. A 2 [crowdsourcing] × 2 [professional source] × 2 [Message topic] between-subjects online experiment (N = 189) found two indirect paths for the crowdsourcing effects. The crowd-as-source path suggests that crowdsourcing negatively affects content credibility and behavioral intentions through decreased perceived source trustworthiness and information completeness. In contrast, the self-as-source path indicates that crowdsourcing may have positive effects on perceived source trustworthiness via heightened perceived interactivity and sense of control. Finally, although the additional professional source on crowdsourcing sites raises perceived gatekeeping on the site, it does not have substantial influence on credibility judgments. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology
2015-0221,2015,Paper Session,Social TV for the Elderly: When Passive Coviewing Leads to a Better TV Watching Experience,3,"Challenges that the ageing global population faces include psychological distress, social isolation, and depression among the elderly. Due to the expensive cost and lack of resources for the treatment, active ageing (e.g., social interaction) via combined entertainment and social activities on social TV has been discussed as a new cost-effective prevention method. In this study, we report on an experiment that examined the effects of social TV (active vs. passive vs. traditional TV) on TV watching experiences among the elderly, including positive affect, enjoyment, perceived quality of social interaction, sense of belonging to the senior center, intention to participate in a community activity, and intention to use social TV in the future. The results (n = 144) showed significant main effects of passive social TV on positive affect, TV enjoyment, sense of belonging, and intention to participate in a community activity. In addition, the results of mediation analyses showed that positive affect mediated the effect of social TV on all the measured variables. Implications regarding the potential of social TV in enhancing the general well-being of the elderly and promoting active ageing are discussed.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology

The iNakba demonstrates the unique capabilities of new media in promoting the right to memory of a marginalized community. The presentation explicates the theoretical foundations of “the right to memory,” a recent addition to the growing literature on collective memory. A demonstration of the app on a poster and an accompanying screen will address three goals: an explication of a recently introduced and scarcely discussed term: the right to memory; a contextualization of the use of contemporary interactive and collaborative applications (commonly referred to as “social media”) as empowering tools for silenced memories of marginalized communities; and an application of the authors’ theory of “new” and “social” media based on a distinct characterization of these media and the ways they differ from their predecessors.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology

Interactivity is often touted as an important characteristic, but we do not know if it contributes to greater usage of online health campaigns. To address this issue, we content-analyzed 94 anti-drug websites in the US, in order to assess the extent to which they feature three dominant types of interactivity. This data was compared with website traffic data from Alexa.com. We discovered that the number of interactive gadgets and the total frequency of the three types of interactivity significantly predicted global ranking of the website as well as the number of daily page-views per visitor. The frequency of modality interactivity and the presence of source interactivity on the homepage were particularly useful in predicting website ranking.

2015-0224,2015,Paper Session,Persuasion Effects of Web Interactivity: A Meta-Analysis,2,"Web interactivity in recent years has attracted increasing academic attention. Unlike traditional media, online media can utilize lots of new functions including web interactivity to engage and interact with users. To examine the extent to which web interactivity can affect persuasion in prior research, we conducted a meta-analysis of 30 studies (N=5335) that met our selection criteria. The results reveal that high web interactivity is consistently more effective in eliciting users’ positive attitudes and intentions compared to low level of interactivity; with this said, users don’t necessarily form positive attitudes when there is too much interactivity. Despite the promise on persuading attitudes and intentions, no significant persuasion effect of web interactivity has been found on cognitive responses and memory. In addition, perceived interactivity shows a significantly larger persuasion effect as opposed to objective interactivity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this paper.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology
2015-0225,2015,Paper Session,Big Data or Small Stories? Exemplification and Interactivity Effects on Shaping Perceptions and Attitude of Social Issues,2,"With the rising popularity of “big data”, journalists are trying to integrate data-rich information into news content and to make them accessible to everyday news readers by accompanying them with exemplifying cases. But, these exemplars do not always fully capture the complexity of the data patterns, yet they end up playing an important role in shaping user perceptions of the issue. This study examines the effectiveness of interactivity in counteracting the strong exemplification effect through enhancing perceived vividness of, and user engagement with, data-rich information. A 2 (baserate-exemplar consistency) × 3 (presentational format) × 2 (issue topic) mixed-design experiment revealed that, compared to textual description and static visualization, interactive visualization is effective in motivating systematic processing of the baserate information, which positively influences accuracy of issue perception as well as personal attitude.

2015-0227,2015,Paper Session,"""I've Walked This Street"": Readings of ""Reality"" in Children's Reception of Fantasy",1,"This paper examines children’s perceptions of identifiable, ‘real’ elements in their reception of the Harry Potter series, focusing on how fantasy finds meaning in the lives of children because they connect with reality in reading fantasy. Notwithstanding the abundance of magical hexes, witches, and wand-waving that characterise the series, children’s talk is found to veer towards emotional matters, relationships and real-life elements. The paper argues that this propensity to extract touches of reality out of the world of fantasy, is not visible in aspirations towards an unreachable, ‘magic’ world hidden somewhere which children believe really exists, but rather by drawing out of the world of fantasy, elements of everyday life, complete with its characters, bonds, rapports, attachments and socio-cultural references. Analysing data from fieldwork with teen audiences of the Harry Potter series, this paper explores ways in which children find a sense of location, rooting and grounding in reading fantasy.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0228,2015,Paper Session,Bad Seed or Good Seed? A Content Analysis of the Main Antagonists in Walt Disney and Studio Ghibli Animated Films,2,"The purpose of this study is to examine the cultural difference in the portrayal of main antagonists between Walt Disney and Studio Ghibli animated films. We analyze whether main antagonists engage in both prosocial and aggressive behaviors (including physical, indirect, and verbal aggression). Moreover, we explore demographics of main antagonists and context of each aggressive and prosocial act initiated by a main antagonist. Results from a content analysis showed that main antagonists in Studio Ghibli tend to participate in both prosocial and aggressive behaviors, while those in Walt Disney tend to commit only aggressive behaviors to harm others. This study concludes that the difference in the portrayal of main antagonists between Walt Disney and Studio Ghibli animated films may reflect the difference between analytic and holistic thinking style.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Nevertheless, the dividing line between childhood and adulthood has become blurred since the mid-20th Century, in what Neil Postmancalled “the disappearance of childhood,” in part because of the emergence of a type of television which creates an artificial identity between children and adult worlds.
We chose two programmes as test cases: Junior Master Chef and Music School which were broadcast on Israel’s second commercial channel during 2011 and 2012. We conducted a structural-qualitative analysis following Gabaton (2001), deriving major theme-based categories reflecting the girls’ and boys’ world as opposed to that of adults. The study gave us new insights about the role of children on the small screen, as well as reflecting the changes in relations between children and adults in the Israeli family and society as a whole.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0230,2015,Paper Session,Learning From the “Blue Monster”: Children’s Reality Judgments and Transfer From TV to Real Life,2,"For preschoolers, transfer of educational material from TV to life is complicated by the blend of factual and fantasy content present in many shows. In this study, 70 3-5 year-olds watched an episode of Sesame Street about Hispanic culture (i.e., fiestas). Their reality judgments and comprehension of both factual and fantastical content were assessed after viewing. One week later, children helped plan a fiesta (assessing their transfer of learning), and were re-assessed on their reality judgments and content memory of the show. Results revealed a moderated indirect effect of age on transfer: older children remembered the content better than younger children, but were only more likely to transfer it if they gave it high reality ratings. Additionally, children’s fantasy orientation was negatively related to transfer. Generally, children gave low reality ratings to fantasy content and tended not to transfer it. Results are interpreted within Fisch’s capacity model.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Two hundred forty children and one of their parents/guardians completed extensive one-on-one interviews before and after an intervention. Participants recalled the produced materials (including Raya, a newly-introduced Muppet® who stresses latrine use, hand-washing, and sandal-wearing); however, intervention variations (one focused on personal objectives, the other on social objectives) were not detected. Results show that those exposed to either intervention, compared to those not exposed to the Sisimpur material, significantly improved across sanitation and hygiene variables. This intervention was successful, suggesting that media can impact children’s healthy development, even in a locale lacking access to even basic resources.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In addition to ASD researcher Baron-Cohen’s (2008) work on Hyper-Systemizing Theory, four information-processing media-based theories are profiled: Sweller’s (1988) Cognitive Load Theory, Lang’s (1992) Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing, Fisch’s (2004) Capacity Model, and Mayer’s (2001) Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. Elements of each theory, including germane cognitive load, linkage to existing knowledge, small narrative distance, and dual-channel processing, are integrated to form a workable “hybrid theory of cognitive capacity and multimedia learning by high-systemizers” for use in further Thomas investigations.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

As part of a larger qualitative study on parental management of communication technology use among US children with significant communication impairments, this paper examines how parents of non-speaking and minimally-speaking children ages 3-13 (N = 20) interpret their child’s engagement with new media and popular culture as an expression of the very skills in which the dominant culture often presumes them to be deficient—specifically socioemotional, cognitive, and verbal aptitude. As a result, I discuss the need for public perceptions of both disability and children’s popular culture to shift away from having to do with deficit and deficiencies (i.e. disability as an individual lack of ability, kids’ media culture as lacking educational value) and instead towards more asset-oriented models.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The current study fills this gap by applying Self-Determination Theory to the context of playing in first-person shooter clans. 585 players of Counter-Strike clans were asked about their behaviors within their clans, the psychological needs clan-life potentially satisfies and the outcomes of playing in clans in terms of well-being. A path analysis shows that playing in a first-person shooter clan could help players to fulfill elementary psychological needs and at least in the short term induce well-being.

Results indicated high perceptual load of web browser game might act as ""attentional anchor"" that exhausts attentional capacity and induces distractor inhibition, resulting in ad devaluation and low ad recognition; low perceptual load enables free capacity to spill over to peripheral ads, resulting in mere-exposure effect, better recognition and less need for attentional control.",Game Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Prior research has identified two important factors that affect Hispanic women’s cervical cancer screening: descriptive norms and response efficacy. The perception of the prevalence and effectiveness of Pap tests, however, do not emerge from vacuums but likely from everyday neighborhood communication environment. This study examines 1) whether Hispanic women’s connections to local communication resources might affect their descriptive norms and response efficacy regarding Pap tests, and 2) whether such associations are mediated by women’s interpersonal discussion about health and their attention to information about Pap tests in the media. Findings of this study offered useful guidance for communication strategies in promoting cervical cancer screening in ethnic communities, and highlight the importance of a multilevel and ecological approach to health communication.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0243,2015,Paper Session,Mapping “Fields of Health Action” in Two Disadvantaged Urban Communities: Implications for Health Communication Interventions,2,"EXTENDED ABSTRACT
(575 words)

Based on analyses of multiple sources of data gathered as part of two larger, multi-year and multi-method research projects to address health disparities in two U.S. cities—a small urban community in the Northeast of the country and a larger urban center in the Southeast—this paper advances understanding of particular challenges that health interventions face in urban environments with different configurations. Both projects are guided by a socio-ecological approach to health communication and public health and, more specifically, by communication infrastructure theory (e.g., Ball-Rokeach, Kim, & Matei, 2001; Wilkin, 2013). Additionally, both projects are also guided by principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR).

Findings suggest that factors in residents’ material environment and their social construction of that environment (through everyday communication among residents, and between residents and local organizational actors) interact to produce a “field of health action” (Matsaganis & Golden, in press) within which healthcare- and health information-seeking behavior is enabled and constrained.

Methods

Both studies focused on how the social and built environments contribute to underutilization of healthcare services by residents. For this paper, we report on findings from a thematic analysis of qualitative data collected as part of each of the research projects (interviews, focus groups, community forum discussions, as well as ethnographic field observations).

In the community located in the large Southeastern city, 52 community members (14 male and 38 female; 12 were 18-35 years old; 30 were aged 36-64; 10 were 65 and older) participated in 2-2.5 hour community forum discussions. Additionally, 32 semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare workers at 1) a public hospital, 2) community clinics associated with the hospital, and 3) a federally qualified health center located within the community. Questions were designed to determine factors contributing to primary healthcare access disparities.

In the case of the smaller urban community in the Northeastern U.S., we draw on 105 semi-structured interviews conducted with 89 unique female attendees at 18 community health education events. Participants reported a median age of 49; 65% identified as African American (or as African American and some other ethno-racial group); 28% identified as White; 6% as Latino/a or Hispanic, and 1% as South Asian. We also draw on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with staff members of local CBOs (N = 20, representing nine CBOs).
Researchers from the two projects identified the “field of health action” characteristics that emerged from their respective projects. We compared and contrasted our general findings and accounted for differences in the focus of the two projects that could influence a more fine-grained analysis of the available data across both sites, interpretation, and conclusions. Subsequently, researchers from both projects engaged in a more systematic analysis of the data.

Findings & Conclusion

Four factors related to the “field of health action” of residents in both cities emerged as salient from our analysis: (1) actual availability of and perceptions of access to health resources, (2) transportation options, (3) communication resources (including interpersonal, media, and organizational) that aid health information and healthcare seeking, and (4) privacy concerns around healthcare-seeking. In discussing these factors, we highlight differences across the two urban communities studied.

Overall, our findings show how a city’s built and social environment, as well as policies that shape everyday life at the local level impact residents’ health. We also offer recommendations as to how to improve the design of public health strategies, health communication campaigns, and policy interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in residential community contexts.

One-hundred and three participants recruited from local medical clinics completed a survey that measured LMOPPC and WTC variables, satisfaction with the consultation and demographic information. Bivariate correlations revealed that patients who perceived their doctors to be more caring and compassionate were more willing to communicate during the consultation. Patient participation was positively associated with satisfaction with care. However, satisfaction with care was not associated with treatment adherence. Only perception of care and compassion and knowledge of health concern uniquely explained significant amounts of variance in patient participation (47% and 2% respectively). Patients who perceived their doctor to be more caring and compassionate, and who had less knowledge of their health concern were more likely to participate in the consultation.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Many studies have found a greater persuasive effect of narrative messages on attitudes and intentions toward the message argument compared to non-narrative messages. However, the detailed mechanism has not yet been clearly established. We propose a pathway of narrative persuasion based on the discussion of transportation theory and the extended elaboration likelihood model (E-ELM). Although there are mixed findings of the causal relationship of narrative mechanism, these theories give an insight about the relationship. We expect that identification might be a predictor of transportation, and counterargument might be come after transportation experience. Finally, these cognitive causal mechanisms lead to changes in attitude and behavior (identification > transportation > counterargument > attitude > intention). This study expects that the greater identification with story characters in narrative increase transportation experience that reduces counterargument against the message and promotes favorable attitude toward message argument, which is skin cancer detection behavior in this study. Finally, an individual’s attitude increases intention to engage in detection behaviors.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

DAs resulted in more accurate risk perceptions. This effect was moderated by numeracy for low-risk women. Exemplars improved accuracy of risk perceptions for low-risk women. Tailoring did not improve risk accuracy. For moderate to high-risk women, one DA condition increased intentions to begin screening at 40, but all DA conditions increased intentions to begin mammography at age 50 for low-risk women.

Findings of a controlled experiment (N = 303) suggested that sarcastic messages, as compared to non-humorous messages, resulted in less negative affect, more counterarguing, and decreased perceived argument strength. Ironic messages led to more counterarguing than non-humorous messages. Significant differences in counterarguing, perceived argument strength, and attitudes toward the risky behavior were also detected between the two humor types.

Yet, the ways in which these related constructs simultaneously influence one’s well-being outcomes, and how they are associated with each other, have not been closely examined. We investigate this question in the context of college students. Findings show that specific dimensions of personal networks – density and gender homophily – and social capital – offline bonding capital – explained perceived social support. Further, perceived social support consistently predicted higher well-being outcomes and played a mediating role between personal network density and subject well-being as well as between offline bonding capital and well-being. The results provide implications for a more nuanced understanding of the relative role of individuals’ interpersonal and social environments in well-being, including different structural aspects of personal networks, distinction between offline and online spheres, and different indicators of well-being outcomes.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Existing literature suggests that health education materials are more effective if they contain a narrative information format instead of the traditionally applied non-narrative information format. However, no previous studies have compared the effects of these formats in the context of school health education for low educated adolescents. This study compares the learning and persuasive effects of these information formats in a two-condition experiment with repeated measures. The experiment was conducted amongst 296 students of the two lowest levels of the Dutch secondary education system. Results showed immediate effects on knowledge and attitude, which did not differ between conditions and school levels. There were no effects on intention.

2015-0255,2015,Paper Session,Test of the Activation of Approach and Avoidance Motivations in Response to Health Messages,2,"Most extant work on health message processing assumes that people are motivated to either move toward a message-recommended behavior or away from it. Health message design has similarly focused on either increasing approach motivation or reducing avoidance motivation. This one-sided focus is based on the bipolar structuralization of motivational valence systems, in which an increase in positivity is equivalent to the decrease in negativity and thus the two cannot co-occur. The present research challenges this prevalent proposition by testing an alternative perspective—the bivariate model—in which these opposite motivations are hypothesized to be separable, and thus able to occur in both reciprocal and non-reciprocal ways. Findings from different analytical methods employed in this study (N=311, Mage=20.29; 67.5% female; 66.2% Caucasian, Stimuli=40 televised antidrug ads) demonstrate the presence of non-reciprocal activation patterns and provide empirical evidence of the merit of utilizing the bivariate framework in health communication research and practice.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A randomized experiment yielded results showing that depersonalized depictions are superior in promoting targeted policies relative to personalized depictions and a no message control group. Among the three dimensions of personalization, revealing the character’s inner states was most detrimental to audience’s narrative engagement, reducing levels of transportation, identification and empathy. Empathy fully mediated the impact of inner states description on policy support. We speculate that personalized depictions may be effective when the persuasion is aimed at attitudinal or behavioral change at individual level. However, personalization may impede the intended effects when the goal is to increase support for public policies aimed at changing social factors that influence health outcomes.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Three conceptual issues bear additional scrutiny in order to uncover when social norms impact action and the moderators of this relationship. First, the influence of financial incentives in normative systems remains a relatively unarticulated but potentially important point of theoretical development because there is reason to believe financial incentives might crowd out other sources of motivation. Second, a distinction has been made between perceived and collective social norms but the unique effect of each type of norm has not been well articulated nor tested empirically. Third, previous research has highlighted the important role of group identification in normative systems, but the empirical findings remain mixed.

Many questions exist, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-affirmation. We hypothesized that if affirmation exerts its effects through refocusing the individual on positive resources that offset the importance of threats, affirmation should be associated with increased activity within key regions of the brain’s valuation system, including the ventral striatum (VS) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Results of a region of interest analysis demonstrated that participants who were affirmed (relative to those who were unaffirmed) showed increased activity in VS and VMPFC when considering core values (compared to everyday activities), and that this effect was particularly strong for future orientated affirmations.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Countering the conventional framing of this issue as a matter of language incompatibility, an intergroup communication approach is proposed to investigate this phenomenon through two experiments. In the first experiment, American undergraduate students (N=90) evaluated three international TAs based on photographs alone and indicated a preference for the European TA over Asian TAs. A second experiment using video recorded narratives of the same international TAs found that a perspective taking intervention was able to eliminate the impact of the international TAs’ ethnicity on undergraduate students’ (N=125) evaluation of the TAs. Also, male students who engaged in imagine-target type of perspective taking had the most favorable attitudes towards the TAs, and were most willing to be supportive of all international TAs as compared to male students who engaged in imagine-self perspective taking or those in the control group. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in the light of social identity theory.",Instructional and Developmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Importantly, such an environment also allows the body movements of the participant in the virtual world to be tracked and recorded. In the following paper we discuss how tracked head movements were correlated with participants' reports of anxiety in a simulation of a computer classroom. Participants who reported a high sense of awareness of and concern about the other virtual people in the room showed different patterns of head movement from those who reported a low level of concern. We discuss the implications of this research for understanding nonverbal behavior associated with anxiety both in the classroom, and for the design of online educational systems.",Instructional and Developmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Analysis of a Cross-National Survey,3,"Against the background of the increasing political and economic influence of China and the Chinese government’s efforts on public diplomacy, this study examines the extent to which the publics in various countries are interested in news about China. Drawing upon a cross-national survey conducted in 10 countries in 2009 and 2010, the analysis shows that China has attracted a level of global public attention comparable to other regional powers in the world. At the national level, interest in news about China is significantly related to amount of news about China on a nation’s television newscasts and to trade volume between a nation and China. At the individual level, people with higher levels of education and income, as well as people who are more interested in the international political economy when consuming foreign news, are more likely to express an interest in news about China.

Based on recent findings and theoretical considerations, we compare the effects of the search results’ position in the results list to those of three credibility cues (website reputation, neutrality, and social recommendations) for two issues. The results of our study (N = 247) suggest a secondary role of credibility in selection processes. Most people rely on the given ranking: the higher the result is ranked, the more likely it is selected. An additional effect is only found for reputation, showing that high reputation results are more likely to be selected. Personal characteristics, like knowledge about the issues or search engine usage patterns, do not influence the preference for results linked with certain credibility cues. These findings are discussed in light of personal factors (e.g., involvement) and situational characteristics (e.g., low-cost situations).",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The results show that the agendas discussed by the Chinese people on micro-blogs are not significantly influenced by newspapers. In terms of the topics of the news, newspapers are more concerned with the Chinese economy and people's livelihood while micro-blogs are more concerned with political and legal reforms in China. As for media tone, newspapers are more likely to cover the event positively while micro-blogs tend to be negative.

To narrow this gap in the literature, this study investigates audience interaction and participation in a particular alternative media outlet, community radio sector in the United States. The analysis is based on case studies from two community radio stations in Texas through 5-year ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews with 70 individuals including programmers and listeners, and a listener survey with 131 respondents. The study suggests that community radio serve to facilitate the development of a genuine relationship between radio programmers and listeners, thus the formation of imagined communities.

What remains unclear in recent research on Terror Management Theory is if 1) the presentation of cultural goods directly after mortality salience is enough or if the buffer components still need to be activated and 2) if the activation of one buffer component is enough. Two studies investigated whether heavy metal music is able to serve as a cultural worldview buffer against existential anguish by using implicit measurements.

This preliminary effort will examine the multidimensional components of empathy, production techniques used to manipulate the story structure to guide the audience’ attention through shifting perspectives, character involvement constructs, and the varying dynamics of autobiographical memory. A particular type of autobiographical memory, termed involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM), is discussed. It is suggested here that narrative engagement entails a frequent oscillation between the narrative and real world, and that a crucial component of this oscillation includes IAMs triggered by specific components of trait empathy, production techniques, and story content. Importantly, it is suggested here that IAMs cued during narrative engagement enhance, rather than inhibit, immersion into the narrative and overall enjoyment.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

How Self-Distancing and Perspective-Taking Influence First- and Third-Person Perceptions,2,"Third- and first-person perceptions (TPPs/FPPs) are considered as biased judgments. We test whether self-distancing, i.e. adapting to a distanced position towards the self, and perspective-taking, i.e. thinking from another person’s point-of-view, decrease this bias. We apply this notion to the formation of TPPs and FPPs. In Study 1 (n = 790), we measure self-distancing and perspective-taking tendencies and find no support for a relationship with TPPs or FPPs. However, in Study 2 (n = 693) we manipulate both changes in perspective. We find no effects for a desirable media message, and, thus, on FPPs. For an undesirable stimulus, both self-distancing and perspective-taking boost perceived media influence on self. However, contrary to perspective-taking self-distancing also increases perceived influence on others. Thus, only perspective-taking absolutely reduces the bias in TPP compared to a control group. We discuss the mixed findings and their implications for the cognitive and motivational explanation of TPPs.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Participants primed with elevation (n = 58) scored significantly higher on a measure of elevation than those primed with happiness (n = 73) or boredom (n = 79). Being an inherently moral emotion, it was hypothesized that elevated participants (n = 117), compared to happy (n = 110) or bored (n = 134) participants, would be more persuaded by a morally framed ad than an amoral ad.

Participants’ similarity to a news protagonist (high/low) and subsequent interpersonal discussion (topic-related/topic-unrelated) were varied systematically. Interpersonal discussion quality was determined via a quantitative content analysis. As hypothesized, exposure to news featuring a protagonist who was similar to the participant resulted in higher news knowledge than exposure to news featuring a dissimilar protagonist. Interpersonal discussion quality predicted news knowledge. Knowledge was highest after high-quality topic-related discussions, followed by topic-unrelated discussions, and finally by low-quality topic-related discussions.

These complex worldviews are the focus of this experimental study, which explores how religious and scientific viewpoints influence perceptions of bias in news coverage about the issue.

Consistent with research on the hostile media perception, we find that those with strong preferences for either science or religion perceive news coverage about the issue as biased against them, even as the story is framed (focusing on conflict or compatibility) in terms that might appeal to a particular worldview.

Additionally, this study explores the relationships between perceptions of media influence on others, perceptions of bias, and the negative emotions that might arise from those perceptions.

This paper critically examines this through an in-depth case study of ‘Cablegate’ – the publication of stories relating to US diplomatic cables leaked through the digital whistleblowing platform Wikileaks. It finds that journalists actively ‘repaired’ narratives in line with elite source agendas (Bennett et al 1986).

2015-0304,2015,Paper Session,Self-Conscious Emotional Advertising: Beyond Fear Appeals,2,"Public service advertisements using negative emotions have mainly focused on inducing basic emotions such as fear. However, several other negative emotions can be used as well, such as anger (another basic emotion) and guilt and shame (self-conscious emotions). A systematic comparison investigating all these negative emotional ads is missing. This is surprising because it can be fruitful to study negative emotions in ads that are more self-involving than fear. Self-conscious emotions might be more involving because they motivate self-evaluations and thus might make more persuasive ads than fear ads. An experiment on condom use among adolescents confirmed that self-conscious emotional ads (inducing shame or guilt) were more persuasive than basic emotional ads (inducing fear or anger). This effect was especially pronounced for shame ads. It is concluded that when behaviour occurs in a social context, it can be effective to go beyond fear and use self-conscious emotional ads to persuade.",Emotion,Information Systems

The two competing hypotheses are posed: the motivational decay hypothesis and the consolidation interference hypothesis. Physiological, behavioral, and self-reported data was used to test the predictions. The results demonstrated higher levels of physiological arousal and higher levels of physiological and self-reported positivity and negativity when processing advertisements preceded by arousing positive and negative movie clips. The heart rate data showed that the appetitive motivational system facilitated higher cognitive effort (slower heart rate) and the aversive motivational system facilitated lower cognitive effort (faster heart rate). The state of cognitive overload was reached during the first 10 seconds of the ads following negative arousing clips while during ads following positive arousing clips the cognitive system was functioning at the maximum of its capacity.

From a technological perspective, Google’s dominance cannot be explained because the performance of the major search engines hardly differs. A possible explanation is the different branding of search engines. To test its influence, we investigated how the brand equity and result page evaluations are related. In an experimental online survey (N=400), college students evaluated one of four (manipulated) result pages. We confirmed our assumption that Google's brand equity is much higher than Bing's. However, the result pages were evaluated very similar. This suggest a differentiation between (a) global satisfaction with search engines and (b) satisfaction with search engine performance. Only for Google, we found that “trust” is related to the quality perception of its result page - a possible explanation for its global success.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0310,2015,Paper Session,“Tumblr is so Depressing”: Adolescents’ On- and Offline Sharing of Emotions,2,"Adolescents experience intense emotional experiences and fluctuations in their emotional state (Gilbert, 2012). Because of this emotional instability, they need to regulate their emotions (Olthof, 2005), for example by sharing their emotions with others. We already know that adolescents share emotions both off- and online. In addition, research (Choi & Toma, 2014) suggests that social sharing face-to-face might be better for one’s wellbeing, than for example on SNS. However, research on the process of adolescent social sharing via various interpersonal communication channels is still scarce. Therefore, this study tries to provide a deeper understanding of adolescents’ motivations to share specific emotions (both positive and negative ones), to certain persons (e.g. parents, other family members, friends, acquaintances, strangers, …) and via certain communication channels (e.g. talking face-to-face, calling, texting, posting on SNS, on a photo-sharing site, …) by conducting in-depth interviews with adolescents between 14 and 18 year old.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0311,2015,Paper Session,Broadcast Your Product: An Online Experiment on the Persuasive Effects of Product Reviews on YouTube,1,"This study deals with the persuasive effect of product reviews uploaded on YouTube. Until now little is known about product reviews in the form of a video on YouTube, which has been uploaded by a common user. To explore this web 2.0 phenomenon, a 2x2x2 online experiment has been conducted. The structure of argumentation (one-sided vs. two-sided), expertise (low vs. high) and the number of views (low vs. high) has been manipulated. To capture the persuasive effects, attitude towards the product, purchase intention, credibility, evaluation of the video and its perceived usefulness has been measured.
Results show that user concentrate on the arguments of a product review to evaluate the product and come to a decision. Product reviews without a contra argument results in a more positive attitude. Further on, experts are perceived as more credible than a layperson. To evaluate credibility, heuristic factors such as expertise and number of views are taken into account. The current study states new findings about product reviews on YouTube.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0312,2015,Paper Session,Information Search Behavior on a Brand Website,2,"This study attempts to understand the nature of information i.e., product or promotion related, that opinion leaders and opinion seekers consume from a company’s brand website. We also examine whether there are significant differences in these segments search behavior. For the analysis, we use a combination of clickstream and trait data provided by a popular sports nutrition firm in Japan. We find that while opinion leaders do not view product related content, those with high brand commitment view more promotional related content. Conversely, opinion seekers do not view promotional related content, those with high brand commitment view more product related content. The study develops a comprehensive framework to understand the information search behavior of these two segments and provides managers with a better understanding of how different segments consume different content.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology

2015-0314,2015,Paper Session,"Effects of Infographics on News Elaboration, Acquisition, and Evaluation",2,"The present study investigated how infographics may affect individuals’ news processing, focusing on multimodality and interactivity as its signature characteristics. News readers’ prior knowledge and issue involvement, which affect their ability and motivation to process information respectively, were considered as potential moderators. In a 3 (text vs. graphic vs. text + graphic) x 2 (hyperlinks vs. no hyperlinks) between-subjects experiment (N = 360), participants read a news article concerning economic issues. Adding graphics to the news heightened the extent to which they engaged in message-relevant thinking (i.e., news elaboration), albeit only among those with higher issue involvement. However, in-text hyperlinks hindered information recall among those with less prior knowledge, creating an information acquisition gap between more and less resourceful individuals. The graphical representation of news appeared to have heuristic appeals to those less involved in and less knowledgeable about the news topic, leading to more favorable news evaluations.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0315,2015,Paper Session,"Information and Communication Technologies, Overload, and Stress: The Contributors to and Impact of Information and Communication Overload",1,"Due to the proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs), overload with information and communication becomes a predominant phenomenon. Yet, very limited research has taken both the aspects of information and communication into consideration when studying overload. In addition, few studies have focused on the implications of various ICTs for information and communication overload especially outside a work-related context. This paper aims to fill these gaps by exploring and examining how use of various ICTs is associated with information and communication overload and how overload in turn affects stress outside the workplaces. Two types of overload—perceived information and communication overload and ICT use overload are conceptualized. A survey of college students at a Southwestern university reveals that the number of friends on social networking sites is the only factor that contributes to both types of overload. Only perceived information and communication overload is positively related to stress.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology

Particularly, the study focuses on the traits related with self-concept, given that motivations of using social network sites (SNS) are highly associated with self-concept. This includes self-esteem, two types of narcissism, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, in order to better assess the predictability of these factors, we consider other control variables in our investigation, drawing from both social psychology and SNS literature. The findings from the proposed study will expand our understanding of personality traits and their predictability to explain Facebook surveillance of former romantic partners.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0317,2015,Paper Session,Partisan Blame for the Partial Shutdown: A Big Data Analysis of Themes on Twitter During the 2013 United States Federal Government Partial Shutdown,5,"This study examines the extent to which blame or responsibility were assigned to general politicians and specific political parties during the 2013 U.S. Federal Government partial shutdown on the social media platform Twitter. Using computational linguistic software we collect a census of shutdown-related keyword geo-coded tweets from the 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia for the period surrounding the 2013 shutdown. We then conduct four side-by-side analyses in order to determine factors related to state-level volume of tweets with themes blaming politicians in general, Democrats or Republicans. While blame aimed at each group is strongly, significantly, and positively correlated to state population and congressional representation by party, we find interesting evidence of clear partisan divides when using OLS regression to predict the volume of blame or responsibility directed toward Democrats and Republicans at the aggregate state level.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0318,2015,Paper Session,Who am I?: The Performance and Governance of Self in Digital Communities,1,"This research seeks to reveal the effects of disembodiment through the performance of self in digital social communities. Its primary goal is to uncover the essence of the Digital Self as a modified real-world, embodied Self that is otherwise exposed to risk. It focuses particularly in arenas that facilitate the form and shape of a Digital Self through expressive digital elements, including avatars, emoticons, photo filters, and interactive social feedback buttons such as liking, upvoting, sharing or commenting.
The core hypotheses of this research is that the Digital Self, in its distancing and preservative venue, causes a reconfiguration of stake for the being, and in this reconfiguration there is a fundamental change in the necessity and meaning of truth as it relates to self-governance in digital communities.
The paper first establishes key concepts on disembodiment and the human experience on the internet from Heidegger, Dreyfus, Dourish, Winograd, and Flores. It then constructs a model for Self through application of Foucault’s work on parrhesia, rebuilt for the digital age.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0319,2015,Paper Session,"The Faster the Response, the Stronger the Bond? Dimensions of Relational Closeness and Texting Response Time",3,"One effect of asynchronous text messaging is that it affords the ability to delay responses. Previous research has showed that individuals tend to respond most quickly when texting with strong bonding ties. Nevertheless, given that relational closeness consists of several dimensions, it is possible that not all of these dimensions are equally associated with rapid texting response time. This paper investigates whether texting response time varies with several dimensions of relational closeness, and examines the utility of data sonification – transforming data into sound – as a tool for exploring time stamped data. We suspect that sonification is well suited to exploring time stamped interactional data, such as the mobile text messages that we use for our analysis. After using sonification to identify reoccurring patterns in our data, we further examine the statistical significance of these patterns using statistical methods to confirm their generalizability to the larger sample.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0320,2015,Paper Session,How Far Are You Willing to Share Your Personal Information?,1,"Consumers often overlook of cyber security issues and an initiative to increase public’s awareness about being smart digital consumers is needed. The purpose of this study is to examine how bringing people’s attention to the issue of sharing personal information and personalized communication affect one’s willingness to disclose various types of personal information. In addition, the impact of one’s social distance to other potential receivers out in the digital world will be examined as a factor that can moderate one’s willingness to disclose personal information. The current research seeks to provide insight for companies so they can maximize the effects of personalization while not violating perceived privacy. From consumers’ perspective, the results will suggest ways that one can psychologically practice to combat unintentionally sharing too much information. The findings may reveal effective approaches that PSA can take to promote digital safety.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology

2015-0322,2015,Paper Session,"3D Technology, Cognitive Processing, and Purchase Intent: Difference From Converted 3D Observed Through Physiological and Self-Report Data",2,"Previous study that compared the information processing of traditional 2D display with 3D display (Park et al., 2013) reported that the additional dimension with depth information in 3D display led viewers to experience cognitive overload easier than traditional 2D display. However, this study had its own limitation: due to lack of content at the time of study, the authors used converted 3D video (real-time conversion of 2D video to ‘simulated’ 3D video) instead of native 3D video.
This study explored the viewers’ information processing of native 3D video and compared it with that of 2D. Physiological responses such as heart rate (index of attention) and skin conductance (index of physiological arousal) were measured on top of self-reported measures. Also explored was individual’s purchase intent of the video, operationalized as amount of money individuals were willing to pay to purchase it. While price offered was generally higher for 3D content, individuals who viewed the content in 3D tend to offer much higher price for 3D content compared to those who viewed identical content in 2D.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0323,2015,Paper Session,Does a Virtual Like Cause Actual Liking? How Following a Brand’s Facebook Updates Enhances Brand Evaluations and Purchase Intentions,3,"Studies so far have shown positive associations between brand attitudes and liking a Facebook brand page, but brand attitudes may be the cause rather than the effect of a Facebook like. In the current study, the authors tested the effect of following a Facebook brand page on brand attitudes (e.g., purchase intention, brand equity) by randomly assigning respondents to a condition in which they either did or did not follow the brand on Facebook. After one month, compared to both current followers of the brand page and non-followers, the new followers developed more positive brand attitudes. The effect was mediated by the perception of a Conversational Human Voice (Kelleher, 2009), indicating the importance of an interactive presence on Facebook. Implications for the way brands present themselves in social media are discussed.",Commercial Aspects of Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0324,2015,Paper Session,Effects of Ad-Profile and Ad-Content Congruence on Attitude Toward the Ad and Brand,5,"Over the last decade, the field of advertising has expanded rapidly, including new advertising platforms such as the Internet and online video advertising. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of ad-schema congruence (ad-context congruence and ad-profile congruence) on attitude in the new context of pre-roll advertisements. A total of 80 participants took part in a laboratory experiment where three pre-roll ads were paired with short videos. The results (n = 80) show significant main effects of ad-context congruence on perceived irritation and attitude towards the ad. The results also show significant main effects of ad-profile congruence on perceived manipulative intent and attitude towards the brand. In addition, the results of mediation analyses show that perceived irritation and perceived manipulative intent are significant mediators for the effect of ad-context and ad-profile congruence on attitude respectively. Theoretical implications with respect to different psychological mechanisms underlying ad-content and ad-profile congruence, as well as practical implications for advertisers to maximise the effectiveness of pre-roll ads are discussed.",Commercial Aspects of Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0325,2015,Paper Session,Effects of Twitted Commercial Messages on Twitter Users’ Retweet and Purchase Intention,3,"This study was designed to investigate how commercial Twitter messages can affect users’
intention to retweet, a Twitter-specific marketing goal, and, then ultimately, purchase intentions, a general marketing goal. In this process, the study particularly focused on three important factors (extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, brand attitude, and Twitter usage) as important antecedents. Relationship with branded Twitter account was introduced as a mediating variable to find out how the factors actually can affect the behavioral intentions of Twitter users by proposing a model. The analysis of structural equation model showed that only extrinsic motivation and brand attitude were positively associated with relation to the branded Twitter account and this relation, in turn, was also positively associated with both retweet intention and purchase intention, mentioning a significant association between retweet and purchase intention as well. Overall, the hypothesized model showed a good fit in explaining significant associations between the variables.",Commercial Aspects of Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0326,2015,Paper Session,How Online Product Presentations Shape Online Impulse Buying: The Role of Local Presence,4,"The objective of this paper is to examine how consumers’ perceptions of product presentation technologies may affect online impulse buying. We propose a model showing that the perceived vividness and interactivity of online product presentations can generate perceptions of local presence, which refers to the sense of a product being present with a consumer in his or her own environment. Local presence, in turn, is expected to influence the urge to buy impulsively by generating both cognitive (perceived risk) and affective (product affect) responses to products. To test this model, data from a laboratory experiment (N = 212) was analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach (SEM). The results confirm our all but one of our hypotheses. The theoretical and practical implications of our results are discussed.",Commercial Aspects of Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2015-0327,2015,Paper Session,A Merry Band of Thieves: Media-Induced Complicity With Antiheroes,7,"An online experiment was conducted to examine the influence a televised anti-hero’s direct address to the audience on viewers’ ultimate liking of the character. Four versions of scenes taken from the political drama House of Cards were created: one featuring the anti-hero bodily and verbally addressing the audience, one featuring only the voice of the anti-hero (without bodily address), one providing information regarding the anti-hero’s thoughts, and a control. The results showed that bodily/verbal direct address was associated with heightened feelings of complicity with the anti-hero – feeling like one was conspiring in his evil deeds. In turn, complicity was associated with perceptions of the character as more moral and with greater liking of the character. These results are interpreted as suggesting an additional media-related variable (direct address) and resultant perception (complicity) that may play consequential roles in viewers’ attachment with anti-heroes.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems
2015-0328,2015,Paper Session,Application of Information Introduced and Physiological Measures to Dynamic Information Processing of Television Messages and Enjoyment,2,"Lang’s Information Introduced (or, ii; Lang, Park, Sanders-Jackson, Wilson, and Wang, 2007) is one of the ways to quantify message complexity that predicts cognitive and emotional processing of viewers. This study attempts to validate ii using psychophysiological measures to index cognitive resource allocation as well as recognition memory. Thirty television advertisements selected from a pool of 172 (all twenty seconds in length) based on their ii/cc ratio (where cc, or camera change, is conceptualized as structural feature that leads to automatic allocation of resource) and ratings for their arousing content.
Heart rate change over time showed significant deceleration (indicative of increased cognitive resource allocation) for messages with greater ii scores. Further, recognition memory worsened as ii increased. These findings support that conceptualizing message complexity as the amount of information introduced per camera change produces cognitive processing patterns that would be predicted by a limited capacity view of human information processing.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems

To explain how identification is formed and influences persuasive effects of a narrative, this study examines audience members’ wishful thinking (their desire to be like a story character) and perceived similarity with a story character. In an experiment, after risk perception was manipulated, participants listened to a story in which story characters did or did not get in a car accident. The results showed that in both risk perception conditions, participants were more likely to identify with story characters who did not get into a car accident, indicating that wishful thinking leads to identification. In addition, wishful thinking mediated the effect of the story on participants’ behavioral intention to engage in safe driving; but identification and perceived similarity did not mediate the effect.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems
2015-0331,2015,Paper Session,The Construction of Situation Models for Comprehension of TV Dramas,2,"The landscape model postulates that comprehension of a story involves integrating existing knowledge and new information into a coherent situation model. Previous research testing the landscape model has primarily relied on reading and factual stories. This study builds on previous research by applying the landscape model to two clips from current entertainment television dramas. The landscape model explained 83% or more of variance in participant recall. The more recent dual-code version of the landscape model, which assumes separate verbal and visual representations of the story, explained 91% or more of variance in participant recall. This study also continues to explore the potential integration of the landscape model and the event-indexing model by analyzing the event-indexing model as a moderator of the relationship between the dual-code landscape model and participant recall. We find significant evidence that the event-indexing model helps explain how participants remember and understand audiovisual information from television dramas.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems
2015-0332,2015,Paper Session,"The Interplay of Argument Strength, Narrativity, Working Memory Capacity, and Transportation in Narrative Persuasion",4,"The authors aimed at providing additional evidence on four (potentially) important factors in narrative persuasion: Argument strength, story narrativity, working memory capacity, and transportation. An experiment with 82 undergraduate participants was conducted. The procedure included two points of measurement with a one-week delay. Multi-level analyses accounted for a 2x2 repeated measures design with argument strength and text narrativity as categorical factors, and working memory capacity and transportation as additional continuous measures. Process measures (thought listing, Pinocchio circling) were obtained, but are not analyzed to date. The extant analyses showed that working memory capacity was unrelated to attitude change (post-exposure attitudes with pre-exposure attitudes controlled). Stories with strong arguments were more persuasive than stories with weak arguments. This main effect was qualified by a three-way interaction: Our results revealed that transportation increases the influence of argument quality, but only if the text’s structure is typically story-like (high narrativity).",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems

Specifically, participants watched a number of minute-long television show's opening theme. To eliminate fmiliarity, all shows were selected from a pool of 102 Japanese anime that was not introduced locally by any major television stations (network and cable).
Preliminary data collected from roughly half of intended subjects (n=29) shows that as information embedded (value of ii) increases, subjects’ attention level also increases, but recognition memory performance drops, which suggests cognitive overload took place. However, increase in information also leads to enjoyment, which is consistent with findings from another study submitted to ICA 2015 for possible presentation. Furthermore, increase in information also led to individual’s viewing intent for the whole series, suggesting that causing cognitive overload may be a useful technic to increase/sustain viewership of television shows.
Target subject size is fifty or more (N > 50). Besides physiological responses during video viewing session, self-report that includes viewing intent and recognition memory test are collected. The extended abstract will include data collected to date (n = 29).

2015-0335,2015,Paper Session,A New Scale for Confirmation Bias,6,"Confirmation bias (CB) is a form of heuristic processing which reduces cognitive effort by selectively limiting information search to that which is consistent with prior expectations, while overlooking that which might disconfirm initial assumptions. As prevalent as CB is—influencing nearly every form of interpersonal interaction and routine communication behavior—it remains a virtually unmeasured phenomenon. Presented is a study designed to develop a new CB scale. Participants (N = 333) read online training and bias elicitation messages, and responded to items assessing general bias knowledge and CB. Results show the scale (dubbed NewCB) to be reliable and valid, with good internal consistency. Two 7-item subscales are highly correlated with each other, and the full 14-item scale is correlated with a measure of CB (Wason’s card selection task), while diverging from a general bias scale. Discussion of the results and limitations is included along with suggestions for future research.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems

A VRE holds the promise of improved coordination and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists by enhancing communication and facilitating access to a shared base of information and research tools. A review of the current literature suggests that knowledge about VRE-based scientific communication and what makes it effective is relatively sparse. In this review we attempts to provide such a framework that captures the increasing complexity of VREs based on the configuration of ICTs they incorporate. We argue that based it is possible to create a continuum based on technological features present within a VRE and propose a model of VRE development. This model illustrates the steps of scientific activities, technologies to needed for those steps, and if implemented the type of VRE we will get based on technological configuration.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems

2015-0338,2015,Paper Session,Applying Game Theory and Signal Detection Theory to Conflict Escalation: A Case Study of a Police Investigator Viewing a Domestic Argument,2,"Human communication can be characterized in terms of game theory as competing motivations in a social game in which one person desires “winning” in terms of obtaining compliance. Another theory, signal-detection theory posits that decision making takes place on a continuum of uncertainty in which many decision are made with complete certainty while others have higher levels of ambiguity and stress. The purpose of this case study is to explore the analysis of conflict escalation by a police detective with experience in domestic violence cases viewed a videotaped session depicting marital conflict in which a wife comes home after a long day at work only to criticize her partner for violating expectations of a good meal. The police detective was asked to stop the video at any time and to write down the verbal and nonverbal (NV) signals that people put out to indicate that conflict is escalating and that they may lash out. These signals are sometimes referred to as costly signals, a concept from evolutionary biology. A content analysis was done of verbal and nonverbal cues as well as the timing of the signals in terms of how often they were noticed. The case study presents a summary of the verbal (e.g., sarcasm) and nonverbal codes (e.g., contempt, breathing) that the detective noticed. Since the detective has expertise with conflict escalation, we argue that this case study sets up a standard of comparison for future research with peoples with various degrees of abuse in their abuse ranging from those who have suffered a great deal of verbal and physical abuse to those who have very little experience with coercive conflict tactics. Results are discussed in terms of game and signal detection theories from an evolutionary perspective.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0339,2015,Paper Session,Conditional Process Analysis With Multicategorical Independent Variables and Multicategorical Moderator Variables,1,"Recent technological advancements make it easier for researchers to test complex statistical models. Moderated mediation is one such model, in which a process (mediation) is contingent on another variable (moderation). This tutorial describes proper parameterization of specific types of moderated mediation models: models in which multicategorical variables are used as either independent variables or moderators. This procedure is especially useful for scholars whose research often necessitates multicategorical designs, such as political communication scholars (e.g., conservative, liberal, or independent respondents) and media violence scholars (e.g., participants exposed to violent media, prosocial media, or neutral media). It allows them to test moderated mediation within such designs without altering the nature of their datasets. In other words, previously popular practices such as collapsing conditions and excluding conditions are no longer necessary with the implementation of this procedure.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0340,2015,Paper Session,Dealing With Measurement Error in Content Analysis Data Using Simulation-Extrapolation,2,"Conducting and reporting reliability tests has become a standard practice in content analytic research. However, the consequences of measurement error in coding data are rarely discussed or incorporated in subsequent analyses. Since both random and systematic coding errors can lead not only to biased correlations and regression coefficients, but also to severely biased estimates of category proportions, we argue that it is almost always necessary to account for these errors when analyzing content analysis data. In this paper, we introduce simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) as a viable solution for dealing with misclassified data, both in uni- and multivariate analyses. In addition, we present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation study on the effectiveness of SIMEX corrections for typical content analysis data.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems

Our goal is to systematically induce BIPs during an extended period of media experience, for which we observe changes in continually sampled data and singular events that are predictive of BIPs. The presented approach extends existing research by accounting for a wide range of observable data rather than isolated data. After four focus groups and an online survey to assess suited BIPs, we conducted an experiment with N = 18 participants, who played a video role playing game that was modified to include 16 BIPs throughout the session. We recorded the gaming session, player behavior, facial activity, and a wide range of psychophysiological indicators.

2015-0343,2015,Paper Session,A Conditional Process Model to Examine the Association Between Risky Driving Television and Joyriding Intentions,2,"This cross-sectional study (N=539) of aimed to examine a conditional process model for the relationship between young adults’ (aged 18 to 24 year) viewing of risky driving television programs (e.g. Top Gear) and joyriding intentions. In particular, a moderated multiple mediator model was developed to examine the processes through which television viewing and joyriding are related and to examine the conditions under which this relationship occurs.
In line with the hypotheses, attitudes and injunctive norms simultaneously mediated the relationship between exposure to risky driving on television and respondents’ joyriding intentions. These pathways were only significant for men.
The results indicate that scholars examining young drivers’ risk-taking should take the interplay between gender, media use, social norms and attitudes into account. For prevention campaign design, the results suggest that messages should be tailored to address both norms and attitudes of young males watching risky driving television shows.",Motivation,Information Systems

Specifically, it was predicted that incongruent combinations of message frame and message content (e.g. A loss frame with a pleasant message) will result in coactivation of the motivational systems. An experiment was conducted in which the availability of cognitive resources was assessed for four combinations of frames (gain and loss) and emotional trajectory (pleasant and unpleasant). Results supported the notion that frames elicit motivational activation, and when placed in an incongruent combination, coactivation is elicited. Also, we found further support for the notion that the appetitive system can inhibit the aversive. Motivational activation over time and the subsequent effects on emotional reactions and cognitive processing are discussed in light of the results of the experiment.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0346,2015,Paper Session,How Thinking About Media Can Support Democracy: Media Self-Efficacy and Internal Political Efficacy as Processes Underlying Young Adults’ Political Participation,1,"News exposure has been demonstrated to leverage political participation. However, we suggest that not only does news exposure foster young adults’ participation, but that their participation is also affected by their perceptions of how effective they are in gathering information from the media (media self-efficacy) and that this perception of media self-efficacy pays into people’s internal political efficacy. Based on Bandura’s self-efficacy theory (1977), media self-efficacy and internal political efficacy are suggested as underlying processes that link news exposure and political participation. In an online survey with young adults (N = 149; Mage = 19.8, SD = 1.33) this interplay was confirmed for online news exposure and participation, but not for television news exposure and participation. We suspect that particularly the interactive nature of online news facilitates the development of media self-efficacy and internal political efficacy.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0347,2015,Paper Session,Motivation-Activation Measure and Media Use in Asia: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,2,"The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, it tests how the Motivation Activation Measure (MAM; Lang, Bradley, Sparks & Lee, 2007) applies in a nonAmerican context, in order to provide evidence for the universality asserted through its theoretical underpinnings as an indicator of biologically based appetitive and aversive motivation systems. It thus investigates the similarity between the MAM scores found in a nonAmerican context with those previously found in an American context. Second, the paper examines how the individual difference in motivational system responsiveness correlates with media use and interests in an Asian culture. 861 respondents completed MAM, personality measures and self-reported media preference in an online survey. Results indicate that the ASA and the DSA recorded in the Asian sample associate significantly as predicted with theoretically-related measures of key factors of human personality and had similar pattern of scores with those found in American samples. Moreover, results suggest that audience interests in different types of media can be predicted through their variation in motivation systems activation.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0348,2015,Paper Session,Negativity Bias and Driver Identification Predict Risky Driving Intentions When Mortality is Implicitly Salient,2,"Prior efforts to reduce risky driving through media campaigns have not been successful. The present work tested predictions of the terror management health model (TMHM) using moderately or highly intense fear-appeal messages. Participants (N = 84) saw one of four PSAs advocating driving more slowly. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that those lower in negativity bias were more likely to identify with the driver when mortality salience was activated implicitly but not explicitly. In turn, higher driver identification was associated with higher risky driving intentions. This pattern is consistent with a terror management perspective, such that implicit death thoughts activate distal defense strategies in an effort to cope with the existential threat. These findings suggest that risky driving fear appeals should avoid implicit death-related content out of concern that it will trigger defensive processing in those most likely engage in risky driving.",Motivation,Information Systems

Sixty-seven participants were recruited to take the MAM measure while brain activity was recorded using a 14 channel EEG. Data analysis is currently underway.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0350,2015,Paper Session,Transparency of Audience Behavior and Co-Orientation in the News Selections of Internet Users,3,"Web metrics (e.g. click rates, comment counts) published in the context of journalistic articles – as along with user rankings (e.g. most viewed and most commented articles), which are accessible on the websites of news media and aggregators – provide information about the news selection of the Internet audience. This transparency in audience behavior might lead to a co-orientation in the use of news content online. Preconditions for this co-orientation are the sufficient awareness of Web metrics and user rankings among Internet users as well as the relevance of such information for their own news selections. Because co-orientation may argue against the fragmentation thesis, we explore these preconditions by a representative online survey in the main user group of online news sites (ages 14 to 49 years, N = 433).",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0351,2015,Paper Session,Beyond Ferguson: Implicit Impacts of Source Characteristics on Crisis Attribution,3,"The current study will conduct a 2 (race of journalists: Black vs. White) x 2 (involvement: Ferguson vs. fictitious city) x 2 (timing: present vs. later) x 2 (attribution of responsibility: black victim vs. white victim) mixed subjects experiment. By doing so, this study will help journalists understand how racial characteristics can lead to publics’ tendency of responsibility attribution in a racially charged incident. In order to explore this, this study will particularly examine implicit stereotyping as a measure of journalist evaluation. Using implicit measurements that prevent socially desirable responses resulted from self-report measures of prejudice, the study will measure accurate stereotyping attitudes as participants partake in non-conscious and automatic implicit learning of stereotypes from society and media (Fazio & Olson, 2003; Mastro et al., 2009; Olson, Kendrick, & Fazio, 2009).",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems
2015-0352,2015,Paper Session,Comparing Implicit Frames Across Domains,1,"Automated content analysis can greatly enhance framing research. Implicit framing analysis for instance has proven itself as a powerful tool to automatically extract frames from large collections of texts. Comparisons of these frames however are typically still done in a qualitative and interpretative manner. This paper proposes to complement the implicit framing technique with a quantitative measure that creates insight in the degree to which different domains overlap: cosine similarity. The technique is tested on a case study of the Dutch nuclear energy debate, including content of three organizations, two news agencies and two newspapers. Analysis shows that the results of the two techniques of implicit framing and cosine similarity analysis are consistent with each other: the degree to which frames substantially overlap is reflected in the cosine similarity scores. Applying cosine similarity analysis empowers framing scholars to statistically compare texts between domains as well as over time.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems

How Pitch Variations Can Improve Effectiveness, Arousal, and Recognition of an Audio Message",2,"This study explores the effect of different intonation strategies applied to audio commercials on the cognitive processing of the listener. A within-subjects experiment was conducted in which participants listened to 16 radio ads that had been created with different models of intonation designed to vary the announcer’s pitch range. Dependent variables were self-reported effectiveness and adequacy, skin conductance level (SCL) and recognition memory. Results showed that radio ads presented by announcers whose pitch transitioned from high frequency to low achieved better perceived effectiveness, elicited greater sympathetic nervous system activation and attained better recognition accuracy than the ads with no pitch variations and variations from low to high pitch.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems
2015-0354,2015,Paper Session,Message Sensation Value: A Meta-Analysis of Main Effects,2,"The sensation value of messages is a concept that can inform the construction of effective messages. However, there have been conflicting results in the literature. Some studies demonstrate an interaction between message sensation value (MSV) and sensation seeking that affects the persuasiveness of a message. Other studies, however, demonstrate a main effect for MSV. This study provides a meta-analysis of the main effect of MSV on arousal, behavioral intention, and perceived message effectiveness. Ten cases from 6 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Findings suggest that MSV has a relatively strong main effect on arousal and a moderate main effect on perceived message effectiveness, but the main effect on behavioral intention is not significant. Implications and limitations are discussed.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems

2015-0356,2015,Paper Session,Visual Attention to Anti-Drunk-Driving PSAs With Different Emotionality: Explicating How Messages’ Emotionality Affects “Seeing” and “Believing”,1,"This study examines participants’ eye movements when presented with “real-world” persuasive messages – using anti-drunk driving PSAs with different emotional tones (positive, negative, co-active) as stimuli (stimuli have been pretested and selected). As public health messages with persuasive intent tend to use negative emotional appeals to promote desired attitude or behavior change (Leshner, Bolls, & Thomas, 2009), findings about their effectiveness have been mixed. Theoretical frameworks used in this study include the dimensional approach to emotions and two motivational systems. EmployingTobii TX300 Eye Tracker system, this study intends to explicate how people’s eye movements will differ as a function of viewing messages with different emotional valence, and further explores the relationship between allocation of visual attention and later cognitive processing of the messages and promoted behavior in the message.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems
2015-0357,2015,Paper Session,What Negative Content and a Tabloid Production Style Contribute to the Success of Television News,2,"This study is the first to test the impact of negative news content and tabloid packaging on viewing behavior among different demographic subsamples of the population, in a controlled experiment, using a behavioral measure. A web-based experiment among 190 participants was conducted in which participants were given limited time to spend watching a maximum of 16 audiovisual news stories that varied in content (neutral versus negative stories) and packaging (standard versus tabloid stories). The viewing time per news story was the dependent variable. Results shows that the presence of negative content is by far the most important contribution to the viewing time. However, tabloid packaging also matters, and the same applies to age and gender of the viewers: Each of these variables provides a qualification of the impact that negative content has.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems
