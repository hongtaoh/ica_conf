2014-0000,2014,Paper Session,Exploring Japanese Media’s Health Coverage in Response to the 2011 Triple Catastrophe,3,"Media system dependency theory suggests that in times of threat and ambiguity, for example, during Japan’s 2011 triple catastrophe, individuals’ dependency on media for information is intensified. Individuals depend on the media for information to gauge health risk and learn protective measures. Dependency relations between the media system and other entities, however, can influence how effectively the media fulfill this important function. This study used a quantitative content analysis of one year of coverage for two Japanese newspapers, the Asahi Shinbun and the Yomiuri Shinbun, to determine the extent to which the news media provided necessary public health information. Results suggest that media system dependency relations may have reduced the amount and type of public health information included in the disaster coverage. Implications of these findings for public health communication are discussed.",Meda Coverage of Health Issues,Health Communication
2014-0001,2014,Paper Session,"National Conversations About Systemic Illness in U.S. Health Care: Influences on Media Coverage of Rising Health Care Costs, 1993-2010",4,"This study evaluated 531 newspaper articles and television transcripts to examine how the U.S. media presented the issue of rising health care costs from 1993 to 2010. The prominence of health care coverage, expert sources and the presentation of the causes of rising health care costs were assessed. Results suggest that the president influenced health care news coverage while expert sources quoted in the reports influenced how the causes of rising health care cost were presented. Findings contribute to the growing body of academic literature on agenda building theory and provide insights for health care reform advocates interested in maximizing their media advocacy efforts.",Meda Coverage of Health Issues,Health Communication
2014-0002,2014,Paper Session,The Impact of Imagery Ability on Perceived Image Vividness: The Case of HPV Vaccine Advertising,2,"This research investigates the extent of pictorial superiority by adopting the Dual Coding Theory (DCT) to test imagery processing provoked by verbal/visual stimuli within the context of HPV vaccine advertising. In keeping with the postulates of the vividness hypothesis, a 2 (high/low imagery ability) by 2 (pictorial/non-pictorial) experiment was conducted on a randomized sample of sophomore college students. We found that an individual’s imagery ability, combined with varied messages, proves to have a moderating effect on both free call and positive attitude. Findings also support the hypothesis that vividness perception is a mediator between imagery ability and free recall.",Meda Coverage of Health Issues,Health Communication
2014-0003,2014,Paper Session,The Role of Media Coverage in Cities With/Without Smoke-Free Ordinances: A 7-Year Content Analysis,2,"We provide the results of a 7-year content analysis of 4,711 newspaper stories and editorials as part of a larger tobacco-control intervention supported by a $5.3 million grant. The main goal was to determine whether news story and editorial characteristics differed in cities/counties with/without tobacco control policies. News media are important information sources for health issues (e.g., tobacco control) and could inform community members who depend upon local newspapers, illuminating newspapers' priorities in providing information about tobacco control policies. Results showed that ordinance cities had more pro-tobacco-control support, public health facts, localization, mobilization, local sources, ordinary citizens as authors, and longer news stories but this coverage appeared in less dominant pages with more negative headlines as compared to no-ordinance cities. Tobacco industry may have greater success in impacting news coverage in no-ordinance cities by diverting attention from tobacco control to secondary issues (e.g., youth smoking) or themes (e.g, business rights).",Meda Coverage of Health Issues,Health Communication
2014-0004,2014,Paper Session,Change Your Ways: Fostering Health Attitudes Toward Change Through Selective Exposure to Online Health Messages,3,"In a lab study, 419 participants accessed online search results about health topics. The display varied messages in a 4 x 2 x 2 all within-subjects design, with topic as four-step factor (organic food, coffee, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical exercise) and source credibility (low vs. high) and issue stance (promoting vs. opposing health behavior) as two-step factors. Displayed messages either promoted the related behavior or suggested avoiding it. Results showed that both engaging more frequently in a health behavior and perceiving greater standard-behavior discrepancy (between recommended behavior standards and own behavior) fostered aligned attitudes through selective exposure to messages promoting that behavior. The impact from selective exposure to health messages on attitudes occurred regardless of associated source credibility.",Cognition and Health,Health Communication
2014-0005,2014,Paper Session,Exploring How Personal Health Beliefs and Social Risks Contribute to College Students’ Use and Perceptions of Online Mental Health Resources,2,"Drawing from prior fear-appeal and information seeking research, this study explored how self-efficacy, perceived threat, and perceived public stigma predict college students’ use and perceptions of online mental health resources. Results showed that perceived vulnerability was significantly associated with visiting any Internet website and joining an online support group, while self-efficacy predicted greater perceived usefulness and trust for online support groups. Interactions also emerged between self-efficacy and perceived threat, indicating that at higher levels of efficacy those perceiving greater threat would be less likely to use web services and view these resources favorably. Perceived public stigma did not independently predict any of the use or perception outcomes; and only once emerged as a significant moderating factor. Specifically, results showed that efficacy positively predicted trust in Internet sources at high levels of stigma but was unrelated to trust at lower levels of stigma.",Cognition and Health,Health Communication
2014-0006,2014,Paper Session,Testing a Social Cognitive Theory-Based Model of Indoor Tanning: Implications for Health Communication,5,"The lack of a theory-based understanding of indoor tanning is a major impediment to the development of communication campaigns to prevent or reduce this behavior. The recently developed Comprehensive Indoor Tanning Expectations (CITE) scale advances our understanding of outcome expectations in indoor tanning. The current study applies this scale in a survey study of 8 sororities (total N=775). Confirmatory factor analyses indicated the CITE positive and negative expectations were robust, multi-dimensional factors, and that a hierarchical structure fit the data well. A social cognitive theory-based structural equation model demonstrated that appearance motivation variables were associated with outcome expectations, which were in turn associated with intentions to tan indoors. Results also suggested that temptations to tan partially mediate the effects of positive expectations on intention to tan indoors. Implications of these findings for the development of messages to prevent and deter indoor tanning are discussed.",Cognition and Health,Health Communication
2014-0007,2014,Paper Session,Distributed Cognition in Cancer Treatment Decision-Making: An Application of the DECIDE Family Decision-Making Styles Typology,5,"A distributive cognition, or “shared mind” approach, to decision-making is one in which cognitive and affective schemas are shared between two or more people during interpersonal discussion. In the health context, distributive cognition often occurs in cancer treatment decision-making between healthcare professionals, family members, and cancer patients. Extant research focuses on decision-making between healthcare providers and patients; however, the communicative processes of decision-making between family members and patients are understudied. The current manuscript addresses this gap by examining the dialectical tension between patient autonomy and family interdependence in cancer clinical trial (CT) decision-making. We examine this dialectic through (1) patients’ preferences for decisional support with CT decision-making and (2) patients’ perceptions of family preferences for the provision of CT decisional support. Finally, a typology for understanding family health decision-making proposed. The typology is comprised of five family decision-making styles: Independent, Isolated, Collaborative, Delegated, and Demanding. We illustrate this using data drawn from in-depth interviews with rural, Appalachian cancer patients offered a cancer CT for their treatment (N = 46). Implications of the typology for reducing cancer health inequities are discussed.",Cognition and Health,Health Communication
2014-0008,2014,Paper Session,J-Tweeters: Pointing Towards a New Set of Professional Practices and Norms in Journalism,1,"This paper studies the process of normalizing in journalism by examining journalists’ use of Twitter. Who are the active j-tweeters, and how do they use Twitter? And how do the j-tweeters deviate from other journalists on professional practices and norms? The study draws from a representative large-n mail survey of Swedish journalists. The findings indicate that there are large differences in norms and values between the most active j-tweeters and their colleagues related to the “Twitter specific” features of interaction and networking and to the views on personal branding. On the other hand, as the most active j-tweeters do not deviate on core professional values, it appears that Twitter is being normalized in journalism. However, due to the ongoing generational shift in the newsrooms, the views held by the active j-tweeters could lead to a new professional view on journalism in which audience orientation and professional positioning gain importance.",Changing the News 140 Characters At a Time: Twitter's Impact on Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0009,2014,Paper Session,The Twitterization of News Making: Transparency and Journalistic Professionalism,1,"Twitter makes visible some of the most fundamental divides in professional journalism today. It reveals tensions about what constitutes news, the norms guiding journalists providing them, their professional identity and relationship to the audience. This article argues that these tensions result from a clash between an institutional logic and an ethic, that is, between the logic of professional control (Lewis, 2012) and the ethic of transparency. Drawing from extensive field research on competing political reporters of a press corps, involving observation, interviews, digital ethnography and content analysis of tweets, this study witnesses the adoption and establishment of Twitter in the everyday life of reporters and thereby also attempts to explain why Twitter won over so many journalists.",Changing the News 140 Characters At a Time: Twitter's Impact on Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0010,2014,Paper Session,Journalism Endures: Has Twitter Changed the News Product?,1,"This study examines the effect of social media use by news agencies on their journalistic norms and practices: public service orientation, objectivity, and accountability. The data are 1,141 stories posted by six mainstream media organizations on Twitter over one constructed week in 2012. Findings show a tendency toward professional, hierarchical journalism; even blog posts have not led to innovative adoption of the horizontal communication patterns of social media. Traditional newsrooms rather co-opt the new technology to connect with digital media users. This study concludes that journalism as an institution normalizes rather than adjusts to the changing media landscape.",Changing the News 140 Characters At a Time: Twitter's Impact on Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0011,2014,Paper Session,I Know You on Twitter: How Journalists’ Self-Disclosures Influence Sharing on Social Media,1,"In the present study, the effects of sports journalists’ self-disclosures on a popular microblogging platform were examined. More specifically, an online experiment was conducted investigating whether being exposed to self-disclosures posted on Twitter influenced the audiences’ perceptions of likability and credibility, as well as the desire to interact with the sports journalist. Results of a path analysis show that self-disclosure had a positive effect on a personal dimension of likability, as predicted by Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). Contrary to the predictions, however, self-disclosure did not affect the professional dimension of likability or credibility. In addition, the results of the present study show that the development of a parasocial relationship between the sports journalist and his audience, as well as professional likability are the best predictors of participants’ intentions to share the encountered content.",Changing the News 140 Characters At a Time: Twitter's Impact on Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0012,2014,Paper Session,"Shares, Pins, and Tweets: News Readership From Daily Papers to Social Media",1,"In this paper we compare the volume of news articles per section in newspapers and social media platforms. To this end, we retrieved two weeks of news articles by querying the public APIs of The New York Times and The Guardian and tracked the diffusion of each article on social media platforms Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Delicious, Pinterest, and StumbleUpon. The results show significant differences in the topics emphasized by newspapers editors and social media users. We found that users of social media platforms favor opinion pieces, but also national, local and world news. This is in sharp contrast to the decisions of news editors to emphasize sports and economy, but also entertainment and celebrity news. Common to the social networking sites is the prevalence of items about arts, technology, and opinion pieces. Niche social networks like StumbleUpon and Delicious presented a greater volume of articles about science and technology, while Pinterest is mostly dedicated to fashion, arts, lifestyle, and entertainment. Twitter is the only social network to have presented a statistically significant correlation with the distribution of news items per section on The Guardian and The New York Times. The results of this study provide a bridge between journalism and audience research and present evidence of the differences between readership in social and legacy media.",Changing the News 140 Characters At a Time: Twitter's Impact on Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0013,2014,Paper Session,The Opportunity Structures and Cultural Schemas of Online Collective Action: The Case of China,2,"Recent scholarship on global internet-related protests emphasizes the role of digital networks and personal expression in online collective action (Bennett & Segerberg, 2013). Highlighting a neglected dimension in current scholarship, we show the importance of conditions external to digital networks in the making of online collective action. Using cases from China, we develop a perspective that takes account of the external conditions without losing sight of agency. We identify four different political styles of online collective action in China and link them to five types of opportunities. We argue that online collective action manifests different political styles depending on the different types of opportunities and cultural schemas available to actors. Actors calibrate their modes of action to the structures of opportunity and constraints, such that when opportunity structures change, their modes of action may change accordingly.",Media and Political Contestation in Greater China,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0014,2014,Paper Session,Between Corporate Development and Public Service: The Cultural System Reform in the Chinese Media Sector,1,"The cultural system reform has become a central part of China’s unswerving reform in the 21st century and noticeably gained velocity after 2008. Aiming to build up a cultural market economy, the reform is transforming the majority of cultural institutions into state-owned and even state-controlled shareholding corporations, while strengthening the public service obligation of state financing in selected areas. This paper not only documents some major lines of market development but also examines why and how the state is realigning its public and corporate sectors in such a particular mode of synthesis, especially in two leading media sectors, i.e., film and TV broadcasting. While scholars have documented how the overlap between the state and market forces creates dominant cultural processes in China, focusing on the state’s straightforward efforts of commercialization, this paper offers an updated understanding of verifiable policy and institutional changes—especially the “de-commercialization” movement embodied by the return of public units.",Media and Political Contestation in Greater China,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0015,2014,Paper Session,Mediation of Global Logic: The Case of Transnational Environmentalism in China,1,"Global issues transcend local concerns and political systems, mediated through larger networks. To examine this process I identify a specific group of transnational NGOs and one particular issue: the environment, which lends itself to global discourse, advocacy and problem-solving. I take China as a case in point, to illustrate such a framework, showing how these groups bridge very different political contexts. This investigation is based on interviews in Beijing with representatives of the most prominent transnational environmental NGOs with offices in China, showing how they carry out their work and what kind of common logic they develop--and in turn how that logic affects communication strategies, and their more indirect impact on journalism in China. Based on these insights supported by case study examples, I suggest how this network contributes to the media-journalistic space and explore the implications such global networks have for the quality and transparency of issue discourse.",Media and Political Contestation in Greater China,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0016,2014,Paper Session,Virtual Mobilities and Sociopolitical Becoming of Forced Migrants,1,"Forced migrants engage with and challenge sociopolitical and legal order through virtual practice and connectivities. This article discusses how asylum seekers as one type of forced migrant use virtual practice to work border and become virtually mobile. Based on the concept of practice and insights from the critical border regime literature the article illustrates how the people confound the order of the border through facebooking, blogging, and skyping, actualizing their personal, social, and political potential. Facebooking and blogging were instrumental in connecting with local cultural, social, and political groups that challenged the nation-state. Voice- and video-sharing were important for creating interpersonal relationality and managing the arrest in space that is typical for asylum seekers in European countries. Overall, the study illustrates how virtual connectivities create solidarities but can also foster a focus on the self, which can endanger collective political action. The study is based on three years of fieldwork with forced migrants in Germany.

2014-0017,2014,Paper Session,The Transnationalization of Chinese ICT Corporations: A Case Study of Huawei,1,"This paper looks into the rise of Chinese transnational ICT corporations in the context of global digital capitalism by a case study of Huawei Technologies. By focusing on the dialectical tension between the capitalist logic and territorial logic, it argues that Huawei’s developmental trajectory is intertwined with China’s paradoxical models of political-economic reforms, and its transnationalized patterns are characterized with diverse contradictions and dynamics of inter-state and inter-capitalist cooperation and competition. There is no singular nature that can be used to define the rise of China’s transnational corporate power and the corresponding transformation of class structures from this case, as Huawei’s transnationalized initiative and activities are driven by its inherent pursuit of the capitalist logic on the one hand, and embody the anti-hegemonic discourse and the interest of national development on the other.",Media and Political Contestation in Greater China,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0018,2014,Paper Session,What’s Science? Where’s Science? Science Journalism in Print Media,2,"This paper examines the current state of science coverage in German print media. It deals with the questions (1) how the main characteristics of science journalism can be described, (2) whether there is a difference between various scientific fields and (3) how different definitions of science journalism lead to differing findings. Two forms of science coverage were analyzed by a standardized, two-part content analysis of German newspapers (n = 1732; n = 1640). The results show that former research has highly undervalued the relevance of humanities and social sciences. Furthermore, we detected a significant difference between a narrower and a broader definition of science journalism. In the “classic” understanding science journalism is prompted by scientific events and is rather noncritical. Science coverage in a broader sense is defined by a bigger range of journalistic styles, driven by non-scientific events and with a focus on the statements of scientific experts.",Between Science and the Public: Studies in Science Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0019,2014,Paper Session,Between Consensus and Denial: Climate Journalists as Interpretive Community,2,"In the quest to understand media coverage of climate change, this study focuses on climate journalists as key mediators between the sphere of science and the broader public sphere. It surveys climate journalists from five countries and five types of news outlets. Despite their different national and editorial contexts it finds a transnational consensus built around the scientific mainstream view of climate change as propagated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Climate journalists seem to have become part of an interpretive community that crosses national borders. There is no climate change denial among prolific writers but it persists among occasional writers on this topic. Journalists who approve the IPCC consensus tend to draw information from environmentalists, science, and the mass media while those who are skeptical towards climate change rather refrain from scientific sources.",Between Science and the Public: Studies in Science Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0020,2014,Paper Session,Journalists’ Perceptions and Reporting on Scientific Uncertainty and Risks of Nanotechnology: Results From Interviews and a Content Analysis,3,"Scientific uncertainty is an integral part of scientific research. Previous studies on the coverage of nanoscale science and technology suggest that journalists mainly report on scientific uncertainty when covering the risks arising from this emerging technology. To empirically examine this assumption, the present study combined interviews with German science journalists (n = 21) with a content analysis (n = 204) of the respective media channels. The results suggest that science journalists covering this issue can be classified according to four different types: Skeptics, Balancers, Advocats, and Ambivalents. In addition, the content analysis detected four different coverage types: Benefits of nanoscale science and technology applications, Scientific certainty of nanoscale science and technology-research, Political discourse about scientific uncertainty and risks, and Benefits of nanoscale science and technology-medicine. In comparison, these types revealed the aforementioned connection between scientific uncertainty and risks, opposed to a connection between scientific certainty and benefits.",Between Science and the Public: Studies in Science Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0021,2014,Paper Session,Examining Geographical Level and News Source in H1N1 Pandemic News: A Case of Impacted Chinese Communities,2,"The swine flu, or H1N1 influenza, was a global pandemic and serious health-risk issue. This study intended to examine how media covered the pandemic in three impacted places. In particular, we investigated how news at local and international levels might differ in citing sources. Based on a content analysis of 908 randomly sampled articles from major newspapers in the Chinese communities, we found that most of the news stories about H1N1 influenza in our sample used a neutral, rather than an alarmist, tone. News attention cycles were event-based and varied according to seriousness of situations in reality. Moreover, news on the international level was more likely to cite organizations, rather than individuals, as sources. Particularly, non-governmental health organizations tended to be more often used in international news coverage. Construal level theory was discussed as an alternative explanation pertaining to the relationship between geographical level and source use.",Between Science and the Public: Studies in Science Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0022,2014,Paper Session,Swine Flu and Hype: A Systematic Review of Media Dramatization of the H1N1 Pandemic,3,"In retrospect, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic looked like much ado about nothing. As a result, many, both epidemiologists and laypeople, accused the media of having created an artificial hype. We set out to examine the validity of such accusations through a systematic review of ex-isting content analyses of H1N1-related media coverage. In order to probe the to-date empirical evidence on whether the media dramatized H1N1, we distilled three specific features of media that indicate dramatization: amount of attention, specific content, and emotional tone. 13 content-analytical studies on H1N1-related coverage in China, Europe, USA, Australia, and Canada ana-lyzing TV, print news, and social media were reviewed. Results show media attention was im-mense, news content stressed threat over precautionary measures, and evidence on coverage to-nality was conflicting. The present paper further revealed a critical gap in existing knowledge about the tone of media coverage on H1N1 and discusses implications for further research.",Between Science and the Public: Studies in Science Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0023,2014,Paper Session,Crisis Communication and the Disconnected Coworker: The Role of ICT Access in Shaping Identification and Safety Message Satisfaction,5,"The present study explores how employee identification, in conjunction with perceived message overload and ICT access at work, accounts for how employees process safety and emergency messages. We adapt Cheney’s (1983b) development of organizational identification to explain the how identification influences the reception of safety and emergency messages. Toward this end, we build on existing literature regarding safety and emergency communication, identification, and message overload to construct a structural equation model (SEM) representative of these relationships. Survey data was collected from a large sample of university employees (n=271) to test the hypothesized model. In addition to identification, the modified SEM model shows that ICT access has an indirect effect on identification and a significant direct effect on satisfaction with safety messages. The findings from this study provide contributions to existing research on identification, technological access, overload, and organizational safety messages.","Good Grief!

2014-0024,2014,Paper Session,Negotiating the Non-Negotiable: Managing Nuclear Safety in the US After Fukushima,1,"This essay addresses the principle of nuclear safety through a framework linking the research literatures on high reliability organizations, social systems theory, science and technology studies, and rhetorical boundary work. The disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant has reopened important questions regarding organizational and institutional communication, systems of regulation and governance, and the assurance of nuclear safety. This moment offers opportunities for improving communication practices and for expanding communication theory. Although nuclear safety is often said to be a “non-negotiable” principle, such claims disregard the degree to which it is constituted through communication and the degree to which that communication is fundamentally negotiative in form. Accordingly, the essay conceptualizes nuclear safety as a negotiated and paradoxical accomplishment within complex sociotechnical systems, extending the concept of high reliability organizations to a larger system level and linking it with heuristic concepts from Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory.","Good Grief!

2014-0025,2014,Paper Session,Organizing and Adaptations of Collective Grassroots Efforts for Disaster Response,2,"This research uses a multi-theoretical framework, including Weick’s model of organizing, self-organizing complexity theory, and the technology-in-practice perspective, to examine the dynamic processes of organized efforts in disaster response following Hurricane Sandy in the United States. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 group organizers/leaders involved in response. The findings showed that those citizen groups exhibited the patterns of self-organizing by adopting flexible work routines, adapting fluid membership, and resorting to different communication channels and technologies, such face-to-face, texting, online media, and social media to request and receive resources necessary for response effort. Collectively, those groups formed network forms of organizing, through which inter-group relationships among emergent and existing groups evolved and changed over time. This study advances our understanding of the evolutionary process of self-organizing response group’s organizing and technological structures in response to a disruptive environment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Good Grief! Disasters, Crises, and High-Risk Organizational Environments",Organizational Communication
2014-0026,2014,Paper Session,A Message Worth a Thousand Lives: Understanding Organizational Change in High-Risk Environments,1,"Recent economic turbulence in the United States has resulted in budget cuts for many city-funded organizations, including local fire departments. Budget cuts trigger organizational change and create uncertainty among employees. Given the need to study organizational change in high-risk, high-consequence environments, this study examines inevitable organizational change within urban fire departments and the influence on communication satisfaction with messages surrounding the change. For this exploratory study, focus groups were conducted with full-time firefighters from multiple lower level ranks (i.e., firefighters, lieutenants, and captains) to learn perceptions about these organizational issues. Findings indicate that the source, amount, and frequency of messages during change are the most important components to consider for high-risk environments.","Good Grief!

2014-0027,2014,Paper Session,When Self is the Source: Implications of Media Customization on Message Processing,2,"Customization of media technologies makes the users de facto gatekeepers of their own information universe; the user in essence becomes the source of communication. But does this sense of “self as source” alter the way the users process information received via customized interfaces? This paper attempts to answer this question by reporting a between-subjects experiment (N = 146) that examined the effect of self-driven customization (high vs. low self-as-source) on persuasive message processing, as mediated by three major psychological consequences of customization—perceived control, perceived identity, and perceived involvement.
The results indicate that perceived identity is a significant mediator between self-as-source in customization and message processing. Theoretical implications for persuasive technologies, dual process models and the agency model of customization are discussed, followed by practical implications for communicators who wish to incorporate new media technologies into their social influence campaigns.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0028,2014,Paper Session,It’s Not What You Say But How You Say It: Information Asymmetry and Compliance Gaining Online,4,"Proliferation of social media has increased the amount of personal information available about users online, and this information is increasingly available to anyone including advertisers and other (unknown) users. Having knowledge about others creates information asymmetries that can be used strategically to manipulate others. Results from an experiment involving sixty-six (31 male and 35 female) same sex dyads show that beneficiaries of information asymmetry were more successful at getting their conversation partners to comply with requests (42% success rate vs. 9% in the control condition). Conversation analysis indicates that conversation topics did not matter. Rather, the linguistic cues were influential: those participants who used fewer second person pronouns—such as you—were more successful at getting their partner to comply. Additionally, we found gender differences affect the style of conversation, such that females communicated more, used more personal pronouns, and more inclusive language than males.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0029,2014,Paper Session,Are You Scared Yet? Evaluating Fear Appeal Messages in Tweets About the Tips Campaign,4,"In March 2012, the CDC launched “Tips from Former Smokers,” a $54 million national campaign featuring individuals experiencing long-term health consequences of smoking. The campaign approach was based on strong evidence that anti-tobacco ads portraying fear, graphic images, and personal testimonials are associated with attitudinal and behavior change. Yet it was also controversial; critics cited the danger that viewers might reject such intensely graphic messages. Tasked with informing this debate, our study analyzes the entirety of the Tips campaign-related tweets from the Twitter Firehose. We provide a novel and rigorous method for media campaign evaluation, and an empirical test of the Extended Parallel Process Model. Among the relevant Tweets, 76% showed evidence of message acceptance, while 18% exhibited message rejection.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0030,2014,Paper Session,Lost and Found in Translation: Persuasive Effects of Native Language and International Comments on YouTube,5,"Research has emphasized the substantial influence of peer comments in participatory online environments. Based on the social identity model of deindividuation effects, this study attempted to explore mechanisms of users’ identification with anonymous commenters and social influence patterns on YouTube. Specifically, we examined whether comments in receivers’ native language lead to stronger persuasive effects than do comments in another language. A 2x2 between-subjects experiment with a German sample (N = 174) showed an anti-marijuana video along with positive or negative comments in either German or English. Video evaluation was directly affected by comment valence, and viewers’ attitude toward marijuana was influenced by the interaction of comment valence and identification with YouTube writers. Native language did not increase identification and persuasive effects. Instead, participants judged English comments more thoroughly: These were more influential when the valence was positive (against marijuana), while pro-marijuana comments tended to be more persuasive in German.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology

This study offers a preliminary glimpse of the sexting phenomenon by highlighting the experiences of 20 young people. We explore emergent themes regarding the nature of youth sexting specific to the definitions, prevalence, and process of the practice. Participant narratives highlight the sexting process as dynamic, highly contextual, and primarily driven by social motives. Furthermore, participants’ experiences implicate media and peer pressures as key players in promulgating the phenomenon. Ultimately, this study foregrounds the importance of the mobile phone in the lives of contemporary youth as well as how new media technologies shape and are shaped by users’ desires to communicate, generally and sexually.","Sexting, Sexual Selfies, and Sexism in Social Media Contexts",Communication and Technology
2014-0033,2014,Paper Session,Examining the Role of Sexism in Perceptions of Female Virtual Representations,3,"Perceptions of credibility and social potential are influenced by clothing choice, even when the source is a computer-generated representation. To test the extent to which personality traits influence perceived social potential of virtual representations and the attributions of the source and message, this study presented participants (N = 397) with a message about dating or job interviews presented by a virtual woman in either context-appropriate or context-inappropriate clothing. Causal modeling techniques revealed that both the perceived appropriateness of clothing and participant perceptions of virtual female representations influenced attributions of source and message quality. Participants higher on sexism rated the representations as less human (anthropomorphic) and less credible, suggesting a dehumanization of female representations consistent with objectification theory. In turn, lower perceptions of anthropomorphism diminished perceived realism, which decreased credibility and the perceived quality of the advice. Implications for understanding the role of sexism on perceptions of virtual representations such as avatars and agents and the influence on communication are discussed.","Sexting, Sexual Selfies, and Sexism in Social Media Contexts",Communication and Technology

A Body Display Index, which incorporated societal evaluation of body parts of either sexes, was developed to measure online body display. It was found that grandiose exhibitionism, a sub-trait of narcissism, is a stronger predictor of online display than narcissism. Influence of body image satisfaction on body display was not significant. No relationship between perceived security risk and online body display was found, implying a serious issue in the safety of using social media. Lastly, potential of utilizing the Body Display Index in future research was discussed.","Sexting, Sexual Selfies, and Sexism in Social Media Contexts",Communication and Technology
2014-0035,2014,Paper Session,"Crisis, Credibility, and the Press: A Priming Model of News Evaluation",3,"This paper advances a theory of press priming, which posits that the news itself can be the subject of media priming. The theory holds that exposure to a press crisis activates standing attitudes about press freedom and media responsibility, which then influence judgments about media performance. Judgments hinge on attitude strength and the amount of attention paid to the crisis. Support for the theory is demonstrated with original survey data collected from respondents in the U.K. (N = 644) and reinforced with a secondary dataset from the U.S. (N = 911). Results show that, as crisis attention increases, attitudes activated about press responsibility influence media credibility judgments, while attitudes about press freedom predict support for press regulation. Implications for better understanding of the news evaluation process, particularly in light of an unfolding media crisis, are discussed.",News Evaluation and Credibility,Mass Communication
2014-0036,2014,Paper Session,Linking Domain-Specific News to Citizens’ Perceptions of Novel Issues: An Example From Risk Communication,2,"What is the effect of different kinds of news on opinions of novel and unfamiliar issues? Previous work on media effects in political, science, and health communication suggests an answer based not on channels of communication but on domains of content. The current study investigates these domain-specific media effects by introducing survey respondents to a novel issue, then testing the relationships between their responses and their news consumption habits. In addition, we explore if these relationships are different among opinion leaders or influentials. Results suggest that domains of content can and do have significantly different impacts on attitude formation, although these impacts are not the same for all segments of the population. Implications for mass communication theory and methods are discussed.",News Evaluation and Credibility,Mass Communication
2014-0037,2014,Paper Session,Perceived Credibility Gaps and Opinion Formation Within a Competitive Media Environment: Arab Satellite TV News in Lebanon,5,"Most often media credibility is examined as the dependent variable and rarely is it considered as an independent, or mediating, variable of interest when considering news exposure and opinion or attitude formation. This study moves our understanding of media credibility forward by examining its mediating role in attenuating the effects of media exposure on public opinion and how individual differences may moderate the linkage between exposure and credibility. We test our moderated mediated model of opinion formation within the emerging competitive and fractured media landscape of Lebanon. Our findings suggest that audience assessment of the credibility of competing news sources mediates the relationship between news exposure and Anti-American sentiment. Religious identification was found to be an inconsistent moderator of the link between media exposure and credibility. Implications for communication theory surrounding media credibility and opinion formation and for public diplomacy in the region are discussed.",News Evaluation and Credibility,Mass Communication

Our model was evaluated based on survey data collected from 256 college students who read a news article discussing the harmful effects of multitasking. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that participants’ emotions (i.e., anger, moral emotions, and general positive emotions) and perceptions of how others perceived the source of the information, but not presumed influence on others, predicted news credibility. News credibility and emotions explained 58% and 24% of the variance in supporting publication of the article and intentions to avoid multitasking, respectively. Results support the inclusion of emotional responses in media credibility research.",News Evaluation and Credibility,Mass Communication
2014-0039,2014,Paper Session,Narrative Persuasion as a Mechanism of Framing Effects: The Mediating Role of Engagement With Characters in Crime News,3,"Framing has been explained as a heuristic process typical for persuasion through rhetoric texts. However, given the centrality of victims and perpetrators in crime news, it was investigated whether framing could be accomplished through inviting readers` engagement. This would establish narrative persuasion as a mechanism of framing effects since character engagement is key to it. An online experiment (N=282) manipulated character perspective (victim, perpetrator, or neutral) and measured character blaming as an indicator of framing effects. Perspective taking, identification, sympathy, and empathy were measured as possible mediators; it was predicted that framing will be enabled by the less intense processes of perspective taking and sympathy since news represents shorter and less literary narratives in comparison to fictional stories. This was confirmed in regard to the effects of the perpetrator but not the victim perspective. Results are discussed in the light of story schemas´ impact on affective dispositions towards characters.",Narrative Engagement and Persuasion,Mass Communication

The study found that the two factors interacted to influence victim blame and helping intention through affecting the perceived psychological distance of the victim such that, when the level of access to the victim’s inner world was relatively high, the first-person (vs. third-person) narrative increased victim blame and reduced helping intention by motivating participants to distance themselves from the victim.

2014-0041,2014,Paper Session,The Elements of Narrative Engagement and Their Influence on Beliefs and Empathic Insight,4,"This research explores the relative importance of the subdimensions of narrative engagement on two types of outcome, story-consistent beliefs and empathic insight. Two experiments (n=107, n= 157) manipulated three dimensions of narrative engagement: narrative understanding, attentional focus and emotional engagement in two repeated measures experiments. Results indicate that, even though interrelated, the dimensions can be grouped into primary and secondary dimensions: A distraction task lowered attentional focus and inserting flaws into the narrative lowered narrative understanding, which in turn lowered both narrative presence and emotional engagement. Emotional content on the other hand increased emotional engagement, but had almost no influence on attention and understanding. Of all engagement dimensions, emotional engagement is the strongest mediator for both story-consistent beliefs and empathic insight. Slightly different paths of influence confirm the usefulness of differentiating between story-consistent beliefs and empathic insight, opening up interesting new avenues for future theorizing and research about narratives.",Narrative Engagement and Persuasion,Mass Communication
2014-0042,2014,Paper Session,The Role of a Narrative’s Emotional Flow in Promoting Persuasive Outcomes,2,"The study of narrative persuasion has increased dramatically in the past decade. Whereas much of this research focuses on story and character involvement, the role of emotion, and emotional flow specifically, has been understudied. In this article, we explore the multiple ways that the desire for and the experience of emotional shifts may promote the persuasive influence of narratives. First, we propose that the desire for an emotional shift (e.g., mood management) can guide message selection. Then, shifts in emotional states in response to the unfolding story may promote and sustain continued engagement with the narrative world. As such, influence of the narrative is likely enhanced. We then argue that the heightened state of narrative engagement and its associated emotional states has implications for post-message attitudes, both short-term attitude change as well as over-time change via emotion-driven topic involvement and social sharing. A research agenda for a greater integration of emotion into narrative research is proposed.",Narrative Engagement and Persuasion,Mass Communication

Results showed that perceived realism and perceived similarity were precedents of narrative engagement. There was no unique effect from parasocial interaction. There was evidence for direct impact from transportation and identification, as well as their indirect impact through enhancing elaboration and reducing reactance. However, message elaboration was found to be negatively associated with message perception.

2014-0044,2014,Paper Session,Correcting Misperceptions About the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change: The Role of Providing an Explanation,4,"Prior research suggests that understanding that a large majority of scientists are convinced that climate change is happening is positively associated with belief that climate change is: real; human-caused; a serious threat; solvable; and worthy of being addressed. Research on other issues has shown that a simple corrective statement may fail if more fundamental erroneous beliefs are not also corrected. Our study tests the effect of corrections about the consensus with or without one or multiple explanations for why the misperception may have developed in the first place. Although we did not find that providing an explanation heightened the effect of a correction, our results replicate past findings that corrections can dramatically reduce misunderstandings about the consensus. Moreover, we found that message effects were larger among political conservatives than liberals. Furthermore, we found important indirect effects such that changes in perceived scientific agreement increased other key beliefs about climate change.",Public Understanding of Climate Change: From Misperceptions to Engagement,Environmental Communication

In addition to measuring variables previously used in the social scientific literature to predict climate change policy support and pro-environmental behavioral intentions, including risk perception, environmental values, negative affect, salience, and perceived knowledge, this study explored the role of information processing (i.e., systematic or heuristic) of climate change mitigation information. Results suggested that, controlling for policy support and behavior at time 1, increased salience and higher levels of negative affect predicted support for policy and increased intentions to engage in pro-environmental behavior at time 2, as did systematic processing of climate change-related information.

This case study focuses on the development, accomplishments, and challenges of this unique collaboration among civil society groups working in climate change issues in Latin America with a U.S. based partner, and the use of online media to achieve its goals. We used secondary data and in-depth interviews to examine this collaborative platform’s role in creating spaces for public deliberation.

2014-0047,2014,Paper Session,Women Farmers’ Voices on Climate Change: A Culture-Centered Approach to Climate Change Adaptation,2,"There is increasingly scholarly work to mainstream gender in climate change adaptation literature, as poor women are disproportionately affected by climate change impacts. Although there are several adaptation studies that call for urgent implementation of adaptation policies, most ignore gender-specific drivers of vulnerability. Moreover, even several feminist research on climate change adpatation, that analyze adaptation through the lens of power, access, and norms, are not grounded in lived experiences of poor women in the Global South. This paper applies culture-centered apporach to climate change by foregrounding the voices of lower-caste women farmers’ from low-income housholds in a semi-arid region in south India. Based on interviews and focus groups, we find that women farmers argue government policies such as promoting genetically modified crops negatively affects the adaptation strategies they already practise, for example, planting a variety of climate resilent food crops to adpat to increasing uncertainity of rainfall patterns. We suggest that adaptation research and policy-making should foreground the voices of marginalized communities such as women farmer’s to frame, implement and assess outcomes of climate change policies, in the absence of which, such policies would most likely perpetuate the gender-gap, and hinder equitable social change.",Public Understanding of Climate Change: From Misperceptions to Engagement,Environmental Communication
2014-0048,2014,Paper Session,“Global Warming” vs. “Climate Change”: The Influence of Terminology on Beliefs and Affective Imagery,6,"While scientists prefer the term ""climate change"" to ""global warming,"" the latter is still widely used in public discourse, and communicators question which term is more strategically effective. We examine the holistic affect and cognitive images Americans associate with each term, as well as the impact of these terms on climate change beliefs and risk perceptions. Americans are more likely to rate “global warming” as a bad thing than “climate change.” “Global warming” evokes more alarmist and naysayer images, while “climate change” evokes more associations with weather, particularly among those who are undecided about the issue. We find some differences among people with different political orientations and between Six Americas segments across key beliefs. We conclude that “climate change” may be the better term to use with the general public, but there may be times when communicators prefer to use “global warming” with specific audiences.",Public Understanding of Climate Change: From Misperceptions to Engagement,Environmental Communication

This paper deals with the use of networked spoof videos for the construction of an alternative memory in China. It discusses the redressing the “inequality of memory”, and with it the redressing of the imbalance of power, made possible by the accessibility and affordability of media technology. I start with a review on the relationship between memory and power, and the changes that Internet as a mnemonic system has brought to their configuration before turning to memory policy in contemporary China and the challenges posed to this policy by active users on the Internet.. I argue that the control of memory in China is realized through the monopoly of the media and the language system. To borrow the term of Michael McGee (1980) I call the latter “ideographs”. I illustrate with two widely circulated internet spoof videos, Little Rabbit, Be Good and Grass-mud Horse, how the memory control regime of the state is subverted and an alternative memory is constructed by spoof videos. I argue that this constructive process negates the official version of memory, strips bare all falsities and pretension, and signals an emergent model for the construction of memory and truth.","Counterprogramming: Resistance, Satire, Subversion",Popular Communication
2014-0050,2014,Paper Session,The Civic Value of Funny and Fictional Communication: The Comic Counterfactual,1,"This essay constructs and explores the comic counterfactual as a device that can generate new avenues for persuasion, agency, and empowered citizenship amidst seemingly recalcitrant political conditions. Threading together interdisciplinary work on counterfactuals with discourses from the comedic activist group the Yes Men, I find that comic counterfactuals productively interrogate lines between truth and falsity to move private interests into public culture, targeting the subtle determinisms that can so easily creep into communication. The analysis demonstrates three temporal functions fashioned by this type of messaging, making powerful institutional narratives less essential and more liminal: by (re)constituting public memories about the past, amplifying mystifications in the present, and generating possibilities for the future. The essay concludes with several implications for communication research and practice.","Counterprogramming: Resistance, Satire, Subversion",Popular Communication

My analysis focuses on vinyl records and printed zines, two examples of low-tech media persisting in the early 21st century. These case studies reveal anti-capitalist, anti-corporate strains in the Slow Media movement, which is not necessarily anti-digital. The Slow Media perspective elaborates a critique of consumer culture and reveals possibilities for collective intervention in the cultural domination and commodification that its advocates perceive. Slow Media are essentially alternative media whose proponents frame the use of print and analog forms as an act of cultural resistance with both progressive and conservative aspects.","Counterprogramming: Resistance, Satire, Subversion",Popular Communication

A week before, Israel's sports channels refused to play the first leg of semi-final matches since one of the games coincided with Holocaust Remembrance Day. And, again, a week later, Israeli sports fans were confounded with the same issue, with Memorial Day coinciding with the soccer tournament's second leg of semi-final games. It is well known that sports spectatorship is a transformative experience through which fans escape their humdrum lives, just as religious experiences help the faithful to transcend their everyday existence. In an era where alternative channels (TV, Internet etc.) are easy to find, we used in-depth interviews with sports fans to learn more about the dilemma of both public and private media expressions and watching and enjoying soccer matches while the Israeli nation is in agony. Findings reveal a whole different viewing experience whereas instead of group watching, cheering and eating together rituals, on a regular match day, an unaccompanied, quiet and even embarrassing experience was marked.","Counterprogramming: Resistance, Satire, Subversion",Popular Communication

The current research attempted to examine the effects of a partake-in-our-cause (PIOC) message in CSR communication on reducing the negative publicity effect. A true experimental design was employed in a laboratory setting to test the main effect of PIOC on the attention to the message, cognitive responses, and company evaluations.

2014-0059,2014,Paper Session,The Effect of Advertisement Customization and Narrative Transportation on Online Advertising Effectiveness,2,"Informed by the agency model of customization and transportation theory, the current study examined how advertisement customization and narrative transportation affect online advertising effectiveness. A 2 (ad customization: choice vs. no choice) x 2 (narrative transportation: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment (N = 113) found that the effect of advertisement customization on ad and brand attitudes is moderated by viewers’ degree of transportation, such that ad choice heightens ad and brand attitudes under low levels of transportation but decreases ad and brand attitudes under high levels of transportation. In addition, advertisement customization reduced viewers’ perception of ad intrusiveness but also decreased the frequency of brand recall. Finally, path analyses suggest that customization has an indirect effect on ad and brand attitudes through the serial indirect effect of sense of control and perceived relevance.

2014-0060,2014,Paper Session,The Role of Cognitive Dissonance in the Selection of Online Reviews,1,"Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957) posits that individuals experience a heightened level of dissonance when they make an important decision between two relatively attractive options that have little or no overlap in attributes. Individuals select information in an effort to reduce the dissonance they experience. After making a purchase, consumers may select online reviews to reduce dissonance. Following this framework, the present research applies cognitive dissonance theory and hypothesizes that the reviews that individuals select and read aim to reduce the dissonance that they experience. The results show that dissonance did not lead to differences in the frequency of review selection. However, participants read reviews that supported their original decision earlier than unsupportive reviews. Results show that the reviews individuals selected to read reduced the dissonance they experienced.

This paper investigates how posting and viewing online negative word-of-mouth (NWOM) affect customers’ subsequent purchase behaviors. We also identify different types of negative emotions expressed in NWOM and examine their impact. Using a dataset that combines customers’ posting and viewing activities on the firm’s online forum and their purchase and redemption histories, we find the interaction effect between posting and redeeming to be positive, and viewing to be negative. Regarding emotions, anger has a negative effect, while concern has a positive effect. We propose an explanation for these findings, and discuss their implications and applications.",Consumer Behavior and Social Media,Communication and Technology

In contrast to previous research, which conceptualized role as dichotomous (initiator or resistor), this paper proposes a third category that acknowledges episodes of a serial argument can be initiated by both partners over time. This possibility is connected to the concept of interdependence, and analyses of serial arguments in interpersonal relationships (N = 346) are presented to highlight the effects of interdependence. Five hypotheses in which one’s role in a serial argument is examined were proposed. Results offered support for three hypotheses and partial support for one of the hypotheses.

2014-0063,2014,Paper Session,A Theory of Interpersonal Goals and Situations,1,"This paper tests a resolution of the difficulties in specifying how goals and situations relate to one another. The new theory suggests a distinction among situational features. “Reasonably apparent” features are those that are fairly obvious at the start of an interaction. “Subjective” features are emergent and depend on a participant’s experience of the interaction. The proposed theory is that reasonably apparent situation features cause primary goals, which cause subjective situational characteristics, which in turn activate secondary goals. In Study 1 (N = 461), results of analysis of open-ended situational descriptions were consistent with this new theory. The difficulties in testing complex causal relations with categorical data led to Study 2 (N = 1435), which also supported the new theory.",New Perspectives in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Study 1 surveyed close, same-sex friends, and same-sex roommates were surveyed in Study 2. Results indicated that transcendence is a multidimensional construct, following the proposed five dimensions. Additionally, sex differences in the experience of transcendence were found for both close, same-sex friends and for roommates. Roommates experienced significantly less transcendence than friends. The second study assessed the associations among transcendence and psychological closeness, everyday contact, and similarity, finding positive relationships among all variables measured. Overall, these findings contribute to literature on dyadic interactions and offer a promising step in the study of interpersonal transcendence.",New Perspectives in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

However, little research has examined the effects of these disclosures on confidants. As such, the Confidant Response Theory (CRT) is advanced. The CRT is a framework that advances three phases (structural elements, cost-benefit analysis of engaging, and boundary management) to explain the impact of structural features and outcome expectancies on confidant decision-making processes. A set of four structural features characteristic of both online and offline interaction are outlined. These structural features are proposed to impact a confidant’s evaluation of possible emotional, relational, and identity-based outcomes which may potentially result from helping the discloser. Finally, these costs and benefits are weighted and result in the decision to either engage with the discloser (in the form of either reciprocal disclosure or social support), or avoid either the discloser or the topic of the disclosure.",New Perspectives in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

framing analysis (N = about 150 stories) revealed a mix of episodic and thematic stories.
Episodic stories always described the method of suicide but rarely discussed the underlying web
of precipitating events. Even in thematic stories that addressed the cause of suicide, the cause
was typically attributed to a single event (for example, bullying), and the multifactorial,
complicated causes of this public health issue were rarely discussed. Findings from the experiment revealed that framing of suicide coverage affects social and individual responsibility attributions
for the act. The study has implications for issues of suicide contagion, the role of the community in suicide prevention, and how stigmatization can make invisible social determinants of mental
health.",Health Message Framing Issues,Health Communication
2014-0071,2014,Paper Session,Newspaper Representation of Autism in China: A Framing Analysis,3,"The public’s lack of understanding as well as their misconceptions about autism in China contribute to the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the disorder and the stigma associated with it. Mass media is the primary channel through which people learn about autism. This paper examines how leading newspapers in China cover autism in the 10-year period between 2003 and 2012 through a framing analysis. It finds that while autism has received increased media attention, it is increasingly framed as a family problem—family members are cited or quoted more than any other sources and the responsibility of dealing with autism is ultimately assigned to families. Autistic people are largely silenced unless they are autistic savants with special talents. The use of the scientific discourse and the human interest discourse both decrease over time in percentage, while the use of other discourses such as the public relations discourse becomes more dominant.",Health Message Framing Issues,Health Communication

A survey and experiment showed that when participants make one food choice in an experimental setting it does not necessarily correspond with their intentions to eat healthy. However, when participants reported their food choices two weeks later, the behavior intentions were significant, positive predictors of behavior. This indicates that in the short term, a number of individual and environmental factors are likely to influence a singular food choice. In the long-term, participants are more likely to make a series of behavior choices that are consistent with their intentions. Additional reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.",Applications of Health Behavior Change Theory,Health Communication

Results (N=200) of an online questionnaire found that perceived similarity to the PSA spokesperson was significantly associated with three dimensions of source credibility (competence, trustworthiness, goodwill), each of which in turn influenced social identification with the spokesperson. Social identification with the spokesperson exerted a positive impact on the audiences’ diet and exercise self-efficacy. Significant differences were also found between overweight viewers and non-overweight viewers for perceived similarity, social identification, and source credibility.

S. publics would directly or indirectly influence various constructs of the Theory of Planed Behavior (TPB) including intention to take part in genetic testing and research. Consistent with the TPB framework, attitudes, injunctive norm, descriptive norm, and perceived self-efficacy were positively associated with higher intention to participate in genetic testing and research. Further, behavioral beliefs, injunctive norms, and perceived self-efficacy were directly positively affected by online deliberations. Those participating in online deliberations had less negative beliefs about volunteering for genetic testing as a part of genetic research. These reduced negative beliefs, in turn, contributed to more positive attitudes, increased injunctive and descriptive norms, and enhanced self-efficacy. These relationships, in turn, were associated with higher intention to participate in genetic testing and research.

Children in the treatment group interacted with the virtual pet, setting physical activity goals and being empowered to teach tricks to the virtual pet when their goals were met. Children in the control group interacted with a computer system presenting equivalent features, but without the virtual pet. Physical activity and goal attainment were evaluated using activity monitors. Results indicated that children in the treatment group engaged in 1.09 hours more of physical activity daily than the children in the control group. Exercising self-efficacy and beliefs served as mediators driving this increase in physical activity. Children that interacted with the virtual pet also expressed higher intentions than children in the control group to continue exercising in the future, even without the continued presence of the virtual pet.",Applications of Health Behavior Change Theory,Health Communication

Recently, the affects of Genetically Modified (GM) techonlogies on agricultural practises and health has emerged as a key debate, particularly in the global South, between government and transnational corporations (TNCs) at one end, and poor and marginalized groups such as farmer organizations, and non-profit organizations at the other end. We apply a culture-centered approach to assess the impacts of agricultrual technologies, specifically Bt cotton, by foregrounding the voices of lower caste women farmers’ from low-income households in a semi-arid region in south India. Based on interviews, and focus groups, we find that women farmers’ articultate alternative development pathway through community’s sovereinty over seeds and farms by resisting increased monopolization of agriculture sector by TNCs. Narratives also suggest that ownership of community media is important to resist the increasing nexus between academia, industry, and the media, and to ensure public participation in GM crops debate. We conclude that future communication research should interrogate the ways in which the benefits of newer agriculture technologies result in increasing disparities between the rich and poor farmers by co-constructing knowledge with marginalized groups through listening and dialogue.",Critical Perspectives in Development Communication,Global Communication and Social Change

Its goals include the connection of every African village to the global information network by 2010. Africa’s integration into the transnational communication system and global information economy, it was presumed, would ‘leapfrog’ continent-wide development. However, at the end of 2010, many villages are still without electricity not to talk of having the internet services. In view of the inherent contradictions between the transnational character of the AISI and the national characters of the region, this paper analyzes the challenges and obstacles that confronted the AISI buy-in and ICTs for development agenda in Africa.

2014-0081,2014,Paper Session,Advertising Expertise: Antecedents to Recognition of Workers’ Expertise in Organizations,1,"Organizations often struggle to identify and utilize the expertise of employees. In response to this challenge organizational communication researchers have explored different ways that the distribution of knowledge among workers, relationships among employees, and communicative practices of individuals might aid the process of recognizing expert workers. However, extant research is largely based upon the perspective that particular forms of expertise exist to be recognized by observers. This study challenges the assumption that others merely identify workers’ expertise, and instead treats expertise as something that can be advertised to coworkers. Drawing on survey data from 97 employees at a financial services company we find that it is active communication practices, and not structural influences, that lead to an employee having his or her expertise recognized by coworkers. The findings extend theory that views individual expertise in organizations as a communicative phenomenon shaped through ongoing work practices.",On Good Authority: Leadership and Expertise in the Workplace,Organizational Communication

This study employs, in a social constructionist fashion, a discursive lens (Fairhurst, 2007) and sensemaking approach (Weick, 1995, Weick et al., 2005) to study the contextual factors salient on co-workers’ discourse of “communicative leadership“. Drawing from focus group interviews with co-workers in a Swedish business organization, it was identified several contextual factors signalling for co-workers’ dissatisfaction with communication and their relationship with their leaders. The findings stressed the divergence between the discursive constructions of “communicative leadership” and the context where it occurs. “Communicative leadership” is deeply rooted in context, yet it is a projected reality reflecting inversely the deficiencies experience in the work environment. In the intersection of these discourses is created a space for negotiation between this projected reality and co-workers’ experienced reality.

Hence, by exploring the relationships between supervisory communication, leader-member exchange and OCB, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interpersonal exchanges between supervisors and employees as well as how these interactions can motivate employees to enact citizenship behavior, which eventually contribute to organizational effectiveness. Based on a sample of 520 full-time employees in a variety of organizations, the results indicate that all forms of supervisory communication are significantly related with OCB and partially mediate the relation between LMX and OCB.

Through an online survey, the study found that supervisor-subordinate conversational richness has a significant predictive effect on work role ambiguity. However, supervisor-subordinate conversational richness interacts with communication frequency in their effects on role conflict and role overload.

Nevertheless, there has been no clear elaboration of how mobile phone uses translate into mobilization in contentious politics. To fill this gap, the current study employs Passy’s (2003) framework of threefold function of social ties as channels of mobilization to examine how mobile communication, embedding the dynamics of social ties, influences protest mobilization. It investigates two cases in rural and urban China in which Chinese people employed their mobile phones to mobilize participants for protests and conducts 24 in-depth interviews with participants in these protests. Findings suggest that using mobile phones for mobilization registers the relational dynamics of social ties, which shapes participants’ perceptions of given protest issues, ensures the safety of protest recruitment and mobilization in a repressive context, and generates pressure on participation, all of which contribute to the mechanism of mobilization. This study concludes with the concept of “relational mobilization” that addresses the embedment and relevance of social ties in the process of mobile-phone–mediated mobilization and its implication for Asian countries.",Mobile Phones and Macro to Micro Behaviors,Communication and Technology

Yet, to date, how the use of mobile phones affects participation in protests remains unclear. This study employs the distinction between communication and metacommunication to investigate the informational and relational dimensions of the mobile phone in protest mobilization in four cases in China. By drawing upon fifty-three in-depth interviews, the results reveal that, in addition to communicating mobilizing information, participators metacommunicate their mutual relationships via mobile phones in the mobilization process, which shape the practice of information exchange and the interpretation of information. As the pivotal driving force for protest participation, the metacommunication involves an engagement of reciprocal relationship, generates a sense of mutual engagement, and enhances a feeling of solidarity. The dynamic of the mobile phone as a facilitator in protest lies in its embedding of metacommunication beyond information dissemination.",Mobile Phones and Macro to Micro Behaviors,Communication and Technology

Research suggests that negative campaign information (Iyengar et al., 2012), increasing media fragmentation (Prior, 2007), and use of partisan media outlets all contribute to attitude polarization (Levendusky, 2013). This study adds to this line of inquiry by examining whether important structural changes to the media system in 1996, which included the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the introduction of Fox News, affected TV news’ contribution to polarization. Using the American National Election Studies (ANES) cumulative data file, we test the media’s contribution to polarization before and after 1996 using spline regression.

Based on industry and government sources, we constructed a country-level dynamic panel of 39 countries from 2007 to 2011. The data set includes the individual nation trends of media industries in terms of % GDP, country-specific economic status, unique characteristics of media industries, and broadband Internet penetration. The results show that 1) the Internet negatively affects aggregate revenue of established media industry in terms of % of GDP and 2) the development of the Internet may lead the shift of the balance from advertising, toward direct payment revenue.

Story schemas become specifically important for antihero narratives, where viewers encounter moral transgressions they would likely not approve when encountered in real life. Participants were exposed to either a hero or antihero TV crime drama in two quasi-experimental studies. Reaction time measurements were employed as a means to assess the narrative schemas. Study One supports the assumption for underlying schemas that impact moral-judgment making, irrespective of the moral complexity of the character in question. Study Two differentiates between a hero and antihero schema and illuminates how schema-related responses are context sensitive. In short, moral transgressions are more likely to be accepted inside a narrative context than outside a narrative context.

Research on suspense has demonstrated that character liking and morally just outcomes are associated with greater suspense and enjoyment. However, it is possible that narrative event timing may alter the importance of morality. In an experiment, 157 undergraduates were randomly assigned to read one of four versions of a short story with different outcome to an event that was recounted in the middle of the narrative: 1) protagonist success/antagonist failure, 2) protagonist success/antagonist success, 3) protagonist failure/antagonist failure, or 4) protagonist failure/antagonist success.

Among these studies, demographic variables have attracted a lot of attention, in spite of their inconclusive findings. In this study, we examined if ethnicity predicts consumers’ environmental attitudes.

In social marketing literature, fear appeals in green advertising have been used to change consumers’ green behavior. As a result, it is important to examine if different levels of guilt appeals affect post-exposure consumers’ attitude toward the green ad (Aad) and the green brand (Ab) when taking into consideration the moderating roles of ethnicity and environmental attitudes.

This study used a post-test only between subject experiment among 108 college students. Empirical results showed that ethnicity was found to predict consumers’ environmental attitudes, which lends support the environmental deprivation theory that predicts Hispanic minority population to be more sensitive and concerned than Whites about the environmental issues. Results from the MANCOVA analysis also found the guilt appeal level in green advertising significantly predicted consumers’ attitude toward the green ad (Aad) and the green brand (Ab). Those who were exposed to a low guilt ad were found to have more positive Aad and Ab, compared with its counterparts exposed to a high guilt ad.

Perceptions of accountability and trust led to favorable persuasion coping outcomes for the sponsor—identification with positive message themes and perception of shared values—which in turn led to positive attitudes toward the corporation and its environmental impact. Contrary to expectations, participants’ environmental concern did not decrease favorability of response but was positively associated with favorable persuasion coping outcomes for the sponsor and positive attitudes towards the sponsor and its environmental impact. This effect was reversed among environmental organization members and those with at least a four-year college degree.

As a part of evaluation of the collaborative stormwater outreach and education campaign, a campus-wide survey was conducted to identify predictors of public engagement in a watershed protection program. A test of the proposed model using structural equation modeling procedures corroborated all the hypotheses except two related to constraint recognition. The situational variables were positively correlated with two types of communication related behaviors: information seeking and information sharing. The test also yielded a significant association between communication behaviors and public engagement in the watershed protection program, mediated by the use of organizational and social media for information on the issue.","Relationship, Engagement, and Nonprofit Public Relations",Public Relations

2014-0106,2014,Paper Session,"Far From the Public Relations Good Life: Small, Community-Based Nonprofits and Local Community Stakeholders",1,"In-depth interviews with leaders (n=10) of small, community-based non-profit organizations (NPOs) reveal that significant human and financial resource constraints on public relations plague these NPOs. Although existing models offer rich strategies for formalizing public relations, the NPO leaders expressed an inability to accomplish any meaningful public relations efforts beyond interpersonal connections, especially with their local communities. Stakeholder theory and public relations’ models are explored and public relations opportunities are identified for academic researchers, PR professional associations, and local community foundations to help small, community-based NPOs build broader, more effective, strategic connections and relationships with their communities.","Relationship, Engagement, and Nonprofit Public Relations",Public Relations
2014-0107,2014,Paper Session,"Children’s Attitudinal and Behavioral Response to Advergaming: Product Involvement, Brand Attitude, and Persuasion Knowledge",3,"The central aim of this study is to build upon previous research by investigating attitudinal and behavioural responses of children to advergames, taking into account product involvement, prior brand attitude and persuasion knowledge. 280 respondents between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in the study. First, they were asked to complete a pre-test survey. Two weeks later, all respondents were asked to play an advergame and to complete a survey addressing attitudinal change, purchase intention, persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the game. Our analysis reveals that attitude changes are greater for brands with positive prior brand attitude. Further, children reported stronger intentions to buy high-involvement products and brands previously evaluated positively. Neither purchase intentions nor attitudinal changes varied according to the level of persuasion knowledge (low/high). This finding confirms that persuasion knowledge is still of limited effectiveness in minimising the vulnerability of children to the effects of advergaming.",Appeals to Young People Through Advertising and Programming,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0108,2014,Paper Session,Evaluating Industry Self-Regulation of Food Marketing to Children: A Longitudinal Study,3,"Concern has grown about the role of food marketing as a contributor to childhood obesity. This led the food industry to adopt a program of self-regulation, with participating companies promising to limit child-targeted advertising to healthier products. This study assesses the impact of industry self-regulation by comparing the advertising content on children’s television programs both before and after the initiative was implemented. Findings indicate that participating companies have fulfilled their specific self-regulatory commitments, but that no significant improvement in the overall nutritional quality of foods marketed to children has been achieved. This outcome likely occurs because of the weak nutritional standards employed for self-regulation, as well as the fact that a substantial proportion of child-oriented food marketers do not participate in self-regulation. This pattern of advertising behavior raises questions about the sincerity of the food industry’s efforts to address concerns about childhood obesity.",Appeals to Young People Through Advertising and Programming,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0109,2014,Paper Session,Portrayals of Bullying on Teen Television: Destined to Deter or Bound to Backfire?,1,"This is a content analysis of the prevalence and context of portrayals of bullying within 11 teen television series. Drawing from contextual factors studied in the National Television Violence Study (Smith et al., 1998), it examines 355 acts of physical, verbal, indirect, and cyber bullying in terms of humor, harm to victims, interventions by third party characters, and anti-bullying themes. Results indicate significant differences across bullying types for all variables except third party intervention, with portrayals of physical and verbal bullying identified as most “high-risk” (i.e. depicting bullying in ways that research suggests increase the likelihood of negative effects) in terms of humorous portrayals and harm shown to victims, and cyber bullying as most “high-risk” in terms of appearing in anti-bullying themed episodes. Overall, trends across the sample suggest that teen television sends concerning messages about bullying to young viewers, including the notions that bullying can be funny or harmless.",Appeals to Young People Through Advertising and Programming,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0110,2014,Paper Session,Food Brand Recognition and BMI in U.S. Preschoolers,4,"Child food brand recognition predicts health-related outcomes such as preference for obesogenic foods and increased overweight. However, it is uncertain to what degree food brand recognition acts as a proxy for more pervasive influences like family demographics, child vocabulary, parent healthy eating guidance, child TV viewing, and child dietary intake, all of which may influence food brand recognition. Preschoolers (N=247, average age 56 months) provided biometric data for BMI and completed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test plus recognition and recall measures for 30 U.S. food brands. Parents completed measures of healthy eating guidance, child dietary intake, child TV viewing, parent education, household income, parent BMI, and child race/ethnicity. Controlling these variables, child food brand recognition significantly predicted child BMI percentile. Discussion focuses on the need to explore family rituals that create food-brand loyalties and affective connections that may increase energy intake early in life.",Appeals to Young People Through Advertising and Programming,Children Adolescents and Media

Although representations of females and minority children in animated cartoons have improved over the years, stereotypical and racially biased portrayals of females and minority groups remain. Using an intersectionality theoretical lens, a close textual analysis was conducted to examine the representation of two female, racial minority characters in children’s animated cartoons: Doc McStuffins and Dora the Explorer. Character portrayals, stereotypes, challenges to traditional stereotypes, and the intersecting role of race, gender and class on the representation of these characters are explored in this analysis.",Appeals to Young People Through Advertising and Programming,Children Adolescents and Media

This paper examines sense-making about hurtful episodes between parents and adolescents and how this affects subsequent communication. Results highlight differences in the type of events parents and adolescents find hurtful, as well as revealing a complex set of forces that influence how parents and children make sense of hurtful events. Furthermore, our findings provide some indication that sense-making about hurtful events can affect both observed and perceived characteristics of follow-up conversations about hurt.

The sample consisted of 82 families of married couples with an adolescent child. Wives were more stressed by the conversation than husbands, which was indicative of the wives’ increased cortisol and sAA after the conversation. Wives who experienced an elevated cortisol trajectory used more co-rumination and had low community support. They also had low economic uncertainty and used more communal coping with their husbands. The husbands, however, particularly husbands with high economic uncertainty, exhibited low, unresponsive cortisol patterns. The amount that parents talked about their financial worries to their adolescent was not associated with the adolescent’s mental health, baseline cortisol, or baseline sAA. Nevertheless, husbands’ and wives’ economic uncertainty and the extent to which they co-ruminated about it with one another were negatively associated with their own mental health. These findings held true regardless of ethnicity, the length of time the parents had experienced the financial uncertainty, and household income.",Advances in Family Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0114,2014,Paper Session,Integrating the Relational Turbulence Model and a Multiple Goals Approach to Understand Children-in-Law’s Uncertainty Management During the Transition to Extended Family,2,"The present study integrated two robust theoretical frameworks—the relational turbulence model and a multiple goals approach—to understand why the mechanisms of turbulence (i.e., uncertainty and interdependence processes) are linked to more reactive communication (i.e., topic avoidance) during the transition to extended family. Specifically, the current manuscript examined how one factor that likely shapes children-in-law’s communicative responses to the mechanisms of turbulence (i.e., uncertainty and interdependence processes) and the relational consequences that follow—interaction goals (i.e., the goal of managing uncertainty). Results revealed that in addition to direct links among the mechanisms of turbulence, interaction goals, topic avoidance, and relationship satisfaction, the goal of managing uncertainty (i.e., reducing and maintaining) significantly mediated the association between the mechanisms of turbulence and children-in-law’s topic avoidance. Collectively, these results suggest that interaction goals can help explain, at least partially, the processes that undergird the associations between the mechanisms of turbulence and topic avoidance.",Advances in Family Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0115,2014,Paper Session,Overparenting is Associated With Child Problems and a Critical Family Environment,4,"Overparenting involves the application of developmentally inappropriate parenting tactics that far exceed the actual needs of adolescents and emerging adults. Past research as well as elements of self-determination theory suggest that this type of parenting should be associated with greater child problems in relation to other people and a more critical family environment. These hypotheses were tested on 477 emerging adult child-parent dyads from 30 of the 50 United States who both completed self-report measures of overparenting and elements of a critical family environment. In addition, emerging adults completed self-reports of problems, primarily in relation to other people, and how they cope with them. Results of a structural equation model indicated that the child, but not parent, overparenting latent variable was strongly associated with reports of more child problems. Both the emerging adult child and parent overparenting latent variables were positively and significantly associated with the critical family environment latent variable. These results can be usefully explained by several postulates of self-determination theory and add to a growing literature pointing to the ill effects of overparenting when applied to emerging adults.",Advances in Family Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0116,2014,Paper Session,Relational Turbulence in the Family: A Changing Dynamic Between Emerging Adults and Their Parents,2,"As emerging adults develop into adults, they begin to explore life more and more outside the family as they progressively move toward greater degrees of autonomy and become less dependent on their parents. The Relational Turbulence Model (RTM) provides a theoretical framework for exploring this specific time of change. This study investigates emerging adulthood as the catalyst for change in the parent-child relationship and examines the experience of relational uncertainty, struggle for autonomy, and goal interference. By analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data gathered from a survey of 156 emerging adults (aged 18-25), this study provides insight into what relational turbulence looks like during this time of change and its relationship to young adults’ use of deceptive communication. The results yielded descriptions of relational uncertainty and goal interference in the parent-child context and support for the Relational Turbulence Model as a model for processes of relational change in the family",Advances in Family Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0117,2014,Paper Session,Talking The Talk: An Exploration of Parent-Child Communication About Cyberbullying,2,"This study had the goal of uncovering if parents talk to their children about cyberbullying, and how they approach these conversations. This study was grounded in the idea that parent-child communication is valuable for developing belief systems, and for making positive and effective changes to behavior and perceptions. One hundred and forty-eight parents with children ages 10-18 completed an online survey designed to discover if and how they engage in conversations about cyberbullying with their child. Results indicated that parents are talking with their children about cyberbullying, and that they approach such conversations inductively. However, analysis revealed that although conversations about cyberbullying are occurring, they are limited in scope, and focus on indirect behaviors. It is suggested that the limited nature of these conversations may stem from media representations of cyberbullying, and as such producers of media content should work toward showcasing more all-encompassing presentations of the behavior.",Advances in Family Communication,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0118,2014,Paper Session,Visually Integrated Collaborative Ideation: Changing the Dynamics of Creativity in Design Teams,9,"This study examines the dynamics of collaboration and creativity in brainstorming teams. We hypothesize that visually integrated collaborative design environments provide affordances that enhance participation and turn-taking dynamics, leading to stronger elaboration and fluency in ideation, and generating higher quality outcomes of collaboration and creativity. We designed a prototype Visually Integrated Cyber-Enabled Design (V-ICED) system, and then examined how teams collaborate on a toy design task using the V-ICED system compared to traditional pencil-and-paper methods. We used real-time sociometric data to measure collaboration dynamics, and the effect of environment on creativity and collaboration outcomes. Findings indicate that the affordances of V-ICED fundamentally change collaborative dynamics by increasing turn-taking and successful interrupts, as well as participation equity, creating a more collaborative dynamic in design teams. Enhanced turn-taking is indicative of elaboration, an important construct of creativity as well as collaboration. Findings also suggest that V-ICED affordances positively affect collaboration quality and creative fluency, but not the experience of creative flow.",Team Performance in Online Environments,Communication and Technology
2014-0119,2014,Paper Session,Communicative Bursts and Idea Sharing in Collaborative Engineering Design Processes,7,"In this study we examine the dynamics between communicative markers and idea sharing in collaborative teams. We hypothesize that there are identifiable communicative signatures of speech volume and body movement, called bursts, which correlate with one another. Additionally, we posit that communicative bursts by team members can predict idea generation from an ego member. To test these hypotheses, a Visually Integrated Cyber-enabled Design (V-ICED) system is used in conjunction with real-time sociometric data collected via wearable sensor technology during group brainstorming sessions (3,760 total observations, n = 11 participants). Our findings support the presence of bursts indicated by communicative markers and suggest that participant speech volume and body movement positively correlate with one another. Additionally, the findings indicate ego speech volume and body movement predict ego idea sharing, and that alter speech volume may predict ego idea sharing, but that alter body movement activity does not. Implications for brainstorming in engineering design contexts are discussed.",Team Performance in Online Environments,Communication and Technology

Given the popularity of multiplayer video games, such experiences might provide for a novel approach to studying the development of TMS with gamers engaging in a Contest task. Pertinent to TMS, multiplayer games require players to engage a highly-demanding and multimedia task (gamers engage each other using text and voice channels while playing on-screen) while also engaging each other in order to be played successfully. To this end, our paper looks at how perceptions of video game task demand and different communication channels are related to the development of TMS for zero-experience groups in League of Legends. Results demonstrate that perceptions of task demand and performance are associated with greater TMS, and that the association between task demand and TMS strengthens over time.",Team Performance in Online Environments,Communication and Technology

Grounded in the concept of co-presence, the current study explores in the gamified mHealth context 1) how mobile-mediated communication conditions affect the level of co-presence and 2) how different types and varying levels of the experienced co-presence are related to health outcomes. Result showed that (a) perceived geographical proximity between social entities, pre-existing social relationships, and consistency of mobile-mediated information with the objective world were positively related to the degree to which the users experience all three types of co-presence, and (b) co-presence with cooperators was positively related to perceived social support and exercise adherence, but (c) none of relationship between co-presence with competitors and health outcomes was statistically significant. Implications and direction for future studies are discussed.

Guided by dual-process models of information, the transactive model of attitude accessibility, and the extended parallel process model, this study also investigates effective theoretical mechanisms of tailored messages on attitude accessibility and behaviors through a conditional process model including threat and efficacy. Results of a lab experiment with 110 young adult college students, a high-risk population for contracting STDs, indicated tailored health ads are related to increased behavioral intent. Tailored, targeted, and graphic ads were related to increased attitude accessibility. Lastly, a mediated-moderated process model resulted in significant positive conditional indirect effects from ads that were tailored with embedded images on behavioral intent through increased efficacy compared to generic text ads.

Nurses who use cell phones in hospital settings can create tension among hospital employees who are concerned about cell phones as a source of distraction, annoyance for patients, and loss of productivity. These concerns have led some hospitals to establish policies prohibiting cell phone use in patient care areas, creating quandaries for nurses who still wish to carry their cell phones. To explore this issue further, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 hospital nurses. Results indicated that some nurses are very supportive of cell phone policies due to the distracting nature of mobile technology. However, these policies create dilemmas for nurses who wish to be connected to others outside of work as well as use their cell phones for work purposes and further blur lines between personal and professional life.",Technology and Health Communication,Health Communication

Self-report of emotional valence and arousal were collected. STRTs (secondary task reaction time), an indicator of resources available for processing were collected. Participants also completed an audio recognition test. Among the key findings were that low-fidelity (animated) messages were rated as more pleasant, and required the least amount of processing resources (i.e., had the fastest secondary task reaction times) compared to high-fidelity (unanimated) messages.

However, with a main focus on hard news, this debate pays little attention to corporate influence on media’s cross-promotion of affiliated media outlets, a shortcoming this study wishes to address by means of a diachronic quantitative content analysis of Flemish newspapers’ coverage of television programmes. The paper analyses if cross-media concentration results in cross-promotion of press outlets’ affiliated television stations. Results partly support the thesis that newspapers cover their affiliated television stations more frequently. However, the paper explores alternative explanations, such as characteristics of newspapers, target audiences and the television programmes obtaining coverage (including broadcast frequency and genre). Hence the paper points to the complexity of tackling cross-promotion and the importance of taking alternative elements into account.",Media Systems and Media Markets: Effects on Journalism,Journalism Studies

A case study investigates how the Norwegian media company Schibsted influences the content of its four regional newspapers Aftenposten, Fædrelandsvennen, Stavanger Aftenblad and Bergens Tidende. The aim is to establish the extent to which levels of pluralism are falling as a result of consolidation strategies. Schibsted’s cost-cutting measures initiated in 2012 include staff reductions, content syndication and centralisation of core services. This trend towards shrinking newsrooms, digital specialisation and centralised layout and editing is recognised internationally, particularly in chain newspapers. In this study, Schibsted's regional print and online news outlets are subjected to a comparative content analysis aiming to establish levels of homogenisation between the titles.

In an analysis of a survey to 1500 journalists in Poland, Russia and Sweden factors related to perceived autonomy in the daily work are analysed. Important factors explaining differences in perceived autonomy are found on the individual level (experience, gender, commitment in the work), on the organisational level (freedom to manage time and recourses) and on the societal level (political pressure and pressure from advertisers). Media development is found to influence factors related to autonomy in daily work in both positive and negative ways – more journalists passing through the profession, temporary employments and downsizing of newsroom is negatively linked with perceived autonomy. But new practices as multiskilling and increasing interactivity are linked with higher levels of autonomy in the daily work reported by the journalists.",Media Systems and Media Markets: Effects on Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0133,2014,Paper Session,"Marginalized Critical News Content, Spiked Stories / Series and Careers Subjected to the ‘Buzzsaw’",1,"This paper focuses on all major and reported post-Cold War instances of anti-democratic phenomena occurring within the U.S. news media industry: the “spiking” of news stories and investigations with critical inclinations; demotions to enterprising journalists or editors; cancellations of TV programs due to critical content and forced resignations of journalists; independent and wire-based stories overlooked by mainstream media; and investigative series whose follow-ups are either marginalized out of existence or simply spiked altogether. The reported occurrences are based on a plethora of damning evidence and documentation: testimony by journalists and/or their newsroom colleagues; audio-recorded conversations between editors and journalists; documented pressure by advertisers and/or powerful public officials; and documented meetings between editors and high powered officials, with subsequent decisions to spike stories and/or follow-up reporting. This underlying evidence shows a clear pattern of institutional constraints resulting in varying forms of censorship.

The focus on these occurrences, which is not only an attack on journalists but an attack on democracy as a whole, is of significant theoretical importance. The most important theoretical tension between two models of media analysis – the indexing and propaganda models (IM and PM) – is a conflicting attribution of culpability for poor media performance and the subsequent lack of news media independence. This paper represents an attempt to resolve this underlying theoretical tension by criticizing the disproportionate fault attributed to journalists themselves, as well as the underestimation by the PM of the role of “crude intervention” resulting from institutional constraints.",Media Systems and Media Markets: Effects on Journalism,Journalism Studies

CSR reports are seen as vehicles that carry the values, norms, and expectations of a particular society, and thus are used to examine the indigenous notion of CSR. Three themes emerged from the analysis of the CSR annual reports of 10 China-based companies: Looking Forward--Development and Modernization, Looking Outward--International Recognition and Global Success; and Looking Inward--Connection with Employees. These themes revealed that the Chinese notion of CSR is characterized by: 1, its positioning of social harmony as the end, and economic growth as means; 2, its association of economic growth to modernization; and 3, its arrangement of individual, corporation, and the country along a patriarchal hierarchy.",A World of Good: Diversity and Culture in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

Based on construal level theory, the study looks into the moderating effect of message framing (desirability & feasibility) on persuasiveness in different psychological distances. According to the results, desirability messages show higher persuasive power on CSR campaigns that yield long-term consequences and take place in distance places. On the other hand, feasibility messages show higher persuasive power on CSR campaigns that yield short-term (immediate) results in near places. There has been a positive interaction effects between distance dimensions as expected. Specifically, when both dimensions are near, persuasiveness are stronger by the feasibility messages than when one of, or both dimensions are distant.",A World of Good: Diversity and Culture in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

Specifically, it identified mediators for state-sponsored news media around the world. Findings suggest that the Twitter-based international network of state-sponsored media and their social mediators conformed to the hierarchical structure predicted by the world system theory over half a century ago. Furthermore, state-sponsored news media differed in their social media strategies, in particular their use of their own affiliated Twitter accounts.

At its forefront is the growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), which offer an active and interactive platform for socio-political development that paved the road to the 25 January revolution. After the ‘digital’ revolution many Egyptians clustered in networks, created parallel communication systems, each with its own identity, and interacted on issues of common concern. Witnessing a changing environment, several newsrooms have adopted ICTs in the hope that the new media would help them to develop their content and reconnect with their audiences. This study therefore aims to investigate the implementation and appropriation of ICTs, especially Internet technologies (netCTs), in three Egyptian newsrooms: Al Ahram, Al Dostor, and Al Masry Al Youm.

2014-0141,2014,Paper Session,Understanding the Use of Circumvention Tools to Bypass Online Censorship,3,"The circumvention tools to bypass online censorship, such as simple web proxies, virtual private network (VPN) service, HTTP/SOCKS proxies, etc., are considerably used in countries whose governments impose heavy Internet censorship. According to the statistics of Harvard Berkman center, around 18 million Internet users in China are currently using those tools to bypass the Great Firewall and gain unblocked online content. As the first of its kind, this study systematically examines a wide range of macro-social and micro-individual factors which affect the use of the circumvention tools to bypass the Internet censorship in a censored environment. This study explores why users adopt those tools under the guideline of an interactive communication technology adoption model proposed by Lin (2002, 2003). The results reveal that except social trust, all other macro-social factors fail in predicting the use of circumvention tools. In contrast, micro-individual level variables including perceived technology fluidity, gratifications and some demographic variables carry much more weight here. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Government Involvement in Communication Technology Networks,Communication and Technology

The current study explores narcissism, an exaggerated sense of one’s own agency and entitlement, as a cultural indicator chronically accessible to the viewing public. Participants completed an online survey with measures of daily television exposure, preference for specific television genres , and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. Sports, reality, horror, and political talk programs were positively associated with narcissism, even after controlling for general television usage; news was negatively associated with narcissism. These findings provide tentative preliminary support that media cultivates narcissism.

Reading times were recorded as partisans from two national organizations read a sequence of short passages from a balanced article about teaching evolution in public schools. Afterward, participants were individually re-presented with selected statements and asked to report the degree of counterarguing and the extent to which each passage favored either side of the issue. Compared to proattitudinal passages, counterattitudinal passages resulted in longer reading times, greater levels of reported counterarguing, and more extreme bias ratings. The data provide until-now elusive support for the selective processing explanation and suggest it may work in concert with other mechanisms to drive the hostile media perception.",Cultivation Studies in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

Within a cultivation study representative for the German population aged 18 and above (n=236), three different patterns are found for violence-related reality perceptions: Demographic fact knowledge (first-order) was solely influenced by television (as one major source of mass media content). Personal experience moderated the cultivation effect for victimization fears (second-order): Mainly those with no or more distant personal experience were influenced by television, indicating that mass media is important especially if no personal experience exists. Mean-world attitudes (second-order) – which may be considered a broader, more general concept – were influenced by personal experience and television independently.",Cultivation Studies in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

U.S. viewers are exposed mostly to U.S. content. Non-U.S. audiences are exposed to a mixture of local, U.S., and other content. International cultivation theory should therefore study what viewers learn about their own world from homegrown TV (primary cultivation), about the U.S. from U.S.-TV (secondary acculturation) and about their own world from U.S. TV (integration).
In an online split-ballot experiment of 1796 Flemish adolescents one group received generic “Scary World” questions (estimates and judgments). The second group received the same questions with the specification “in Flanders”. For the third group “in the U.S.” was added. All respondents detailed their exposure to Local, US, and other TV content. The study offered some evidence of primary cultivation, secondary acculturation and integration.

How the Supernatural Genre Affects Attitudes Toward Outgroups",2,"The supernatural genre, in which non-human creatures are the villains, may make salient the fact that we are all human. According to ingroup projection theory, this superordinate category should influence attitudes toward subgroups which are normally considered to be outgroups. In the present study, we examine the effects of the supernatural genre on attitudes toward the racial outgroup of African Americans, and on minority groups in general. In addition, we vary the race of the main (human) character, in order to further understand the interplay between racial groups and the superordinate category of “human.” Results suggest a complex relationship between exposure to supernatural villains and character race on a variety of attitudinal outcomes, with feeling close to humans as one mechanism. Consistent with ingroup projection, a White character fighting non-humans predicts more negative attitudinal outcomes. However, exposure to Black characters seems to act as a buffer against this effect.",Identity and Stereotypes in Mass Media,Mass Communication

Grounded in a social identity approach, the present study explored the relationship between Latina/os’ viewing of identity categories (i.e., accessibility, social norms, prototypes, and fit) embedded in ELLTP and self-esteem. A voluntary survey of 493 self-identified Latina/os found a positive relationship between identity categories and self-esteem shifts either at a personal (i.e., self-worth and self-capability) or collective dimension (i.e., ethnically-involved and ethnically-committed).

The hypothesis is that media stereotypes prime the “dark-skinned criminal” stereotype in memory which, in turn, influences subsequent face processing. An experiment with two groups was used to test this hypothesis. For the treatment group (n = 53), “dark-skinned criminals” were mentioned as the offenders.

A content analysis of audience comments on Sina Weibo and Facebook revealed significant findings on the existent cultural divergence and promising cultural convergence between China and the US. Findings suggest that Chinese audiences are inclined to embrace collectivism, but are reluctant to obey the hierarchy in real space. Additionally, both Chinese and American audiences are similar in showing antipathy online.

Hollywood films began to use Caucasian characters in yellow-face makeup to play Asian characters in the 1910’s. These yellow-faced characters were often represented with exaggerated physical features in order to play upon popular stereotypes and assert a white racial dominance. The current study is the first empirical research that explored the case of the yellow-faced characters in film by analyzing the demographic characteristics, physical appearance, cultural identity, character role, communication style and social image of Asian American portrayals in film. The content analysis results reveal that the picture of the portrayal of yellow-faced characters is mixed. Yellow-faced characters were equally likely to be a hero in these films relative to their non-ethnic counterparts (neither group portrayed villains). While yellow-faced characters were shown primarily as submissive and humble individuals who were dignified, honest and trustworthy, they were also presented as physically unattractive and undesirable foreigners.

2014-0155,2014,Paper Session,Towards a Radical Body Positive: Reading the Online “Body Positive Movement”,1,"Under the auspices of the “body positive movement” there has in recent years been a proliferation of websites dedicated to nurturing bodily acceptance. Responding to the barrage of media images reflecting a narrow bodily ideal, the movement and its related sites provide a space to showcase bodies of all shapes and sizes. There has already been significant engagement with the question of whether these sites are helpful or harmful, asking whether they fulfill their mission of combating the very narrow definition of the ideal body with which we are constantly bombarded. Yet this project addresses an aspect of these sites that is less readily interrogated- the kinds of bodily performances actually facilitated. Looking at three US-based “body positive” websites, this work explores how the body is both conceptualized and enacted on these sites and examines how narratives of authenticity, identity and revelation are negotiated when the body is performed and disseminated online. What it finds is that body positivity more closely mirrors than challenges a neoliberal paradigm of bodily compliance. It then proposes a way body positivity might be reimagined as a more radical project than its current state.",Bodies in Place: Mediated Identities and Intersections,Popular Communication

2014-0157,2014,Paper Session,Giving License on RuPaul's Drag Race,1,"This paper explores the identificatory functions of music licensing on RuPaul’s Drag Race, a competition-based reality program for drag queens on Logo. As an industrial practice, music licensing requires licensees—the entities to whom the work is licensed—to pay fees to the licensors who own the work. Drag Race amplifies the responsibilities of both the licensor and licensee. Through music licensing, Drag Race makes audible the program’s intersectional negotiations between commercial and subcultural practice. The program uses music licensing to simultaneously enact and problematize normative, exclusionary measures for its host, contestants, and drag culture. Thus the program expands licensing’s basic definition—to give permission—toward queer cross-purposes. I am concerned with music licensing as an industrial and a cultural practice that eliminates contestants while suggesting drag’s subversive potential within queer subcultures. These struggles are made audible through music licensing.",Bodies in Place: Mediated Identities and Intersections,Popular Communication

It attempts to understand, through onsite field studies and online content analysis, how queered understandings of sports are manifest in these sites of LGBT community and consumption through circuitous and polysemous interactions, conversations, and identity formations. This project sets out to see how LGBT consumption and community, as played out in gay sports bars, might complicate reified and essentialized notions of LGBT interaction and identity. It uses queer engagements with the ubiquity of sports to think through how acts of quotidian consumption still speak to collective engagements. This paper looks to gay sports engagements not as spaces where individual identities ask for recognition, but rather as territories where possibilities can arise. Potential knowledge gained can help to alter presumptions regarding the mutually exclusive worlds of heteronormative sports, homonormative bars, and queer culture.",Bodies in Place: Mediated Identities and Intersections,Popular Communication

I argue that it appeals to readers by tapping into a set of deeply classed longings, memories and anxieties. Rather than dismissing this because of its classed character or because of its focus on the everyday details of food consumption, I argue that it must be examined in detail in order to make sense of what it says about this class formation at present. I also argue that Pollan’s program—and its incredible popularity—is structured by ambivalence marked by simultaneous investment in status quo arrangements and longings for a different kind of world. This ambivalence opens up possibilities for progressive change at the same time that it shuts down others.","Two Faces of Digital Capitalism: Class, Charisma, Discourse, and Participation","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Appealing to a widespread desire for authenticity, the narrative, while often inaccurate, gained momentum in the past few years because it provided an image of a capitalist who looked like an alternative to the Wall Street financier. The story of Steve Jobs who supposedly followed his inner convictions, his authentic inner truth, rather than the common wisdom or rational calculation, offers the appealing if ultimately unrealistic hope of a capitalism with integrity, where one's inner life and outer experience need not be in conflict. The Jobs story offers the optimistic vision of a one per-center who actually deserves it, and thereby an enticing invitation to a kind of self-absorption – what amounts to a technology of the self.","Two Faces of Digital Capitalism: Class, Charisma, Discourse, and Participation","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

These class inequalities are rooted in and inextricably linked to neoliberal capitalism. The economic and political system of personal liberty and initiative, fosters what I call the Silicon Valley Ideology of the Internet's entrepreneurial spirit of individuation and atomization. But this “free market fundamentalism”, which grew symbiotically with the rise of the Internet, inherently clashes with social class inequalities. People are left to their own digital devices, if they have them, to participate in online politics. The Internet as a level playing field for exercising citizenship rights is part of the neoliberal framework, but the reality is exacerbation rather than amelioration of political inequalities because of socioeconomic divides.","Two Faces of Digital Capitalism: Class, Charisma, Discourse, and Participation","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

To do this, the paper addresses concerns that the type of trust deployed to negotiate networked media is often inappropriate, resembling that between known individuals rather than a generalised scepticism. This only holds, however, if the experience of networked media is conceived as immersive, and the paper draws on phenomenological perspectives to conclude that the user’s experience of these media remains iterative. As such the improvised, selective and often individualised assessment of trust in networked media can be seen as functional.","Two Faces of Digital Capitalism: Class, Charisma, Discourse, and Participation","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Integrated with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a theoretical model was proposed to investigate teens’ perceptions of online privacy and relevant behaviors on SNSs. Drawing on evidences from a survey (N=127), this research found that perceived risks of information disclosure increase privacy concerns, and directly lead to teens’ coping behaviors to grapple with privacy-related threats by restricting information.

Focusing on regretted self-presentations, in particular, the study finds that normal development processes play an important role in why young people engage in presentations they later regret. The types of presentations that are regretted often are quite ordinary or benign, despite the tragic stories that dominate news media coverage of regretful teens.

For a brief period of time, KVOS and Canawest fostered a unique cross-border relationship between a media outlet and its audience. Canawest closed in 1977 after the Canadian legislature passed Bill C-58 and ended tax deductions for Canadian companies advertising on American stations. This paper analyzes the cross-border design of KVOS and Canawest’s role in producing audiovisual material in this period.",Media Forms as Forms of Conflict: History in the Making,Communication History
2014-0177,2014,Paper Session,"Combatting “Big Media”: The Liberal Roots of the Conservative Critique of the “Liberal Media,” 1969-1974",1,"During the Nixon administration, Republicans, led by Vice President Spiro Agnew, pressed high-profile public critiques of liberal bias in network television news. This paper examines conservative media criticism in this period, with specific attention to a significant irony: conservatives often drew on arguments from liberal media reform traditions to attack a liberal media elite. In making their case against the networks, Agnew and his contemporaries critiqued media concentration and monopoly power, touted the public’s rights in the media system, and cited progressive reformers and legal opinions in support of their points. Drawing on analysis of the Vice President’s speeches, conservative writing on the media, and coverage of the events in the trade press and in National Review, this paper argues that the use of progressive media reform rhetoric aided in the development of a populist conservative media critique that identified liberals with privilege and power and conservatives with the people.",Media Forms as Forms of Conflict: History in the Making,Communication History
2014-0178,2014,Paper Session,"Toward a Theory of Persuasive Hope: Hope Appeals and Hope, Appraisals, and Climate Change Prevention (Top Paper in Health Communication)",1,"Hope has the potential to be a powerful motivator for influencing behavior. However, hope and messages that evoke hope (hope appeals) have rarely been the focus of theoretical development or empirical research. As a step toward enabling the effective use of hope appeals, this study operationalized hope appeals in the context of climate change prevention. The study then empirically tested appraisals purported to evoke hope and the effects of message components designed to evoke hope. Results indicate that future expectation appraisals affect feelings of hope. In addition, all the message components affected feelings of hope. Message components also affected message attention, perceived message effectiveness and behavioral intentions. Subjective feelings of hope affected interest in climate protection and perceived message effectiveness. This study takes an important step toward enabling the effective use of hope appeals in persuasive communication.",Top Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication

Analyses used longitudinal survey data collected in 2005 and 2006 from a nationally representative sample of U.S. males aged 40 to 70 (n=841). Cross-sectionally, non-medical seeking was significantly associated with increased odds of having a PSA test in the past year (Time 1 OR=10.35, 95% CI=4.72-22.69; Time 2 OR=5.75, 95% CI=3.15-10.48). However, lagged analyses showed that, among those who had a PSA at Time 1, active seeking is associated with reduced odds of later having a PSA test (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.93). Participants who had not had a PSA test in the past year very rarely sought information about PSA tests. Information acquisition in an environment of conflicting recommendations may influence adoption of cancer screening behaviors.",Top Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication

Eighty family members of United States SMs who served in Iraq or Afghanistan read a scenario where their SM was displaying PTSD or depression symptoms. Participants described goals they would pursue, barriers they might encounter, and advice they would give others in the situation. Four dilemmas of talking about mental health emerged: (a) getting you to recognize the problem without implying you’re not normal, (b) getting you to seek help without implying you’re weak, (c) being persistent but patient, and (d) wanting you to open up but not being able to understand. These dilemmas reflect military culture as well as beliefs about masculinity, mental health and family communication. Family members reported using four groups of strategies to manage dilemmas. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Top Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication

Guided by a theoretical framework anchored in the regulatory fit theory, a quasi-experiment was conducted to test for the effects of regulatory fit and the presence of primacy effects when two sets of health messages were presented alongside an unhealthy food commercial on television. The health messages were crafted to match either the individuals’ prevention or promotion regulatory orientation, and presented before and after a fast food commercial. Findings revealed significant three-way interaction effects for both prevention- and promotion-fit and provides support for the moderating influence of presentation order on regulatory fit. The study highlights the importance of message congruency and presentation order of health messages on intentions to eat healthily and presents their implications for public health policy and intervention.",Top Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication

It is concerned with the common lack of clean experimental manipulation and proper stimulus control in games research practices. We first discuss how scholars have addressed this issue in the past and then introduce game modifications (“modding”) as a viable alternative. Successful applications of modding in experiments are outlined, and followed by a brief overview of modding tools readily available for research purposes. Modding is a method that provides researchers with the necessary tools for powerful manipulations. At the same time, researchers maintain a thorough control over their stimulus materials, and are able to create proper experimental and control groups. Moreover, it increases studies’ internal validity and replicability without necessarily impairing their ecological validity.",The Tools for a Good (Research) Life: Advances in Game Studies Theory and Method,Game Studies
2014-0183,2014,Paper Session,Object-Relation Mapping: A Method for Analyzing Phenomenal Assemblages of Play,1,"In digital games research, there is a wide acceptance of theories of play assemblages and technological agency. However, current approaches to empirically examining these notions are limited to ethnographies that are resource-intensive and not suitable for many types of inquiries, particularly those focusing on micro-level analyses and phenomenologies of play. In this paper, I propose an analytical method called “object-relation mapping” (ORM). ORM incorporates techniques from Actor-Network Theory, social network analysis, phenomenology, and Grounded Theory to examine assemblages of play at micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. In particular, ORM provides a systematic framework for collecting, deconstructing, restructuring, and coding data gleaned from players’ subjective experience of play.

The solution, however, is not to rid game studies of the concept of the magic circle as many scholars have advocated, as doing so may only perpetuate the common conception of digital play as an immaterial practice. Rather, by engaging with the rich literature on the concept of magic in anthropology and religious studies, I argue that the magic circle can be redeployed as a useful analytic for understanding how digital play is not an ephemeral practice but rather one that is all too materially embedded within the world. I argue that this materialist account does not divest the magic circle of its magical properties but instead may provide a space for a more rigorous conversation about the ethics of the magical practice that we call digital play.",The Tools for a Good (Research) Life: Advances in Game Studies Theory and Method,Game Studies

Often victims are unaware that they have been swindled or the perpetrator has vanished by the time the crime becomes clear. This paper leverages the rich data set provided by a virtual economy within the game Team Fortress Two to examine the social networks of known fraudulent actors.

2014-0186,2014,Paper Session,The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale,3,"Recently, the American Psychiatric Association included Internet Gaming Disorder in the appendix of the 5th edition of the DSM. The main aim of the current study is to test the reliability, dimensionality, and validity of two instruments to measure Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), based on the nine criteria from the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The properties of two types of survey tools (an IGD scale and an IGD index) were tested among a representative sample of 2444 adolescents and adults, aged 13 through 40. Confirmatory factor analyses in SEM indicated that the IGD index generally had better psychometric properties than the IGD scale, indicating that sum-scores of a dichotomous measurement may be more suited than mean scores on a frequency scale. Both types of measurement showed good convergent validity. The prevalence of IGD among 13-40 year olds is approximately 6%, mostly males. Interestingly, the prevalence is slightly higher among young adults than among adolescents, or middle adults.",The Tools for a Good (Research) Life: Advances in Game Studies Theory and Method,Game Studies
2014-0187,2014,Paper Session,Defecting From The Gutenberg Legacy: Employing Images to Test Knowledge Gaps,3,"Knowledge gaps are well-documented across cultures, media platforms, and media content. And although there has been some debate about what constitutes knowledge, there is unwrinkled uniformity across studies in measuring knowledge through words, not images. The question is if the knowledge gap is an artifact of verbal measurement. Would visual knowledge tests threaten the robustness of this theory? In order to investigate this question, an experiment was conducted in which participants watched eight audiovisual news stories and answered verbally and visually prompted questions that tested both their simple recognition of story details and their applied understanding or comprehension of the social issues addressed in the stories. The findings show that when questions are asked through visual means gaps between higher and lower educated groups decreased but remained significant for both measures. These findings underscore the necessity in survey and experimental research to incorporate visual measures into knowledge tests.","Cognitive Processing and News: Knowledge, Opinion, and Emotion",Journalism Studies
2014-0188,2014,Paper Session,Does Storytelling Help Adolescents to Process the News? Comparing Narrative News and Inverted Pyramid,3,"Previous research has shown decreasing interest and low comprehension of traditional news formats, particularly in young audiences. Searching for more compelling alternatives, storytelling is hoped to improve recipients’ understanding and memorization of news. This paper aims to empirically test such effects of narrative news. In an experimental study with 706 adolescents aged 12 to 17, we compared traditional and narrative written news in terms of comprehension and retention as well as involvement during reception. Our findings suggest that narrative news do not enhance or ease information processing in general, but only for adolescents who are lacking issue knowledge. We attribute this result to the structure of narrative news which requires less background knowledge for constructing a coherent mental model. Additionally, narrative news elicited a more intense affective involvement, which may have a negative effect on information processing. Implications of our findings for further research and practice in journalism are discussed.","Cognitive Processing and News: Knowledge, Opinion, and Emotion",Journalism Studies
2014-0189,2014,Paper Session,"Moody News: The Impact of Collective Emotion Ratings on Online News Readers’ Attitudes, Memory, and Behavioral Intentions",2,"Indicators of collective user behavior and opinion are increasingly common features of online news stories and may include information on how the story made users feel. An experiment (n = 298) examined the effects of the presence and valence of a “mood meter” posted alongside an online human-interest news story on memory for story content, attitude toward the story, emotional response to and intentions to share the story. The results show that the presence of a mood meter, regardless of valence, led to lower recall of story content, more negative attitudes toward the story, and less-positive emotional response. Participants who assessed their own emotions before evaluating the story had more negative responses to the story than those who evaluated the story before recording their emotions. The results suggest that mood meters may attenuate the positive responses to stories that news sites are seeking to promote by their implementation.","Cognitive Processing and News: Knowledge, Opinion, and Emotion",Journalism Studies

In this sense, we integrated news diffusion on the Internet and online public opinion process. Specifically, we selected one recent Korean example showing how a judge’s private tweet on government’s trial of Social Network Services (SNS) regulation emerges as controversial social issue, how mass media, governmental institutions, and civic advocacies interact around the issue, and what frame competes on online public discourse. By analyzing citation networks between online news/opinions, we examined news diffusion process and how the process is related with frame-by-frame interaction and their structural features, such as homophily and/or heterophily. Our study revealed three important findings: (1) homophily effect of ‘frame’ on citation patterns, (2) fragmented news clusters colored with the same frame, and (3) small-scale cross-cutting deliberation (i.e., heterophilous interactions). Implications for news consumption and the Internet’s democratic potentials are also discussed.","Cognitive Processing and News: Knowledge, Opinion, and Emotion",Journalism Studies

Series of moderation, mediation and integrated moderated mediation analytic models are applied. Results show the relationship between incidental news exposure and political participation is stronger among non-partisans than partisans. The relationship with civic engagement was stronger among low knowledge group than high knowledge group. Also, results show heterogeneous political discussion mediates relationship between incidental news exposure and participation. Finally, the combined conditional mediation analysis finds that the mediation of heterogeneous discussion is likely to occur under the high partisanship and high knowledge condition. Overall, findings imply that unintended encounter with news is beneficial to both the politically engaged and the less engaged citizens, but in a different way.","Cognitive Processing and News: Knowledge, Opinion, and Emotion",Journalism Studies

Taking Weick’s recommendation to task, this project applies an Action-Implicative Discourse Analytic (AIDA) lens to examine teleconference calls between Louisiana local and state officials and federal officials as Hurricane Katrina approached Louisiana. AIDA highlights the linkages between communication dilemmas, communication practices, and situated ideals. We focus on “reporting” as a metacommunicative practice that embodied several communication dilemmas with respect to effective disaster management. Through our analysis, we explicate how “reporting” functioned to shape and constrain the formulation of problems and responses to problems during the Hurricane Katrina teleconferences: “reporting” created a structure that facilitated the orderly, one-way conveying of information while inhibiting the identification of and ‘talking through’ of confusion points and the communicative sharing of local resources.",As Good as Gold: Top 4 Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2014-0193,2014,Paper Session,Organizational Citizenship Behaviors as a Framing Conundrum,2,"Organizational members attempt to shape others’ impressions of them. At times, that undertaking presents inherent difficulties, as with needing to present oneself as going above and beyond (i.e., organizational citizenship behaviors). Presenting that impression is challenging because overt attempts at shaping meanings (i.e., framing) can invite negative attributions like boasting, bragging, and brown-nosing; simultaneously however, overt framing is a primary means of managing impressions. Constant comparative analysis of interviews with working adults (N = 24) revealed that organizational citizenship behaviors constitute a framing conundrum for organizational members such that they work communicatively—within a highly-constrained context—to avoid their coworkers’ negative attributions. Specifically, organizational members avoid being seen as taking actions for (a) personal gain and through (b) ostentatious means. Organizational members do so by framing their actions redressively as (a) motivated by the collective and customers and as (b) performed smartly and silently.",As Good as Gold: Top 4 Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2014-0194,2014,Paper Session,The Structures of Interorganizational Communication Networks,5,"Communication networks are more nuanced than linear transmissions of messages between actors. Rather, they are multiplex, multidimensional, and should be classified based on differences in relations, not nodes. Following this logic, we advocate a recently proposed taxonomy of communication networks based on (1) communication flow, (2) affinity ties, (3) representational endorsements, and (4) semantic interpretations. Despite the existence of this taxonomy, with the exception of selective comparison of case studies, little is known about how endogenous structural mechanisms and multiplexity affect networks ties across each relation type amongst interorganizational networks. With a sample of 50 nonprofit organizations, we used binary and valued exponential random graph modeling to examine the structures of each of the four communication networks and the relationships among them. Our findings suggested that (1) affinity ties were only influenced by reciprocity, (2) representational ties were surprisingly local, defined by reciprocity and clustering, (3) semantic ties mirrored characteristics of small world networks in terms of closure, short path lengths, and high clustering coefficients, and (4) flow was mostly influenced by preferential attachment and represented a scale-free network. Finally, mutiplexity effects were only evident for flow, which was related to all three networks, especially affinity and representational ties. The results suggest node carrying capacity, diffusion, and physical proximity significantly influenced the structures of interorganizational communication networks. Implications for the taxonomy of communication networks were also drawn from the results.",As Good as Gold: Top 4 Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

Specifically, the project assumes that employee emotional experience in the workplace would influence their communication motives to their supervisors. Emotional experience involves employees’ received emotional support from the supervisor, engaged emotion work, and emotional valence. These experiences, in turn, lead to employees’ diverse motives (enjoyment, affection, inclusion, escape, and control) for communicating with the supervisor. With the participants of N = 608, the study finds that employees’ received emotional support from the supervisor positively predicts their communication motives of enjoyment, inclusion, and inclusion. Employees’ emotional valence positively predicts enjoyment and affection motive. Finally, employees’ emotion work positively predicts affection motive to their supervisor.

This study attempts to identify how social media, particularly Facebook, play a role in subcultural identity. A survey and interview of fans of indie folk demonstrate that Facebook plays an important role. Each dimension of subcultural identity (cognitive, evaluative, affective, and behavioral) is significantly related to both emotional affiliations with Facebook community and music-related Facebook use. Facebook usage in general, such as number of times logging into Facebook, amount of time spent on Facebook, and routine Facebook usage, is not correlated with music subcultural identity. In response to interview questions, participants indicate that Facebook allows them to post and share various types of media, to create and share events, and to interact with members through fan, band, and group pages. These help establish their identification with the music subculture.

The present study undertakes this task. A 2 (time for profile composition: limited vs. unlimited) x 2 (anticipation of future interaction: face-to-face vs. email) experiment shows that daters who had unlimited time lied less than those who had limited time. Daters who had limited time and expected email interaction produced the most and most serious lies. While daters who had unlimited time were generally honest, those who had limited time produced more tailored deceptions, with women lying about their physical appearance more than men, and men lying about their relationship goals more than women.

The present study expands on a growing body of research through a qualitative analysis of Facebook users by first addressing questions of users' audience conceptualizations on the site and then considering the relationship between such conceptualizations and privacy attitudes and behaviors. Findings suggest an increasingly complex relationship between audience and privacy management that is fueled by collapsing contexts as users’ networks become increasingly diverse. Consequently, users may choose from a variety of strategies to regulate privacy boundaries and, in some cases, regain some of the structure lost as communication moves to more public, online spaces. However, even with a wide range of privacy tools available, most participants in this sample still engaged in some degree of self-censorship on the site.",Privacy Management of Social Media Users,Communication and Technology

Yet, only a few studies have documented teens’ privacy-protecting behaviors on SNS. Using data of Facebook teen users and their parents in the U.S. from the Pew Internet’s Teens & Privacy Management Survey (N = 622), this study investigated the socialization agents of teens’ level of online privacy concern, and the relationship between teens’ level of online privacy concern and their privacy-protecting behaviors on SNS. Based on path analysis results, this study identified parents and SNS as the two significant socialization agents. In particular, this study revealed the role of parents’ privacy concern and the role of SNS use in motivating teens to increase online privacy concern, which, in turn, drives teens to adopt various privacy-setting strategies on SNS and to set their Facebook profiles to private.

2014-0203,2014,Paper Session,Predicting Users’ Privacy Boundary Management Strategies on Facebook,4,"This study examines how users regulate their interpersonal boundaries on Facebook. Drawing from Communication Privacy Management theory (CPM), we propose that Facebook users maintain personal privacy by adopting two sets of boundary management strategies—privacy setting control and self-disclosure control. The influence of social media usage and individual differences on such a boundary management process is also explored. A survey of 224 college students in a large public Asian university was conducted. Results show that different uses of social media (e.g., social interaction, social browsing, and entertainment) predicted different boundary management strategies. Personalities (e.g., big-five) and privacy-related psychological factors (e.g., privacy literacy and concern about privacy) also showed significant influences. We concluded that the privacy setting options offered by the social networking sites were only useful insofar to provide users with a base point and a psychological sense of security, and had little influence in Facebook users’ actual self-disclosure behavior on Facebook; users were more likely to rely on frequent changes of privacy settings and controlling level of self-disclosure to maintain a privacy boundary.",Privacy Management of Social Media Users,Communication and Technology

An experiment was conducted to investigate the independent contributions of the two types of bandwagon behaviors to audiences’ selections of Hollywood movies in an online setting and the factors influencing the bandwagon effects. The results showed that the qualitative bandwagon effect was, on average, greater than the quantitative bandwagon effect. Furthermore, an increase in audiences’ familiarity with Hollywood movies led to an increase in the qualitative bandwagon effect and a decrease in the quantitative bandwagon effect; an increase in audiences’ motivation for social interaction resulted in a decrease in the qualitative bandwagon effect and an increase in the quantitative bandwagon effect. In the current study, the cognitive load did not show any significant impact on the qualitative or quantitative bandwagon effects.","Media Entertainment: Selective Exposure, Consumption, and Effects",Mass Communication

Effects of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Need Satisfaction on Media Enjoyment,3,"In times of ubiquitous online access to media content and social interactions, external forces, such as social pressure to use media, have become an important driver of media exposure. Yet, while intrinsic motivation has received broad attention in recent entertainment research, the role of extrinsic motivation in media enjoyment remains unknown. Based on an online-survey (N=230), the present study tested the effects of intrinsic need satisfaction and perceived social pressure on the enjoyment of Facebook use with structural equation modeling. The results reveal paradoxical effects of extrinsic motivation: While social pressure negatively affected enjoyment through thwarted autonomy need satisfaction, it was positively related to competence and relatedness need satisfaction.

This study examines audience selection of entertainment media, in particular television program genres streamed in the online environment. By drawing from social cognitive theory, it is the aim of this study to investigate whether acts of emotional self-regulation can provide an explanation for selective exposure to media entertainment. In an experimental setting, mood management theory and social cognitive theory are pitted against each other in determining content preference under the influence of sad moods. Putting all subjects in a sad mood, and manipulating habit strengths for comedic and dramatic content, it is predicted that subjects whose emotional self-regulation is depleted will select more habitual entertainment video options than non-depleted subjects.","Media Entertainment: Selective Exposure, Consumption, and Effects",Mass Communication

However, experimental research and research examining the psychological process underlying such effects has been lacking. Adopting a social comparison theory perspective, this research investigates how exposure to romantically-themed programming influences relational beliefs and both relational and partner satisfaction compared to exposure to other genres. 120 couples were exposed to either 45 minutes of romantic comedy, suspense movies, or stand-up comedy. Existing levels of relational beliefs and satisfaction were assessed at least 3 days before media exposure as well as after stimulus viewing. Results indicate no direct effect of genre consumption on the relational outcomes of interest. Rather, those initially less satisfied with their relationships evidenced a small vulnerability to romantic comedies. Also, viewers of romantic comedy who engaged in social comparison were more likely to engage in fantasy rumination and experience decreased relational and partner satisfaction, which was mediated by the emotions of hope and envy. Implications of these results for social comparison theory and the study of media influence on relational expectations and satisfaction is discussed.","Media Entertainment: Selective Exposure, Consumption, and Effects",Mass Communication

In-depth investigations of three sets of panel data from 2000 to 2008 suggest that there is a positive feedback loop between news exposure and political discussion. The results further revealed that political discussion and media exposure are functionally in competition; thus, discussion compensates for the low level of news exposure while simultaneously mediating and moderating the effect of news exposure in predicting knowledge (but not for participation).

2014-0210,2014,Paper Session,News Coverage of Sexual Assault and Rape in the U.S. Military: From Tailhook to the Invisible War,3,"Despite increased media attention to the issue of rape in the U.S. Military, this type of media content is relatively unexplored by scholars. For this study, over two decades of newspaper coverage of rape in the military (N = 1,955) was analyzed by two coders for the presence and location of critical sexual assault-related terms. Findings suggest a dramatic increase in newspaper coverage about this issue after the release of the 2012 documentary, The Invisible War, and that critical sexual assault terms were more frequent toward the end of articles, and more significantly so within news originating from publications close to military bases. Agenda-setting and muted-group are intertwined and expanded upon to provide further insight into these data and offer fertile ground for future research.",Media Use and Political Debate,Mass Communication
2014-0211,2014,Paper Session,The Effects of Emotional and Rational News Appeals on Political Attitudes,2,"The present study investigates how emotional and rational appeals in political news media stories interact with preexisting attitudes in changing citizens’ political attitudes. It is hypothesized that news media appeals that match predispositions are more likely to affect attitudes than mismatching media appeals. That is, people holding attitudes primarily based on affect should be more susceptible to emotionally arousing media content than to rational appeals. For people holding attitudes primarily based on cognition rational appeals in news media are expected to be more persuasive than emotional appeals. These assumptions were tested in a real-world setting in the run-up of a popular vote on immigration. In order to test the hypotheses the data of a three-wave panel survey were matched with data from a content analysis of the news coverage on the issue. Results indicate the expected matching effects: Voters whose attitudes are primarily based on affect were more likely to change their attitude when confronted with emotional appeals as compared to rational appeals. In contrast, voters holding cognitively based attitudes were more likely to change their attitude when they received rational appeals as compared to emotional appeals. These findings clearly document that the configuration of preexisting attitudes moderates voters’ susceptibility to emotional and rational news media content.",Media Use and Political Debate,Mass Communication
2014-0212,2014,Paper Session,The Effects of Repetitive News Framing on Political Opinions Over Time,4,"Everyday news media use is characterised by news frame repetition. However, virtually no study has tested how repeated exposure to the same news frame influences individual political opinions over time. In a survey experiment (N=296), we repeatedly exposed participants to the same generic news frame (at the start of the study, after 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks) and measured effects on political opinions (at the start, after 2 weeks, after 6 weeks). Participants in a control group were only exposed to one news frame at the beginning of the experiment, and the framing effect was equally traced over time. Our results show that repetitive news frame exposure leads to both stronger and more persistent framing effects than single exposure. This effect is most evident for individuals with moderate levels of political knowledge. Our study contributes to a more realistic conceptualization of news frame exposure in mass communication experiments.",Media Use and Political Debate,Mass Communication

The results revealed that priming effect occurs through accessibility and framing effect occurs through applicability of certain beliefs. Based on the expectancy-value model, this study confirmed that news frame altered belief importance of a certain consideration in the overall evaluation compared with that priming effect occurred by altering belief accessibility. The proposed mechanism was also tested in the domain of attribution of responsibility. The results further confirmed the proposed mechanism by suggesting that the mechanism of belief importance alteration was also applicable to the framing effect on attributions of responsibility.",Media Use and Political Debate,Mass Communication
2014-0214,2014,Paper Session,Diversity of European Information Cultures as Explanation for Varying Efficacy of ICT Policies,1,"Information is a key concept of modern society and is considered to be the source for wealth and success in the so-called information society (Beninger 1986; Castells 2011). Despite the common conviction of governments that ICTs strengthen the national performance in general, the patterns of diffusion and usage of ICTs differ quite considerably within the countries of the European Union, and between EU countries and other Western countries, like the United States or Canada.
Based upon a comparative analysis of ePolicies among selected European Union member states, this paper introduces the concept of information cultures as analytical framework. Based upon this framework, the empirical model for the identification of information cultures based upon a cluster analysis comprising available data according to three relevant dimensions (religious and ethical values, duration of democratic experience, and the legal system). The resulting seven clusters of European countries built the basis for a consequent comparative policy analysis among selected countries. The policy analysis embraced national eStrategies as well as concrete actions. The research questions focussed on assumed differences between strategies and actions and on the testing if the information cultures framwork can provide additional explanations for differences between countries/clusters.",Regulatory Models and Cultures in New and Convergent Media,Communication Law & Policy
2014-0215,2014,Paper Session,"Corporate Governance of China’s Media: History, Logic, and Framework",1,"Presently media reform has entered the stage of systematic reform characterized by “rebuilding market subjects and constructing the modern enterprise system” in China. Corporate governance, as a keyword in media policy and an important part of modern enterprise system, has become an important topic in the study of China’s media economics and China’s media system. This paper, by displaying the evolution of corporate governance of China’s media from administrative governance framework to economic governance framework in a changing political and economic environment, points out that the transformation of corporate governance logic from “state-monism” to “state-market”, despite its progress, still shows weakness in establishing effective corporate governance. Then, this paper proposes that incorporating “society” into corporate governance framework of media, and building a multi-governance logic framework of “state-market-society” will be the focus of the transformation of corporate governance of China’s media.",Regulatory Models and Cultures in New and Convergent Media,Communication Law & Policy
2014-0216,2014,Paper Session,Three Network Convergence and OTT TV Development in China:,2,"In the past decade, China has adopted a communications policy called ‘Three Network Convergence’, which strives to integrate telecommunications, broadcasting and internet networks by 2015. This paper first evaluates the implementation of such communications policy in China, before examining the development of OTT TV, a new converged media service, in the country. It then considers OTT TV development in the context of the Three Network Convergence policy. Finally, this paper discusses Matland’s theory of policy implementation. It argues that that the Three Network Convergence policy has changed from ‘symbolic’ implementation to ‘political’ implementation at the national level and ‘administrative’ implementation at the local level, as exemplified by the development of OTTV in recent years. The paper demonstrates how the implementation pattern of communications policy changes at both the national and local level as China strives to regulate new media technologies and services in an age of technological convergence.",Regulatory Models and Cultures in New and Convergent Media,Communication Law & Policy

The Flemish ‘Signal Integrity’ Case,2,"Taking (debates in the run up to) the ‘Signal Integrity’ legislation (July 2013) in Flanders as a case, this contribution analyses the impact of convergence on various players in the media ecosystem, focusing on struggles between broadcasters and operators. It further examines if national policy-makers/regulators have (residual) powers to act, given economic globalisation and, for EU members, legislative Europeanisation. Through an Advocacy Coalition Framework, the paper identifies and analyses the ‘broadcasters are the owner of their signal’ coalition (arguing for adoption of legislation to fight the undermining of broadcasters’ business model and content autonomy) versus the ‘this is not about ownership, but about technological innovation’ coalition, claiming legal interference hampers innovation. While the adoption of the legal proposal by Flemish parliament indicates nation-states have the power to develop their own media policy and legislation, the paper modifies this.",Regulatory Models and Cultures in New and Convergent Media,Communication Law & Policy
2014-0218,2014,Paper Session,Paranoid Politics: Visual Communication in Right-Wing Populist Political Poster Advertising,2,"Right-wing populist parties are oftentimes accused of relying on the negative stereotypic depiction of foreigners. However, these stereotypes are hardly ever addressed in research. This paper aims at identifying the visual construction of right-wing populist parties’ discourse as embodied in their political poster ads. A semiotic analysis allows for the identification of empty signifiers as aspects of visual representation that strongly change with the varying context. The analysis illustrates how rhetoric tropes contribute to the visual representation of abstract notions (e.g. nation or citizenship), and reveals common traits across the posters, such as the iterative presence of a paranoid narrative that involves a changing “other” threatening an idealised “self”. This paper thus contributes to a further understanding of the European right-wing populist discourse and assists in explaining the politics of fear and the application of negative stereotypes in their advertising strategies.","Visual Politics: Posters, Cartoons, and Political Depictions in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies

We used a mixed-methods approach of combining quantitative content analysis with qualitative semiological analysis to examine frames, topics, main characters, and structural features of cartoons posted to this site as well as audience reactions to the cartoons. More importantly, we analyzed how content and structural features of the cartoons were associated with audience reactions to the cartoons to identify characteristics of cartoons that generated most reactions. While the oppression frame appeared most frequently, the international influence frame received most reactions from Facebook users. In terms of topic, a majority of cartoons focused on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his forces, and social media users reacted most actively to the cartoons that emphasized martyrdom and international intervention. These and other findings are discussed in the context of political cartoons and visual persuasion in the social media age.","Visual Politics: Posters, Cartoons, and Political Depictions in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies

This study examines the subjective audience evaluations based on visual portrayals of a politician by employing Q methodology, a qualitative-quantitative approach of audience research. Q-sorts of 33 different pictures showing a European politician, along with personal interviews, were used to probe the audience’s perception of a favorable or unfavorable picture. Q factor analysis yielded four groups of participants. The audience groups differ regarding their expectation toward favorably depicted political behavior and the involved balance of professional political leadership competences, social competences, and personality. Additionally, technical and formal representation strategies were identified as important visual cues, but not for all audience groups.","Visual Politics: Posters, Cartoons, and Political Depictions in Visual Communication",Visual Communication Studies

The study argued that different face concerns (positive, negative, collective) determine whether Chinese students remain “reticent” or choose to actively participate in classroom communication. The majority of results were found in the collective face condition. Collective face concern is a new concept which is examined in this study. This is the Chinese international students’ belief that their own image and performance are associated with the image of their country and the entire CIS population. Correlations between perceived CIS’ feelings of alienation, perceived CIS’ reticence, and typicality of CIS were also found.

2014-0224,2014,Paper Session,“You’d Better Go to School Today LOL!” Utilizing YPAR to Rethink the Communication Theory of Identity in the Era of Social Network Sites,2,"This article aims to contribute to conversations within intercultural communication research about theories of identity and about the role of emergent digital platforms within those theories. Utilizing Youth Participatory Action Research as a method, the article explores the question: how might we theorize the ways that young people negotiate identity practices in relation to the various communities of affiliation of which they are a part, particularly when social network sites make it possible for those differing communities and their values to interact and collide with one another in virtual spaces? And secondarily, how might the young people engaged in the research utilize the process of research to participate in their own empowerment for the solving of intercultural communication challenges that they face? The article considers the ways that young people who are recent immigrants negotiate online what Urban and Orbe (2010) described as identity gaps that members of immigrant communities experience when they are confronted with a discrepancy between their own self-perception and the perceptions of others that are rooted in assumptions of home country, nationality, ethnicity, gender, familial role, or something else. An analysis of several such online instances highlights the ways that digital platforms afford new opportunities for both constraint and agency, particularly with reference to what we term digitally enacted identity. The article thus suggests the importance of incorporating a more fulsome understanding of digital practices into theories of intercultural communication and of including the lived experiences of persons experiencing intercultural communication dilemmas in that theorization.

Investigating how scholarly discussion on the growing success of K-pop has focused on cultural hybridity, this article maintains that SNSD’s debut clarifies how K-pop’s hybridity does not mean dialectical interactions between American form and Korean content; rather, the phenomenon is best interpreted as a Korean version of American pop, or American pop performed by a Korean girl group. As a result, this article argues that, rather than cultural hybridity, cultural hegemony as a constitutive result of sociopolitical and economic arrangements provides a better heuristic tool to investigate the nature of K-pop’s current global popularity. In this respect, SNSD should be understood as a new inventory in the global hegemony of American pop, which originated from Korea’s position as a subempire of the US’s model of neoliberal capitalism. Consequently, this article concludes that K-pop has been a cultural surrogate of a neoliberal hegemony and hyper commercialism, and Korean society has become exponentially Americanized since the 1997 IMF crises.","Sounds Global: Music, Politics, and Discourse",Popular Communication
2014-0226,2014,Paper Session,“Sor Bir Bana”: Hip Hop and Sociocultural Institutions in Germany (Top Student Paper in Popular Communication),2,"In the age of accelerating globalization, hip hop has emerged as one of the most symbolically contested and productive sites for the constitution and interpretation of a supposed ‘global youth culture’. Hip hop culture demonstrates the transnational value of the genre for youth expression as well as its pedagogical value for the state; the German case, in particular, shows how intimately these two purposes may be intertwined. This paper examines hip hop produced by non-ethnic Germans and immigrants in Germany for its expressive qualities, oppositional character, and cooperative role within the cultural policies of the German state. Even as hip hop offers emancipatory possibilities, it simultaneously risks essentializing experiences of alterity, forcing them into narratives built on violence and deprivation. Our textual and discourse analysis of lyrics, interviews, films, music videos, and news media explores the contentious, cooperative, and co-opting relationship between hip hop and the state.","Sounds Global: Music, Politics, and Discourse",Popular Communication
2014-0227,2014,Paper Session,Against All Odds: Making Underground Music in Iran,1,"This research focuses on Iranian underground music (musighi-e zir zamini) and its place in the social, cultural and political fabric of the country. The author examines the significance of Iranian underground music landscape as a new social space, largely driven by young Iranians, as a form of resistance to the political, social and cultural hegemony of the Iranian regime. The author discusses elements--local and global--that have influenced the growth of Iranian underground music in recent decades: elements such as the de-westernization policies of the post-revolutionary regime in Iran; the impact of new information technologies, especially the Internet, on the production and distribution of music; and the impact of the political reform movement of the 1990s on this particular music ""scene"" (Straw, 1991) in Iran. This overview of Iranian youth’s engagement with underground music draws on three semi-structured in-depth interviews during 2010. Above all, the author relies on their experiences of working as underground musicians in a country that is governed by a regime that heavily censors its cultural sector. Guided by these interviews, as well as literatures on postmodern and phenomenological approaches to understand cultural practices, the author argues that underground music in Iran cannot be reduced to a tool for political resistance. At the same time, it cannot be completely dismissed as just a cultural practice, devoid of any form of politics.","Sounds Global: Music, Politics, and Discourse",Popular Communication
2014-0228,2014,Paper Session,From Musical Expressivity to Public Political Discourse Proper: The Case of Karpe Diem in the Aftermath of the Utøya-Massacre,1,"Musical communication is widely understood to be too elusive and abstract to have any real significance for political public discourse. However, in the aftermath of the Utøya-massacre there have been several instances where hip hop music and performances have become subjected to politicised debate in the Norwegian public sphere. Based on a qualitative case study of the media reception of the Norwegian hip hop group Karpe Diem, this study finds that their music both provoked and fed into extensive public debates about topical cultural and political issues. Moreover, this study outlines the process through which Karpe Diem and their music came to be publicly identified and responded to as politically significant. Based on the evidence of the findings, this article further argue that hip hop music fills a peripheral yet significant function in the model of the political system outlined by Habermas (2006).","Sounds Global: Music, Politics, and Discourse",Popular Communication

However, this type of organization has almost received no attention in the crisis communication literature or the broader field of PR research. For this ongoing project the authors developed an integrative model of organizational crisis communication to analyze institutional, technical-instrumental and symbolic-relational dimensions of crisis communication of CYWA in all its stages. By applying qualitative guided interviews with CYWA employees and quantitative content analysis of crisis reporting on CYWA this theory-driven project is expected to contribute to a better understanding of crisis management practices and outcomes in the government sector of social welfare services. The framework applied will also serve as a basis to identify important indicators for how public relations in crisis contexts may support or hinder the attainment of well-being for both CYWA employees and their external stakeholders.",Crisis Communication Effects on Stakeholders,Public Relations
2014-0231,2014,Paper Session,The Impact of Spokespersons’ Nonverbal Crisis Communication on the Public’s Perception of Organizational Competence,2,"Organizational crises cause uncertainty amongst stakeholders. Therefore, organizations in crisis must communicate their ability to resolve the problem and ensure the public’s well-being. To this end, we examine the impact of powerful nonverbal communication by organizational spokespersons during different crisis stages. Study one investigates how vocal nonverbal cues express power during crises and how this affects perceptions of spokespersons. The results illustrate that a spokesperson that speaks with a lowered voice pitch, which reflects powerfulness, appears more competent than one with a raised voice pitch. Study two examines the moderating influence of crisis stage on the impact of visual nonverbal cues. During a crisis, powerful nonverbal behaviors (e.g., expressive body movements) minimize reputational damage through an increase in perceived competence of the spokesperson. In the aftermath of a crisis, however, powerless nonverbal behaviors positively affect the organizational reputation through an intermediate effect on perceived sincerity of the spokesperson.",Crisis Communication Effects on Stakeholders,Public Relations

Participants were asked to imaging that their personal information had been stolen from an online retailer’s website and the retailer was apologizing to them for the situation. Results indicated that an expression of remorse, an acknowledgement of responsibility, a promise of forbearance, and an offer of reparations each contributed to stakeholders’ perceptions that the organization had apologized. However, the expression of remorse and acknowledgement of responsibility had larger effects on this perception than the other elements. Furthermore, the promise of forbearance and the offer of reparations made stakeholders more likely to forgive the organization. Forgiveness was defined as intending to continue doing business with the retailer and not intending to criticize the retailer to others. The expression of remorse and acknowledgement of responsibility did not have a significant effect on forgiveness.",Crisis Communication Effects on Stakeholders,Public Relations

The results reveal the two variables wield significant interaction effects on consumer response to a post-crisis cause. The findings suggest that while the consistency of a post-crisis cause with a pre-crisis cause is more effective on perceived corporate credibility and attitudes toward the corporation when the pre-crisis cause is not congruent with the crisis issue, the inconsistency between the two causes before and after the crisis leads to a rather positive consumer response when the pre-crisis cause is congruent with the crisis issue.",Crisis Communication Effects on Stakeholders,Public Relations
2014-0234,2014,Paper Session,Early Exposure to Pornography: Indirect and Direct Effects on Sexual Satisfaction in Adulthood,1,"Early pornography viewing’s effects on sexual satisfaction in adulthood were explored in a nationally representative survey of American adults aged 21-89 (N=1,572). Path analysis revealed that early, frequent viewing had an unexpected, positive direct effect on later sexual satisfaction (b=.06). Early viewing also indirectly affected sexual satisfaction, as mediated by sexual experience, compulsive adult use, sexual script overlap and intimacy. The positive indirect effects of early viewing on increased sexual experience (b=.025) are tempered by the negative indirect effects of early viewing on increased great sex/porn script overlap, which negatively affects intimacy (b=-.029). The exogenous variables sexual abuse, attachment, erotophilia and rigid gender role beliefs were included to explain why some children view more pornography than others. Sexual abuse history moderated early viewing of pornography’s effects (r=.16), while erotophilia directly increased early viewing (r=.33) and rigid gender role beliefs (r=-.14) and secure attachment (r=-.04) directly decreased early viewing.",Developing Views and Behaviors Regarding Sex and Romance,Children Adolescents and Media

Results from a survey among 1,975 Dutch adolescents (aged 13-17) showed that exposure to online sexy self-presentation of others was associated with sexual objectification of women, instrumental attitudes towards sex, sexual experience, adolescents’ own online sexy self-presentation, and positive prototypes of and willingness to engage in casual sex. Boys showed stronger associations between exposure to online sexy self-presentation of others and sexual objectification of women and willingness to engage in casual sex.

2014-0236,2014,Paper Session,Investigating Adolescents’ Sexual Uncertainty: Looking at the Interplay of Sexual Media Use and Individual Dispositions,3,"Previous research has suggested that a lack of congruency between sexually explicit internet material (SEIM) and adolescents’ sexual dispositions may result in sexual uncertainty. However, it is unclear whether, next to SEIM, also mainstream sexual content, such as reality TV, is related to sexual uncertainty. Moreover, while research suggests that the relation between the use of sexual media content and sexual uncertainty may be stronger for girls, we know little about whether within-gender differences in sexual dispositions (i.e., impersonal sex orientation and hypergendered orientation) may further boost this relation. Using data from a representative survey among 2,137 Dutch adolescents (aged 13-17), we found that for girls, the relation between sexual media use (both SEIM and reality TV) and sexual uncertainty depended on within-gender differences in sexual dispositions. Our findings call for more attention to mainstream sexual media content and within-gender differences when studying sexual uncertainty.",Developing Views and Behaviors Regarding Sex and Romance,Children Adolescents and Media

Music video exposure affected sexual behavior in boys, while, the reverse effect, was found among girls. Second, relationships between boys’ and girls’ sexual behavior and music video exposure were mediated by perceptions of the sexual behavior of male peers. In addition, sexually active boys and girls were demonstrated to believe that many of their male and female peers were also sexually active; however, among boys, the perception of the sexual activities of same-gender peers subsequently predicted their music video exposure, whereas among girls, the perceptions of the sexual activities of male peers resulted in decreased exposure to sexualized music videos.",Developing Views and Behaviors Regarding Sex and Romance,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0238,2014,Paper Session,Sex in College Relationships: The Role Television Plays in Emerging Adults' Expectations in Relationships,2,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether emerging adults may be using relationship television to form their expectations for sex in romantic relationships. Since emerging adulthood is a unique period of development providing opportunities to experiment with adult identities (Arnett, 2000), and since relationship television contains multiple consistent messages about gender roles in sexual relationships (Kim et al., 2007; Ward, 1995), we questioned whether television may contribute to emerging adults’ sex expectations in their current or most recent relationship. Our findings indicate relationship television viewing is associated with higher sex expectations for women. Men’s sex expectations were moderated by their perceived realism of the relationships they watch on television. Men who watched more relationship television, and perceived that television to be realistic, reported higher sex expectations, but those who perceived relationship television to be unrealistic reported lower sex expectations. We discuss the implications and limitations of our findings.",Developing Views and Behaviors Regarding Sex and Romance,Children Adolescents and Media

Inasmuch as generating a consensus about music’s value and quality has been challenging and contentious, the various methods, criteria, and standards related to music’s qualitative value have been under-explored, if not ignored, in the context of the cultural studies discipline. With this in mind, this paper offers an exploratory study of the digital evaluation game called “Hit or Not.” Hit or Not is an interactive music game application on Spotify, where the listeners judge whether a song being played is a hit or not. During the game, the evaluators receive points and badges if their predictions are close to game players’ collective tastes in music. Through an analysis of data based on the game and interviews with the game players, this paper explores three emerging themes: 1) understanding Hit or Not as a new type of market research and music promotion; 2) assessing how gamification intersects with evaluation and its shortcomings; and 3) exploring what evaluators individually learn as personal tastes both stand out and merge with the collective tastes richly embedded in a historical, cultural, and social context. Taken as a whole, this paper analyzes the emerging evaluation methods, as well as Hit or Not’s underlying motives, implications, benefits, and shortcomings as an extension of the digital economy and the evaluation culture.",Train Your Brain: The Effectiveness of Goal-Oriented Serious Games,Game Studies

In this follow up study we explore whether traditional methods and game training differ in terms of the cognitive processes that both are able to impact. We incorporated standardized measures of working memory and visuo-motor skills. Additionally gains in arithmetical performance, and self-reported measures of enjoyment were investigated.

2014-0242,2014,Paper Session,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Serious Digital Games for Healthy Lifestyle Promotion,9,"Healthy lifestyle adoption, important for a person’s quality-of-life, is often hindered by factors which can be overcome by computer-delivered interventions such as serious games. Several systematic reviews showed health-promoting effects of serious games but none so far have conducted a meta-analysis. This paper presents a meta-analysis of 30 serious game studies for healthy lifestyle promotion published between 2007-2012. Findings show positive effects on healthy lifestyles and their behavioral determinants, especially for knowledge. Long-term effects are maintained for knowledge, but not for behavior or skills. Although stand-alone and multi-component games can both be effective, different mechanisms are needed for their effectiveness. Stand-alone games require a theoretical foundation in game-based learning and are more effective when tailored to the player’s socio-demographic information. Multi-component programs are more effective when non-tailored and based on other theories than game or behavioral prediction theories. This will be further explored in a larger sample of studies.",Train Your Brain: The Effectiveness of Goal-Oriented Serious Games,Game Studies

Persuasive games can communicate complex relationships through designed problem-solving experiences. However, the interactive narrative structure of digital games demands high cognitive efforts from the players to process the information and understand the underlying messages. A lab experiment was conducted. Results showed that only players with higher gaming expertise benefitted from higher working memory capacity by increasing attention to game. However, the heightened attention from players with higher gaming expertise did not predict better comprehension of the persuasive message. Instead, higher working memory capacity and attention from players with lower gaming expertise predicted comprehension of the persuasive message.",Train Your Brain: The Effectiveness of Goal-Oriented Serious Games,Game Studies
2014-0244,2014,Paper Session,"@todayin1963: Commemorative Journalism, Digital Collective Remembering, and the March on Washington",2,"This study uses content analysis and social network analysis methods to examine NPR’s novel use of Twitter to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, including the implication of that coverage on collective remembering of the event. Specifically this study explores the extent to which NPR’s coverage followed “conventionalized” patterns of traditional news coverage, including the “protest paradigm,” which obscure the specific civil rights demands at the heart of the march. Twitter’s social network data also make it possible to visualize and examine the audience’s active participation in collective remembering, and whether that participation changes which aspects of the coverage – and the march – are ultimately most salient for collective memory retrieval. However, the “most influential” Twitter accounts in the network that developed around the @todayin1963 coverage that this study focuses on are among those institutions and individuals who have traditionally had more cultural authority over collective memory. Thus, the data end up challenging the extent to which Twitter has altered those power structures that determine whose memories of important historic events dominate, and whose do not.",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies

This study examines 10-year anniversary coverage of SARS in mainland China and Hong Kong. Specifically, in the context of a past public health crisis, this study seeks to explore how media frames the SARS outbreak in anniversary coverage, what differences exist in coverage patterns in different societies, and how those discrepancies may influence the public's collective memory differently. Analysis of 344 newspaper articles from Hong Kong and two cities in mainland China (Beijing and Guangzhou) reveals both quantitative and qualitative differences between mainland China and Hong Kong's 10-year anniversary coverage of SARS. By presenting how a single past crisis was portrayed differently in two societies, this study provides a framework for future investigations into the mediated past and the journalistic construction of mediated collective memory.",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies

This study considers the practice of commemorative sports journalism, in particular how (and by whom) the stories surrounding Title IX’s fortieth anniversary were constructed at two of the nation’s leading sports news outlets. Drawing from a combination of narrative and critical discourse analysis grounded in hegemonic theory, we contend that ESPN and Sports Illustrated shifted away from the traditional battle-of-the-sexes narrative; the end result was a celebratory women-centric model, one that offered progressive ways of understanding Title IX but sometimes fell prey to flaws associated with what White (2009) has called the “content of the form.”",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies

News provided space for competing liberal and conservative claims about the lessons of the 1930s for contemporary policy; journalists also remembered the Depression--figured as a time of frugality, common purpose, and a simpler lifestyle--in order to guide behavior during economic hard times. Newfound attention to the New Deal did not, this paper argues, effect consensus around the importance of government involvement in the economy. Liberal calls for a new New Deal met with conservative attacks on the first New Deal, and calls to emulate the values of the Depression resonated with a cultural politics of personal responsibility, implying that the nation’s economic well-being rested on whether or not individual Americans lived within their means.",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0248,2014,Paper Session,The Connection Between Social Capital and Help Seeking on Facebook,4,"Mobilization requests – broadcasted status updates which request information, favors, or other forms of assistance from one’s network – can help us understand social capital dynamics as they unfold on Facebook. Specifically, we view these requests and the responses they receive as a window into how, why, and with what results individuals turn to their Friends network for help. In this study, we synthesize the existing research on mobilization requests via Facebook (e.g., Ellison et al., 2013; AUTHORS, in press) and present analyses of survey data collected from a random sample of Facebook users who have made any post in the past week (N=573) and a sample of those who have posted a mobilization request in the past week (N=1,074). To identify mobilization requests, an automated classifier trained on a hand-labeled sample of public status updates was used. Using participants’ self-reported survey data and server-level behavioral data, we examine how often participants request assistance using the status update tool, how effective such requests are in recruiting help, and how these requests relate to perceptions of bridging and bonding social capital. Finally, we examine related variables such as engagement in Facebook Relational Maintenance Behaviors.",Relationship Maintenance on Facebook,Communication and Technology
2014-0249,2014,Paper Session,"Facebook Features, Usage, and Relational Quality",1,"This study aims to examine the relationship between parent-child Facebook communication and relational quality using dyadic analysis. Facebook communication refers to the use of various Facebook features to communicate with each other for the parent-child pair. Fifty parent-child dyads were invited to participate in an online survey on individual general Facebook use, communication with counterparts via Facebook features, communication with counterparts via other mediums, intimacy and relationship satisfaction. Actor-Partner Interdependence Model was employed to explore the relationship between Facebook features and relational quality in parent-child dyads. With forty-nine valid dyads, results show that adolescents use Facebook more often, but parents are more active in using Facebook to communicate with their children. Adolescent-initiated Facebook communication with parents is positively linked to parent-perceived intimacy and relationship satisfaction, especially when adolescents play games with their parents or view photos uploaded by parents. However, parent-initiated Facebook communication with children negatively predicts adolescent-perceived intimacy and relationship satisfaction, especially when parents view photos uploaded by their children. Suggestions are provided to both parents and the young generation to facilitate parent-child communication on Facebook.",Relationship Maintenance on Facebook,Communication and Technology
2014-0250,2014,Paper Session,Connecting in the Facebook Age: Development and Validation of a New Measure of Relationship Maintenance,1,"New communication technologies have changed how we connect, interact, and maintain relationships with a variety of social ties. The present study expands our understanding of relationship maintenance processes to account for the unique affordances of these communication technologies through a study of adult Facebook users (N=407). Drawing on more than three decades’ research on relationship maintenance research (e.g., Canary & Stafford, 1992; Stafford, 2010; Stafford & Canary, 1991), a four-factor measure of relationship maintenance on Facebook is developed, including Supportive Communication, Shared Interests, Passive Consumption, and Social Information Seeking. The four strategies are discussed in detail and the scale’s convergent validity is tested through correlational analysis with a number of relational and Facebook-specific variables. Overall, the strategies overcome two major limitations of previous relationship maintenance measures—assumptions of geographic and emotional closeness—and are more appropriate for the diverse social connections represented in users’ social media networks.",Relationship Maintenance on Facebook,Communication and Technology

It examines the usage patterns, social network composition, and social interaction on the two sites. A survey of Chinese international students at a large US university (N=210) reveals that they use Renren more intensively than Facebook. Their primary social networks on Facebook are composed of co-ethnics in the US, i.e. Chinese friends who come from the same country of origin, followed by Americans, other Asians, and others with different nationalities and ethnicities. They are more likely to interact with their Chinese friends on Facebook. Comparing Facebook and Renren, they prefer using Renren to interact with Chinese friends, regardless their geographic locations.",Relationship Maintenance on Facebook,Communication and Technology

The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, the study examines the content of the official Facebook pages of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to understand how politicians use social networking sites to reach out to voters. Second, with the help of an experiment the study examines the influence of these messages on Facebook on political participation. Findings from the content analysis show important differences in strategies between the two candidates. Results from the experiment demonstrate posts promoting the candidate increase political participation in individuals whose party ID are congruent with the post.

In particular, this study asks whether interacting in social networking sites can meaningfully contribute to the democratic process by facilitating citizens’ engagement in political activities. Analyses of a national sample of U.S. adults reveal that social networking site use positively contributes to political participation, particularly among politically interested citizens. Nevertheless, further analyses highlight the important role of the users’ trust toward the source in the current information environment, and reveal that the interactive dynamics in social media can function to engage the politically disengaged citizens, when they highly trust the information mediated through online platforms.",Political Participation and Social Media,Communication and Technology

Customizability’s theoretical dimensions (i.e., explicit and implicit), its conceptualization and operationalization were developed. Quantitative content analysis of the 180 most popular political blogs, wikis, discussion forums, participatory journalism sites, content-sharing sites, and traditional news sites showed that customizability was present on the vast majority of these sites. Explicit customizability was more extensively present than implicit customizability. In the second part of the article, two theoretical models of potential political effects of explicit and implicit customizability were proposed (but not experimentally tested), suggesting that implicit customizability might have stronger effects on selective exposure. The two models lay the foundation for future experimental work on customizability effects.",Political Participation and Social Media,Communication and Technology

We analyze about 450,000 Twitter messages related to the Occupy and ‘indignados’ movements. We test how well integrated the two movements are; we characterize users posting content relevant to both movements; and we examine the robustness of the network to node removal. We find that global connectivity depends on a small percentage of users and that the two movements are mostly concerned with their local struggles: the bridges connecting the two flows of information channel just a small percentage of all information exchanged. We use these findings to assess theoretical claims about political protests in the digital age.",Political Participation and Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0256,2014,Paper Session,Examining Perceived Distance and Authenticity as Mediators of the Effects of Sociability and Ghost-Tweeting on Parasocial Interaction With a Microcelebrity,2,"Parasocial interaction has traditionally been conceptualized as a one-sided phenomenon, but interactive social network sites are opening the door for more reciprocal, parasocial encounters with media figures. College students (N=184) participated in an online experiment to examine the effect of two different Twitter practices on parasocial interaction with social media figures. Sociability (interacting with other social media users or not) and Tweet authorship (using a ghost-twitterer or not) were manipulated. Sociability did not affect parasocial interaction with a Twitter microcelebrity, but the practice did reduce users’ perceptions of distance. Ghost-Tweeting decreased parasocial interaction. Participants’ perceptions of the media figure’s authenticity mediated this effect. These findings shed light on processes related to both computer mediated communication and parasocial interaction with new media figures.",Staying Connected: Interacting With Popular Culture Through Social Media,Mass Communication
2014-0257,2014,Paper Session,How Do Fans Criticize Their Own Team? Demonstrated Practices From a Facebook Fan Page,2,"Despite the contestation of the image of the passive audience, sports fans have often been categorized as an overly emotional crowd. Our paper aligns the active audience with van Zoonen’s (2004) “Fan-public” to discuss the seemingly unsupportive action of fan criticism. Using a professional NFL team’s Facebook fan page, we studied thousands of comments and found mitigation practices (such as using webspeak) for fans’ negotiation of criticism.


This team performed poorly in 2012, and we show how fans construct a public sphere through both their critical and participatory behavior in reaction to this performance. The prevalence of this behavior suggests that these negotiations and criticism are important parts of the engaged fan. We conclude that the establishment of a fan space can be construed as a public sphere and therefore serves as a reminder that discussions of power and resources are not limited to the national or purely political level.",Staying Connected: Interacting With Popular Culture Through Social Media,Mass Communication
2014-0258,2014,Paper Session,Motivations to Use Social Media During Sporting Event Attendance: Placing Attitude Functions Within the Theory of Planned Behavior,1,"The recent years have observed an increased use of social media through mobile devices on different occasions. The present investigation examines why sports spectators use social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) while attending sporting events. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 466 participants who generally attended games with friends or family, structural equation modeling analysis revealed that social media use during sporting event attendance served four functions: information-based and game pleasure-based utilitarian functions, an ego-defensive function, and a value-expressive function. The first three functions, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy predicted attitudes toward social media use. When placed within a larger theoretical framework, attitudes, self-efficacy, descriptive norms, and the ego-defensive function predicted intentions to use social media during sporting event attendance. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Staying Connected: Interacting With Popular Culture Through Social Media,Mass Communication

The Role of the Coviewer's Reactions, Gender, and Perceived Identification With the Male Protagonist",2,"While media research has long ago acknowledged that watching TV is a social activity, only a few studies have examined the effects of co-viewing on adult reactions to a televised text. In the current investigation, we use previous research on the intra-audience effect, as well as research on audience identification and attitude change to develop hypotheses connecting co-viewers’ reactions, co-viewers’ gender, and viewer’s post-exposure attitudes. Participants were invited to watch a movie depicting rape. We manipulated their co-viewers’ reaction (engaged or unengaged) and gender, and subsequently measured perceived co-viewer identification with the rapist, the viewers’ own identification and the viewers’ rape myth acceptance (the tendency to attribute responsibility for sexual violence to the victim, rather than to the rapist). Results demonstrate that, as hypothesized, both manipulations had an indirect effect on rape myth acceptance, sequentially mediated through perceptions about the identification of the co-viewers and viewers’ own identification.",Media Violence and Aggression,Mass Communication

Violent media consumption was assessed via daily diaries kept by children. Behavioral problems and peer rejection were assessed via parent reports. Peer rejection had both short-term and long-term consequences on behavioral problems, and violent media consumption amplified these effects. The effects remained significant even after controlling for various demographic characteristics and academic achievement, as well as prior behavioral problems andthe stability of rejection. These findings are consistent with social cognitive and cultivation theories and have important theoretical and applied significance.",Media Violence and Aggression,Mass Communication

Youth’s exposure to music media is troubling, in part, because sexual and violent content and imagery has become commonplace in even mainstream music. In this study, we content analyzed music video lyric stanzas and the corresponding music video images. We coded for the presence of sexual and violent content within each stanza, which allowed us to determine the frequency with which music lyrics and videos simultaneously portray sexual and violent lyrics and images. The results indicate that consumers of music media messages may be exposed to objectifying content, graphic sexual lyrics and images, and the simultaneous portrayal of sex and violence.",Media Violence and Aggression,Mass Communication

Study results found that non-sanitized violence inhibits enjoyment of traditional violence. Furthermore, serial and parallel analyses of indirect effects find that non-sanitized violence has both negative and positive effects on enjoyment as predicted by identification and mood management theory.

Drawing from an inter-disciplinary body of literature, this paper illustrates a wide range of ways in which mobile Internet access offers lower levels of functionality and content availability; operates on less open and flexible platforms; and contributes to diminished levels of user engagement, content creation, and information-seeking. At a time when a growing proportion of the online population is “mobile only,” a ramification of these disparities is the emergence of what is termed here an emerging Internet underclass. The implications of this argument for digital divide policymaking and, more broadly, for the evolutionary trajectory of the Internet and the dynamics of Internet usage are discussed.","Assessing Internet Access: Content, Connection, and Speed",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0267,2014,Paper Session,Effects of Public Policy on the Quality of Broadband Services: A Comparative Analysis of Internet Download Speeds,2,"With the rapid diffusion of fixed and mobile platforms, access to broadband services has become widely available in most OECD countries. Access continues to be an issue in rural and remote areas and for certain disadvantaged groups but harnessing the benefits of advanced information and communication services is increasingly dependent on the quality of the available connectivity. This paper examines the factors that influence the quality of broadband access, measured by the average and peak download speeds that are supported by the network infrastructure. It focuses on the role of public policy decisions in facilitating quality upgrades of access networks. Because policy instruments typically interact with each other, the paper adopts a novel empirical method that is better suited to systematically explore these interactions. Using a cross-national sample of OECD countries, we find that certain policy constellations are more likely to support continued quality improvements than others. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that the best policy approach is dependent on the specific context of a country.","Assessing Internet Access: Content, Connection, and Speed",Communication Law & Policy

Cameron defended the policy by saying that pornography was “corroding childhood.” This paper seeks to answer the following research question: How can U.S. doctrine on pornography and obscenity, analyzed in conjunction with prominent U.S. theories of freedom of expression, explain and assess David Cameron’s anti-pornography policy? This paper synthesizes landmark cases that define U.S. law regarding the major issues discussed in this paper (pornography, obscenity, the Internet, and protection of minors), and analyzes those using major theories of freedom of expression. The paper then comparatively analyzes those theories with British political theory to explain and assess the default filtering policy.","Assessing Internet Access: Content, Connection, and Speed",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0269,2014,Paper Session,New Models and Conflicts in the Interconnection and Delivery of Internet-Mediated Content,1,"As the Internet has evolved, interconnection terms and conditions between Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) have diversified. Content Delivery Networks offer downstream video, all but guaranteeing an imbalance between downstream and upstream traffic which typically triggers a demand for higher compensation from the carriers delivering increased volume. When commercial disputes become protracted, issues of fairness, network neutrality and the need for regulatory intervention arises.

This paper will examine existing and likely future interconnection disputes with an eye toward identifying when and how conflicts can get resolved. The paper supports commercially driven negotiations, but suggests that regulatory authorities may need to arbitrate and promote settlements when now essential Internet access becomes blocked or congested. The paper concludes that ISPs should have the opportunity to provide both end users and content sources alternatives to “best efforts” content delivery, but that they should not create artificial congestion as justification for additional compensation.","Assessing Internet Access: Content, Connection, and Speed",Communication Law & Policy

The paper focuses on the contributions of pre-Colombian cultures to the language and cultural geography that defines cultures that still cut across national borders in Latin America in ways that frame cultural spaces and markets. We also look closely at the colonial era relationships between the Catholic Church and the Portuguese and Spanish empires in setting crucial linguistic boundaries that still separate Brazil from the rest of Latin America, affecting contemporary television program flows, genre development and format flows. We also look at other colonial traditions, such as corporatism, patterns of cultural hybridity, and certain commercial patterns, that came from the colonialists but were further shaped both during colonial times and post-colonial times, as well as newer patterns shaped across Latin America and Iberia in the 20th Century, such as populism.

This paper traces the cultural, political economic, and infrastructural forces that shape media in the process of emergence. It argues that public policy is especially important for defining emergent media technologies and that discourse in obscured regulatory decisions brings consequences for the terms of access to and participation in the public sphere. It examines these dynamics of media emergence through a case study of internet access policy and its influence on broadband network development in the 2000s United States. The analysis focuses on the use of terminology on which a key policy struggle turned— the particular terms ‘information’ and ‘telecommunication’— and shows how the decision by the Federal Communications Commission to classify broadband as the former rather than the latter came with major consequences for the shape of the internet in the US, particularly by diminishing network neutrality.",Industrial Histories of New Media,Popular Communication

Games are treated as pure speech while code is treated as speech and action (making it easier to regulate code). By comparing the legal classification of these two new mediums, the paper demonstrates disjunctures in the way the law defined these media—in particular, that both human and machine action were obscured in the legal codification of video games. This obfuscation, aided by an approach to new media that focused only on what is visible on the screen, is an example of commodity fetishism. This fetishism enabled the justices to treat the ability of games (as objects divorced from the conditions of their production) to circulate freely on the market as an example of the type of political speech and freedoms protected by the First Amendment.",Industrial Histories of New Media,Popular Communication

Much of the literature on transmedia entertainment tends to assume a monolithic production context where transmedia storytelling is carefully orchestrated using sophisticated methods that leave little to chance. This paper proposes that using a historical perspective, disruptions and disjunctions of transmedia entertainment can be rendered more visible. We present here two historical case studies of transmedia entertainment properties: adventure hero The Shadow as an example of early 20th century ‘pulp’ transmedia entertainment and toy-based franchise Transformers as an example of the contemporary paradigm of transmedia entertainment. Our findings indicate a need to nuance contemporary understandings of transmedia narratives, by acknowledging to a greater extent the potential disorganization that fictional worlds might hold.",Industrial Histories of New Media,Popular Communication

Analyzing the emergence of listening as a cultural technology for organizing colonized masculine bodies, I demonstrate how Gibraltarian’s way of listening to noise reproduces the gendered, racial, and class-based antagonisms between Gibraltarians and Spaniards – from discourses of Spanish migrants blaring stereos in pursuit of young British Gibraltarian women, to dismissals of Royal Air Force jet noise as “not so bad.” I trace this way of listening back to post-World War II dawn of Gibraltarian colonial subjectivity, when colonial administrators, all of whom were men, and a majority of whom were English, inscribed in the noise ordinances an elite, English sense of the “proper” relationship between British qua white bodies, mass media technologies, and private and public sounds.","Noise, Memory, Multiculturalism: Mediation in Postcolonial Spaces","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

In many ways, this case serves as a counterpoint to the present literature on the mediation of multiculturalism, which is primarily situated in the cities of the developed world. Drawing on both a thematic analysis of the Manila-centric Philippine entertainment media and six focus group discussions with the city's local Filipinos, I argue that this particular instance of mediation is entwined with the Filipino postcolonial condition, which has made Manila’s locals insecure about their cultural identity. Specifically, I show that the symbolic marginalization of the city’s diasporas is linked to the locals’ preoccupation with establishing a homogenous and unique cultural identity. My hope is that this work helps in broadening the way we understand the mediation of multiculturalism, so that it can also account for the diverse conditions of cities in the developing world.","Noise, Memory, Multiculturalism: Mediation in Postcolonial Spaces","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2014-0277,2014,Paper Session,Doing Mediated Memories Memory Work and the Practices of Cuban-American Remembrance,2,"How can we conceptualize and analyze the ways, personal and public memories are enacted in environments that have become increasingly digitally networked? Following this question, we first develop a concept of mediated memory work. Building on theories of social practices, accomplishing remembrance and commemoration is thus understood as happening in sets of sequenced activities done in relation to media and geared into personal as well as collective memories. Capitalizing on such an understanding of mediated memory work, the paper secondly demonstrates how the enactment of memories can thus be empirically studied by example of the Cuban-American community in Miami. In particular, building on participant observation, in-depth interviews and media ethnography, we outline practices, cultural artifacts, communal bonds, compassionate relations and a media manifold that have been employed by different segments of the diasporic collective in shaping what of and how the country of origin and the exile is to be remembered.","Noise, Memory, Multiculturalism: Mediation in Postcolonial Spaces","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

This article recovers his works and proposes an update of his contributions within the context of the contemporary media ecology. After describing the conversations that characterized the Latin American academic circuit in the early 1980s, the article introduces Martín-Barbero’s theory of mediation, taking as a reference his influential book De los Medios a las Mediaciones (1987). The article then explores two paths: a contemporary reading of Martín-Barbero’s contributions from a digital perspective and a comparison between Martín-Barbero’s mediation and Jenkins’ convergence culture. Finally, the article reflects on the status of the Latin American media and culture discourse within the global media research networks.","Noise, Memory, Multiculturalism: Mediation in Postcolonial Spaces","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2014-0279,2014,Paper Session,Climate Narratives in Public Relations and Strategic Communication,8,"Anthropogenic Climate Change (climate change that is caused by human activity) is considered to be one of the key global concerns over the course of this century (BBC, 2010; Boykoff, 2007; Budescu, Broomell & Por, 2009). Many research studies have analyzed why the discourse of climate change is so fraught with conflict; why scientists have had so little impact in changing the master narrative; and how news reports present arguments from a variety of positions yet have failed to produce a coherent narrative (Corner, Butler & Pidgeon, 2009; Corbett & Durfee, 2004; Corner & Hahn, 2009). The research indicates that conflicting scientific research, general uncertainty, the complexity of the information, a variety of personal values, and the psychological distance create difficulties when assessing arguments about the direst impacts of climate change.The practice of public relations often encompasses strategic communication campaigns and while it has a definite functional component that has become very metrics driven and ROI focused over the last two decades, research on public relations can also be understood as the structuring of these communication activities (e.g., Bordieu, Cozier and Witmer, 2001). From this perspective, the ongoing flow of communication around an issue can be seen as a co-production of strategic messaging with the voice of stakeholders (not all working in the same direction) and others who engage with the narratives as they evolve (Riley, Thomas, Weintraub, Noyes and Dixon, 2013).",Public Versus Corporate Discourses on Environmental Issues,Public Relations

Although these campaigns may include brief and selective references to corporate activities, most campaigns place a much stronger emphasis on commonly shared societal values. This project examines audience response to values-based environmental marketplace advocacy messages through a series of focus groups. Four instrumental values were identified in campaign videos (innovation, community, resilience, and patriotism), and the terminal value of pragmatism, especially as it relates to environmental issues, was identified as a result of identification with one or more of the instrumental values. This study sheds light on the ways corporations appeal to commonly-held societal values in an effort to generate support for a given technology or industry. Implications of values-laden marketplace advocacy are discussed and direction for environmental groups to develop counter strategies is offered.",Public Versus Corporate Discourses on Environmental Issues,Public Relations

The interplay between issues and stakeholders as represented in news coverage in these two countries compares and contrasts in important ways when mapped over time. Initially presented as a compelling business story, the unconventional gas is today more frequently depicted as a zero sum game in which a win for the economy equates to a loss for environment and quality of life. The network of stakeholders to emerge is complex and evidence of elite opinion leader withdrawal—elite retreat—provides some explanation of the fragmented debate.

We hold that there is a tendency, in public relations research, to tacitly underestimate the complexity, and indeed fragility, of the concept of ‘fact’ in public discourse. This tendency leads to a masking out of a crucial part of what public relations does. Our paper suggests some ways of exploring the establishment of facts as an active process, thus highlighting the role of communication. Our suggestions refer to actor-network theory (ANT) as a theoretical foundation and are illustrated by a case study previously conducted by the authors.",Public Versus Corporate Discourses on Environmental Issues,Public Relations
2014-0283,2014,Paper Session,Double-Identification and the Critical Actor: Implications of Brecht’s Dramatic Theory for Media Research,1,"Viewers’ identification with a media character results in the experience of enjoyment. However, the loss of the critical distance to the narrative leaves the viewer vulnerable to persuasion. This dilemma of a joyful persuasion through identification is not only discussed in media research, but has already been recognized some decades ago by the dramatist Bertolt Brecht. Thus, adhering to an interdisciplinary approach, the paper is deriving implications for media research from Brecht’s theatrical theory. Firstly, it was found that identification is indeed a process of double-identification, not only taking place between the viewers and the characters (the merged perception of actor and role) but also between the actors and their roles. Secondly, the process of identification can be influenced or prevented by both a critical viewer or by a critical actor without precluding the experience of enjoyment.",Critical Examinations of Drama and Media Production,Mass Communication

2014-0286,2014,Paper Session,Women’s Employment and Professional Empowerment in South Koream Dramas,2,"This study examined how Korean dramas portray the relationship between women’s life and work. Men were more affluent, more educationally privileged, and older. Women were depicted as married, as opposed to being single, more often than men. There were far more men than women among the characters employed outside the home and holding a professional occupation or managerial position. A closer look at the characters’ occupations revealed a clear gender divide that designated more authoritative and financially lucrative occupations to men. Among young adults, being married was a negative predictor of employment and professional empowerment and it was more so for women than for men. Being a parent of a little child(ren) also negatively affected employment and professional empowerment. Comparisons between the 10-year trends in television dramas and South Korean social statistics revealed that the two are not too far off from each other, suggesting possible mutual influence.",Critical Examinations of Drama and Media Production,Mass Communication

Most Americans view nudes monthly, nonparaphilic pornography a couple of times per year, and never view paraphilic pornography. Men view twice as much pornography as women and younger generations view pornography at younger ages and with more frequency than older generations. 25% of respondents reported a few years or more of compulsive use of pornography. Path analysis revealed that pornography use has no negative direct effect on sexual satisfaction, but has a very small positive indirect effect on sexual satisfaction, as mediated by increased sexual experience. Pornography viewing in adulthood is strongly influenced by early, frequent exposure to pornography in childhood, and moderately influenced by erotophilic tendencies and sexual script overlap. Pornography appears to serve a very temporary, pleasurable physiological arousal experience with no long term effects for most people.",Sexy Topics in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Both mothers and their daughters responded to measures on their self-efficacy, susceptibility, and severity based on their reports of the risk of obtaining sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The study found that mothers’ perceived severity influenced their daughters’ behavioral intentions and condom use behavior. However, no evidence was found that mothers’ communication impacts their daughters’ condom use or communicative behavior with their partners. On the other hand, daughters’ self-efficacy was shown to predict their intentions, risk communication, condom use communication, and condom use behavior with their partners. The strengths and limitations of this study are discussed, and future STI research directions are suggested.",Sexy Topics in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Additionally, assessments of the risks and benefits of disclosing were expected to influence the relationship between orgasm, alcohol, and post-coital communication. Results revealed that individuals who orgasmed perceived greater benefits to disclosing to their partners after sexual activity. These individuals also disclosed information of greater magnitude and more positively valenced information compared to those who did not orgasm, though risk-benefit assessments did not mediate this relationship. Additionally, the more alcohol individuals consumed, the fewer benefits they assessed to disclosing, the less deep and positively valenced were their disclosures, and the more unintentional they were in their disclosures. Similarly, this relationship was not mediated by risk-benefit assessments. Lastly, one interaction between orgasm and alcohol emerged for the dimension of valence. Individuals who consumed more alcohol and did not orgasm disclosed less positively valenced information than individuals who consumed less alcohol and did not orgasm across occasions. The implications of these findings for couples’ communication and future research on the post-coital time interval are discussed.",Sexy Topics in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Individuals were asked to read a scenario in which an imagined heterosexual partner engages in infidelity with a different-sex or same-sex person. Individuals were randomly assigned to one of these two conditions and then asked to complete several measures assessing their imagined emotions, communicative responses, and relational outcomes. Results revealed that both men and women experienced more negative emotional responses to different-sex infidelity versus same-sex infidelity. Additionally, men reported more sexual arousal in response to a woman’s same-sex infidelity versus different-sex infidelity, while women’s sexual arousal did not vary across conditions. Lastly, likelihood of terminating the relationship, attributions of blame, and communicative responses to jealousy (CRJs) were investigated.

Hypotheses were tested in a secondary data analysis of a selective exposure study, in which respondents’ time spent with manipulated health articles (low versus high suggested susceptibility) was unobtrusively recorded, while perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, worry, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions were assessed through an online questionnaire. Findings accentuate the roles of message exposure and susceptibility appraisal as indirect and direct determinants of persuasive effects and support the assumption that the message manipulation and severity appraisal are only indirectly related to behavioral intentions. Worry, a function of severity and susceptibility appraisals, showed the strongest direct impact on behavioral intentions.

Specifically, youth at high risk for smoking have high levels of sensation seeking and trait reactance, rejecting traditional anti-smoking messages. To overcome these challenges, the truth® campaign was designed, targeting youth high in sensation seeking and trait reactance. Limited work has explored the mechanisms through which this campaign achieved results. This paper uses the truth® campaign as a case study to examine whether, and how, anti-smoking change was produced in high risk adolescents. An online survey of 251 13-15 year olds tested the hypotheses that sensation seeking and trait reactance moderated the effects of exposure to the campaign. Analysis of strategies used by the truth® campaign to reach high-risk youth, identifying features that can be translated to other adolescent health campaigns are presented.",Social Influence and Health Outcomes,Health Communication
2014-0296,2014,Paper Session,Using Inoculation Theory to Promote Interpersonal Discussion About Emergency Preparedness,2,"Following recommended evacuation procedures in a disaster situation is one of the most effective ways one can minimize the impacts of the disaster. Interpersonal discussion has been identified as one factor that may increase the probability one will engage in an advocated behavior. This may occur is because interpersonal discussion requires individuals to centrally process the campaign information. This study proposes that inoculation messages could facilitate discussion and bolster attitudes about evacuation procedures. Inoculation messages may encourage individuals to discuss the message with others through talk as reassurance or talk as advocacy depending on the level of attitude certainty individuals’ experience. These discussions may increase attitude accessibility, attitude certainty, involvement, and behavior intentions. The results suggest attitude certainty impacts interpersonal discussion, but not in the ways predicted. Additionally, interpersonal discussion increased attitude accessibility, attitude certainty, and involvement.

This paper differs from such studies, as it uses conversation analysis and membership categorization analysis to offer close-grained, moment-by-moment analysis of how participants in an adult-oriented Internet Relay Chat room oriented to the 9/11 attacks as ‘tellable’ events, collaboratively constructing responses and reactions that one could accountably give when doing ‘being ordinary’ in relation such an extraordinary event. While the analysis presented here is drawn from IRC interaction, similar conversations happened in many online forums on that day. Such analysis is useful from a theoretical viewpoint, as it serves to further underscore how we interact online in ways that replicate face-to-face interaction, while allowing us to do things we can’t easily do in most face-to-face situations – including sharing feelings and comfort with people around the world.","Subjectivity, Morality, and Agency in Conversation, Radio Phone-ins, 9/11 Interactions, and Qualitative Research",Language & Social Interaction

Prior researches suggested that three-part lists are the normative lists and when compared to narrative, lists are centered on the delivery of objective information. Using data from Israeli and U.S. radio call-in shows, we discuss the “more-than-three-part” lists. Unlike prior research claims, these lists deliver their speaker’s subjectivity in a structure similar to stories: a “lister” (teller) delivers the “list” (tale) in a “listing” (telling) process. The listing may include elements comparable to evaluative elements of stories. More-than-three-part lists can come in chains to reinforce the speaker’s point. In Israel, more-than-three-part lists have some normative standing in the radio phone-in environment. Shifting to their topic, speakers in both countries use the more-than-three-part lists to emphasize media biases. The conclusion suggests a relationship between the speech event, radio phone-in interactions, and the type of extended discourse structure used in it, lists.","Subjectivity, Morality, and Agency in Conversation, Radio Phone-ins, 9/11 Interactions, and Qualitative Research",Language & Social Interaction

Interestingly enough, the artifacts used as tools of inquiry are rarely deemed worthy of similar analytical attention, as if they were inconsequential to the organization of social interaction taking place in the field. Adopting a theoretical framework on hybrid agency, this article discusses and empirically shows how these objects play a role in defining the institutional goal of the interaction and, therefore, contribute to the crafting of the data. The analysis illustrates the circumstances in which these references occur and the activities accomplished by participants by referring to these objects. In the discussion we propose that the analytical underestimation of the role of things “talked-into being” in the research setting supports a vision of research practices as a mirror of the social reality out there.","Subjectivity, Morality, and Agency in Conversation, Radio Phone-ins, 9/11 Interactions, and Qualitative Research",Language & Social Interaction

Focusing on three aspects of journalistic interventionism – the importance of setting the political agenda, influencing public opinion and advocating for social change – multilevel analyses found substantive variation in interventionism at the individual level of the journalist, the level of media organizations, and the societal level. Based on interviews with 2100 journalists from 21 countries, findings affirm theories regarding a hierarchy of influences in news work. We found journalists to be more willing to intervene in society when they work in public media organizations and in countries with restricted political freedom. An important conclusion of our analysis is that journalists’ professional role orientations are also deeply rooted within perceptions of cultural and social values. Journalists were more likely to embrace an interventionist role when they were more strongly motivated by the value types of power, achievement and tradition.",Journalists' Role Conceptions and Journalistic Cultures,Journalism Studies

We test whether factors such as their target audience, the issues they cover, the year they left Iran, as well as the professional role perceptions relate to reported freedoms and fears. We find that Iranian journalists abroad do not see themselves in an activist role, but strongly identify themselves with objective journalism. Also, while respondents see some editorial freedoms to pursue investigative reporting and question the Iranian government, the majority of respondents fear personal or familial repercussions, and many have been the target of cyber-attacks. Third, we find that contextual factors such as the topics covered or the target audience are only weakly related with professional role perceptions and reported freedoms and fears.

2014-0305,2014,Paper Session,Conceptualizing a Four-Factor Construct for Journalists’ Job Satisfaction: A Structural Equation Modeling Method,1,"Job Satisfaction studies especially in the field of Organization research have traditionally been looked at as a measure of motivation and environmental factors. Factors of burnout related to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment and its different variants have also been related to diverse conceptualizations of job satisfaction. Recent studies in the fields of human services have conceptualized intrinsic, organizational and salary as factors of job satisfaction.
The present study theorizes a four factor construct of job satisfaction for journalists — intrinsic satisfaction, organizational satisfaction, tangible benefits and efficacy perceptions. Based on an online survey of 216 journalists in three Indian cities, this study provides a structural equation modeling approach to prove the construct validity of the hypothesized model proposed as a second order hierarchical construct. Standard goodness of fit indices and factor loadings are used to prove the construct validity.

In this paper, we draw upon content analysis data collected as part of a 61-films study from 1947 to 2007 on Bollywood and globalization in order to better understand the impact of economic liberalization upon cinematic depictions of modern and traditional practices and consumerist lifestyles. While we found that these films have experienced increases in several forms of modern content, we also found that producers privileged modern over traditional content throughout the entire history of post-colonial popular Hindi cinema, not just after liberalization in 1991. Additionally, while many commentators suggest that brand displays are a post-1991 phenomena in Hindi cinema, data analysis suggests otherwise: product placements and other consumerist tactics have been present in post-colonial popular Hindi cinema throughout the entire period analyzed in this paper. Thus, these findings serve as an important qualification for recent Indian film scholarship attributing widespread consumerist cinematic changes to liberalization.","Indian Media, Culture, and Globalization",Global Communication and Social Change

A woman-produced documentary supported by UNESCO, Ladies Special represents a parallel and gendered public sphere at a time when women, gender inequity, and the disconnect between India’s modern aspirations, its traditional notions of women's role in society, and its legal system are the subject of international media coverage. The result is an unique space of documentary practice representing the private lives of women in a semi-private space created in the public sphere. The film reveals the train as an unique place for women to freely associate and create a women-only culture in accordance with customs and beliefs outside of the institutional demands of home, school, and work. It serves to promote a counter-discourse, facilitating the support of women’s rights via the director’s “insider” view of women’s practices of gendered and space-related liberty.","Indian Media, Culture, and Globalization",Global Communication and Social Change

It is based on expert interviews with nine leading senior online news
managers and journalists from Canada’s principal news organizations, with a focus on the growing influence of social media, and the professionals’ subjective, experience-based understandings of the current changes in journalism. The interviewees demonstrated a tacit understanding of a shift away from the traditional role of gatekeeper towards a shared ecosystem of news and information.

The grid’s practical implementation is being discussed by means of a research design for a content analysis of an international public broadcaster’s social media activities.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies
2014-0312,2014,Paper Session,Chinese Journalists’ Discursive Weibo Practices in a Spin-Off Journalistic Sphere,2,"This study examines Chinese journalists’ Weibo practices through analyzing 2,659 journalist Weibo postings. Past studies indicate that Western journalists generally “normalize” their postings on social media to fit their professional norms and practices, but this issue is much more complicated in China. Findings of this study suggest that Chinese journalists’ Weibo practices are influenced by offline discursive journalistic discourses that include four components: party press, professionalism, market economy, and Confucian intellectual. As Weibo has become a major news channel in China, this study takes journalist Weibo as a “spin-off journalistic sphere” where several boundaries are blurred. Journalist Weibo is both a private sphere and public sphere. Journalists operate on Weibo as both citizens and professionals. And journalists move from the backstage of news production to the front stage of news delivery. The changes offer opportunities for uplifting journalistic autonomy, but findings show that the official control is still tight.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies

More media organizations are using social media to engage with their publics in innovative ways. This study evaluated the perspectives of viewers regarding “Stay Tuned.” Through an online survey and in-depth interviews (N=7), viewers considered the audience of “Stay Tuned,” the topics and format of the show, their involvement and engagement with the show, their learning about show topics, and their overall evaluations of the program. The researchers also sought to validate “trustee networked journalism,” a model that seeks to build on public and civic journalism efforts by supporting journalism that not only addresses community concerns but also empowers community members to act by ensuring that their voices are represented in media content.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies
2014-0314,2014,Paper Session,Social Media Guidelines for Journalists. An Investigation Into the Sense and Nonsense Among Flemish Journalists,2,"This study investigates how Flemish journalists experience the sense and nonsense of social media guidelines, focusing on rules that prescribe their behaviour on Twitter. Analysis of 20 in-depth interviews demonstrates that the majority of Flemish journalists find the introduction of rules concerning the use of Twitter unnecessary. The argument heard most often is that the journalist’s common sense should be enough to deal with the platform in the proper way. A number of journalists even find the rules a curtailment of individual freedom. Particularly guidelines concerning specific formal requirements – such as mentioning the employer in the Twitter bio and/or account name, or the requirement to only use one account – encounter resistance. Based on these findings, the tweeting journalists seem to indicate that they themselves are able to both adapt their use of social media to fit traditional professional norms and adapt those norms to fit the media logic of the Twitter platform.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies
2014-0315,2014,Paper Session,Smoke-free Policy and Inter-Organizational Networks in Rural Communities,1,"Network analysis was used to examine inter-organizational partnerships related to smoke-free policy development over time in 30 rural Kentucky communities. A network of 30 community coalitions (22 treatment and 8 control communities) and 29 individual and organizational partners were assessed through annual key informant interviews for four years. Treatment communities received stage-based tailored technical assistance to promote smoke-free policy. Partnership ties, resource sharing ties, and support ties were examined. Network density and degree centrality were assessed. Density scores were higher over time for partnership contacts within the treatment networks but not the control networks. An increase in average degree centrality was observed in both the treatment and control communities. These findings have applied implications for building effective inter-organizational relationships to leverage resources for health policy in rural communities, and theoretical implications for using longitudinal network analysis as an indicator of improvement in community capacity and readiness for change.",Good to Make Your Acquaintance: Networks and Collective Action Within and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication
2014-0316,2014,Paper Session,Top NGO Partnerships With Corporations: A Test of the Symbiotic Sustainability Model,3,"Studies of partnerships between corporations and nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) typically examine the relationship from the corporation’s perspective. Although this perspective is informative and has guided the majority of the corporate social responsibility literature, it tends to ignore the role of NGOs in the partnership. Drawing from the Symbiotic Sustainability Model, we suggest that NGOs have an equally important, albeit different, role in these relationships. In order to understand the NGO-corporate partnership network from the NGO perspective, we examined 122 of the largest, most recognizable NGOs, according to the Philanthropy 100 and Cone Brand 100. This yielded a list of 1740 corporate partners and 2424 cross-sector relationships. The results demonstrate leading NGOs are strategic in communicating their corporate partnerships, communicate relatively few corporate partners and only one corporate partner in each economic industry. However, the same mimetic tendencies reported in studies of corporations in economic industries were not present in NGO issue industries. The most popular economic industries reported were financial services, pharmaceutical, and professional services. Particularly salient pairings included: (1) environmental NGOs and metals, energy, and oil industries, (2) health NGOs and the pharmaceutical industry, and (3) human services NGOs and the pharmaceutical industry.",Good to Make Your Acquaintance: Networks and Collective Action Within and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication

Scholarship on nonprofit management and the popular media typically position volunteering as an activity that improves both personal and community wellbeing through the development of collaborative relationships. This paper questions the uncritical acceptance that a positive relationship between collaboration in volunteer settings and community development exists and examines the role of contestation in building volunteer networks. It uses Lave and Wenger’s (1991) communities of practice framework as the basis for a study of the social practices of volunteers from three nonprofit organizations. The findings indicate that some instances of contestation are productive, and some cases of collaboration destructive. The paper assesses how organizational structures and practices impact the development and acceptability of conflict and contestation by volunteers, considers the implications for volunteer engagement in nonprofit organizations, and offers suggestions for future research.",Good to Make Your Acquaintance: Networks and Collective Action Within and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication
2014-0318,2014,Paper Session,Revisiting the Roles of Communication for Collective Action: A Theoretical Analysis,1,"In the past few years, the scholarly interest in the roles of communication, in particular, through social media for collective action has rapidly grown, as several large-scale social movements across world has been observed to occur. Many studies have been conducted to confirm a “near-consensual” belief that communication is functional for collective action. Casting a reasonable doubt upon the belief, this study attempts to explore the boundary condition under which communication truly matters for collective action. Pointing out that the conventional theoretical framework (i.e., public goods or commons problems) fails to fully represent a wide range of real-world collective action problems, this study examined three alternative theoretical models—threshold/critical mass theory, evolution of cooperation, and coordination problems, which have not received enough attention in communication research. The study found that the roles of communication differ depending upon the structural characteristics of collective action. Finally, direction for future research was discussed.",Good to Make Your Acquaintance: Networks and Collective Action Within and Between Organizations,Organizational Communication

Drawing from a sample of college students who used both Facebook and Twitter, this study focused on how contextual factors, such as the medium and the audience, influence the occurrence and characteristics of self-disclosure. The study drew upon communication privacy management (CPM) theory to predict the effects of the medium and network characteristics of the audience on how people form privacy concerns and make decisions about what to disclose. Results showed that there were strong effects of the medium on participants’ privacy concerns and their characteristics of disclosure, with participants being less concerned about privacy on Twitter, and disclosures on Twitter being less intimate and less significant to the self. The influence of audience as a context revealed significant three-way interaction effects between medium, network size, and network diversity.",Self Disclosure in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Drawing from social penetration theory and research on negativity/positivity effects, two studies were conducted to test the notion that the interpersonal and relational outcomes of such broadcasts are not uniform. The results of the cross-sectional survey offer evidence that responses to positive and negative broadcast disclosures vary based on the receiver’s perceived closeness to the discloser. The findings from the experiment further demonstrate that positive broadcast disclosures have a relatively more beneficial impact among close friends, whereas negative broadcast disclosures have a relatively more detrimental impact among acquaintances.",Self Disclosure in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Especially, the influence of moderating variables such as appropriateness, intimacy, and perceived reasons for the disclosure as well as socio-demographic aspects have not been addressed systematically in online settings. The present study seeks to analyze the impact of these factors by means of an online survey (N = 1934) that was conducted in Germany, United States, the Netherlands, China and Great Britain. Results show that self-disclosure on the Internet can have detrimental effects on the receivers´ perception of the relationship to the discloser when the discloser is not close, the message is sensitive and the reason for self-disclosure is assumed to be impression management. Culture is more influential than gender and age are and especially Germans compared to US-Americans perceive an impaired relationship towards the discloser. These cultural differences are also moderated by closeness as well as impression management motives of the discloser.",Self Disclosure in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Levels of (semi-) public self-disclosure are often high on SNS, although self-disclosure in face-to-face settings usually drops from dyadic to group settings. Status updates are often positive and funny, so self-disclosure might also fulfill an entertainment function. Respondents were asked to judge their own and their friends’ status updates as well as their private conversations on several dimensions (e.g. intimate, entertaining). Motives and effects were also assessed. Although status updates were less intimate than private messages and maintaining friendships was not the main motivation for posting status updates, people felt more connect when they read or posted more intimate messages. However, entertainment also played a major role: People felt more connected with their friends when they read entertaining messages.",Self Disclosure in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Based on survey data (N=150) of adult Facebook users, we examine how this group of users respond and react to face-threatening content about them that was posted by others on Facebook. To describe these behaviors of interest, we introduce the term “impression curation” to refer to the reactive management of content about oneself posted by others on social network sites such as Facebook. We examine four impression curation strategies, and draw on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to make some preliminary inferences about how and why these users chose to respond to such content in particular ways. We found that impression curation is a complex process requiring attention to both individuals’ self-presentation and interpersonal goals.",Threats Responses on Social Media,Communication and Technology

The inaction of bystanders can augment the deleterious effects of bullying on a victim. However, bystanders can often take action to stop a cyberbullying incident or offer support to the victim. The present study examined several variables which were expected to influence the propensity for a bystander to take action in cyberbullying incidents – the number of bystanders, the anonymity of the bystander, and the closeness between the bystander and the victim. Results supported the diffusion of responsibility effect. A higher number of bystanders was negatively associated with bystander intervention. Moreover, the perceived anonymity of bystanders negatively related to propensity to intervene, and closeness with the victim was associated with a higher likelihood to intervene and support the victim. Altogether, the results shed light on the interplay of context, relationships, and technology in the behavior of bystanders to a cyberbullying episode.",Threats Responses on Social Media,Communication and Technology

In their actions they can choose between different communication modes: private (one-to-one) or public communication (which occurs in front of an audience). Elaborating on the data of a previous experimental scenario study with 453 [regional origin deleted] thirteen- to fourteen-year-olds, we tested whether contextual factors of a harassing incident on SNS (incident severity, identity and behaviour of other bystanders) and bystanders’ gender influenced bystanders’ behavioural intentions to help the victim and reinforce the bully in private or in public. The results showed that, in general, bystanders had higher private than public behavioural intentions. While the identity and behaviour of other bystanders influenced behavioural intentions to help the victim in private or in public, incident severity and bystanders’ gender affected behavioural intentions to reinforce the bully in private or in public.",Threats Responses on Social Media,Communication and Technology

Findings showed that the three-way interaction among commenting behavior, virality, and arousal level was significant in affecting civic behavioral intentions (CBI). Additionally, viral behavioral intentions (VBI) were the strongest predictors of CBI, with degrees that varied as a function of commenting behavior, virality, arousal level, and the interactions among them.

2014-0328,2014,Paper Session,Plug Away: Disclosure of Material Connections in Social Media Channels,1,"Abstract
Plug away: disclosure of material connections in social media channels

As eyeballs have moved online, advertisers have struggled to find effective ways to communicate their messages. Some have found it effective to influence bloggers or celebrities through paid posts or free products, trips or other considerations. The Federal Trade Commission regulates these messages as commercial speech and has required that these material connections be disclosed to readers. But few do, and those who do may not disclose in ways that effectively communicate these relationships.

This study explores the issue of disclosure in the context of all digital advertising, then uses unobtrusive analysis to examine disclosure in two areas online: in the top style blogs and in the Twitter feeds of three popular celebrities. The study finds that these platforms are often used for commercial speech, but material connections are seldom disclosed.",Audience and Advertising in Social Media,Mass Communication

We claim that the temporality underlying different factors shapes bursts of public attention. Measuring bursts with the peak fraction for the diffusion of YouTube videos, the results demonstrate that the burst is negatively related to popularity, search, and social influence, but is positively related to system recommendations.

Types of Narrativity in News, Narrative Engagement, and Learning Effects",4,"The concept of narrativity serves as a framework to identify possible textual factors that enhance narrative engagement and learning processes in narrative news. Narrativity indicates the richness of a story and the quality, which makes it a good and interesting story. It avoids the dichotomy of narrative versus non-narrative. In the study, we test three types of narrativity factors (related to character interaction, narrative structure and narrative discourse) against a non-narrative condition. In an experiment using a cross-sectional sample (n=312) we found that the structure version was superior for fact learning than the other two narrative versions, and comparable to the non-narrative news report. All narrative versions enhanced the perception of the experiential quality of the text, while the non-narrative version enhanced the perception of the information quality.

The current study extends this work by testing whether the tendency of readers to assimilate, or identify with, narrative groups mediates this relationship (Gabriel & Young, 2011). A study assessed the salience of ingroup concerns and randomly assigned participants (N = 292) to read a passage from a popular novel featuring one of three groups. After narrative exposure, narrative group assimilation and transportation were measured. In line with Grizzard and Eden (2013), ingroup salience was a significant predictor of transportation across all three narratives.

Particularly, the primary impediments to achieving these goals in any interaction between students and vulnerable peoples and communities are inherent in (1) the belief that experience is sufficient both to evaluate community impact and to promote learning, (2) the assumption that service always has positive results, and (3) the concept of service itself. The charge to critically reconceive international service learning may result in something new and positive because the changes required to do this are so fundamental that it could constitute a paradigm shift with an outcome entirely different than current frameworks for ISL.",The Challenge of Finding the Good Life: Retention and Learning Both In and Out of the Classroom,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Under the purview of experiential learning, liberating structures (LS) are microstructures, that are easily adaptable and constructivist in nature. The purpose of the study was to find out what happens in a classroom where the professor purposely employs liberating structures, especially focusing on communication patterns that emerge in these settings. Classes were selected purposefully where liberating structures as a participatory method were applied. This qualitative study utilized ethnography, auto ethnography, participant observations and in depth interviews with LS practitioners to collect data.

Previous research has acknowledged many demographic and academic preparedness factors as influential on college student performance and retention. Framed by face threat and face support theoretical concepts, this exploratory, mixed methods, and longitudinal study focused on familial communication as a primary factor in college student performance and retention. Qualitatively, students who chose to leave the university up to two years after initial enrollment and who performed poorly as indicated by GPA for up to two years reported receiving significantly more face threats from both family and at college, and reported receiving less face support from both sources. Implications of the study suggest that 1) a reduction in the disconnect between messages from family and the college and 2) face awareness and sensitivity training for family and college faculty may be a necessary step in easing the transition for college students during the critical first year and up to two years later.",The Challenge of Finding the Good Life: Retention and Learning Both In and Out of the Classroom,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Drawing from the literature on interpersonal communication and social support, this research project compares and contrasts how the quality and quantity of supportive messages for targets of racial discrimination differs in face-to-face (FtF) and computer-mediated (CM) contexts. Study 1 examines the exchange of supportive communication in face-to-face settings, and Study 2 investigates support messages on an online forum.

2014-0341,2014,Paper Session,How Sports Fans Forge Intergroup Polarization Through Language: The Case of Verbal Irony,4,"In intergroup situations, people strategically use language to strengthen group identity and foster intergroup competition. Two communicational patterns are distinguished to accomplish this: (1) aggressively derogating out-group members and (2) mitigating expectancy-violation situations (i.e., negative in-group/positive out-group behavior).
We conduct two experiments comparing and contrasting both theories in an intergroup-sports context. We focus on verbal-irony use, because previous research shows that irony can be used to both increase and mitigate criticism.
Experiment 1 focuses on speaker behavior and shows that in-group members find irony most appropriate to derogate out-group members, regardless of the situation. This supports the irony-as-aggressiveness hypothesis.
Experiment 2 focuses on inferences by neutral observers. Results demonstrate that ironic comments on competent behavior increase criticism, but ironic comments on incompetent behavior mitigate criticism. This supports the irony-as-expectancy-violation hypothesis.
In sum, both experiments demonstrate a communication asymmetry between speaker behavior and addressee inferences. Implications for intergroup communication are discussed.",Intergroup or Alcohol (but Not Intergroup With Alcohol),Interpersonal Communication

The Effects of Mortality Salience and Similarity on the Desire to Date In-Group vs. Out-Group Members in an Online Dating Context,4,"Online dating has become an important resource for building romantic relationships. Thereby attitudinal similarities and group-membership have been found to be just as important for online as for offline dating. Research on terror management theory has shown that both similarity and group-membership play a key role in managing existential threats, indicating difficulties for either dissimilar or intergroup couples. Yet, no study—so far—has investigated both factors simultaneously after mortality salience (MS).
The current study examined this question by presenting German participants (N=249) with a bogus dating-app that randomly assigned them to a MS or a control condition. Afterwards a candidate following a 2(In- vs. Out-group member) × 2(Similar vs. Dissimilar) design was suggested. Results confirmed the expected three-way interaction.

In so doing, we also seek to better understand why underaccommodation is consistently evaluated more negatively than overaccommodation, which previous studies have suggested may be a result of inferred motive. We found that under some circumstances, perceived accommodation mediated the relationship between perceived motive and evaluative responses to nonaccommodation, suggesting that inferences about motive may actually be a lens through which perceived accommodation is determined. Results also indicate that the consistent differences in evaluations of over- versus underaccommodation are not a result of recipients’ inferences about speakers’ motives.

Framed by the theoretical lens of facework (Cupach & Metts, 1994; Goffman, 1967), semi-structured, in-depth interviews of 29 non-drinking professionals revealed that non-drinking is a deviant act that can be face threatening for both non-drinkers and drinkers. Consequently, non-drinkers deployed a variety of preventive and corrective facework strategies (including passing and humor) to mitigate and remediate positive and negative face threat.

The present study explores occasions in which people seek out close others to drink with to obtain social support. Specifically, this study examines concrete aspects of support drinking such as whom is more likely to initiate support drinking occasions, expectations for support drinking occasions, and consequences. The motivational model for alcohol use, alcohol expectancy theory and interdependent/independent self-construal were applied to generate meaningful outcomes of this study. Participants (N = 193, mean age = 26; 59% were female) completed an on-line survey. The most prevalent reason for support drinking occasions was feeling stressed or depressed. Interdependence-orientated self-construal was a consistent positive predictor of support drinking behavior (e.g., initiating support drinking, amount of alcohol consumed, and problematic consequences).

2014-0346,2014,Paper Session,Comparing News Work to Care Work: A Different Lens on Journalistic Labour,1,"This paper advances two fairly recent discourses in media and communication studies. First, many scholars are now addressing a historic blind spot in our field by researching labour, and more recently, labour resistance, both in the media and cultural industries and in service work more generally. Second, there is a recent turn to notions of flourishing, care, and well-being among communication scholars. This year’s conference theme “Communication and the Good Life” articulates this interest which goes beyond traditional conceptualizations of media ethics. However, both lines of research lack an in-depth engagement with working conditions and well-being among journalists. Interlacing both discourses while addressing their shortcomings, this paper compares news work to care work and the media sector to the health sector. This articulates unexpected structural similarities regarding worker motivation, interactivity, ethical underpinnings of practice, and policy attention - while cultivating a view of society that avoids media-centrism.",The Press’ Labor of Listening and its (Neoliberal) Freedom,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Many have noted the enduring importance of a 19th century liberal imaginary – the myth of the press as a “free marketplace of ideas” – to the hegemonic discourse of press freedom. I ask: how might we understand contemporary claims about the neoliberalization of press freedom as a point of departure? My answer takes different routes, supplementing political economy analyses of “actually existing neoliberalism” with an examination of how freedom is conceived in the work of Hayek and Friedman. Focusing on the antagonisms generated after the November 2012 publication of the Leveson report, I end with a brief illustrative analysis of how neoliberal logics textured criticisms of the report’s proposal for a new legislatively-supported system of “independent self-regulation”.",The Press’ Labor of Listening and its (Neoliberal) Freedom,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

As expected, White respondents’ own personal value orientations most closely matched the assessments of mainstream American values, and greater racial identity (from a Cultural Identity perspective) corresponded to an even closer match. A variety of media consumption measures correlated with personal/mainstream American values congruence, with greater media exposure predicting higher congruence, but most relationships were eclipsed when controlling for demographics, race, and racial identity. Predictors that maintained under controls included music TV and sports programming exposure, pointing to the potential importance of such particular media forms in the process of value-based cultural assimilation and reinforcement.","News Media, Advertising, and Diversity",Ethnicity and Race in Communication
2014-0354,2014,Paper Session,News Making as Identity Work: How Religion and Race Compete in the American-Muslim Press,1,"This paper explores the diversity within the American-Muslim community by looking at how two publications that are avowedly “Muslim” but have different racial affiliations—one “indigenous/black” and the other “immigrant/Arab”—frame events that have both religious and racial relevance. It develops two interrelated ideas. First, news organizations “perform” their identities in the way they frame news. Second, identity is not simply an individual level but also an organizational level of influence on news making. Comparative frame analysis reveals identity construction, even at the organizational level, is highly context-sensitive. Muslim Journal and Islamic Horizons frame news similarly when their common religious identity is activated, but their framing diverges when their differing racial identities become more salient. Racial identities also color how American-Muslims construct and relate to “America.” The news media, this paper shows, are thus a site of collective meaning-making, where multiple identities constantly compete for salience in a community’s imagination.","News Media, Advertising, and Diversity",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

It examines SVT’s and SR’s cultural diversity policy documents and how they are interpreted and put in practice at a managerial level in the two companies. The study is based on policy documents and interviews with eight managers responsible of formulating and/or implementing the companies’ diversity policies and plans. In addition the paper provides a presentation of the historical background to the current policies.
The analysis of the interviews indicates discrepancies between the principles and practices of cultural diversity policies. In the concluding section of the paper, I call attention to the companies’ focus on bringing diversity into the newsrooms through recruiting journalists with migrant backgrounds, with an intention of securing market shares. I argue that this market logic is potentially threatening to the companies’ cultural diversity, making it a vulnerable value.","News Media, Advertising, and Diversity",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

However, little still is known about the approaches used by newsrooms in Spanish-language media in the United States. This study shows the nature and content of environmental news and the models used by decision makers in Spanish-language newsrooms regarding content and editorial decisions. This study is based on a content analysis of environmental news in Latino media, and on data collected through interviews with senior newsroom staff and reporters who have experience in covering environmental affairs at major US Spanish-language television stations. Findings demonstrate the effect of revenue streams, the perception that environmental news is not important, and the perception that environmental coverage lacks immediacy and impact.

To test the generalized mere exposure effect this study examined the influence of exposure to women with dark or light skin, on perceptions of target female attractiveness in media images. The current study tested the hypotheses that exposure to Dark ethnic-female models in advertisements would increase attractiveness and favorability ratings of subsequent Dark models (Dark/Dark), but decrease ratings for Light models (Dark/Light). Conversely, exposure to Light ethnic-female models in advertisements would increase attractiveness and favorability ratings of subsequent Light models (Light/Light), but decrease ratings for Dark models (Light/Dark). The results of the study were consistent with one of the hypotheses. The Dark models received significantly higher scores for attractiveness than the Light models, when initially exposed to Dark ethnic-female models.","News Media, Advertising, and Diversity",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

The paper analyses two types of claims: as a provider of images of history in the making; and as a kind of prototype, a forerunner of a new era. Looking at the production and organization of the broadcast of Yuri Gagarin’s return to Moscow in April 1961, the paper argues that historiography is often too bound up in the present and remains blind to perspectives falling outside the dominant narratives of the current. The claims of being forerunners fit poorly with later historical events and are perhaps nothing more than a ruin of an anticipated future.

Using historical documents and interviews, this study interrogates how the cultural cold war, Americanization, and production practices influenced how the anti-communist propaganda mandate was articulated in radio melodramas. The Cold War use of radio in the post-Korean War era resulted in radio melodramas in which the original propagandist purpose was sublimated in favor of “vulgar” content. This sublimation can be seen as the result of historical contingencies within radio-drama production (e.g., a writer shortage, technological limitations, film-industry relations, and commercial motivations). Nonetheless, due to the extensive Americanization of radio writers and cultural cold war efforts by the U.S., the genre of “vulgar” radio melodrama effectively supported the purposes of anti-communist propaganda by enshrining “the American Way of Life.”",Disciplinary Explorations,Communication History

It demonstrates that, despite the centrality of the “Empire” in the regime’s discourse, investments in shortwave broadcasting remained very low throughout the years. Not only was the Portuguese state broadcaster not given the resources to achieve a good coverage of the African territories, but there was also no national policy concerning the creation of stations in the colonies.

We conducted a web-based survey (N=151) with standardized pictures of 40 robots which were evaluated. A cluster analysis revealed six clusters of robots. We were able to identify different groups of robots which were rated significantly different on six dimensions. Interestingly, in two clusters robots were rated both low in human-likeness and low in “mechanical” indicating that in future research these adjectives should be used separately. The robots in those clusters with a high mean concerning “Threatening” are almost all bi-pedal robots. In contrast to the humanoid robots (cluster 5), the android robots (cluster 3&4) were rated higher on “Familiarity”, and on “Likability” although all three clusters (3,4,&5) were rated as “Threatening” which contrasts the uncanny valley hypothesis. Moreover, the data in this study could not be explained by a cubic function as would be suggested by the graph proposed by Mori, but rather by linear or quadratic relationships.",Human <~> Machine Communication,Communication and Technology

Considering the social characteristics of the voice control and virtual agent in a TV interface, we predicted that the voice control increase social evaluation and induce positive overall viewing experience when the virtual agent is also humanlike. In a 2 (input modality: voice control vs. remote control) X 2 (agent type: realistic vs. cartoonlike agent) between-subjects experiment, 64 participants interacted with a smart TV. The results showed negative effects of the voice control, especially when it accompanied a cartoonlike agent. Those who used the voice control to the cartoonlike agent rated the agent less humanlike, attractive, intimate, and intelligent than did those who used remote control to the cartoonlike agent. Also, those who used voice control reported that watching the TV was less involving and enjoyable than those who used remote control. The negative effects were mitigated, however, when they interacted with a realistic agent. These results suggest the importance of the matching between input modality and visual interface to reduce negative effects caused by using the voice control.",Human <~> Machine Communication,Communication and Technology

Results support the notion that communication on the road follows patterns found in computer-mediated environments. Specifically, a survey-based study of 123 college-age drivers found that social closeness with other drivers was associated with less aggressive driving, more communication comfort, greater communication of identity through the car, and less treatment of the car as a social entity. Overall, this research suggests that theories of computer-mediated communication can be successfully applied to understanding communication in the mediated context of the road. In doing so, such research has the potential to guide the development of near-future social-mobility services in ways that improve safety on the road.",Human <~> Machine Communication,Communication and Technology

Following previous work, one approach to understand the mechanism responsible for CASA is to utilize computer agents and have the agents attempt to gain compliance from human partners. The current study focuses on three key factors frequently cited to influence traditional notions of compliance: normative influence (e.g., reciprocity), evaluations toward the source (e.g., competence and warmth), and affective influence (e.g., mood). Structural equation modeling tested a path model to assess the effects of these factors on human compliance to computer request. The final model suggested that normative influence (e.g., receiving help from a computer agent) increased the likelihood of compliance. On the other hand, evaluations toward the computer agent, specifically perceived competence and warmth, did not significantly influence compliance. The discussion includes implications for practitioners and directions for future research.",Human <~> Machine Communication,Communication and Technology

College students are a sexually active population, especially when frequent alcohol and drug use at social events is in the mix. Many college students are at risk for the HIV virus, when they don’t take precautions to protect themselves. This focus group study explored college students’ perceptions, emotions and motivations associated with HIV testing. It also examined the effectiveness of both online and offline communication channels in facilitating college students’ HIV-testing compliance. Results show that students felt “invincible” about getting HIV and fearful toward HIV testing at the same time. They are nevertheless interested in receiving an HIV test, if there is adequate social and emotional support to help them overcome the perceived social stigma associated with the test. Students are also receptive toward the use of both offline and online communication channels by health professionals to deliver information and consultation to them about their sexual health and HIV testing.",HIV Message Framing and Risk Perceptions,Health Communication

But are these frames predominant in scholarly circles also recognized by people in the broader society? This study answers this question using photographs. It also scrutinizes if visual images of these four frames depict different emotions, and elicit emotions, empathy and character trait evaluations from viewers. Thought listing and an experiment show that the four frames do belong to the visual repertoire of the participants, but that they do not define the deviant frame in the same way that researchers do. We recommend revision of this frame in order to correspond with public perceptions.

In a sample of at-risk young adults (N = 386), we investigated three potential motivational barriers that might affect the likelihood of retention. Perceived pressure, perceived efficacy and fear and anxiety during the initial session were measured, along with demographic characteristics, partner characteristics, and HIV-related health knowledge. Logistic regression demonstrated that (1) in general, perceived ineffectiveness was negatively associated with retention; (2) perceived pressure or coercion was negatively associated with retention, but only for younger clients; (3) experienced fear and anxiety had no significant association with retention.

2014-0369,2014,Paper Session,Sensation Seeking as a Moderator of Gain- and Loss-Framed HIV-Test Promotion Message Effects,2,"This study tests whether fit between sensation seeking disposition and message frame enhances the persuasiveness of gain- and loss-framed HIV test promotion messages. Sensation seeking is an indication of individual orientation toward engaging in risky behaviors associated with a need for arousal. High sensation seekers prefer high levels of arousal and are willing to engage in risky behaviors to meet that need. According to prospect theory, in the context of potential losses, people are risk seeking in their behavioral preferences. When considering gains, people are risk averse. We argue that gain- and loss- framed messages may be consistent with low and high sensation seekers disposition with respect to behavior. We hypothesize that the effects of gain- and loss-framed messages are contingent on individual sensation seeking tendencies. A loss-frame should be more persuasive for high sensation seekers because they are risk seeking. A gain-framed message should be more effective for low sensation seekers. We also expect elaboration to mediate the interaction. Hypotheses were tested using a single factor experimental study in which women (N = 1052) were randomly assigned to receive gain- or loss-framed HIV test promotion messages. Results demonstrate a significant interaction between frame and sensation seeking in the hypothesized directions, but the mediation hypothesis was not supported. This evidence supports the thesis that when the frame highlighted in the message fits with the viewer’s way of thinking, the persuasive power of the message is enhanced. Practical implications for audience segmentation, targeting and message design are discussed.",HIV Message Framing and Risk Perceptions,Health Communication

I seek to enhance the repertoire of knowledge in the available communication scholarship by exploring Chinese Malaysians’ conception of the self through their discourse about the Chinese identity in Malaysia.

By soliciting meta-discourse/ meta-talk (Craig, 2008) in focus group discussions about Chinese “citizen and official interaction” in public confrontation as evidenced in a popular online video, we focus on cultural terms for talk that are active in Chinese participants’ discussions so as to decode the social-cultural meanings of talk in relation to communicative conduct in contemporary China. These cultural terms for talk are essential (at a meta-discursive level) not only for understanding the communicative practice in a given cultural context (Carbaugh, Berry and Nurmikari-Berry, 2006), but also for theoretical reflections upon conceptualizations of “talk” in communication theory. Grounded in this case study, findings about cultural terms for talk could potentially reveal some nuances in understanding harmony in Chinese communication, such as invoking harmony in social interactions for the very purpose of dismissing or disagreeing with others.","Ethnographic and Narrative Perspectives on Identity and Culture in Chinese, French, and Bulgarian Interactions",Language & Social Interaction
2014-0372,2014,Paper Session,Narrative and Cultural Identities: Performing and Aligning With Figures of Personhood,1,"This paper analyzes how people perform, and evaluate recognizable “cultural identities” in storytelling interactions. When people tell stories, they do not simply reflect their cultural identities as static, monolithic entities, describable by single demographic labels. I draw from Goffman’s notion of footing (1979) and Bakhtin’s notion of heteroglossia (1981), to treat “cultural identities” in narrative as multivoiced productions. This multivoicedness results from participants’ co-ordinated presentations, evaluations, and enactments of multiple images of selves and others, situated in the immediate interaction, and in the story as locally recognizable characters . I draw from scholarship that treats such images as figures of personhood (Agha 2006) . “Cultural identities” in narrative therefore emerge through participants’ recognition of, performance of, and alignments toward recurrent figures. I then analyze how Luso-descendants, daughters of Portuguese migrants raised in France, perform and comment upon dialogues between locally recognized figures of personhood in stories told to each other.","Ethnographic and Narrative Perspectives on Identity and Culture in Chinese, French, and Bulgarian Interactions",Language & Social Interaction

Our analysis of news coverage of abortion, energy, taxes, and Iraq from 1975-2008 demonstrates that consistently high levels of elite partisan framing competition between the two major parties decreases the likelihood of journalists acting as their own source when reporting issue frames, even when controlling for economic factors and public opinion. When journalists do frame issues on their own, they generally adopt a party’s preferred frame for owned issues and apply game frames as Election Day draws near. We situate our findings in terms of the scholarship examining the media’s role as a political institution, concluding that Cook’s (1998) perspective, focusing on the role of political parties as exemplars of the media’s institutional behavior, is the most comprehensive framework.",Reconsidering the Role of News in Democratic Governance,Journalism Studies

While the resources of many local news organisations are declining, local authorities are being encouraged to engage the public in democracy to a greater extent, and to harness the transformative potential of digital media to achieve this. Local journalists are no longer the only source of news for citizens, and face competition from hyper local new sites, local blogs, and increased levels of direct communication from Councils. Using Leeds City Council as a case study this paper comparatively analyses the changing role of local journalism in the public communications and engagement strategies of local government. Drawing on over twenty semi structured interviews with elected politicians, Council strategists, mainstream journalists, and citizen journalists the paper explores perceptions of the mainstream news media’s role vs. new modes of communication in engaging and communicating with citizens.

The present research also investigates how new media outlets based on podcast technology serve the public who has been alienated from mainstream media. To these ends, this paper particularly draws on Bakhtin’s “political carnvalism,” which can be defined as a combination of festivity and resistance. Carnival allows people to create an open public sphere where free expression of non-legitimate voices can resist and even mock the dominant power.

Public space continues to play a significant, and so far understudied, role in the ongoing Arab rebellions. Public space is important for understanding communication in revolutionary times because of the complex ways in which public space articulates communicative practices. The main four domains of the taxonomy consider public space as an arena of collective communication, as a canvass for political expression, as a field of embodied action, and as a potent rallying symbol.

2014-0380,2014,Paper Session,"Controlling Squares, Reclaiming Space: “Revolutions” and Communication in Beirut and Egypt",1,"“Revolutions” in Beirut (2005) and Cairo (2011) are examined through the lens of place, space and media. After recounting narratives of “revolutions,” public squares are analyzed as communication platforms, as arenas for contentious socio-political forces and as places of consumption practices. These are manifestations of a critical shift in our understanding of space and place as loci of communicative acts in which meanings are established through the cumulative flow between alternative and mainstream media. After identifying similarities and differences, this paper concludes by acknowledging how public space and place contribute to shifts in the nature and boundaries of social and political agency.","Middle East and North African (MENA) Media and Public Communications After the ""Arab Spring""",Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0381,2014,Paper Session,Islamism to Post-Islamism: The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s Challenge of Marrying an Islamic Ethos With Democratic Ideals,1,"This essay offers an ideological analysis of the discourse of the Islamist Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB) in its official English-language website, Ikhwanweb.com, between 2005 and 2010—years preceding the Egyptian uprising of January 2011. The purpose was to examine the ideology manifest in the rhetoric and uncover the instrumental function the rhetoric serves. Analysis portrayed a qualitative shift in the Egyptian MB ideology—Islamism to post-Islamism. The rhetoric, through dialectical tensions, manifested the incertitude and flux associated with this shift. The shift and flux were evident in the MB’s maneuvers and discourses during its political centrality in Egypt post-Mubarak. The instrumentality of the rhetoric lay in challenging Western societies’ monolithic understanding of Islamism—undemocratic and radical—and criticizing Western agents’ support of dictatorial regimes in the Arab world, thereby shedding light on the hypocrisy of the discourse of democracy promotion in Arab, Muslim societies.

As a result, scholars report that it is difficult to locate the audience or study it empirically. Moving beyond the idea that audiences are ‘untraceable’, this paper analyzes the viewership patterns of forty-five young viewers of global television drama in Morocco and ‘maps’ their mental trajectories after global media exposure. Through the use of qualitative interview data and visualizations based on cartograms (distorted maps), which reflect what particular countries are placed on the viewers’ ‘mental map’ through media flows, and what places of the world seem most attractive to them, I show how different audiences make different choices of programming and mentally emigrate to different places based on them.","Middle East and North African (MENA) Media and Public Communications After the ""Arab Spring""",Global Communication and Social Change

Therefore, this project investigates how media consumers negotiate Orientalist depictions of Iraqis specifically and Muslims, Arabs and Middle Easterners in general. This qualitative analysis of focus group discussions between American college students at a large urban university sheds light on how media visuals shape consumers’ perceptions about these groups. Understanding if and how Orientalist stereotypes are transmitted to audiences is an essential first step in trying to eliminate them from photography and from U.S. society.","Middle East and North African (MENA) Media and Public Communications After the ""Arab Spring""",Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0384,2014,Paper Session,The Push to Popularize Politics: Comparing Public Affairs Coverage in Six News Systems Since the 1960s,2,"A systematic content analysis (including cross-national, cross-temporal, and cross-organizational comparisons) of 6137 political news stories from national, regional and weekly newspapers examines tendencies to popularize political news reporting in U.S. American, British, German, Swiss, French and Italian newspapers between the 1960s and 2000s. The study investigates three key indicators (sensationalization, scandalization, emotionalization) and stipulates that differences in the use of these practices are driven by five factors (commercialism, tabloid tradition, communication cultures, professional autonomy, type of medium). Even though sensationalized, scandalized and emotionalized presentation patterns have increased in most of the news systems and organizational types, differences in intensity can be related to these drivers, and they have so far prevented a transnational homogenization of news practices. Conclusions to be drawn from this study point to the continued relevance of system and organization level factors for explaining Western reporting styles.",What's Changed?

The Mediatization of UK Television News 1991-2012,1,"This study carries out a longitudinal content analysis of UK early evening news bulletins between 1991 and 2012 (N=2040) in order to systematically examine whether they have adapted their format for the rolling news age with more live and instant editorial conventions. Drawing on the concepts of mediatization and journalistic interventionism to interpret editorial changes, our findings broadly indicate that the media logic shaping bulletins has changed from reflecting the “day’s news” to covering more “news as it happens” (as news channels now claim). We found an increasing reliance on less pre- scripted material, greater emphasis on live reporting from journalists (rather than external sources) who were routinely asked to instantly react, update and interpret news, particularly in the world of politics. By way of conclusion, we suggest this represents a mediatization of television news bulletins, with broadcasters increasingly subscribing to a journalistic logic associated with 24-hour news values.",What's Changed?

Instead, changes in content are assumed or illustrated anecdotally rather than systematically assessed. This empirical study, covering Swedish and UK news sites with a tabloid, quality morning, and local/regional background between 2002-2012, shows that there is a tabloidization effect in general but that it is stronger in tabloids and in Sweden compared to the UK. Further, this tabloidization can be more precisely described as a lifestylization and de-politization process as it is in these areas where the biggest growth and decline are. In addition, the study reveals that it is the slower news that increases most suggesting that the immediate character of online news is mediated by production conditions.",What's Changed?

2014-0388,2014,Paper Session,#HurricanePreparedness: Emergency Response Recommendations in 140 Characters or Less,1,"Hurricane Sandy was one of the most expensive and deadliest U.S. natural disasters in recent memory. While weather organizations disseminated emergency preparation information to US citizens through multiple means (e.g., television, radio, online social networks, etc.), many vulnerable populations did not adhere to these evacuation and/or preparation mandates. Specifically, 40 of the 117 deaths attributed to Hurricane Sandy were caused by drowning (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). 40% of these deaths occurred in homes that were designated as the primary evacuation zone. Thus, many of these deaths could have been prevented if residents had advanced warning and adhered to evacuation recommendations disseminated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As a result, the present investigation seeks to gain greater insight into the content of, and message strategies used, by different types of national weather organizations when disseminating emergency preparedness information via social media.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

In this paper I develop a lens on communicative organizing practices to bridge these two schools of thought, which highlights the duality of action and meaning. I do so by “fleshing out” Yates & Orlikowski’s (1992) genre approach with Goffman’s (1963) work on social interaction. The situational view of genre developed here reveals how – through cooperatively performing a recognizable script of bracketing behaviors – co-present actors jointly frame their focused interaction and interpretation of meaning.

Scholars and practice alike acknowledge that participation processes require enhanced communication between employees (Stohl & Cheney, 2001). In this paper, we explore the use of an interactive video website for communicating about change. The senior managers’ aim with this website is that it should encourage enhanced communication and in turn facilitate employees’ participation in a change process. This study emanates from the contentions that organizing occurs in conversation and that organization emerges in communication (Taylor, 1999; Weick, 1979). The work is informed by the communicative constitution of organization (CCO) approach and we apply mixed methods (observations, surveys, focus groups and interviews). The results disclose little communication and low overall employee participation. Reasons for why the initiative did not meet expectations are discussed.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

This study proposes that the militarization metaphor constrains firefighter’s possibilities for action, directing them to activities that involve ""fighting"" fire, and limiting their ability to draw from a wider variety of actions, including declining assignments. Data include government documents (e.g., safety checklists, operations manuals, accident investigations) and firefighter discourse drawn from 38 individual interviews. Initial findings reveal that firefighters feel an obligation to act even when situations are too dangerous. Further, the option to decline assignments is not considered to be desirable or realistic. Recommendations include changing the occupational language of wildland fire so that activities can become less about “fighting” fire and more about “managing” it.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

It illustrate this through a case study with HTA – a first mover IT organization, by examining why and how HTA adopted green IT as a semi business strategy by responding to both the sustainability movement and the emerging green IT industry need. The research discovered a unique story of green IT strategy formation at HTA. Its strategy formation resembles a social movement-like mobilization process, which emphasizes grassroots pattern of organizing and the role of personal values and involvement. Understanding strategy development of green IT as a semi social movement process provides us a wider lens to understand the fuller picture of postmodern business movement such as green IT and organizational development.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

This study examines the brand equity of two western public diplomacy actors in Egypt, one is aid-oriented while the other is culture-oriented. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted to understand (a) the differences between the consumer-based brand equity of the British Council and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Egypt (b) the main sources of such brand equity and (c) the brand associations that each of these two different types of organizations generate. The country-of-origin effect (COO) served as the framework for understanding the main sources of brand equity of the two actors.

This paper will advocate that collective labor should be placed as the central paradigm for web communication. Utilizing the theories advocated by Soviet scholar Aleksandr Bogdanov, historical analysis of the Internet, as well as US and Soviet cybernetics, and a case study of an illicit international organization which utilizes collective labor to preserve one of the world’s largest collection of pirated books, this paper aims to showcase how the actions of the whole, over the desires of the individual, are an organizing principle of web activity.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0396,2014,Paper Session,Cultural Intelligence and International Business Ventures Success: A Framework at Organizational-Level,1,"Most current studies emphasize individuals’ capacity and construct cultural intelligence at individual level, while little attention has been devoted to study organizational-level cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence goes beyond micro-level and is also an important capacity for global teams, multinational corporations to successfully cross cultural boundaries and perform in cultural diverse environment and international ventures.
In this research, organizational-level cultural intelligence is discussed as a form of organizational intelligence necessary to perceive, interpret and adapt to new cultural context, generating new knowledge and functioning effectively in diverse cultural context. Drawing on Early and Ang’s (2003) micro-level conceptualization of cultural intelligence and St. Gallen management framework, this study develops a three dimensional framework of organizational-level cultural intelligence in the context of international business ventures, from a knowledge-based perspective. The implications for this model are discussed.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

My analysis revolves around a central orienting question: How is participation in collective action to contest the meaning of homelessness in the public sphere impacted by formal organizationally sponsored digital resources and emergent network dynamics? Drawing on affordance theory (Gibson, 1977; Norman, 1998), I suggest that communication-oriented collective action in the public sphere is structured by organizational, technological and linguistic affordances. I argue that political organizing is often focused around issues, and participants in collective action experience opportunities and constraints within the issue spaces where they intercede. Three aspects of communication-oriented collective action are explored by employing network analysis methods in measuring hyperlinking patterns, discursive prosody, and semantic similarity profiles within each campaign’s issue space. Implications for research on emergent organizations, technology as organization and discourse in organizational contexts are discussed.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

2014-0399,2014,Paper Session,Emotional Experience in the Organization Socialization: Thinking Beyond Information Seeking,2,"To date, most literature about organization socialization has focused on employees’ attempt for uncertainty reduction through information-seeking in the socialization process. However, employees’ emotional experience, as well as the possible emotional support from supervisors and co-workers during socialization have not received sufficient attention. Although workplace emotionality is traditionally discouraged by occupational expectations, we need to acknowledge that emotions pervade in organizational life, particularly during the entry phase in which the combination of excitement, upset, and frustration may occur. Thus, the biased focus on the “rational” side of organization socialization—such as information seeking for uncertainty reduction—is not sufficient to study this complicated and rich process. With the purpose of expanding the current socialization literature, this project attempts to combine employees’ emotion with their communication behaviors to reduce uncertainty during socialization.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

Scientific research communities, unlike typical organizational settings, communicate primarily through platforms, such as research symposiums and publications of various forms. From an organizational point of view, the value of organizational outputs is judged based on the discovery and evaluation of new knowledge that are produced and evaluated by those within the community. There is evidence that the unique processes and concepts by which epistemic communicates operate are not sufficiently understood from an organizational point of view. In attempting to fill this gap in research, this study articulates and tests variation-selection-retention mechanisms that operate within an epistemic population of articles submitted for journal publications. Looking specifically at the evolution of mobiles for development research, this study looks at research articles submitted to an interdisciplinary journal in the information and communication technology for development arena.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

This study asks: How do individuals make sense of organizational changes occurring in response to technological disruption? How do views on organizational competition correspond with organizational identity discourse? And, how do perceived interorganizational competitor networks differ among public media organizations, and among people in similar roles across different organizations? Theories of sensemaking, organizational identity and legitimacy are used, and interviews have been conducted with 75 people from 14 organizations. Respondents used identity frameworks to make sense of organizational changes. The way individuals perceived competitors encapsulated the connection between organizational identity and change. Social network analysis of perceived competitor networks showed that people in similar departments across organizations had similar networks, but there was divergence among these role-based groups.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

Data is organized in three broad categories: 1) context and circumstances; 2) content and form; and 3) social aspects and analysed for their ability to facilitate a collaborative relation between insider and newcomer. A turning point analysis was used to catch those socialization behaviors that significantly impact on the newcomers’ attitude as either collaborative or conflictual in their interaction with insiders. The analysis initially suggests that strong social ties between insider and newcomer have valuable socialization effects in terms of a collaborative behavior.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

Two network mechanisms are tested in this study. The first mechanism is homophily, which hypothesizes that information flow will be more likely to cluster around countries and regions. Users with similar traits will be also more likely to engage in conversation. The second mechanism is preferential attachment, which hypothesizes that some influential corporate, NGO, and public figure accounts will be more likely to become information hubs for advocacy networks. The hypotheses will be tested by analyzing Twitter data from an online advocacy campaign known as “Free Bassel”. SIENA will be used to estimate factors associated with tie formation and dissolution.

Indeed, increasingly we see in the literature calls for collaboration (Bratch, 2001) and community involvement (Ford & Yep, 2003) in preventive health efforts. However, as Backer and Rogers (1993) pointed out, little is known about the organizational aspects of health communication initiatives, and even less is known about the role of interorganizational relations in the development and application of health programs. Following a field network approach (Knoke & Kenis, 2002), this research studies interorganizational collaboration among 22 HIV/AIDS organizations in Santiago, Chile. Findings reveal that the network is not homophilous and that the organizations perceived as having greater technical capacity and access to at-risk populations are the most popular in the network. Organizations perceived as having more monetary resources are not central to the network.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

In addition, secondary data such as press releases and annual reports of the top three scoring banks based on our quantitative analysis will be examined with case study methodology in order to understand how they define and communicate their organization’s identity.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0415,2014,Paper Session,The ITU’s “Global Youth Summit” and Organizational Issues,1,"Abstract: In September, 2013, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), charged with finding ways to engage young people in international policy-making, held a “Global Youth Summit” in Costa Rica, with 500 participants and worldwide “hub” workshops. Keeping with the current United Nations (UN) agency directive to rethink “Beyond 2015”, the ITU focused on youth, ICTs and the social media, in both method (online connectivity) and content (how this combination might create a viable organizational process to target and achieve key global goals). However, organizational communications were disappointing and, from the perspective of many young participants, the Summit failed to achieve viable action plans. The research seeks to explore their key concerns and the internal process by which this effort stalled, in an effort to provide useful information for future international agency endeavors to inspire and earn the support of youth.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0416,2014,Paper Session,The Paranoid Organization,1,"This paper contributes to the on-going interest within organizational communication in how an organization’s identity and culture are influenced by its organizational image. The case study of an European Railway Service illustrates that extensive negative media attention damage the organizational image and identity resulting in a paranoid culture. Based on interviews with 10 ticket conductors, observations from management meetings, written internal communication material and press material the paper discuss the dilemmas, contradictions and possible benefits related to being a paranoid organization. The findings suggest that the organizational paranoia has benefit on a short-term basis, however it paralyzes the organization and prevent it from moving towards a more positive identity in the future.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0417,2014,Paper Session,The Phenomenology of Materiality in Organizations: How the Relationship With Equipment Affects Experience in Organizations,1,"In this paper, I propose that Heidegger’s (1962) description of equipmentality can enhance and clarify the role of the material in organizational communication theory, specifically whether humans ultimately have agency over non-humans (Aakhus et al., 2011; Cooren, 2012; Leonardi, 2011, 2012) and the role of material objects in communicatively constituting organizations (Ashcraft, Kuhn, & Cooren, 2009). Using the empirical example of a comparative study of bike commuters in the American Midwest and Copenhagen, Denmark, I argue that although the social (and organizational) world is constitutively entangled “all the way down” (Orlikowski & Scott, 2008), humans’ mundane interactions and relationships with materiality itself affect how they experience the world at a basic level. The nature of the relationship itself between humans and non-humans (ready-to-hand or present-at-hand) can change one’s experience of being-in the organizational world.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0418,2014,Paper Session,The Role of Organizational Communication in the Life and the Mission of the Society of St. Paul: An Empirical Research,1,"This doctoral thesis critically and scientifically analyses the Role of Organizational Communication in the Life and the Mission of the Society of St Paul (SSP) with an empirical research. Based on the empirical research and the findings, the paper also proposes a three-year Strategic Communication Planning to the SSP. The strategic communication planning, as the paper argues, translates the mission of the SSP into well-defined goals to be achieved in a given period of time and place.
The paper restrains the empirical research only to the Indian Province of SSP and the examination of documentary sources only to the years between 2006-2012.
The principal theoretical foundation of this scientific investigation is ‘Communication Constitutes Organization (Robert D. McPhee and Pamela Zaug, 2000)’. The thesis argues that the communication is constitutive of the community life and the mission of the Society of St Paul.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0419,2014,Paper Session,The Crisis and the Chaos: When Forgotten Stakeholders Self-Organize,1,"This case study of the 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota examines the poor handling of the small businesses in crisis by various levels of government through the lens of chaos theory. This case study builds on extant research that examines crisis from a chaos theory perspective by focusing specifically on two concepts from chaos theory, strange attractors and self-organization, in order to extend both our knowledge of crisis and chaos theory itself. Whereas self-organization is often viewed as a positive mechanism that “leaders crave” (Wheatley, 2007, p. 33), this study reconceptualizes self-organization more negatively by arguing that self-organization is better explained as a worst case scenario caused by power differentials. While Liska et al. (2012) argue that self-organization is “the ultimate response to crises” (p. 194, emphasis added), the analysis of the bridge collapse suggests that self-organization, imposed across various small organizations, is an unfortunate consequence of crisis.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

Recently, New Ways of Working (NWW) has been proposed as a new job design whereby employees have control over when en where they work, enabled by electronic communication. Studies on NWW components and their consequences revealed opposing findings, demonstrating that NWW offers advantages (e.g., efficient communication) and new challenges (e.g., stress from interruptions). This project acknowledges these contrasting findings and aims to study the eventual effects of NWW on employee well-being (i.e., psychological, psychosomatic, and social well-being).","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0421,2014,Paper Session,Understanding Organizational Change in a Post-Conflict Society: A Sensemaking Approach to Northern Ireland’s Government Re-Organization,1,"Traditionally, systematic investigations into communication issues during organizational change have involved comparatively reviewing an organization before and after the change has occurred by way of an internal communication audit. Such an audit focuses on the organization’s communicative structures and systems, but there is a growing need to shift this focus onto examining how people make sense of organizational change. Sensemaking offers insights into the process of communication during organizational change, the identities that are maintained, altered, developed or constrained during change. A review of literature in the field reveals few studies have been conducted examining how organizational communication and sensemaking are linked (Mills, 2009), particularly within a public sector context such as local government. This study helps redress the extant dearth of investigations in this area, by examining the emerging communication issues and the role of power within a local government authority in the developing post-conflict context of Northern Ireland.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

The first perspective presents the view of a participant in meetings; the second perspective presents the view of the meeting as an agent within meetings, as understood by this same participant. These perspectives have been generated based on my one-year ethnographic project with Suicide Prevention Campaign, where I also serve as a member of the organization. My approach to this study is based on the communication as constitutive of organizations perspective and the ethnography of communication research tradition. This paper shows how organizational members can both use and be used by meetings by examining the meeting as an agent within meetings.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

Since adoption rates among the citizens are still low this study tries to contribute to answer the question, what factors in the relationship of the government and its citizens might prevent a successful implementation. It is argued that a certain level of willingness for innovation on both sides is necessary for a successful implementation of M-Government. On the basis of the Diffusion of Innovation (Rogers, 1962) and using the concept of Innovativeness (Rogers & Shoemaker, 1971) a study was conducted among citizens and the municipal council of a large city in Germany. They were asked to assess their own willingness for innovation as well as the perceived innovativeness for the respective other side. The results show a significant misperception of citizens and the government concerning the innovativeness of the respective other.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication
2014-0425,2014,Paper Session,Work-Life Negotiation as Engaged Practice: Considering a Practice-Based Approach to Empowerment,1,"Originally conceived by Levinas’ (1969; 2003) and recently taken up by critical management scholars (Loacker & Muhr, 2009; Muhr, 2008), “practice-based ethics” is the idea that ethics only exist through encounter with others and is “concerned with concrete situational answers to codes and normative, often inconsistent, expectations” (Loacker & Muhr, 2009, p. 267). The same, then, can be said for work-life negotiation. The elusive and often theorized state of ‘balance’ is better understood as empowerment, which can only ever be realized through ongoing engagement and negotiation of competing work and life. Thus, the ideal state for work-life is not something that can ever be achieved, but is ongoing and constantly (re)negotiated. Work-life negotiation is highly contextual and subject to inconsistent (and often unfair) normative beliefs. Just as discourses are constantly negotiated, always in flux, and require direct engagement in order to exist, so too is the nature of work-life negotiation.","So Far, So Good, Part 1: Organizational Communication Research Escalator",Organizational Communication

An Examination of the Motives for Using Social Media While Watching TV,3,"Disruptive innovations driven by technology are currently evoking fundamental changes in the TV market. “Social TV”, described as the use of social media while watching TV, is recognized as one of the key trends in this field. Communication research has only infrequently addressed the question of what drives users to participate in Social TV. In this paper, we explore the motives for using Social Media while watching TV. A factor analysis based on a survey study with 409 German Social TV users determined five motive dimensions for Social TV, in order of importance: (1) Impression Management, (2) Orientation and assistance, (3) Intense show-experience, (4) Alternative action and (5) Maintaining relationships. A cluster analysis also showed four groups of users: (a) Contact-Maintainers, (b) Players, (c) Orientation-Seekers and (d) Indifferents.

2014-0428,2014,Paper Session,"What’s Going On? Age, Distraction, and Multitasking During Survey Taking",2,"5,853 people from seven countries completed an online survey that included questions about what other background distractions, non-electronic activities, and electronic activities were occurring at the same time. Nearly 30% of respondents reported doing at least one other thing while taking the survey, and age was negatively associated with multitasking. All types of multitasking were associated with an increase in feeling distracted; however, with respect to electronic multitasking, it was how many different tasks they were doing that was related to the increase in distraction. Once this was controlled for, increases in the number of times they engaged in a particular electronic activity actually decreased the sense of distraction. The hypothesis that younger people would be less distracted by multitasking than older people was not supported, and the relationship among age, multitasking, and distraction appears to be a curious and curvilinear one worthy of future research.",Multitasking With Technology,Communication and Technology

The study is based on a cross-cultural survey (N=1,972) that included respondents from two countries: United States and Taiwan. The measures of media multitasking and media ownership were adjusted to reflect the newest media forms and options available on the market. The findings indicated that age, media ownership and polychronicity significantly predicted media multitasking in both samples. The study also explored motivations to multitask with media. Two motivations, connection and addiction, were important predictors of this media use behavior cross-nationally and mediated the effects of some factors on the dependent measure, among others.

Predicting Political Orientation and Measuring Political Homophily on Twitter Using Big Data,1,"This paper investigates whether Twitter can be conceived of as a public sphere or an echo chamber. By using big data, data mining and network analysis, we automatically predicted the political orientation of the users and measured the political homophily in the graph. Evidence was found that supports the echo chamber view. Furthermore, we found that Democrats’ political homophily is associated with political ideology, while Republicans’ political homophily with political affiliation. Finally, by comparing homophily rates in reciprocal and non-reciprocal graphs, we found that in non-reciprocal graph (people we follow, who don’t follow us back) there is 16% less of homophily with respect to the reciprocal, suggesting that this Twitter characteristic allows the creation of a more fluid public sphere.",Network Analyses of Online Message Content,Communication and Technology

Using content and network analysis on 1013 memetic units (mainly videos and images), we aimed at (1) revealing the prevalent themes, participation, and forms of contemporary memes, (2) examining the “loyalty” of meme instances to their family, and (3) understanding the factors that influence this loyalty. Our findings provide the first empirical support for the theory that internet memes are loyal to their family, by significantly sharing more attributes with other ""members"" of it. They clearly show that unique and distinctive non-popular content attributes, (e.g. politics) and to a lesser extent also participation and form attributes, provide prominent cues for the production of instances that keep loyal to their own family and distinct them from other families. The implications of these findings to the broader digital culture are discussed.",Network Analyses of Online Message Content,Communication and Technology

On Twitter, both hashtags, which are indexed, searchable features (e.g. #“word”, where “word” is the hashtag) and mentions, where the @ sign indicates that tweet is directed toward a handle (e.g. @username directed to username), are simultaneously structural and content-based. This paper uses regression and semantic network analysis to begin to tease out the structural and content-based contributions of hashtags and mentions originating from three online smoking cessation accounts (usernames: SmokefreeGov, SmokefreeWomen and SomkefreeTeen) created by the National Cancer Institute on information contagion (operationalized retweeting). We find that there is a significant negative relationship between the number of mentions and information contagion and that smoking-related information is associated with the most common hashtags. Further, retweets mentioning individuals are less contagious",Network Analyses of Online Message Content,Communication and Technology

Results show that the Facebook audience referenced a wide spectrum of sources within the news discussion, and that most audience members’ links led to politically neutral Web sites. This may mitigate somewhat the idea that the Internet is an echo chamber that users navigate in a filter bubble of partisan preferences. Furthermore, the use of links and the range of resources linked to by the audience suggest that Facebook resembles a dual-network structure where a secondary user-generated network is built upon a primary database of goods or content.",Network Analyses of Online Message Content,Communication and Technology

Unlike most measures of habits, it does not rely on retrospective self-reports, but focuses on the script-based character of habits. Participants are presented with several media use situations and are asked to choose under time pressure the media device they would use in each situation. The more often a media device is chosen the stronger the cognitive script to use this device and the stronger the general habit is assumed to be. After the encouraging results of a first validation study with a student sample, the present paper demonstrates that the RFMMH is applicable to a general population sample as well.

To address this gap, the current study constructs and validates a new scale. Results from confirmatory factor analysis suggest that message credibility can be measured by asking participants to rate how well the following adjectives describe content: accurate, believable, and authentic. Interestingly, this measure was not influenced by expertise or fairness, two concepts often associated with general notions of credibility. Instead, it appears that quality is the main determinant of message credibility. Validity and reliability tests are reported and contributions to credibility research are discussed.",Methodological Innovations in Mass Communication Research,Mass Communication

Such responses are subject to different errors, inaccuracies and biases. There are several approaches to identify such biases and inaccuracies. The most elaborate and expensive method is the comparison of respondent’s self-reports with their observed behavior. Thus, so far no study analyzed the validity of answers about media use behavior by comparing the answers with observations on the basis of a representative sample.
To further understanding of what contributes to and impairs the validity of self-reported media use through quantitative questionnaires, we conducted a secondary analysis of both telemetrically observed and surveyed data on TV use in Germany of a representative sample. Results show format- and respondent-specific effects on inaccuracies of TV use responses. Intensity of use and age were found to be main predictors of TV use validity on an individual level.

Method: An experimental design was utilized to investigate whether a website’s level of design complexity impacts user evaluations. An online questionnaire measured the hypothesized impact of design complexity on predictors of message effectiveness.
Results: Findings reveal that increased design complexity was positively associated with higher levels of perceived design aesthetics, attitudes toward the website, message comprehensibility, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived message quality, perceived informativeness, and perceived visual informativeness.
Conclusion: This research gives further evidence that design complexity should be considered an influential variable for effective health communication, as it embodies the critical first step for message evaluation via electronic platforms.","Visual Design, Visual Complexity, and Impact",Visual Communication Studies

The current study sought to examine whether individuals’ dispositional mindfulness could predict their forgiving responses to real or potential relational transgressions. To assess this, 91 participants in committed relationships completed self-report measures related to mindfulness and numerous antecedents to forgiveness. Results indicate that mindfulness predicted forgiveness, empathy, perspective-taking, rumination, and offender apology. Simple mediation results indicate that mindfulness mediated the relationship between all four antecedents and forgiveness. Empathy, perspective-taking, and rumination were unrelated to forgiveness until mindfulness was included as a mediating variable in the models. Implications for theory and methodological comparison are discussed.","Forgiveness, Happiness, Mindfullness, and Charity",Interpersonal Communication

2014-0446,2014,Paper Session,The Mindful Communication Scale: Development and Initial Validation,1,"Trait mindfulness is defined as one’s general aptitude for focusing on present-moment experience in a non-habitual and non-judgmental manner (see Kabat-Zinn 1990, 1994). Although myriad measures of mindfulness exist, none capture people’s tendency to be mindful specifically when communicating with others, a process called mindful communicating. This paper proposes a conceptual definition for mindful communicating, and it details the development, testing, and initial validation of the Mindful Communication Scale (MCS). The MCS is designed to measure the degree of self-reported mindfulness individuals enact during conversations with others. In this paper, two studies are reported. The first discusses scale development and initial factor analytic procedures to establish subscales and scale reliability. The second study uses confirmatory factor analysis to retest the MCS with new data. Concurrent validity is also established through correlation with an existing trait mindfulness measure. Implications for further testing of the MCS as well as potential use in the field of communication are discussed.","Forgiveness, Happiness, Mindfullness, and Charity",Interpersonal Communication
2014-0447,2014,Paper Session,"The Relationship Between Forgiveness, Imagined Interactions, Empathy, and Relational Satisfaction Among Romantic Couples",2,"Forgiveness helps maintain healthy romantic relationships. Imagined interactions (IIs) are a type of social cognition involving mental dialogues that occur with significant others. Although forgiveness has been studied in a variety of interpersonal settings, it has not been explicitly studied in relation to the usage of imagined interactions (IIs). Moreover, even though a correlation between empathy and forgiveness has long been established, the interplay between these two constructs and intrapersonal communication and relational satisfaction has not been explored. The goal of this study is to bridge the theoretical and conceptual gaps between forgiveness theory, empathy, imagined interactions, and relational satisfaction. This study sampled participants in romantic relationships (n=181). The use of IIs did significantly predict both forgiveness and relational satisfaction. Additionally, IIs were shown to be positively correlated with empathy, a significant finding considering the lack of research into that area of the otherwise well developed field of IIs.","Forgiveness, Happiness, Mindfullness, and Charity",Interpersonal Communication

2014-0449,2014,Paper Session,The Social Construction of the 21st Century Museum: Digital Mapping and Community Building Through MOCA’s Mapping Our Heritage Project,1,"The use of social media and digital tools has recently been promoted by museums as a move toward creating more democratic, participatory spaces. This paper addresses the effectiveness of these digital efforts by focusing specifically on the case of the online mapping project, “Mapping Our Heritage” at the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) in New York City. The project is a web-based interactive map that allows visitors both to access material from the museum, and to contribute their own stories and media. Looking specifically at the youth program associated with this map (called Community Youth Action Committee – CYAC), I examine how particular ways of describing the museum may limit the participatory potential of these digital projects. I draw from the perspective of social construction for this analysis – concentrating specifically on the metaphors of ‘mapping’ and ‘heritage’, and how the museum’s conceptions of these ideas shape, constrain, and structure how the program is currently run. While project aims to create a complete, more ‘truthful’ map of Chinatown for its visitors, I argue this becomes impossible since the creation of the map shapes the very realities the participants wish to correct. Therefore, rather than trying to offer a corrective, I suggest the best way to understand the project and the museum at-large is as a social organization that is enacted through a network of conversations. Shifting back to the overall efforts of digital museum projects, I conclude by illustrating how a social constructionist perspective may allow us to reconsider the role of museums in a networked world – rather than being keepers of artifacts, they may now be understood as generators of community discourse and knowledge.","Surveillance, Narrative, & Expert Systems in the Digital Era","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2014-0450,2014,Paper Session,On Becoming an Exchange: Translating Michel Callon Into a Political Economy of Communication,1,"Financial technology and information are more than commodities, and hence political economists ought to look beyond their discipline to understand the multi-faceted nature of information and technology. Using a case study of trading technologies of Nasdaq stocks prior to the dot-com boom, this paper argues that Michel Callon's writings on Actor-Network Theory lend insight to political economists. It is shown that the financial bubble was created and later destroyed by various trading technologies, price calculation, and index composition. Hence, there has never been an unified dot-com economy. However, Callon's sparse mentions of power and social relations, and his dismissal of capitalism, require political economists' critical appraisal.","Surveillance, Narrative, & Expert Systems in the Digital Era","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2014-0451,2014,Paper Session,Cops and Computation: Visual Evidence and Police Narrative Authority in the New Media Landscape,1,"Police power derives to a significant extent from their narrative authority, their ability to tell authoritative stories about crime and their own role as arbiters of law and order. While struggles over legitimacy have been fundamental to modern police institutions since their inception, what is changing today are the platforms, technologies, and tactics through which these battles play out. This paper focuses on the emerging field of forensic video analysis (FVA) – a set of technologies and practices for exploiting the evidentiary potential of surveillance video. It examines FVA as a domain of cop-knowledge production and professional specialization in a context of proliferating surveillance infrastructures and risk-management crime-control strategies. The professionalization of this police “media work” promises to invest the police with renewed narrative authority, allowing them to harness computational technologies and expertise in the constant battle of interpretations over prevailing ways of understanding crime, social disorder, and police power itself.","Surveillance, Narrative, & Expert Systems in the Digital Era","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

I focus on neo-Weberian analyses of occupational fields as political, competitive sites of practice, and on recent work from the sociology of occupations that considers occupational fields as discursive arenas, where particular occupational ideologies circulate and discipline practitioners, both in terms of their practice and their self-management. My argument is that while legitimising PR in relation to organisational imperatives makes commercial sense, it results in the construction of an occupational habitus that disconnects PR from the wider social, cultural and political context in which it operates. As a consequence, the effects of PR on the distribution of material and symbolic power, both outwith and within the field, are masked.",Public Relations Identity and Professionalism,Public Relations

Public relations professionals with more years of working experience were more likely to value task-oriented leadership skills and characteristics, value shared power, and considered themselves as empowered and self-governing. Longer work experience corresponded with greater the self-perception, gender perception, and organizational perception of leadership. Public relations professionals working for public organizations tended to value more passive leadership skills and characteristics, compared to those working for private organizations. This may be due to a lack of decision-making power and role enactment into dominant coalitions. In addition, public relations professionals indicated that the most important current issues in communication management, or that they are most concerned with media use in social networks, followed by employee communication, and brand management.",Public Relations Identity and Professionalism,Public Relations
2014-0456,2014,Paper Session,Successful PR Consulting: When is PR Work Consulting and What is Necessary to Ensure Success?,1,"PR consulting, which is understood as a special form of organizational consulting, has hardly been investigated in communication science, and does not play a considerable role in either classical sociological or economic consulting research. Both disciplines, however, offer theoretical approaches, which would be relevant for research on interactions between PR consultants and their clients. The principal-agent-theory from organizational sociology, as well as theoretical models from economics concerning the analysis of management processes could expand the theoretical frame. This article first determines the potential of such theoretical approaches for the description and analysis of PR consulting processes. On this basis, success factors for PR consulting processes are analyzed using guided interviews, looking for differences between the self-assessment and the external assessment of the actors involved. The results of the guided interviews will be analyzed quantitatively by means of an online survey which also explores the issue of the “extended workbench”.",Public Relations Identity and Professionalism,Public Relations
2014-0457,2014,Paper Session,"Concerned, Responsible, and Guilty? Testing a Model of Guilt Arousal and Effects in Environmental Campaigns",1,"Guilt has been identified as a crucial factor mediating the effects of social campaigns, for instance, on charity giving. So far, however, knowledge regarding the process of guilt arousal is limited. Who is especially susceptible to guilt arousal and how does guilt influence campaign effects? This paper studies processes of guilt arousal and effects through exposure to environmental campaigns. Following the Extended Parallel Process Model, environmental involvement and efficacy are introduced as main predictors. The proposed model is tested by a stimulus driven survey (N = 201). The results show that guilt arousal reinforces persuasive effects when prior concern is high. While efficacy predicts donation intention, it is not a premise of guilt arousal. The main implication is that guilt arousal enhances campaign effects for those with a high involvement but is the wrong strategy to reach those with a low involvement prior to exposure.","Environmental Campaigns: Effects, Rhetoric, and Mobilization",Environmental Communication
2014-0458,2014,Paper Session,How Naked People and Polar Bears Made Climate Change Newsworthy,1,"This paper investigates visual representations of staged environmental protests that are produced and distributed by the environmental-activist organization Greenpeace, and broadcast through international news media. By examining images taken from Greenpeace campaigns, this paper shows how these demonstrations generally, and images of them more specifically, draw attention to climate change issues through their rhetorical capacity to challenge dominant cultural values that have enabled climate-changing human activities to persist. The rhetorical capacity of these images further demonstrates Kevin DeLuca’s image event theory, which suggests how visual demonstrations can be designed to attract mass media attention that then leads to public advocacy and adherence. More specifically, this paper argues that Kenneth Burke’s concepts of identification and disidentification can show us how Greenpeace’s rhetorical agenda unfolds, how their visual representations of extreme environmental activism and advocacy challenge cultural values that support environmentally damaging industrializing practices and the subordination of nature to human progress.","Environmental Campaigns: Effects, Rhetoric, and Mobilization",Environmental Communication
2014-0459,2014,Paper Session,"Internet, Citizen Self-Mobilization, and Social Movement Organizations in Environmental Collective Action Campaigns: Two Hong Kong Cases",1,"Much research on online activism has shown that the Internet enhances social mobilization through lowering the costs of information, organization, mobilization, and participation. The Internet thus facilitates the rise of citizen self-mobilization (CSM), i.e., organization of and mobilization for collective actions by ordinary citizens unaffiliated with social and political groups. However, CSM does not necessarily render social movement organizations (SMOs) irrelevant to protest movements. In contrast, the two can be considered as complementary to each other, and many collective action campaigns in contemporary societies are constituted by the dynamic combination of CSM efforts and SMO-based mobilization processes. This study conceptualizes the complementary relationship between CSM and SMO from a resource mobilization perspective. It then illustrates, through two case studies of environmental collective actions in Hong Kong, how CSM and SMO-based processes may interact with each other to drive the evolution of collective action campaigns. The study points to an approach to understand the impact of emerging online social mobilization phenomena on existing movement organizations and industries.","Environmental Campaigns: Effects, Rhetoric, and Mobilization",Environmental Communication

We focus on the online mobilization tactics used by Greenpeace, and how they differed from previous campaign practices. The findings are based on a content analysis of all statuses posted on the campaign Facebook page (N=129), and six semi-structured interviews with key Greenpeace leadership. The analysis reveals that Greenpeace extensively used Facebook for the dual purpose of disseminating information and contexts about the campaign, and as a platform for mobilizing and facilitating broad public engagement. Greenpeace seized the affordances of the Facebook medium, and introduced new means of online mobilization and engagement. These e-tactics proved useful for engaging diverse transnational supporters in the campaign. The implications for ENGOs and the broader environmental movement are discussed.","Environmental Campaigns: Effects, Rhetoric, and Mobilization",Environmental Communication

Looking specifically at the argument to reinterpret the 14th Amendment in order to exclude the children of undocumented migrants from birthright citizenship, I argue that the construction of citizenship as a mode to receive the Mimi Thi Nguyen terms “the gift of freedom” erects a will to love the nation-state as well as a simultaneous will to fear those who have been cast outside of its biopolitical fold.","Migration, Minorities, and Diasporas",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

In this study we use a media ethnographic approach, including fieldwork and 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews. Previous studies on diasporic film cultures nor studies dealing with migrants’ ICT usage have given scholarly attention to online film consumption. By considering the notion of the ‘connected migrant’ (Diminescu 2008) and questioning its emphasis on migrants’ unlimited connectivity, this paper shows how connectivity not only involves material access but is also restricted by the constraints of the everyday diasporic living context. Furthermore, while a shift from material to online film distribution takes place, allowing African diaspora more access to Nigerian films, a trend towards more individual (rather than communal) film consumption can be observed.","Migration, Minorities, and Diasporas",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

2014-0464,2014,Paper Session,The Politics of Place. Media Representations of Traditionally Mobile Minorities: The Case of Irish Travellers,1,"This paper discusses meanings of place in connection to peoples, relating to a settlement-mobility continuum. It considers representations of land, borders, living quarters, identity and belonging. The study is drawn from a project where cases concerning traditionally mobile minorities highlight how place, ethnicity, class, and rights are conceptualized in mainstream media. This paper examines a case of ”contested place-making” concerning Irish Travellers in the UK; mainly studying online slideshows in the Guardian. The study comprises theories of media, place identity, and globalization. It combines compositional analysis, discourse theoretical method and intersectionality. Place-making is contested partly through legal aspects/actions, but rarely understood in terms of justice. Instead, life-style appears as a main problem. Manifested through imagery of fences, “identity management” meets “place management”; not detaching identities from places generally - as in cultural globalization - but detaching some identities from some places, while celebrating some types of mobility, but not others.","Migration, Minorities, and Diasporas",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

It is a rich text to study intersecting discourses in Korea’s shift to a multicultural society that negotiate local hierarchies within a broader global context. Locally, the film represents patrilineal assimilation as a desirable and possible outcome for the multi-ethnic Korean “other.” The film builds support for an assimilationist multiculturalism through its use of a feminized ideal victim, advancing gendered multicultural goals. Globally, the film argues rhetorically in favor of multiculturalism as a way for Korea to gain global recognition from the West. Thus, multicultural discourses in the film support assimilation of the multi-ethnic other for the purposes of positioning Korea within the pantheon of “advanced” countries.","Migration, Minorities, and Diasporas",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

The creation of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin’s Mass Communications History Center provides an illuminating entry point into conceptions of mass communications and processes to carve out an area of study. Drawing on the archive’s administrative records, we can find discussions about the meaning of mass communications. Archivists grappled with the definition in order to develop a collecting policy for materials and called on experts to help define the scope of mass communications and what sorts of materials were necessary for its study.

Media Change Research and the Complexity of Transitions in Culture and Society,3,"Change’ and ‘transition’ are trending topics in media and communication research. Change however is often seen as encapsulated in the latest technological innovation and research is often characterized by presentism. We argue that substantial research about media change has to elucidate the interrelations between change in media, culture and society as dialectically connected and that research on media change that fails to historicize its topic is likely to produce shallow accounts. We review media evolution theory and concepts of mediatization as approaches to media change that aim beyond short-lived technology driven research interests and apply broader scopes and historical long-term perspectives. We propose the notion of ‘situation’ as a construct to approach media change empirically and reflect three different dimensions (change, media, coping) to define complex situations as stem cells of empirical research on media change. We conclude with early 20th and 21st Century journalism as examples of contextualized situations.",Reflections on Methodology: Yesterday and Today,Communication History

This is done by applying a newly developed framework that focuses on both cognitive as well as material dimensions of research covering central factors such as structures of subject fields, patterns in research funding and publication output as well as activities in teaching on different educational levels. The results show the diversity and patterns found in the field of MCS in Switzerland. By arguing along the lines of distinct research clusters that can be found within the field—namely “classical” and “emerging” fields of media and communication research—the analysis helps better understand general relationships between different cognitive and material dimensions, their role for different subject fields in MCS as well as for the overall development of the field in Switzerland.",Reflections on Methodology: Yesterday and Today,Communication History

The importance of nurses to healthcare cannot be understated, but neither can the environmental struggles nurses routinely encounter in their jobs. Decades of health communication and nursing scholarship show conflict and stress as two visible and enduring problems. We use principles from systems theory to offer new understandings of these historical challenges for nurses and identify ways in which nurses and their employing organizations can better cope with stress and conflict pressures. Analyses of open-ended survey comments from nurses (N = 135) employed at a large teaching and research hospital demonstrate how stress and conflict function as multi-level systems contingences disruptive to individual, team, and organizational interdependencies. Results show the ways in which nurses (mis)manage these contingencies through respectful/disrespectful messaging. A metaphor for considering communicative disruptions, we argue, can be depicted as fire. Items—and relationships—can go up in flames due to disrespectful communication and conflict mismanagement. Findings suggest conveying respect may help nurses cope with and even avoid stress and conflict whereas disrespectful communication heightens nurse stress and conflict. Solutions are offered for developing multi-level strategies to mitigate the effects of stress and conflict while also developing respectful organizational cultures.",Issues in Provider-Patient Interaction Research,Health Communication
2014-0471,2014,Paper Session,Challenging Integration: Clinicians’ Perspectives of Communicating Collaboration in a Center for Integrative Medicine,5,"A shift has occurred in the provision of health care to include a focus, not just on biology and disease, but also on the whole person and preventative care. This approach to health care, termed Integrative Medicine (IM) blends biomedicine with a broader understanding of patients and their illnesses, including anything in their life, mind, body, and spirit, that may be contributing to an ailment. While the use of integrative medicine has increased and centers for integration medicine have proliferated, distinct tensions arise from this integration. The tensions between IM and biomedical clinicians often center on their differing training and philosophies, as well as a larger system of health care that privileges biomedicine. As a result, this research is designed to explore the challenges clinicians face in collaborating to provide patient care. Analysis of interviews with 14 clinicians at one center for integrative medicine revealed four specific challenges they face in their attempt to integrate health care.",Issues in Provider-Patient Interaction Research,Health Communication

We aim to describe (a) different uses of teleconsultation technology (TCT) and (b) TCT-mediated communication of home-based patients and hospital-based specialized palliative care team (SPCT) members. In an embedded multiple-case study around teleconsultation with 18 terminally ill patients, 15 informal carers, 18 primary care physicians, and 12 SPCT-members, we conducted 56 interviews, 40 ethnographic conversations, and 129 field notes. Analysis according a grounded theory approach resulted in three main findings: TCT’s quality of transcendence both neutralized physical distance by ‘demanding’ focused attention and jeopardized condensed virtual encounters and privacy. TCT’s quality of transparence extended and limited SPCT-members’ clinical eye, reduced physical proximity, and transformed TCT into an object of death. Finally, teleconsultation enriched contact as digital engagement led to trust, intimacy, and experiencing relief. This paper concludes with a teleconsultation model for humane, multidisciplinary palliative homecare.",Issues in Provider-Patient Interaction Research,Health Communication

This study focuses on the relationships between initiating messages and responses to them to understand the communication functions and dynamics fulfilled by these interactions. We analyzed 29,716 messages from 6,070 conversations from Pro-Ana Nation online discussion forum for linguistic markers of stigma, anorexia-related psychological content, emotions, and cognitive concerns to reveal patterns in how sufferers manage their stigmatized information and identity. We found that stigma and anorexia-related disclosures are associated with higher levels of negative emotions, cognitive processes, and insightfulness in responses. Additionally, there are communicative changes of the initial discloser within an interaction exchange, both from cathartic consequences and based on responses of negative emotional support and cognitive rationalizations. Understanding these patterns is an important step toward improving interventions aimed to help anorexics by increasing our understanding of the illness.",Communication and Health-Related Stigma Management,Health Communication

This study examines the role of prior weight stigmatization in parents’ reactions to sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) reduction messages. An online survey experiment was conducted with 807 parents randomly assigned to view two videos representing one of three persuasive appeals (fear, humor, or nurturance) or unrelated control videos. Subsequent emotional responses, evaluation of argument strength, and intentions to reduce SSB consumption were measured. Prior stigmatization had no direct effect on emotional responses or perceived argument strength. Stigmatized parents had higher empowerment/hopeful feelings than non-stigmatized parents after viewing humorous videos. Negative, positive, and protective emotions predicted lower intentions to reduce consumption among stigmatized participants. Empowerment/hopeful emotions and argument strength were the strongest predictors of intention to reduce SSB consumption and were not moderated.

The concept of “media systems” is a conceptual construction that enables an aggregation of structures and dynamics in ways that allow for the systematic study of media, politics, and policies. It assumes that important structures and dynamics “thicken” around “media systems” which are bounded by the politics of states, without denying the significance of globalization. As the rigorous study of the intersection among media, politics and policies demands clear units of analysis, and we propose that while the concept of “media systems” is not the only relevant analytical unit, it remains important for comparative research interested in contrasting cases and assessing the impact of global trends, and alternatives proposed are not particularly persuasive.",The National and the Global in Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0485,2014,Paper Session,Producing Place: Television and Soft Power in India,1,"Mechanisms of ideological control in imperialist, colonial, and postcolonial contexts have been richly studied by critical scholars. In the current moment of globalization, ideological control has resurfaced in Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye’s elegant phrasing: “soft power,” which he defines as the capacity of a nation to quite simply, get what it wants through attraction rather than force. Facilitating the soft power project in India is lifestyle television, most notably on foreign channels, pushing for newer ways of consuming and newer ways of making room for foreign direct investment. This paper examines travel and cooking programs on Fox Traveler and NDTV and integrates interviews with Indian news and lifestyle media professionals, to discuss the complexities of producing place and nation. Drawing from postcolonial theory, it examines the “encounter” among multiple actors and evaluates the opportunism on all sides of the interdependent dynamic to create soft power.",The National and the Global in Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0486,2014,Paper Session,Media and Multilateralism in Latin America: How the International Matters to Domestic Media Reform,1,"Currently we are seeing major examples of media reform in several Latin American countries. Accounts of these processes focus primarily on the national level, particularly media’s place in the renegotiation of the social contract between state, capital and society. In an effort to move the media reform discussion more in the direction of international political economy concerns, I suggest three different models at work in Latin America: cordial complex interdependence and market-based media reforms (e.g. Brazil), counter hegemonic network management (e.g. Venezuela), and finally informational capitalism dependent development (e.g. the PPP corridor). I show that the fact of these different models highlights the significance of the relationship between management of capitalist insertion and patterns of media reform. I then go on to discuss three implications of this international political economy reading of Latin American media reform.",The National and the Global in Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change

2014-0488,2014,Paper Session,Exploring Relational Termination Between Online Friends: An Investment Model Approach,2,"The current study examined the process of friendship “distancing behaviors” in the online social network website, Facebook. First, we examined if individuals’ narcissistic personality would predict their performance of annoying self-focused or offensive Facebook posting behaviors. Secondly, we applied the Investment Model (IM; Rusbult, 1980) to predict if such annoying behaviors would affect individuals’ selection of active termination (e.g., defriend or cut annoying Facebook friends from their newsfeeds) versus passive distancing strategies (e.g., simply ignoring the behavior). Using a novel “matched-pair” survey sample design (N = 307), this study found that narcissism did predict offensive posting behavior. Results also suggested that intent to defriend was predicted by the amount of relational commitment, while intent to engage in more passive distancing behaviors was explained by quality of alternatives. This research also examined the effects of relational closeness as a moderating factor that affects distancing strategy selection.",End-Stage Interpersonal Relationships on Facebook,Communication and Technology
2014-0489,2014,Paper Session,Spying on the Ones We Love: Antecedents and Outcomes of Postbreakup Surveillance on Facebook,4,"Social networking sites (SNS) are sometimes used for social surveillance, particularly in the context of romantic relationships. While several personal variables have been identified as causes of electronic surveillance, less is known about its relational antecedent. The present study investigates the predictors and outcomes of surveillance on SNS in the context of the dissolution of a romantic relationship. Participants (N = 171) who recently experienced the end of a romantic relationship responded to a survey about their past relationship and their surveillance behaviors toward their previous partner on Facebook. Results supported hypotheses that desire to resume the romantic relationship, and non-initiators of the breakup, predicted surveillance behaviors. Further, the relationship between breakup initiation role and surveillance was explained by negative emotions during the dissolution process. Controlling for elapsed time since the breakup, surveillance after the breakup predicted current levels of rumination. Implications of this work are discussed for relationships and surveillance on SNS.",End-Stage Interpersonal Relationships on Facebook,Communication and Technology

Because Facebook allows individuals to readily maintain relationships with, or monitor the activities of, past romantic and sexual partners, this study explores how maintaining connections with former relational partners on Facebook may relate to one’s perceived quality of alternative romantic relationships within his or her “friends” on Facebook. Data from an undergraduate sample (N=318) established that use of Facebook does not impact relational commitment. However, the number of exes a user has as friends moderates the relationship between investment size and relational satisfaction and commitment.",End-Stage Interpersonal Relationships on Facebook,Communication and Technology

A content analysis of 2,533 messages posted on 10 deceased individuals’ Facebook profile pages reveals that messages to the deceased reflect three themes: Processing the Death, Remembering the Deceased, and Continuing the Connection. An analysis of messages over time indicates that posts pertaining to processing the death and remembering the deceased peak immediately after loss and then decrease in frequency, while messages signaling continued connections increase with time. This study expands upon the framework of the social information processing theory to explicate how Facebook is used as a facilitator for relational preservation with the deceased.",End-Stage Interpersonal Relationships on Facebook,Communication and Technology
2014-0492,2014,Paper Session,Unspeaking on Facebook? Testing Network Exposure Effects on Self-Censorship of Political Expressions in Social Network Sites,3,"Social Network Sites (SNS) have become widely used for political opinion expressions and social exchange focused on a host of regional, national, and international political issues. The aim of this study is to explore the role online social network exposure effects have on predicting individual’s willingness to self-censor political expression. The Spiral of Silence theory (SOS) is applied to the online social network context and considers three major characteristics of SNS including reduced anonymity, integration of multiple social contexts/relationships, and increased probability of unanticipated exposure to different opinions. Drawn from the discussions, we propose three possible network exposure effects –network size, incongruence exposure, and diversity exposure –on political expression. Results suggest that diversity exposure increases the likelihood of self-censorship, which in turn is associated with political posting behavior online. We speculate to what extent the social conformity proposition of the SOS theory should persist online, and call for further exploration of informational influence as conceptually distinct from normative influence.",Social Network Analysis of Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0493,2014,Paper Session,Investigating the Effects of News Sharing and Political Interest,2,"This research investigated whether the use of social networking services (SNSs) promotes or restricts the likelihood of citizens’ exposure to political disagreement by focusing on two different types of news sharing activities on SNS –news externalizing (e.g., news posting) and news internalizing (e.g., news seeking)– and on individuals’ level of political interest. First, the results show that frequent SNS use may entail higher chances of interacting with heterogeneous others, but the influence is only indirectly exerted through its effects on two new sharing activities. Second, findings indicate that political interest and news sharing activities interact with each other in predicting the degree of network heterogeneity. Interestingly, the directions of influence were diametrically different between news internalizing and externalizing. For those who participate in frequent news internalizing, being less interested seems to result in more heterogeneous online networks, while frequent news externalizing is likely to lead to more heterogeneous networks for the more interested. The study is conducted with a nationally representative survey.",Social Network Analysis of Social Media,Communication and Technology

The results suggest that the flow of political discussions is not notably centralized and cliquish. Participants refer primarily to the remarks of like-minded fellow citizens. Political discussions are more emotional than cognitive and express more anger than anxiety, but it appears that cognitive discussions are more influential than emotional ones. Among cognitive components, assertive and strong discussions have greater influence than analytical ones. These results have implications for the practice of citizenship and the theory of selective exposure as well as for future directions in political communication research.",Social Network Analysis of Social Media,Communication and Technology

The findings confirm the threshold hypothesis of interpersonal effects. To be specific, there is a J-curve relationship between interpersonal effects and diffusion size. Further, such curvilinear relationship is moderated by the depth of diffusion networks. Additionally, the depth of diffusion is relatively limited and the temporal diffusion curves are featured by strong bursts. In all, this research extends threshold models of interpersonal effects by linking it with the J-curve model, and further explicates it with the moderation effect of the depth of diffusion network.",Social Network Analysis of Social Media,Communication and Technology

A web-based survey experiment with a single factor independent groups design was conducted among 279 adults. The respondents were randomly assigned to either the conservative newspaper group or the liberal newspaper group. The results indicate those exposed to the editorial published in the newspaper that matched their political views evaluated the credibility of the newspaper more highly than those exposed to the same editorial published in the ideologically oppositional newspaper. The perceived media credibility was negatively related to the magnitude of psychological reactance, which, in turn, was negatively related to attitude toward anti-smoking campaign. These findings suggest the perceived media credibility can have an indirect impact on audience attitudes through psychological reactance.",Persuasion in the Media,Mass Communication
2014-0498,2014,Paper Session,The Effectiveness of Self-Persuasion in Media Campaigns,1,"Recently, it has been demonstrated that self-persuasion can be activated by media campaigns, which were more effective than those using direct argumentation. Extending these findings, in the present paper we investigated conditions under which self-persuasion can be successfully applied in media campaigns. We examined whether there was a difference in effectiveness of pro- and counter-attitudinal self-persuasive messages in media campaigns. In two studies we tried to facilitate volunteering and donating by means of pro-attitudinal self-persuasive campaigns. Findings revealed that when people are not motivated to process the self-persuasive messages in media campaigns, campaigns, providing people with arguments led to a higher amount of hours people intended to volunteer. However, when processing was facilitated by means of a counter-attitudinal message, self-persuasion led to an increased amount of donation to a good cause. We suggest that active processing is vital for self-persuasive media campaigns and should be stimulated by a message itself.",Persuasion in the Media,Mass Communication
2014-0499,2014,Paper Session,The Effectiveness of Using Sexual Appeals in Persuasive Messages: Memory and Third-Person Perception,1,"This study empirically investigates the effectiveness of using sexual appeals. It examines memory for the persuasive messages, as well as the third-person perception (TPP) activated by sexual versus nonsexual appeals. A mixed factorial experiment was conducted. Estimates of perceived messages-impact on self and others as well as memory (free recall and recognition) for the ads presented were recorded in 151 participants. The results indicate that sexual appeals enhance memory for the narration/non-brand information presented in the commercials. But they distract from the brand-related information. Moreover, the findings reveal that brands advertised through sexual appeals might only be remembered by women and they will not increase purchase decisions in men, who are unlikely to remember them. Interesting TPP findings related to sexual versus nonsexual appeals are also discussed. Media producers and marketers, contrary to popular belief, might benefit more from using nonsexual appeals, especially when targeting adult males with their brands.",Persuasion in the Media,Mass Communication

Statistical analysis of survey responses from 2,828 members of the College Art Association (CAA), finds chilling effects in all professional sectors, but more so in non-artist professions—art scholars and historians; museum professionals; editors and publishers. In a field where art scholarship and curation are dependent on access to artists’ products, the current environment seriously inhibits contextualization of artists’ work. Artists are less likely to be constrained by permissions than other visual arts professionals, even when they do rely on copyrighted works of others. However, both direct and indirect chilling effects are evident in both categories.","Policing, Managing, and Censoring the Self in the Digital Era",Communication Law & Policy

While managing user-generated content is a common practice across social networking services, the policies implemented on gay-targeted services tend to be distinctively restrictive in scope and highly specific in formulation. This analysis identifies the technical, legal, and social affordances that authorized the creation of these policies. Framing content management policies as derived from the technical rules of platforms like Apple’s App Store obscures normative judgements about proper self-presentation and community formation. Identifying the normative character of these policies requires an analysis rooted simultaneously in technology studies, media policy, and subcultural identity politics.","Policing, Managing, and Censoring the Self in the Digital Era",Communication Law & Policy

These women are subjected to identity struggles in India due to the gendered patrifocal society that poses structural and societal barriers. Subsequently, when these women enter U.S. engineering programs they encounter a highly masculine organizational and cultural space. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand the identity dislocations, transformations, and assimilations as these migrants attempt to meld into the existing structures. We use liminality theory to explore the cultural transitions, identity restructuring, and negotiations of Indian women engineers navigating the intersections of competing cultures.","Identity Issues, Discussions, and Debates in Intercultural Communication",Intercultural Communication

As international TAs ourselves, we examine our lived experiences and our own narrative constructions of them. This study also helps us grasp a more careful understanding of our present selves and consciously engage in our future-making-growing identity as international teachers in the U.S. academic setting.","Identity Issues, Discussions, and Debates in Intercultural Communication",Intercultural Communication

This study examined the cultural conversion of the community from a position of assertive separation to one of assertive accommodation. This study explored reasons why this population chose to practice assertive separation, what caused it to seek a greater voice in society, and how its new cultural position affected the lives of its citizens. Studying the community of Centennial Park provides a unique glimpse into a culture previously unstudied. This study found that based on participant interviews, participant observation, and document analysis, three categories that demonstrate this community’s focuses in this time of transition are maintaining high standards, preserving gender roles, and Negotiating a Relationship with America.","Identity Issues, Discussions, and Debates in Intercultural Communication",Intercultural Communication

We found that background has a negative main effect on talkativeness and self-disclosure, indicating background items may be distracting during the conversations. We also found the effect of background on self-disclosure to be more salient in intercultural pairs (American-Chinese pairs) who may be more reliant on nonverbal cues in video-mediated communication due to their lack of common ground. Performances during conversations such as talkativeness and self-disclosure seem to affect the perceptions of extraversion and affective trust.

Through conducting in-depth interviews with 25 domestic sellers from 21 companies, together with a 6-month field observation in two local companies, this study supported the importance of rapport for successful business in China. Based on a systematic study, I identified the goals for rapport management, two levels of rapport, and four articulated strategies. These strategies included online or offline enjoyable interaction and extrinsic or intrinsic friendship connection, which would result in different kinds of relationship quality. Six common themes in the discourse of rapport management were shown and interpreted, which was consistent with each rapport management strategy. I concluded that rapport in China is an ongoing and dynamic concept which involved an enjoyable interaction stage and friendship connection process with the goal of producing long-term relationships.

Whilst a substitution of this nature appears a distinct possibility with social media, the participatory dynamics at the heart of such connective action remains largely uncharted. This paper provides an exploration of two dimensions-motivational and resource coordination- with the aim to scrutinise the scope for the participatory development of these two essential ingredients for collective action. For the purpose, it reviews an empirical study of public Facebook and Twitter communication associated with the pan-European protest against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.

Because food needs to be shared with multiple members, shared meals create situations where consumers are confronted with issues of fairness and respect in their interaction with others. One cannot be greedy and take all or most of a dish, but rules of polite food sharing need to be obeyed. From this it is assumed that those who often engage in shared meals will be more prosocial compared to those who less often take part of shared meals. To test this, data about past shared meal frequencies and current acts of prosocial behavior was collected by means of cross-sectional surveys in Belgium (n = 487) and Taiwan (n = 275).",Perspectives on Interpersonal Communication From Around the Globe,Interpersonal Communication

It suggests that distinguishing between a normative and empirical concept, and explicating the relationship between the two, will yield a conceptualisation that is more productive in generating research questions and hypothesis, and in providing a philosophical framework for interpreting empirical results. The paper first sets out a taxonomy of the public sphere, identifying key counterfactual conditions that require specification, before distinguishing normative and empirical approaches on the basis of methodological and epistemic pluralism. It concludes by proposing three ways in which the relationship between the normative and empirical concept of the public sphere can be productively conceived.","Liberalism, Rights, Normativity, and the Good Life","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Briefly surveying rights discourse in popular music documentaries and biopics, it examines two notable claims by popular music makers on rights relating to intellectual property (before Congress, 2000) and workplace autonomy (before the California Legislature, 2001-2002), treating these discourses and legislative appeals as instances of liberal rhetoric and political practice, participant in liberal discourse and institutions. Approaching liberalism as the political-philosophical obverse of capitalism, the paper derives a framework from Wendy Brown’s (1995) discussion of Karl Marx’s essay “On the Jewish Question” to interrogate the ways in which discourses and practices of rights in popular music skew toward the naturalization of liberal institutions even as they appear to critique and contest institutions of capitalism.","Liberalism, Rights, Normativity, and the Good Life","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

In this essay, I argue that a lack of metaethical groundwork limits the possibilities for praxical engagement within the dialogical–dialectical coherence of Craig’s (1999) constitutive metamodel of communication theory, and also leaves the pragmatic principle that undergirds the metamodel vulnerable to critique on grounds of moral relativism. As a remedial measure, I advocate for an infusion of Levinasian ethics into the pragmatic moorings of the metamodel. The result is an ethically grounded pragmatism that guides and grounds the field of communication theory and addresses a critical deficiency in the metamodel without introducing moral absolutism into the metatheoretical superstructure.","Liberalism, Rights, Normativity, and the Good Life","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Based on the assumption that a social network approach is fruitful for the analysis of this changing interplay, the relationship between journalists and media professionals in politics is conceived as a whole actor network, which is called here political media relations-network. Empirically, a social network survey of 74 spokespeople from various political organizations and journalists from leading news media in Germany has been conducted. The results indicate that contrary to what one might expect, the media relations-network appears to be relatively stable. New actors such as bloggers are rarely integrated in the network. One explanation for this might be that the existing ties between the actors are characterized as routine arrangements. However, weak ties exist towards new actors which might change the elite political media relations-network in the long run.",Public Relations for Politics and Governments,Public Relations

The results revealed solid support for all three levels of agenda-building (i.e., object salience, attribute salience, and network associations among objects or attributes), but the linkages with media coverage and policymaking were not uniform across information subsidy types. Based on the analysis, presidential news releases, blog posts, and presidential speeches were the most effective all-around agenda-building tools for media management and policymaking purposes during this time period. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",Public Relations for Politics and Governments,Public Relations
2014-0524,2014,Paper Session,"Exploring Crisis Type and Effects of Planning, Magnitude, and Citizen Satisfaction on Local Government Officials’ Evaluations of Crisis Management",3,"How a government responds to, manages, and communicates about crisis has direct implications for public well-being and ultimately shapes public opinion about their local governments and government officials. Yet, little is known about the pre-crisis stage of crisis management, and even less crisis communication research has been done on crisis management in local governments. Local governments become involved in handling any crisis situation that affects their communities, regardless of the responsible organization or nature of the crisis. This study surveys local government officials (n=307) in 44 states across the nation who handle crisis communication to reveal unique considerations of planning, magnitude, and citizen satisfaction on crisis management. Novel considerations are revealed with respect to each variable to direct future crisis research, particularly that informing the pre-crisis stage.",Public Relations for Politics and Governments,Public Relations

2014-0527,2014,Paper Session,Framing Gaming: The Effects of Media Frames on Perceptions of Game(r)s,2,"This paper investigates the effects of news frames on attitudes towards video games and perceptions of their users. Prior research and an explorative content analysis showed that gaming is a controversial issue, with media coverage either focusing on risks or opportunities. To examine the effects of these portrayals, the study used an experimental design and exposed student participants (N = 360) to an article that framed gaming as risk or opportunity. By examining perceived negative effects of video games, this study furthermore extends previous research by combining framing and third-person research. Results show that framing gaming in various ways indeed had an effect on participants’ attitudes towards game(r)s. This framing effect was moderated by individual video game use. Albeit identifying a traditional third-person effect regarding negative video game effects, we found framing to have no significant influence on the extent of third-person perceptions.",Top Competitive Papers in Game Studies,Game Studies
2014-0528,2014,Paper Session,Longitudinal Patterns of Problematic Computer Game Use Among Adolescents and Adults: A 2-Year Panel Study,3,"In past research, problematic computer game use has been linked to negative psycho-social outcomes such as loneliness, low life satisfaction or success in school. In this study, we investigated the longitudinal patterns (stability and change) of problematic game use as well as its psycho-social causes and consequences in different age groups. Using representative panel data (n = 902) from a 3-wave annual survey of German computer game users, we could show that very few respondents consistently exhibited symptoms of problematic game use across all waves. Changes in problematic gaming were not consistently related to changes in psycho-social well-being. Since our results indicate that problematic gaming is a far less stable condition than previously reported and not systematically related to negative changes in the gamers’ lives, researchers need to seriously reconsider whether problematic gaming by itself is a psychiatrically relevant condition.",Top Competitive Papers in Game Studies,Game Studies

An Empirical Study Among Older Adults Using Investigating Physiological, Preference, and Intention Measures",4,"This study investigates whether playing digitally-mediated fitness games such as Wii or Kinect exergames will indeed improve fitness of the elderly participants. Twenty-four elderly participants (aged 64 to 84 years old) were recruited to play on selected popular Wii and Kinect exergames designed with motion-sensing technologies. Factors investigated include physiological measures such as heart rate, shoulder range of motions and blood pressure as well as elderly participants’ psychological perceptions on these exergames. Exergames were found to be equivalent to light-intensity exercises, and hence posed no or minimal risk to the elderly participants. Although there is no conclusive evidence that exergames would help to increase shoulder flexibility, some elderly participants agreed that they stretched their arms more while playing the bowling game. Elderly participants had a positive attitude towards exergames compared to traditional, physical exercises as they believed there could be health benefits associated with engaging in exergaming on a regular basis. This is initial study and among the first to investigate if exergaming can indeed improve fitness among the elderly participants using some physiological and psychological measures.",Top Competitive Papers in Game Studies,Game Studies

Using the EU Kids Online dataset, including information on 8,581 adolescents (14-16 years) in 25 countries, and applying multilevel modeling, this study shows that social context has an additional and differential impact on male and female adolescents’ risky online behavior. When taking into account individual characteristics such as sensation seeking, growing up in a single-parent household and absence of parental co-use positively relates to online risk behavior, particularly for male adolescents. Also, adolescents, especially males, are less likely to participate in risky online behavior in societies where internet use is widespread. Overall, this study shows that it is important to take account of individual and social factors when explaining adolescents’ online risk taking and gender differences herein.",Gender and Identity Development in a Media-Rich Context,Children Adolescents and Media

It’s a Gender Stereotype!: Longitudinal Associations Between Viewing Superhero Programs in the Media and Gender Stereotyped Play in Preschool Children,5,"Although content analyses have found that superhero programs in the media portray strong gender stereotypes of masculinity, little research has examined the effects of viewing such programs. In the current study, 134 parents of preschool children reported their child’s superhero exposure in the media, gender stereotyped play, weapon play, and parental active mediation of the media at two time points (one year apart). Results revealed that superhero exposure was related to increased gender stereotyped play for boys and increased weapon play for both boys and girls from Time 1 to Time 2, even after controlling for initial levels. Parental active mediation did not negate these effects, and even served to strengthen some. Implications of the results are discussed with a focus on whether such programs are developmentally appropriate for preschool children.",Gender and Identity Development in a Media-Rich Context,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0532,2014,Paper Session,Negotiating Identity Through Media Use: Developmental Tasks and the Social Dimension of Using Audiovisual Media in Adolescence,1,"Audiovisual media content (e.g., movies, serials) provides a wide range of identity-related models (e.g., social roles, individual style), which teenagers can use to negotiate their self-concepts. Therefore, identity-related developmental tasks may contribute to explaining the intensity and functions of using audiovisual media during adolescence. Yet, it can be assumed that teenagers only draw on media models to differentiate their identity if they can integrate them into social interaction, especially with friends (through discussions and shared media use). Based on a survey with 373 German teenagers, it is shown that shared media use with friends can be better explained by developmental tasks than solitary use and discussions about audiovisual media. Specific identity-related functions (e.g., shared media use as a situational frame for experimenting with adult status and gender) significantly contribute to explaining how teenagers make sense of watching audiovisual media with peers as a means of addressing developmental tasks.",Gender and Identity Development in a Media-Rich Context,Children Adolescents and Media

And how have Arab girls’ encounters with commercial and independent princess media shaped their gendered identities? My paper—based on in-depth interviews with Arab female undergraduates in Qatar—explores these questions.

Taking Arab girls’ views about Disney’s Aladdin as a primary example, I argue that the gap between Disney’s perception of the Middle East and girls’ lived experience of it, is wide indeed. Yet my analysis also highlights how Arab girls are using Disney narratives as a springboard for new cultural productions more in line with their gendered concerns. Ultimately, in powerfully recasting gendered norms in their own creative stories and videos, girls in Qatar demonstrate they are active agents in the global march toward improving girls’ media—and by extension, the experiences of Arab youth in the Middle East and beyond.",Gender and Identity Development in a Media-Rich Context,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0534,2014,Paper Session,The Gendered Nature of News Consumption by Children and Youth,2,"This study examined the gendered nature of news consumption by children and youth in Israel, given the marginal role of women in the news world and the centrality of news in the construction of social life. A random sample of 931 8 and 11 year-old children completed a comprehensive survey about their news consumption in 2007. We found that girls are as interested in news as are boys and both genders use all media platforms to access news and have an interest in a wide variety of hard news topics such as war, terror, accidents, disasters, environmental issues, etc. Significant differences were found in the selection of a variety of news areas along traditional perceptions of “gender-appropriate” interests. As expected, girls were more family oriented in their news consumption, and reported higher levels of negative emotional reactions to news (fear, sadness). Girls were uniquely preoccupied with sexual crime, while boys seemed to be very marginally aware and/or concerned about that aspect of social life. The role that news stories may be playing in perpetuating such a strong sense of vulnerability and anxiety among girls as young as eight years old was particularly striking and requires further investigation.",Gender and Identity Development in a Media-Rich Context,Children Adolescents and Media

The Implications of ICT Use for the Social and Psychological Well-Being of Older Adults,2,"As information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been rapidly integrated into people’s everyday lives, inequalities among ICT users in grasping the benefits of ICTs have become crucial in determining their quality of life. Prior research has characterized these inequalities as a result of preexisting socioeconomic disparities. Older adults, as retired or isolated from society, have been excluded from the benefits of ICTs, as well as from the focus of ICT research. Addressing this research gap concerning the currently fastest growing sector of users, this study centers on the disparities regarding older adults’ ICT access and use. Drawing on surveys from 1,780 older adults, this research links older adults’ digital inequalities to their social and psychological well-being. We demonstrate that while socioeconomic status remains the major factor affecting their quality of life, social and instrumental ICT use can also contribute to their well-being in different ways.",Top Paper Session on Conference Theme,Theme Sessions

Results show that accesses to mobile Internet devices, diverse app use, especially recreational and work-related app use, are positively related to mobile cultural participation. The Hispanic lead, the reversed educational gap, and the disappeared urban-rural divide in mobile cultural participation suggest that it offers members of disadvantaged groups a more accessible venue for cultural participation. The stronger relationships between mobile Internet devices, in-person and mobile cultural participation among the less educated further support the mobilization rather than the normalization hypothesis.",Top Paper Session on Conference Theme,Theme Sessions

Further, the size and density of discussion networks concerning culture were positively associated with well-being and social support in general, while the heterogeneity of networks had a negative contribution. Based on the results, three major contributions to existing literature are discussed: first, differentiating between offline and online contexts of cultural capital; second, examining the value of the networks of communication about cultural information and experiences in addition to cultural capital itself; and third, understanding the implications of cultural capital in a college setting.",Top Paper Session on Conference Theme,Theme Sessions
2014-0539,2014,Paper Session,Media Regulation for Happiness: The Case of Bhutan,1,"The author spent three weeks in Bhutan in 2012 at the invitation of its Government to update its media laws and policies. Central to the recommendations was the Bhutanese notion of Gross National Happiness (GNH).

The paper discusses the challenges Bhutan faces in attempting to meet the lofty goals in the GNH, which has been operationalized into eight domains and 26 indicators. In reality, given the range of indicators, there are internal conflicts among the indicators.

Also, as a small country where not just “everyone knows everyone” but many are related to each other (there are a few very common names and surnames), it is difficult for institutions to be truly critical and independent.

This paper argues that notwithstanding these challenges, the Bhutan case offers an interesting counterpoise to ponder—whether media policy might be crafted for the good of a society.",Top Paper Session on Conference Theme,Theme Sessions

Connectives (i.e. words like because and therefore) are found to make texts easier to process, but its influence on persuasiveness of health education materials has not been examined yet. In this study we focused both the main effect of connectives on attitude and intention and its indirect effect through text appreciation. We conducted a two-condition experiment (connectives vs. no connectives) that included a pre-measurement, immediate post-measurement, and delayed post-measurement at secondary schools for students with severe learning difficulties. Connectives had no effect on text appreciation, but text appreciation and connectives did have a negative effect on attitude and intention. However, these effects were only found for the delayed post-measurement. We conclude that connectives increase the persuasiveness of educational materials for low educated adolescents.",Teenage Health and the Good Life: Health Issues Among Adolescents and Young Adults,Health Communication

Social competence is both a protective factor against SUD and, in its deficiency, a risk factor for SUD. To explore the link between social competence and SUD, the current study aimed to measure the social competence of residents of a youth treatment center and to compare the results to those of a normed sample. Addiction counselors completed the Home and Community Social Behavior Scales (HCSBS) on 54 youth in residential addiction treatment. Results showed that males were significantly more likely than females to be in the ‘at risk’ category for social competence and, in particular, for peer relations.

The two message attributes were tobacco industry attacks (anger) and disgusting images. Industry attack ads were adapted from the American Legacy Foundation anti-tobacco campaign, which showed tobacco company executives as deceitful, dishonest, and manipulative. A 2 x 2 within-subjects experiment was conducted, where participant watched anti-tobacco messages that varied in the amount of anger and disgust content. The results of this study suggest that the combination of both anger and disgust content in anti-tobacco television ads have significant effects on resources allocated to encoding the messages, on recognition memory, and on emotional responses. In concordance with recent fear appeal research, messages high in anger and disgust accelerated heart rate, worsened recognition memory, and reduced corrugator responses. These findings indicate that messages high in both anger and disgust showed signs of cognitive withdrawal and descent into a defensive cascade reflective of defensive processing and message responses.",Talking Tobacco: Cognition and Emotional Messages,Health Communication

In particular, this research focuses on the kinds of science sources used and the kinds of other sources used in such stories. This study examines whether the use of scientific sources in climate change coverage in the Great Lakes region may be related to factors such as geographic location, reporting frequency, and authorship. The results show that scientific sources are underrepresented as sources in news stories. The finding also brings out the problems of source selection process. While most scientists cited are global warming believers, and while relatively few stories use climate change skeptics, more non-scientists than scientists are selected as skeptic sources to discuss climate change. But when skeptics are used, their views are more likely to appear in a more prominent location in the news content than sources believing in it.","Climate Change in the News: Regional, National, and International Perspectives",Environmental Communication

We reliably identified and quantified the occurrence of 118 image themes. We then hierarchically clustered the themes based on their co-occurrence in images to identify 42 image frames. We highlight certain frames associated with particular types of images (e.g., photographs, maps) or geographic regions. From among the full set of frames, we identify 14 that commonly appear in US climate change news imagery and discuss the ways in which image frames make salient (or render invisible) particular categories of people, geographic regions, aspects of science, and spheres of activity.","Climate Change in the News: Regional, National, and International Perspectives",Environmental Communication

This study analyzes the manner in which Latin American and Spanish online media presented news on climate change during the Conferences of the Parties (United Nations Climate Change Conferences) in Cancun (2010) and Durban (2011). This study involved a content analysis of 889 news items from 97 online media outlets. Consistent with previous research, the findings show that media attention decreased in 2011, the principal sources for these news items are politicians and almost half of the news came from news agencies. When politicians, scientists, victims or activists appear, there is a trend for the news item to have a specific position (conformity/confrontation). However, in those articles in which witnesses are included, the trend is the opposite. The study concluded that the media coverage of climate change does not respond to local needs and that further qualitative analysis is required.","Climate Change in the News: Regional, National, and International Perspectives",Environmental Communication

This study advances research on MTSs by exploring the relational dynamics that unfold within and between teams, and their consequences for success. We hypothesize the generative mechanisms that shape the emergence of communication sequences in MTSs. We then compare the mechanisms that distinguish the most and least successful MTSs based on performance at the team and MTS level. We analyzed communication logs and in-game performance metrics from 28, 20-person MTSs performing a humanitarian aid task. Results indicate that MTSs shared some generative mechanisms in common but varied on others. When mechanisms unfold such that between-team communication influences subsequent within-team communication (intra-team representation & gatekeeping), performance is maximized at the team level.

This study addressed these issues by using a different and more in-depth history induction and testing some discrepancies in the relationship between idea quality and idea quantity using 42, three-person brainstorming groups. Results indicate that brainstorming groups given an adequate amount of time (ten weeks) to develop a working history did generate more ideas and higher quality ideas than zero-history groups.

An Exploratory Perspective on Media Choice Processes for Smartphone Apps,3,"Developments in decision-making theories have argued that many daily decisions – be they media selection or otherwise – are the result of heuristic rather than deliberate processes. Given the ubiquity of smartphones as mobile communication and computing devices along with the vast smartphone app market, our study aimed to understand how heuristics might guide smartphone app use. Observing 49 smartphone users viewing 189 total apps, the current study identified five decision-making heuristics used to download a variety of smartphone apps (flashlight, running, dictionary). Of these, four were variants of a “Take the First” (TtF) heuristics that allowed smartphone users to quickly navigate the app market, bypassing a good deal of informational cues in order to download apps that were highly rated or ranked. Reliance on heuristic processing is useful in helping navigate the vast app market, but it also results in smartphone users overlooking potentially important app information (such as privacy settings).",Mobile Phones and Social Behaviors,Communication and Technology
2014-0558,2014,Paper Session,A Comparative Analysis of Convergent Media: Audio Versus Video on Mobile,2,"Acoustic media has intrigued and delighted the interpretation industry for decades. From a technologically determinant perspective, media tools during the “audio tour” era allowed the rich production and distribution of sounds in ways in which other media forms -- such as video or animation -- could not, providing a competitive advantage for audio in the media ecology of augmented places. Mobile technology today, though, can just as efficiently and effectively deliver different media -- video, for example -- to users in situ, leveling the mobile mediascape, and raising questions about the traditional positioning of acoustic media. This study examines such interpretation contexts from a Medium Theory perspective by briefly outlining the historical progression of place-based media and new affordances of mobile media, with a comparative analysis included that directly contrasts mobile audio and video presentations in the field at a historic attraction.",Mobile Phones and Social Behaviors,Communication and Technology
2014-0559,2014,Paper Session,Mobile Phone Use to Manage Negative and Positive Emotion,2,"Smart-phone users (N=204, aged 18-71) were recruited from a survey panel to complete an online questionnaire. They described times they had used their phone to reduce negative emotion and maintain/extend positive emotion, and rated several measures, including emotion regulation via phone and expected responses to loss of phone. Both social contact and media/content were important in managing emotions via phone, but social contact facilitated all methods of emotion regulation: reappraisal/support, distraction, savoring positive emotion. Greater use of the phone for distraction was associated with expecting to miss media/content. Habitual emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal, distraction) were associated with greater use of these methods to manage emotion via phone. Finally, well-being was associated with greater use of the phone for reappraisal/support (and marginally greater use of distraction and savoring) – but only among those with less positive recent affect. Interpretations and implications of the findings are discussed.",Mobile Phones and Social Behaviors,Communication and Technology
2014-0560,2014,Paper Session,"Detecting Deception in Text Messaging: The Role of Context, Relationships, the Lie, and the Liar",5,"Text messaging has become wildly popular in the United States, and it has some unique characteristics that may impact interpersonal communication such as deception. Here we report how deception detection operates in text messaging, specifically exploring the roles of context, relationship closeness, message content, and one’s liar type on deception detection. We addressed these questions using a novel data collection method which relied on the archives of undergraduate students’ sent text messages. We find that people are overall accurate at identifying text messages, primarily because most texts are truthful. For those text messages that are deceptive our participants performed poorly in identifying them, correctly identifying less than 20% of lies. Beyond this central contribution, this study also demonstrates that the other factors described above are important for assessing text messages, which adds an important dimension to the deception detection research.",Mobile Phones and Social Behaviors,Communication and Technology
2014-0561,2014,Paper Session,"Frailty, Thy Name is Online Privacy Opinion? Experimental Approach to Solve Privacy Paradox",2,"This study examines why ordinary online users highly concerned about misuse of personal information do not take privacy-protective behaviors, or even take risky behaviors on the Internet. However, given that people have fewer chances to directly experience ‘privacy infringement’ and are less familiar with technical terms, their opinion estimated in conventional polls tends to be instantaneous reaction, lacking thoughtfulness, toward a survey questionnaire. By adopting counterargument experiment (Sniderman et al., 1991), this study found three important findings: (1) People’s online privacy opinion is swayed by encountered counter-argued message, and (2) such persuasion is promoted among people with low level of online knowledge or evaluating the provided message’s argument strong. Also (3) the privacy paradox is found in conventional polls but disappears in counter-argument conditions. Findings imply that online privacy opinion should not be estimated in conventional polls and alternative polls (e.g., deliberative polls) should be adopted for online privacy policy-making.",Privacy Paradox of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology
2014-0562,2014,Paper Session,Is the Privacy Paradox a Relict of the Past? An In-Depth Analysis of Privacy Attitudes and Privacy Behaviors,1,"The privacy paradox states that online privacy behaviors cannot be explained successfully by privacy attitudes and privacy concerns. In this study, the paradox will be reconsidered in light of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) by further elaborating on its underlying informational, social and psychological privacy dimensions. In six research questions, it was asked if the privacy paradox still exists. Further, It was surmised that privacy attitudes would have a direct as well as an indirect relation with privacy behaviors (H1 and H2), and that privacy concerns would also have an indirect relation with privacy behaviors (H3). The results showed that the privacy paradox still exists when applying former research designs. All three hypotheses were confirmed: When using the TPB in a novel and a multidimensional approach, privacy behaviors can be explained successfully with privacy attitudes. Also, Privacy concerns remain relevant, because indirectly they also relate to privacy behaviors.",Privacy Paradox of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

The authors argue that this finding might be due to methodological reasons: privacy attitudes are a broad concept that was linked to very specific behaviors. In this paper, we thus address the privacy paradox from a different perspective: instead of attitudes, do concrete experiences on SNSs lead to a change in behavior? In a longitudinal study, N = 327 respondents were surveyed. It was found that after negative experiences, users did change their informational privacy behavior and also their risk assessment of potential further negative experiences. Respondents did not change their psychological privacy behavior. A trend towards a change of the social privacy behavior was found.",Privacy Paradox of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

Using an eye tracking device, the study examines how users read the policy, and how reading a policy, in turn, helps users better understand the ways their personal information is being treated and the limitations of a service with the use of personal data.
Results show that when a privacy policy is presented as a default, participants tend to dwell on it significantly and better understand its principals, while when given the option to sign their agreement without reading the policy, most participants skip on reading it completely. Surprisingly, participants who actively chose to read the policy spent significantly much less time and effort on reading it than participants who were presented with the statement as a default.",Privacy Paradox of Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

Previous studies have shown that politicians appearing in these programs are interviewed in an overwhelmingly positive manner. Therefore, it is likely that audience perceptions of politicians are affected by watching such talk show interviews. Using two experiments, we show that exposure to interviews with politicians in this kind of talk shows positively affects the trust people have in their political representatives. This effect is stronger as people are less aware of politics. The trust of people who know more about politics hardly seems to be affected by watching feel-good talk shows featuring politicians.",Audience Perceptions of Media Sources and Political Interest,Mass Communication

Based on a theoretical integration of entertainment theory with theories of motivated information processing, we suggest that entertainment consumption can either be driven by hedonic, escapist motivations associated with a superficial mode of information processing, or by eudaimonic, truth-seeking motivations that prompt more elaborate forms of processing. Results of two experiments indicate that eudaimonic forms of emotional involvement (characterized by negative valence, moderate arousal, and feeling moved) stimulated reflective thoughts about politically relevant content, issue interest, and information seeking. This pattern was consistent across two types of entertainment stimuli (fictional films and soft news), and two types of affect manipulations (moving film music and moving exemplars).",Audience Perceptions of Media Sources and Political Interest,Mass Communication
2014-0567,2014,Paper Session,Politicians’ Perceptions of Biased News Media: A Hostile Media Phenomenon Approach,3,"There is limited knowledge about why political actors are dissatisfied with journalism. This paper attempts to answer this question by pointing to individual-level perceptual processes of politicians. We argue that part of politicians’ unease with the media can be explained by the hostile media phenomenon (HMP). Originally developed in audience research, the HMP refers to a process by which highly involved individuals tend to perceive media coverage as biased against their own views. Based on a survey of politicians (N = 199) in three European countries, we demonstrate that the HMP also holds for political actors. Furthermore, we show that the HMP makes politicians less likely to contact journalists and more likely to use conflict and drama to gain public attention. Finally, the HMP decreases politicians’ trust in democracy by fostering the belief that the public is not adequately informed about political matters. Theoretical and societal consequences are discussed.",Audience Perceptions of Media Sources and Political Interest,Mass Communication

This study developed and tested a measure of earnestness using three dimensions – perceived helping, goodwill and responsiveness. Media figures Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert were used as the target sources in this study due to the similar nature of their television programs emphasizing political satire and because they were believed to differ in earnestness. Stewart, who appears to portray himself on his program, was predicted to be more earnest than Colbert, who plays another character – that of a conservative pundit. Results confirmed this prediction. Earnestness also significantly positively predicted trust and positive descriptions of a particular source. Discussed is the utility of this new measure in study of both political and non-political sources – those featured as media figures but also those portrayed in media content.",Audience Perceptions of Media Sources and Political Interest,Mass Communication

Multinational collaboration has created a situation that some see as a problem and others see as an opportunity. Intercultural teamwork involves a dynamic push-pull tension between diversity and unity which places its study solidly within a dialectic perspective.
In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 individuals who held management or supervisory positions, worked on multinational teams, and spent time working abroad. Their companies represent a broad range of industries and collectively, these individuals worked on teams in several dozen countries across the globe.
The results explore a variety of cultural paradoxes and dialectics. The importance of cultural identity and relationship recur throughout participant narratives. Dialectics include self-other validation, autonomy-connection, national-organizational culture, ambiguity-certainty, efficiency redundancy, and direct-indirect communication styles. Intersections among dialectics are also identified.",Studies on Traits and Behaviors in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

Two studies were conducted, with participants reporting English as their native language and reporting on FLCA in a second language (Study 1) and with participants who spoke a variety of languages as their native language and reported on FLCA when speaking in English (Study 2). In both studies, the foreign language anxiety scale (FLAS) demonstrated construct validity, as it was internally reliable and factored into a unidimensional scale. Additionally, FLAS demonstrated convergent and divergent validity, and concurrent validity by predicting the number of places that participants used the foreign language, even after controlling for demographics, foreign language ability, and general CA. Interestingly, the relationship between FLAS the number of places that the foreign language was used was in opposite directions in the two samples.",Studies on Traits and Behaviors in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

2014-0572,2014,Paper Session,What is Stopping Them From Racial Mixing?,1,"The study looks into attitudes toward and perceptions of interracial dating relationships among college students. This study lays out the preliminary knowledge about who is likely to engage in interracial premarital relationships and what the barriers are to entering interracial romantic relationships, both of which are meaningful precursors to understanding and predicting further interracial relationships, such as marriage. Specifically, by showing that there are distinct social and psychological factors, such as social pressure or anxiety from interracial interaction, which predict the extent of involvement in interracial dating relationships, the study adds to the literature in three ways. Examining interracial dating relationships will contribute to the understanding of interracial marriage patterns in general. Second, by focusing on the socio-psychological factors predicting interracial dating relationships, it differentiates the global attitudes toward interracial dating from the personal attitudes to engage in interracial dating. Lastly, by paying attention to in-group socio-psychological factors like perceived social pressure/support, the efforts can improve ethical minority groups’ adjustment to predominantly white societies beyond the romantic relationships.",Studies on Traits and Behaviors in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

Using a common education tactic in skin cancer education, which has also been used in public health communication efforts, an experiment was conducted to determine the influence of varying the visual exemplar presentation: singular exemplar, juxtaposition, or multiple comparisons. Compared to a control condition, the visual exemplification proved to be more effective at increasing affective response as well as behavioral intentions to perform skin self-examination. Further, participant perception of congruency between the images and text interacted to explain part of the differences in behavioral intention change. A surprise response was found to mediate the relationship between visual exemplification and behavioral intention change, although investigation of potential moderated mediation found no such relationship.

However, the effects of visual news frames on attributional processes and on recipients’ attitudes toward scandalized individuals (e.g., politicians/managers) remain unclear. An experiment (N=166) with four groups (G1-G4) was conducted to analyze potential effects of frequently used visual frames in mediated scandals. All participants read an identical news article (financial scandal). Visual frames were systematically altered. G1 received a frame of the scandalized manager with negative visual cues (police/handcuffs), G2 received the same picture without negative cues and G3 a picture of a financial firm (employer of manager). G4/control group received no visual. A MANOVA showed significant visual framing effects (attribution of responsibility/attitudes toward manager).

2014-0577,2014,Paper Session,Terrorism as Spectacle: It’s All for the Audience,1,"This paper analyzes terrorism from the framework of ""spectacle"" (Debord, 1995). In this context, ""spectacle"" is a historical event that looks like a political drama, theater, or even a play. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were played out as a script, mise en scène, and choreography. Terrorism can be a disaster or horror movie. This is made possible thanks to around-the-clock news and media images. Of particular importance is the ability of terrorism to command the audience's gaze. As a spectacle, a terrorist act becomes a type of theater; it is a performance to be seen. Electronic communications (television in particular) allow the immediate worldwide exposure of the terrorist spectacle. The purpose is to plant images – usually gory and frightening – in the audience's collective memory. These images are seen, recorded, and usually unforgettable. The spectacle, then, becomes a ""Culture of Terror"" (media images of horror and destruction).",Perception and Effectiveness of Visual Messages,Visual Communication Studies

It confirmed a three-part typology of message strategies – corporate ability (CA), corporate social responsibility (CSR) and hybrid – exists in corporate online social networking communication. As predicted, when corporations communicated in wall posts using CA strategies, related wall comments showed publics demonstrated greater CA associations and product evaluations than CSR associations and company evaluations. Likewise, when corporations communicated using CSR strategies, comments showed publics demonstrated greater CSR associations than CA associations. This study provides evidence of corporate strategies and consumer associations and evaluations as they exist in the digital market, topics thus far examined primarily in lab experiments or in the one-way communication of corporate websites.

the public relations function towards a strategic management function in two organizations. The change processes in these organizations involved both a re-orientation of the purpose of the public relations function, but also a physical relocation of the professionals to a centralized function. The professional identity construction processes of public relations professionals are illustrated to be embedded in a macro discourse of strategic management, and characterized by tensions that create resistance to organizational control, influence the identity construction, and ultimately effect organizational transformation.
The results provide an alternative view on the construction of public relations identity as dependent on discourses on macro, meso and micro level, organizational factors and individual understandings of the role.

Mass Effect as a Case Study to Understand the Influence of Players’ Moral Intuitions on Adherence to Hero or Antihero Play Styles,2,"This research examines relationships regarding moral foundations and moral decisions in the Mass Effect video game series. The findings suggest that moral foundation predicts what type of moral decisions a player will make during play. This research reports an online survey (N = 147) that asked participants the importance of their moral foundations, along with the moral path, either traditionally heroic (paragon) or traditionally antiheroic (renegade), they chose in their first time playing through the Mass Effect series. The results indicate that most players, even when given the opportunity to behave immorally, choose to engage in moral virtual behaviors, and moral foundations predict the extent to which players engage in traditionally immoral/moral virtual behavior. These findings are discussed in light of game design and the potential for game designers to use morality as a game mechanic beyond violence and justice considerations and into realms of more meaningful moral situations in game narratives, as well as the relevance to research on meaningful experiences in games.","Understanding the Good Life Through Our Gaming and Identities: Action, Perception, and Relation",Game Studies

In particular, the connection between player and avatar is understood as influencing a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioral play phenomena. Divergent approaches examine this connection from both parasocial (one-way, non-dialectical) and social (two-way, dialectical) perspectives. This study examined how player-avatar connections may be better understood by integrating an existing parasocial approach (character attachment; CA) with a social approach (player-avatar relationships; PAR). A quantitative linguistic analysis of player interviews revealed statistically robust associations among language patterns, dimensions of CA, and PAR types. Validating and extending prior research, findings highlight the importance of self-differentiation and anthropomorphization in suspending disbelief so that the avatar may be taken as a fully social agent.","Understanding the Good Life Through Our Gaming and Identities: Action, Perception, and Relation",Game Studies

2014-0586,2014,Paper Session,The Influence of Physical Activity Habits on Observed Video Game Travel Mode Decisions,3,"A growing area of video game research considers factors external to games that might predict both observed in-game and physical world decisions. One factor may be an individual’s habitual behaviors, such as their physical activity routines. Because we tend to automate behaviors that we repeat in stable circumstances or contexts, virtual re-creations of those stimuli should prompt the same behavior in the game environment. Moreover, as virtual worlds become more similar to the physical world, behaviors we learn in physical reality might influence virtual behaviors. We ask two research questions: (RQ1) Is there an association between real-world habits and in-game decisions? (RQ2) Does the nature of the in-game task influence any relationship between real-world habits and in-game decisions? A quasi-experiment of 110 students at a large, mid-Atlantic university demonstrated that physical activity routines bias in-game transportation decisions, particularly when prompted to pursue a specific goal over a free exploration task.","Understanding the Good Life Through Our Gaming and Identities: Action, Perception, and Relation",Game Studies

However, stereotypes are still prevalent in game culture. This study aims to gain insight into these practices by looking at gaming stereotypes on two different, yet interrelated, levels. First, we inquire into perceptions of gamers regarding gender-related and general gamer stereotypes and how these relate to playing frequency. Second, game genre choice is investigated in light of player’s gender and how this is associated with playing motivations. Results of a survey study (N = 962) suggest that high frequency male players hold the least stereotypical ideas about digital gamers, while high frequency female players disagree the most with gender-related stereotypical beliefs. Additionally, we found that high frequency female players are more strongly drawn towards specific game genres, suggesting that playing motives of these gamers are higher than their beliefs that gaming is a typically male pursuit.","Understanding the Good Life Through Our Gaming and Identities: Action, Perception, and Relation",Game Studies

Such demonization of this condition appears callous and out-of-touch with today’s seemingly sympathetic culture, but representations of infertility in horror films reveal prejudice lurking beneath society’s veneer of compassion for childless women. Film history and feminist theory analyze traumatic birth in cinematic horror. Far fewer studies, however, investigate the cinematic interpretation of a woman’s struggle to achieve that birth. This project considers representations of infertility on film, particularly these depictions situated within frameworks of horror. Horror plays on persistent stereotypes of infertile women as selfish, as turning playing God via science, and as resorting to creating unnatural families. Given these tropes and their staying power decades after adoption of fertility medication and in-vitro fertilization, has empathy for infertility truly pervaded society, or do cinematic representations indicate latent fears and prejudices?",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

But the design of smartphones seems to encourage shooting vertical video. This essay examines the aesthetic desirability of vertical videos through applied media aesthetics. It traces the history of horizontal film and television orientations, as well as the image-centric orientation model found it still photography. It argues that vertical video, rather than an syndrome to be avoided, instead takes advantage of the technological innovations and embodied pleasures offered by the smartphone to rupture the visual paradigms and create a new visual aesthetic for phone-based moving images.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0593,2014,Paper Session,Determinants of Self-Rated Health and Health Information Efficacy of Migrants Living in South Korea,2,"This study explores the determinants of self-rated health and health information efficacy of Chosunjok living in South Korea as migrants. Various factors such as socioeconomic factors, network factors, and acculturation were examined as determinants considering the circumstances of Chosunjok in the society of Korea. Self-rated health was measured in two dimensions, self-rated subjective health and self-rated objective health. Health information efficacy was assessed in three dimensions, general health information efficacy, high-level health information efficacy, and internet health information efficacy. The results showed that acculturation strategy was an important determinant for migrants of Korea, especially assimilation and integration was significant at all the dimensions of health information efficacy. Segregation influenced only self-rated objective health negatively and marginalization affected only self-rated subjective health negatively. Based on these interesting findings, the meaning of network factors with local people and the positive perspective both on host country and on native country were discussed.",Health Information-Seeking and Processing Research,Health Communication
2014-0594,2014,Paper Session,Examining Patterns and Motivations for Drug-Related Information Seeking and Scanning Behavior Among University Students,4,"Research has explored information seeking and scanning in the context of cancer screening and prevention behaviors. However, the literature has not yet examined seeking and scanning for drug-related information, which may impact perceptions and attitudes, and shape drug use trajectories among young people. This study uses a grounded theory approach to explore dimensions of active information seeking efforts (seeking) and passive information acquisition (scanning) for drug-related information among a sample of 39 Israeli University students. Results of semi-structured interviews suggest that information scanning and seeking about marijuana and amphetamines are common, particularly from peers and from the Internet. The analysis uncovers themes relating to young people’s cross-source information acquisition, movement across interpersonal and media sources, and motivations for engaging in active efforts to seek drug-related information. The study extends past research on information seeking by illustrating how this behavior shapes drug-related perceptions and may shape drug trajectories among young people.",Health Information-Seeking and Processing Research,Health Communication
2014-0595,2014,Paper Session,Reducing Unrealistic Optimism About Alcohol-Related Problems Among College Students: The Relative Efficacy of Narrative and Informational Messages With Self-Affirmation,1,"In the context of college binge drinking, this study examines two intervention approaches designed to improve risk decision-making, particularly among unrealistic optimists: (1) reducing the level of self-defense motives (using self-affirmation) before exposure to risk information that challenges unrealistic optimism, and (2) providing a vicarious experience about negative health consequences through a narrative depicting a person who shares a similar risk profile with the audience. To specify for whom and under what circumstances each approach is most likely to be effective, we identify the presence of unrealistic optimism at the individual level by comparing perceived risk to actual risk based on self-reported behavior. Results suggest providing risk information to unrealistic optimists that challenges their comparative optimism, while concomitantly protecting their self-concept via self-affirmation or via narratives, may reduce biased processing and help to correcting their perceived risk. Transportation and identification were the mechanisms through which unrealistic optimists realized their vulnerability.",Health Information-Seeking and Processing Research,Health Communication
2014-0596,2014,Paper Session,Health Communication in an Ageing Society: Towards a Conceptual Framework to Understand Information Recall in Older Adults,1,"This article presents a new perspective on the linkages between health communication, aging and information recall. Information recall is considered a key outcome of health communication, because it largely determines whether patients follow the advices given. We introduce a conceptual framework for older adults' processing of medical information that can deal with current and future developments in the health communication landscape. To develop this framework, (a) we use an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, drawing on theories from communication science, health psychology and gerontology, (b) we theorize how tailored mediated and interpersonal communication can predict information processing, resulting in optimal information recall and; (c) identify specific factors that affect information processing (e.g., age and age-related factors in ability and motivation, anxiety, characteristics of interpersonal communication and communication evaluation). The article ends with a brief summary of where future research is headed and novel developments in the study of health communication in an ageing society.",Health Information-Seeking and Processing Research,Health Communication
2014-0597,2014,Paper Session,Consequences of Failure to Acknowledge Individual Responsibility in Narratives to Promote Obesity-Reducing Policies,3,"This study tests whether messages designed to increase support for obesity-related public policies should explicitly acknowledge individual responsibility while emphasizing environmental determinants of obesity. We use a web-based, randomized experiment with a national sample of American adults (N = 718) to test hypotheses derived from theory and research on narrative persuasion. Results indicate that respondents exposed to messages that acknowledged individual responsibility while emphasizing environmental determinants of obesity were less likely to counterargue the message and felt more empathy for the story’s main character than those exposed to a message that did not acknowledge individual responsibility. Counterarguing and affective empathy fully mediated the relationship between randomized message condition and support for policies to reduce rates of obesity, suggesting that these variables play a key role in shaping responses to narratives to increase obesity-related policy support. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical considerations of this research.",Health Narratives and Messages,Health Communication
2014-0598,2014,Paper Session,"Complicating Relationships Between Exposure to Narrative Messages, Intentions to Talk About the Message, and Intentions to Engage in Healthy Sleep Behavior",1,"There is growing empirical and theoretical attention to the role of conversation in response to health-promoting messages and campaigns. Several scholars suggest that narrative messages are uniquely positioned to generate conversation, which in turn should increase the likelihood of message effects on health-related intentions and behavior. Using a randomized experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial design (narrative vs. non narrative, positive vs. negative emotional tone) with an offset control group, we find evidence that narratives elicited greater message-related talk intentions than informational messages in the context of sleep promotion messages among a high school audience. At the same time, we found evidence that a sizeable proportion of respondents that intended to talk about the messages generated largely unfavorable thoughts about it. Those with talk intentions and unfavorable thoughts had lower intentions to engage in healthy sleep behavior than those who did not intend to talk, while those with talk intentions and favorable thoughts had more positive intentions to sleep. Results are consistent with, yet complicate, our understanding of the roles of narrative messages and conversation in response to messages designed to promote healthy behavior.",Health Narratives and Messages,Health Communication
2014-0599,2014,Paper Session,Do the Ends Justify the Means? A Test of Alternatives to the FDA Proposed Cigarette Warning Labels,4,"This paper seeks to provide empirical, social scientific tests of alternatives to the originally proposed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cigarette package warning labels on health risk beliefs, perceived fear, and effectiveness. Results from three studies examine research questions based on legal disputes surrounding these warning labels, including the mediating role of health risk beliefs and perceived fear in shaping their effectiveness. The first study featured non-smoking young adults (who may be at risk for future smoking), while the second and third studies sampled adult daily smokers. Each study was a randomized experiment with five warning label image conditions. Results consistently indicate that graphic warning labels (in both color and black-and-white) appear more effective than other, less-restrictive strategies, largely due to their effects in promoting increased perceptions of fear. We conclude with a discussion of the results, highlighting implications, public policy considerations, and suggestions for future research.",Health Narratives and Messages,Health Communication

A random sample of women aged 25-45 was surveyed before, two weeks after, and six months after viewing a narrative film about Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and vaccination. Regressions controlling for race/ethnicity and pre-test levels of extended parallel processing model (EPPM) constructs found that the more personally relevant women found the narrative, the higher the perceived severity of the virus and perceived response efficacy of the vaccine. At two weeks, identifying with characters was negatively associated with perceived severity, but positively associated with perceived susceptibility to HPV. At six months, identification was significantly associated with perceived threat. Implications for narrative health messaging are discussed.",Health Narratives and Messages,Health Communication

By combining linguistic theories on speech acts and non-reality, the article seeks to bring clarity on the fuzzy concepts of guessing, conjecturing, predicting and speculating which have previously (Jaworski et al. 2003, Neiger 2007) been handled as presupposed and, to some extent, undefined categories, although they are often hard to distinguish from each other and from other speech acts dealing with future events. This leads to a set of operationalized definitions which are tested for intercoder reliability (Krippendorff’s α = 0.88) on a case corpus (n = 1939 sentences). The article concludes by emphasizing the necessity of elaborate definitions and a testing device when dealing with speech acts in content analysis.",Journalism and its Future: Perspectives on Change,Journalism Studies

Dwelling on a quantitative diachronic analysis of the newspapers with a national range for the democratic period, complemented with qualitative interviews of key actors with insightful knowledge of the Portuguese press, the main purpose of the study is to map the reasons for success and failure of press titles over the last 35 years and by so doing advance a specific empirical model to be applied to other national contexts. It concludes that besides the existence of more overall entries in the market than demises in different segments, the home media is undergoing a transitional period somewhat comparable to the one following the demise of the dictatorship in the early 1970s.",Journalism and its Future: Perspectives on Change,Journalism Studies

By digital transition we refer to the shift to publishing content on digital platforms. Japan is globally one of the most important newspaper markets with the world’s largest daily newspapers circulation-wise. The research focusing on the digital transition in Japanese newspapers and the implications of the newspaper crisis in Japan has been hitherto almost non-existent. In the paper, the digital transition is examined by analyzing results from a qualitative in-depth interview study with representatives from the Japanese national newspapers. The conclusion based on the empirical analysis is that for the Japanese newspapers the most essential strategy in coping with the digital transition is protecting the printed paper and treating the digital platforms as supplementary.",Journalism and its Future: Perspectives on Change,Journalism Studies

We examine the reasons journalists give for leaving journalism or remaining in it, and the destinations they choose. We base this examination on a sample of 60 life histories of active and former Israeli journalists. We analyze this sample using the “Exit, Voice and Loyalty” typology developed by Albert Hirschman. We argue that applying this typology to the data suggests the easy availability of exit routes out of journalism together with journalists' difficulty in voicing their occupational concerns within news organizations, given their chaotic organizational structure, contributed to news organizations’ passive response to the crisis.",Journalism and its Future: Perspectives on Change,Journalism Studies

Using CIC as a variable, the data show that, among the nations studied, CIC concerning foreign countries covered in the news is generally stronger than CIC regarding topics in the news. At the same time, the analysis examines whether the level of CIC relates to several national, media system, and audience characteristics. The analysis shows that larger nations exhibit higher levels of CIC regarding topics and lower levels of CIC regarding countries. Interestingly, the more commercialized the television system is and the greater the focus on soft news, the lower the CIC regarding news topics.

Based on this development with this paper we aim to contribute to the debate about the assumed journalistic adaption of audience news selection criteria. Applying the concept of media logic and the news value theory we conducted a content analysis comparing the selection of different journalistic media (online news site, offline tabloid, and offline quality newspaper) and in different online user rankings (most viewed and social media activity). Our results show more similarities than differences between the news selection of the internet audience and journalistic media in terms of news values. However, concerning the topic preferences there is some distinction. These findings support certain implications regarding the relationship between media logic, different media formats, and audience news selection criteria.",The Perceptions of Journalists and the Perceptions of Audiences,Journalism Studies

Survey data on the sources of journalists’ audience image suggest that especially their presumptions of media effects on the audience should be coined by unsystematically gathered knowledge and subjective-intuitive judgments. At the same time, research shows that these presumptions must be considered important factors for the formation of journalistic coverage. However, the ways in which journalists’ presumptions of media effects evolve and take effect are diverse and have not been systematically examined. This article offers a first step in this direction by developing a framework of the interrelations between the different dimensions, determinants, and consequences of journalists’ presumptions of media effects.",The Perceptions of Journalists and the Perceptions of Audiences,Journalism Studies

However, little is known about the extent to which these efforts may have adverse implications. The present study attempts to investigate the influence of journalists’ social media activities (specifically, self-disclosure and interaction with audience users) on audience perceptions of them as journalists, and in turn, audience perceptions of their news products. An experiment (N=267) revealed that: 1) although both self-disclosure and interaction positively influenced audience perceptions in the personal dimension, interaction significantly harmed audience perceptions in the professional dimension; 2) perceptions of journalists transferred to perceptions of their news products; and 3) self-disclosure moderated the influence of interaction on personal-dimension perceptions such that the positive effect was strongest in the low-disclosure and high-interaction condition. This moderating relationship was not found for professional-dimension perceptions.",The Perceptions of Journalists and the Perceptions of Audiences,Journalism Studies

Attachment style thus influences how individuals use Facebook for social interactions to satisfy their need for relatedness, which further leads to various psychological outcomes and levels of social capital. The results of this study supported the hypotheses and showed that individuals with a secure attachment style are motivated to engage in interactions with different types of friends on Facebook, have higher relatedness need satisfaction, and have better psychological outcomes than individuals with anxious and avoidant attachment styles. Avoidant-style individuals do not employ Facebook for social interactions and have less psychological well-being and lower online and offline communication frequency and quality. Anxious-style individuals seek social connections through Facebook but are not satisfied with their social lives.

The present study investigated the question of who in particular uses the self-presentational opportunities of this feature and which users engage in riskier self-disclosures than others. In a combination of questionnaire (N = 172) and content analysis, we related self-reports on users’ personality traits (extraversion, narcissism, self-efficacy, need to belong, need for popularity) to the actual use of Facebook status updates. Result showed that higher degrees of narcissism led to deeper self-disclosures and more self-promotional content within these messages. Users with higher need to belong disclosed more intimate information in status updates, while perceived efficacy of self-presentation was negatively related to the mass suitability of postings. Findings extend prior research on personality and SNS usage with regard to dynamic features and content differences in online self-presentation.",Psychological Variables Associated With Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

This study also examined how loneliness was related to each of these variables and moderated their associations. Self-activities appeared more important than friends-activities in networking usefulness and affinity. However, the importance varied by levels of loneliness. As for less lonely people, self- and friends-activities were equally important in networking usefulness. On the other hand, for lonely people, self-activities significantly predicted networking usefulness, while friends-activities did not. Also, the association between self-activities and friends-activities was weaker for the lonely than the less lonely. In addition, lonely people had fewer Facebook friends and showed lower levels of self- and friends-activities and networking usefulness. The results indicate that lonelier people use Facebook more self-oriented ways.",Psychological Variables Associated With Social Media Use,Communication and Technology

Our study builds upon the emerging research on habit, automaticity, and media use in an attempt to explain why many individuals believe that such behavior is dangerous but engage in it anyway. Our survey study (N = 776) of college students (n = 255) and adults (n = 521) revealed the “acting with awareness” to be the best predictor of texting while driving while texting-related automaticity was the best predictor of texting while walking, even when controlling for overall frequency of texting.

Our test corpus of webpages has been collected from hyperlink networks on the issue of food safety in the US and Germany. Three filtering strategies were evaluated for their ability to eliminate irrelevant pages not treating the issue from the networks: (1) scraping for keywords, (2) classifying documents with machine-learning algorithms, and (3) extracting core networks with network-analytical measures.

2014-0617,2014,Paper Session,Speaking Freely: Questioning Assumptions Underlying Negative Free Speech,1,"Free speech is classically seen in negative terms as a limitation on government action that restricts speech. Although there have long been arguments that government also has an obligation to act in support of free speech—in part because common free speech rationales appear to involve more than a negative right—most free speech law adopts a negative understanding. This paper examines assumptions within negative approaches to free speech and finds them unconvincing. There seems little reason to support the idea that free speech exists primarily when the state is not directly limiting speech. If the analysis presented here has plausibility, then arguments about free speech would be reframed. New questions would emerge about what legal limitations and obligations should be applied in the name of free speech and through what methods.","Parsing Free Speech Around Press, Politics, and the State",Communication Law & Policy

This paper summarizes the history of “freedom of press” in the Constitution, the courts, and various states around the country, in an attempt to formulate a workable definition for the rapidly changing media environment. Consideration is given to the philosophical underpinnings of the “freedom of the press” as conceived by the Founding Fathers and the varied definitions of “the press” codified in current state laws around the country. In order establish a free press as a positive liberty, I encourage a definition that allows for the production of news by (and press protections for) citizen and independent journalists that often fall outside the historical definition of a “journalist”.","Parsing Free Speech Around Press, Politics, and the State",Communication Law & Policy

After the same five justices in the majority on that decision joined an unsigned, summary, 195-word, per curiam decision in American Tradition Partnership, the court now turns its attention to limits on direct contributions to candidates in McCutcheon v FEC. Direct contributions to judicial candidates raise quid pro quo questions that go beyond those the court has addressed for candidates for political office. Using a 15 year archive of public file data from a six station cluster in Milwaukee, WI, we examine non-candidate issue advertising in judicial elections.

Analyzing Claims to the End of Privacy, 1990-2012",2,"Privacy is a value that appears always to be in crisis, no more so than in light of this year's NSA revelations. Analysis of 101 newspaper articles between 1990-2012, however, shows that the end of privacy is declared with quite remarkable regularity. This paper presents content analysis of those articles and, based in grounded theory and drawing on the notion of 'endism,’ explores how they position themselves in relation to the purported end of privacy. Specifically, the paper discusses different endist formulations; asks who is held responsible for the end of privacy; and pays close attention to those special cases where the article’s author shows awareness of previous claims of the end of privacy. The paper concludes with a reflection on contrasting attitudes to the past and to the future as expressed through the case of privacy endism.","Change Has Come?

Nevertheless, other approaches to entertainment argue that the sought-after psychological effects can only be validly explained by taking the aesthetical and narrative aspects of the content into account, as well as regarding sociological aspects of the audience. Focusing on the genre of frontier fiction, we analyze its various instances with regard to the presented forms of a good life. Based on this, we propose to re-evaluate the current approach in research on eudaimony by taking a closer look on the content and the audience of entertainment media, as these present for example various notions of a good life, resulting in different interpretations by certain audiences.","Change Has Come?

Mad Men facilitated AMC's own institutional makeover as it moved into original productions for the first time, in support of a transition from exclusively carriage-fee to primarily advertiser-based revenue. Mad Men is a show about reinvention set in an advertising agency that has garnered vast acclaim for a movie-nostalgia channel that has begun running advertising spots and commissioning original programming. It is also an historical drama rewriting and making over our recent cultural past. Understanding Mad Men as a form of makeover television helps us to see the complex links between the institutional conditions of production and circulation and the kind of symbolic work performed as the text circulates.","Change Has Come?

Perceptions of Change Among TV Documentary Makers,1,"This paper focuses on the production culture of documentary, a genre with traditionally strong ties to television and public service values and as such strongly affected by the recent transformations of broadcasting cultures. Based on ethnographic data, this presentation examines how the production practice has changed for British and German documentary filmmakers and producers in the last decades, and how this impacts not only on the working lives of broadcasting professionals but also on the development of the genre itself. Do editorial shifts towards ‘documentary as diversion’ (Corner 2002) and changes in ‘documentary craftsmanship’ (Dover 2004) erode the traditional values of a genre as old as cinema itself, or is such critique denying creative development based on the glorification of a ‘golden age of television’?

Using a somewhat unusual point of departure – a failed inter-coder reliability test – we analyzed 130 humorous forwards (videos, jokes and images), 55 of which elicited disagreement between coders regarding the target of mockery and 75 of which elicited consensus. Our comparative analysis yielded six textual attributes that augment polysemy in mediated humor: narrative-valence discrepancies, un-stereotypical stereotyping, debatable personality traits, self-deprecating humor, intertextuality, and centrifugal multimodality.

The three-book series that explores the relationship between inexperienced virgin Anastasia Steele, a 21-year-old college student, and Christian Grey, a 27-year-old wealthy entrepreneur who practices BDSM. The erotic romance’s graphic descriptions of Christian and Ana’s sexual encounters, combined with adult women’s fervent response to the series, has led to public debate over the series’ appeal to female audiences. In conversation with feminist media research that explores women’s use of romance reading, I explore Fifty Shade’s appeal through interviews with its readers. I argue that Fifty Shades’ appeal requires an exploration of the roles fantasy, romance reading, and sex play in the lives of readers who are immersed in a media environment characterized by a postfeminist sensibility.",Audiences and Fans: From Disney Fans to the Nursing Home,Popular Communication
2014-0628,2014,Paper Session,Nursing Home Residents and Celebrities: A Tale of Morality,1,"In contemporary Western societies, characterized by global aging and an omnipresent celebrity culture, little is known about the role of celebrities for older adults. This study bridges gerontology and celebrity studies to explore a social role that celebrities can fulfill for nursing home residents: triggering moral discussions. This potential role is examined in four focus groups with twenty-seven Flemish nursing home residents. Here, twenty celebrity pictures are employed to evoke moral discussions, with a focus on adultery and homosexuality. These discussions are subjected to a framing analysis. Results show that celebrities can trigger moral discussions among the nursing home residents. The residents’ adultery and homosexuality frames show that they mostly retain dominant values from their youth, often combining them with contemporary dominant values. Further, the residents’ frames prove to be relativistic, which can be linked to their multitude of life experiences and complex emotional skills.",Audiences and Fans: From Disney Fans to the Nursing Home,Popular Communication

Through interviews with these fan-producers this paper moves beyond largely conceptual discussions of free labor and situates the Marxist concepts of labor, exploitation, and alienation in the concrete practices of individuals using social media platforms. The goal is not only to provide a more grounded understanding of how these Marxist concepts can be applied to contemporary media phenomena, but also to contribute to a dialogue between those subscribing to the free labor perspective and those committed to the participatory culture perspective.",Audiences and Fans: From Disney Fans to the Nursing Home,Popular Communication

Empirical content analysis and interviews reveal different aspects of fandom as identified by Abercrombie and Longhurst to dominate the representation: intense media use and fan productivity, strong hierarchical communities and a lack of critical interpretative skills. Fan-idol relationships are shown to go beyond mere identification to include parasocial relationships and neo-religiosity. As such, results confirm the theoretical paradox between the television industry’s promotion of celebrity to attract loyal audiences and the rejection of fandom as ‘freaky business’.",Audiences and Fans: From Disney Fans to the Nursing Home,Popular Communication

A variable that influences the perceived competence of a woman is her styling. This variable was modified with virtual characters in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). In a 2x2 (makeup/no makeup, loose hair/braid) between-subject design, 81 participants interacted with a virtual female leader and subsequently evaluated her. Although there have been no findings for competence, after interacting with the female leader with makeup, participants remembered more information correctly than in the no-makeup condition. The female leader without makeup was perceived as warmer than the leader with makeup, and participants rated the quality of a text written by her as higher. Therefore, although makeup seems to be enhancing the effectiveness of the leader, not wearing makeup leads to more favorable ratings.

This study administered an online-based experiment (n = 571) manipulating for different sources (close personal networks, distant social networks, experts and authority figures, organization officials) to examine whether personalness of source can affect the potential involvement of otherwise unaffiliated and uninformed individuals in online and offline collective activities via social media. Results indicated close personal networks as most influential in bridging the networks-to-individuals call to activist action. Online activities, particularly publicly expressive ones, were found to be more popular and positively related to offline activities. Findings suggest a possible triggering mechanism perpetuated by one’s close personal networks for collective action, and the implications of easy-to-do online activities (e.g., “Like,” “Sharing”) are discussed",High-Density: New Media,Interpersonal Communication

Previous studies have shown that SNS is used in geographically-close relationships (GCR). However, knowledge on SNS use in relationship maintenance processes as well as in long-distance relationships (LDR) is still lacking. Our study aimed to examine the relative importance of SNS in maintaining LDR as opposed to GCR. An online survey was conducted among Facebook users who are in a relationship (N=272; 110 in LDR, 162 in GCR). Results show that individuals in LDR are more likely to use SNS for relationship maintenance than those in GCR. Particularly, participants in LDR have higher levels of expression of commitment, passion, intimacy and relational maintenance behaviors than participants in GCR. Furthermore, SNS are utilized more in LDR for partner surveillance and participants in LDR experience higher levels of SNS-related jealousy and suspicion of infidelity compared to participants in GCR.",High-Density: New Media,Interpersonal Communication

This study investigates the role of attitudinal ambivalence in moderating the effects of junk food advertisements on behavioral intentions using three conceptually distinct measures – felt ambivalence, potential ambivalence, and affect-cognitive ambivalence. Results based on an online survey of college students first indicate that attention to junk food advertisements has an indirect positive effect on intentions to eat junk food by promoting positive attitudes toward junk food. A moderated mediation model reveals that this indirect effect of junk food advertisements is observed only for respondents with low levels of felt ambivalence, but not those with moderate to high levels of felt ambivalence. Also, this moderating role was not observed for potential and affect-cognitive measures of ambivalence. Implications are discussed for health interventions.",Eating and the Good Life: Nutrition and Health Issues,Health Communication

Based on a survey of 124 parents, grandparents and older siblings in Singapore, this study, which is grounded in the Health Belief Model, found that four variables, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits and cues to action are positively correlated with health actions in limiting the children’s access to fast food. Beyond conventional health communication variables such as beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, this study further investigates perceptions about the ethicality of fast food advertising, a health communicative dimension reflected in the controversy about fast food. It is compelling to understand how ethics, a hitherto largely ignored dimension in health communication, could potentially be connected to individuals’ beliefs and health actions, in ways that could potentially influence adult family members’ management of children’s access to fast food. A regression analysis indicated that four predictors—perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, cues to action, and message ethicality—significantly explained 40.2% of the variance in the outcome variable, health actions.

More specifically, the influence of framed norms messages on the motivation to consume healthy versus unhealthy foods. We proposed that a negative message frame would strengthen the persuasive effect of injunctive norms, while descriptive norms were expected to benefit from a positive frame. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five message conditions and read a positive or negative injunctive or descriptive norm message, or a control message. Subsequently, motivation to eat fruit and candy was assessed through an approach-avoidance task. In line with expectations, results show increased approach motivation for fruit compared to candy in the injunctive negative and descriptive positive norm conditions, but not in the positive injunctive or negative descriptive norm conditions.

A randomized between-subject design was conducted with 261 children who played an advergame that promoted energy-dense snacks or nonfood products. As an extra manipulation, half of the children in each condition were rewarded for refraining from eating. Results show that rewarding impulsive children to refrain from eating had no influence when they were playing an advergame promoting energy-dense snacks, while we observed reduced intake among low impulsive children and when children played nonfood advergames. Playing an advergame promoting energy-dense snacks contributes to increased caloric intake in children. The advergame promoting energy-dense snacks overruled the inhibition task to refrain from eating among impulsive children, making it more difficult for children to refrain from eating.",Eating and the Good Life: Nutrition and Health Issues,Health Communication
2014-0643,2014,Paper Session,Remedy or Poison? Reconsidering the Impact of Online Participation on Cancer Patients’ Psychological Adjustment Moderated by Personality,2,"Health and social outcomes of online peer-to-peer support communities have gained much attention in recent years. Previous studies found that participating in cancer online communities could improve patients’ psychological well-being. However, contradictive research findings indicated that online participation would increase cancer patients’ isolation and depression. Mixed findings warrant further explorations from new perspective. In response, the current research introduced personality variables into the investigation of participation and psychology linkage. It is hypothesized that Emotional stability and Openness to experience are two moderators of the impact of online participation on cancer patients’ psychological adjustment.
Data collected from 124 participants in two blood cancer related forums of mainland China, Baidu Blood Cancer Community and Bloodbbs , revealed that the main effect of online participation on psychological adjustment was not statistically significant. Importantly, two personality traits (i.e., Emotional stability and Openness to experience) moderated the relationship between online participation and psychological adjustment to cancer. Thus, the current study helps us to understand the communication mechanism of cancer virtual community. Based on the research findings, advice is given to cancer patients who want to obtain psychological adjustment from virtual peer communities.",Communication and Cancer: Psychological Approaches,Health Communication

In the first study, it was found that absolute risk (versus comparative risk) was a significant stronger predictor of some cancer screenings, including PSA test and Pap test on a 95% confidence interval, and mammography on a 90% confidence interval. The second study examined the mechanism that explains the association between risk perceptions and cervical cancer screening. It was demonstrated that cancer worry mediated the relationship between comparative risk perceptions and cervical cancer screening behavior. This provides empirical evidence that supports the more primacy role of affect (compared to risk perceptions) in the decision-making process of cervical cancer screening.",Communication and Cancer: Psychological Approaches,Health Communication

This survey and interview research examined the experiences of patients’ loved ones in viewing online cancer information and the emotional and behavioral consequences that result. Findings indicated that participants experienced more negative than positive emotions after viewing information, and that there are relationships between these emotions and certain information and website types. User-generated content was only associated with negative emotions, showing the potential dangers of Web 2.0 spaces. Positive emotions were associated with several constructive behaviors, whereas negative emotions were associated with seeking comfort, suggesting that the emotional effects are strong enough to warrant the support of others. Overall, this study extends the work of emotions and action tendencies into the realm of patients’ loved ones and represents an important step in developing useful online resources for this population.",Communication and Cancer: Psychological Approaches,Health Communication

The media sector in this formerly military dictatorship is playing a key role in challenging – as well as reinforcing – the militarism of the country’s recent history. Key in this situation is the role of the formerly exile media sector, which has begun to move back into the country, joining with the internal media sector to promote media freedom and the development of media laws that develop and protect media diversity and independence. While these changes are currently so rapid as to make it hard to draw hard and fast conclusions, this paper offers a snapshot of the transition-in-progress and offers initial thoughts on the process.",Journalism-State Relations: Views From Four Countries,Journalism Studies

Myanmar) 2010 political transition in an attempt at drawing insight into prevailing news framing and agenda setting scholarship. Employing qualitative content analysis, seven frames were identified for analysis: attribution of responsibility; human interest; economic responsibility; morality; conflict, protectionist and feminization. Analysis of these frames in relation to prevailing news framing scholarship revealed the existence of a dominant moral framework in which foreign affairs is presented in American news media. This broader moralization frame was predicated on embedded moral judgments regarding appropriate forms of development and progress, one in which prosperity and growth are viewed as best being attained through governmental policies aimed at economic liberalization characterized by a twofold processes of privatization and deregulation. This frame was found to be largely a product of U.S. governmental elite “framing dominance” and an extension of the ideological “Cold War” frame that prevailed until the 1990’s.",Journalism-State Relations: Views From Four Countries,Journalism Studies

The intention to adopt the model was to know that how far it works in the Pakistani media sociology. The study too uses the same questionnaire items and was administered to 300 journalists working in major cities of Pakistan. 195 responded to the questionnaire. The study analyzes the list of journalistic functions, rated by the Pakistani Journalists for importance applying Principal Component Factor analysis, generated eight factors, News for Social Goods, Citizen Journalism, Support of Government Policy, Cultural & Development, Information and country image, Evaluating Government Development, Interpreting Government Policy, and Watch dog Function. Ramaprasad (2006) indicates that perceived importance is an indicator of journalists’ belief about how they should practice the functions.

Pakistani journalists practice most journalistic functions—libertarian, social responsibility, and development in a large measure. They argue that such types of journalistic functions are required keeping in view the poor economy, poor industrialization, poor education ratio, unprecedented population growth, lack of job opportunities, extreme terrorism, long period of military rules and feudalist mentality of the politicians, bad governance, etc. in the country. All these menaces have shaken the culture’s fabric of the society and brought bad name to the country.

Journalists in Pakistan often do similarly as they rate for perceived importance of the journalistic functions. The ‘Thematic’ factors did not replicate quite well in the Pakistani journalism situation. The study also differs in term of mean score between perceived importance and how to do the journalistic functions. The ‘conceptual and thematic’ factors in this study where they are different from Ramaprasad’s Journalistic Functions Model designed specifically for the third world countries, suggest some refinement of the model.

A qualitative content analysis of the 23 episodes of the program Human Rights: Look at the World was conducted. The anti-opposition and anti-revolutionary ideological standpoints were revealed in the efforts to alienate the audience from the opposition forces and transfer characteristics of extreme acts to them. The anti-globalization rhetoric and portrayal of the West as an enemy prevailed in most of the episodes. A dominant discourse on the world as suffering from wars and economic instability in contrast with the alleged stability in Belarus was often combined with the Soviet nostalgia rhetoric.

Recognizing “material journalism” expands both the range of actors implicated in journalistic practices as well as the spaces within which journalism can occur. Additionally, grounded in an “empirical ontology,” this work argues that “material journalism” motivates two related ontological concerns: the materialization of journalistic actors and practices, and the way actors and practices “leave their mark” on journalism as an ideal. Reading scholarly literature on algorithms and news photographs through these ontological questions suggests new ways of thinking about and studying nonhumans in journalism. Ultimately, this paper argues that recognizing “material journalism” suggests the utility of an explicit “turn to ontology” in journalism studies.",Visualizing the News: Trends in Image Use,Journalism Studies

Evidence of normative isomorphism was found, though it was unclear if inter-media agenda setting by elite publications was responsible. Hypotheses predicting different visual framing among different community structures were not supported.

This project compares the videos posted by newspaper websites with those posted by television organizations using a content analysis based on narrative structure. Two waves of the analysis, one in 2011 and another in 2013, allow for a longitudinal analysis. The study found that newspaper organizations are producing and posting videos in a wide array of formats, using styles that contrast with broadcast news. Unlike television, which has a presentational style dating back to the early 20th century, newspaper websites are experimenting with narrative style. Over time, the websites reflect changes in the amount of video offered but TV/Newspaper differences remain.

This paper explores the nature of luxury products in a virtual economy created by the popular game Team Fortress Two. As all items in the economy have roughly equivalent utility as a means to preserve the fairness of the game this provides a novel testing ground for competing theories addressing the social process driving consumption. Results suggest that within the Team Fortress economy possession of luxury goods is correlated with a wide ranging social network with many connections to prestigious members of the community and an avoidance of tight clusters or cliques.",Visual Variables in Communication Technologies: Effects on Perceptions and Behaviors,Communication and Technology

For this purpose a new scale to assess slacktivism was developed and tested with an online-survey among Facebook users (N= 1345). It revealed a high level of slacktivistic activities among SNS users, regardless of whether they already volunteered offline or not. Using regression modeling, it could be shown that slacktivism determines life satisfaction in a negative way, which is especially true for Facebook users who perform slacktivistic activities with a high intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, preceding criticism of self-expression as main motivation for slacktivism was not supported.",Civic Engagement With Social Media,Communication and Technology

An online survey (n=490) was implemented in mainland China via multiple channels. Results indicate that both new media and conventional media have effects on civic engagement; the pressure from social networks is positively related to offline civic engagement, while online civic behavior is significantly enhanced by the motivation of emotion; relative deprivation is negatively associated with online civic participation. Path analysis reveals that the impact of news use on civic engagement via conventional media was mediated by political orientations. Meanwhile, the motivation of social relationship mediated the effects of reading news via new media on offline civic engagement.",Civic Engagement With Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0663,2014,Paper Session,Personalized Public Goods Production in Social Networking Site: The Effectiveness of Incentivizing User-Generated Content for Public Goods,2,"Studies of information public goods in traditional interactive communication systems (ICSs) have adopted theories of collective action for decades. Emerging communication technologies, e.g., social media, provide new affordances for information public goods production yet call for a reconceptualization of collective action. This paper argues that information public goods in social media are jointly produced from private interests and personalized communication practices. Through examining the composition and distribution of user-generated content (UGC), this paper demonstrates the personalized public goods production in social networking site (SNS) with two constraints imposed by its personalized nature: (a) incentives designs are effective only if they match specific personal needs, yet (b) simultaneous incentivizing UGC-related behaviors for a single individual is hard due to bounded time, energy, and connectedness.",Civic Engagement With Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0664,2014,Paper Session,SNS Dependency and Community Engagement: From a Media System Dependency Theory Perspective,2,"This study proposes a theoretical foundation for conducting research on the relationship between social networking services (SNSs) and community engagement. In particular, we introduce a theoretical concept and measure of SNS dependency based on media system dependency (MSD) theory as a new type of media dependency measure reflecting the transformation in the communication environment. The results based on confirmatory factor analyses and OLS regression analyses confirms the reliability and validity of the SNS dependency measure which well reflects the MSD theory-based conceptualization and operationalization: one overarching concept (SNS dependency) with seven sub-dimensions (personal understanding, social understanding, action orientation, interaction orientation, solitary play, interaction play, and expression). Using the SNS dependency measure, we tested its relationships to three outcome factors derived from MSD theory that are related to individuals’ social relations in the neighborhood context. We found that individuals who are more dependent on SNSs are more likely to spend more time on SNS (exposure), pay more attention to specific community related contents and functions (attention), and engage in social activities within their neighborhood communities (post-exposure communication).",Civic Engagement With Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0665,2014,Paper Session,Influence of Different Movie Genres on the Perceptual and Behavioral Component of the Third-Person Effect: The Moderating Role of Hedonic Motivation,1,"This paper presents research on the effects of different movie genres on the perceptual
and the behavioral component of the third-person effect. A total of 176 students participated
in an online experiment. They were asked to estimate their own and other’s enjoyment of
serious (n = 88) or light-hearted movies (n = 88). Furthermore, the moderating role of individuals’ motivation behind their entertainment media consumption was of interest. Results
showed a clear third-person effect given light-hearted movies and a first-person effect given
serious movies. However, the third-person effect for light-hearted films was moderated by
hedonic motivation: Participants with high hedonic motivation showed no perceptual
difference between their and others’ enjoyment of light-hearted films. Concerning the behavioral component of the third-person effect, results supported a moderated mediation model in which the effect of the experimental manipulation on support for political action through third-person perceptions of enjoyment was moderated by hedonic motivation.",Third Person Effects in Mass Communication,Mass Communication
2014-0666,2014,Paper Session,Investigating the Role of Incomparability on Third-Person Effects and First-Person Effects of Public Service Announcements,1,"In response to socially desirable media content, numerous studies on the effect of first-person have identified that people overestimate the message effects on themselves rather than on others (Cho & Han, 2004; Duck & Mullin, 1995; Gunther & Hwa, 1996). However, empirical studies have also shown that inconsistent patterns of first-person effect occur to some extent (Duck & Mullin, 1995; Duck, Terry, & Hogg, 1995). To date, a factor that has yet to be fully investigated concerning first-person perception research is how public health campaign messages interact with individuals’ prior states. Therefore, it is uncertain whether certain message attributes that are inconsistent with individuals’ prior motivation to reflect on the message play a role in estimating first-person perceptions.

Using a 2 (Fear Appeal: High vs. Low) X 2 (Perceived Control Belief: High vs. Low) experimental design, this study therefore investigates how the interaction between level of fears and individuals’ prior risk-control belief influence their message perceptions as well as Public Service Announcements (PSAs) effects on both themselves and others. The results show that participants generally evaluated the PSA effects on themselves to be greater than the effects on others under the condition of incompatibility. To some extent, participants under the condition of cognitive consistency, however, tended to estimate a greater PSA effect on others than on themselves. The findings have practical and theoretical implications for future studies on first-person/third-person effects.",Third Person Effects in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

The mathematical relationships among four different statistical models were analyzed. The average effects of the third-person perception, presumed media effect on others, and perceived media effect on self were estimated for 14 previous studies (Study 1, the total N = 5,253). Study 2 conducted a meta-regression analysis for Schmierbach, Boyle, Xu, and McLeod’s (2011) correlational data. The results of the analyses showed that previously used methods have critical limitations. The average effect of DME on support for censorship was found to be insignificant and highly inconsistent.

2014-0668,2014,Paper Session,Narrative Processing and Person Effects,2,"Persuasive messages embedded in a narrative format often result in greater acceptance when compared to similar arguments in a more expository format, especially for initially resistant audiences. However, beyond the actual effects of narrative formats, the perceived effects of such narratives on the self and others remain unexplored. First and third person effects explore the attitudes and behaviors that stem from a reaction to perceived effects of media, and researchers have yet to extend this line of inquiry to the context of persuasive narratives. The current manuscript proposes a model that links narrative processing with first-person effects, which it contrasts with the linkage between non-narrative processing and third-person effects. These linkages provide a novel pathway through which message attributes may translate into attitudinal and behavioral change, with both theoretical and practical implications.",Third Person Effects in Mass Communication,Mass Communication

However, uncertainty remains about the psychological processes that underlie estimates of effects. This study used an online questionnaire (N = 161) to focus on the predictive power of underlying personality characteristics such as self-monitoring, collectivism, maternalism, and paternalism to predict general third-person tendencies and whether that influence varies across different types of content (cereal, beer, and flu ads). A collectivist orientation resulted in higher estimates of effects on self and a reduced TPP for the cereal and beer ads. Conversely, high self-monitors exhibited reduced estimates of effects on self for the cereal add. As such, estimates of perceived effects and any subsequent TPP are likely driven by personality characteristics such as collectivism and self-monitoring but also a consideration of the particular message type and its perceived negative or positive effects.",Third Person Effects in Mass Communication,Mass Communication
2014-0670,2014,Paper Session,Technology Dissemination and Computer Surveillance Under the Northern Territory Intervention,3,"In 2007, Australia’s Commonwealth Government commenced a dramatic new approach to the governance and management of remote Indigenous communities. The ‘Northern Territory Intervention’, as it is commonly known, was initially introduced as a means to combat alleged child abuse in remote Indigenous communities, and included significant changes to welfare administration, employment strategies and policing. Although the Intervention has been the subject of a great deal of public commentary and critique, one aspect has remained surprisingly hidden from public scrutiny: the surveillance of publicly funded computers.
Between 2007 and 2012, providers of internet and computer access facilities were required to manually audit computers, keep detailed records of computer users, and install filters on computers and networks. In this paper we examine this extraordinary attempt at ICT surveillance, designed to target a specific group within a liberal democratic state. The impact of the Intervention on internet freedoms was compounded by the low rates of internet adoption by Indigenous households. We argue that the so-called ‘digital divide’ made the policing of internet use possible even where it applied to a limited number of computers. However, the policy could have also worked to exacerbate the divide by imposing costly requirements on those that were attempting to provide some level of access. In the first half of the paper we examine the laws related to publicly funded computers and the outcomes of the auditing and reporting process, using documents we obtained through freedom of information (FoI) processes. In the second half of the paper we draw on evidence gathered through interviews with stakeholders to discuss the experience of complying with the laws and the factors that may have contributed to its ultimate demise.","Privacy, Personal Data, and Surveillance: Histories, Tensions, and Dilemmas",Communication Law & Policy

Repurposing Lippmann, this paper argues that recent calls for individual data privacy by the FTC, the White House and Congress present a comparable fallacy of personal data sovereignty. Had we the faculties and the system, the digital citizen has little interest or time for data governance. We desire the freedom to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. We want privacy, and safety, but cannot and will not do all that is required for its protection. If the fallacy of direct democracy is similar to the fallacy of personal data sovereignty, then the pragmatic solution is representative data sovereignty; a combination of non-profit/commercial digital dossier management and government oversight ensuring the protection of personal data, while freeing individuals from what Lippmann referred to as an ‘unattainable ideal.’","Privacy, Personal Data, and Surveillance: Histories, Tensions, and Dilemmas",Communication Law & Policy

In response, the personal data infomediary emerged as a market-based intervention and was offered by many commentators as an alternative to comprehensive privacy regulation. Despite being positioned as a method for protecting privacy without stifling innovation, those companies operating at the turn of the twenty-first century, failed to achieve market success and the model was quickly abandoned. In the current information landscape, the infomediary has re-emerged as a potential method for enhancing user privacy. Through interviews with industry actors, participant observation at industry events and document analysis, this paper explores the evolution of the infomediary model, paying particular attention to the implications of the movement’s construction of information privacy.","Privacy, Personal Data, and Surveillance: Histories, Tensions, and Dilemmas",Communication Law & Policy

Results of a survey of 5973 participants from six countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and France) demonstrated that media multitasking is most common in the United States and is least common in the Netherlands. Moreover, the study demonstrated that media multitasking with traditional media (e.g., radio and newspapers) is most prevalent in countries that can be characterised as monochronic, whereas media multitasking with new media (e.g., social media and mobile media) is most prevalent in countries characterised as polychronic.

The analysis of 41 in-depth interviews indicated that participants’ negative position towards trust in news media stemmed from two different rationales: the inherent disbelief in the possibility of trustworthiness of any news media and the evaluation of news media work as unprofessional. The study also found that Serbians and Macedonians valued objectivity, fairness, accuracy, separation of facts from opinion, clarity, and balance in selection of topics and sources in news reporting, values similar to the dimensions of trust in news media and credibility of news media found in the Western literature.

Before long, thousands of internet users had uploaded their own versions of the clip, creating a mass appeal to young people, while at the same time negotiating the norms of LGBT collective identity. In this paper, we focus on the prominent memetic features of the campaign, namely the ways in which each participant both imitates and alters previous videos. A combined quantitative and qualitative analysis of 200 clips shows that in an arena ostensibly free of formal gatekeepers, participants tend to police themselves, toeing the line with conformist norms. We also identify arenas of potential subversiveness, related not only to the content of the videos but mainly to the forms facilitated by new media.",Public Cultural Politics and Mediated Citizenships,Popular Communication

Previous debates regarding the relationship between symbolic action and more traditional forms of political participation suggest a binary between empowering “civic culture” engagement and disempowering “slacktivism.” Interviews with participants in the red equal sign profile picture campaign for marriage equality provide some evidence to support the former (particularly in the context of building an identity-focused political movement), and little to support the latter. However, a third model suggests how sympathetic citizens who would not otherwise take on organizational commitments are brought into the circle of participation by making micro-level contributions to aggregate projects of public rhetoric. Furthermore, the nuanced logics of visibility and awareness suggest conceivable mechanisms by which symbolic action may function as instrumental participation in a media-centered “battle over the minds.”",Public Cultural Politics and Mediated Citizenships,Popular Communication

As more and more producers join in creating diverse versions of SFGs in recent years, this entertainment program has become a field full of ideological struggles. This study selects SFGs provided by three different levels of producers—national, provincial, and grassroots level, and examines their discursive strategies respectively. A content analysis is conducted to investigate the theme, characteristic of nationalism, and performer in the samples. Further, different frames in constructing nationalism and social-individual relationship are also identified. The results indicate that nationalistic discourse no longer dominates SFGs, and social-individual relationship has become a new theme of the program. In addition, while the three producers maintain tacit cooperation in political ideology, they adopt different apolitical strategies to complete with each other.

This transformation is linked to a neoliberal political project and concerns a shifting relationship between discourses of exclusion and inclusion. The key argument is that working-class people are now portrayed through ‘a moral underclass discourse’ in which the working class is devalued and delegitimized, and given moral blame for their own structural situation. This discussion is based on a multimodal critical discourse analysis of participants who appear to be ‘ordinary’ working-class people in Ullared, a docu-soap that follows the goings-on at a rural low-cost outlet (called Gekås). Hence it puts participants’ consumption and consumer behaviour in the foreground, and these activities are ridiculed through a mode of production best described as the ‘middle-class gaze’.

However, the focus of this research had mainly been the single community as such. In core, our argument is that it seems to be increasingly inappropriate to focus on only one community and the role of media in its constitution. Rather, if we really want to capture the changes of recent mediatization we have to grasp the ‘mediatized totality’ of different communities within which human beings position themselves. To investigate this, we will develop the concept of the ‘mediatized horizon of communitization’. Based on qualitative, ethnographic research with young people we outline four types of mediatized horizons of communitization: the horizons of the ‘localists’, ‘centrists’, ‘multi-localists’, and ‘pluralists’. Such an empirical analysis offers us the chance to make some more general observations on mediatization and the changing forms of communitization.",Ethnographic Interventions: Linking New Configurations of Media Practice With Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Research on offline bullying has identified peer group dynamics such as popularity and peer pressure as explanatory factors for peer-to-peer and peer-to-teacher aggression. The current study examines whether these dynamics also play a role in these cyberbullying behaviors. A large-scale quantitative survey among 1943 Flemish teenagers (12-18 years) revealed that, in the six months prior to the study, 25% of adolescents had made a picture or video of a peer who was being ridiculed, 8% of a peer who was being physically bullied/beaten, and 11% had distributed such a picture or video online. Thirteen per cent had made a picture or video of a teacher being ridiculed, and 6% had distributed such content online. Self–perceived popularity, need for popularity and perceived peer pressure positively predicted adolescents’ involvement in each of these practices.","Mobile Media, Digital Media, and Youth",Children Adolescents and Media

Indeed, while mobile media may provide resources for overcoming the digital divide among children who do not have access to domestic broadband , their use may equally result in new divides since different platforms do not lead to the ‘same’ internet experience.

Drawing off of data collected in twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork with 15 rural, female, teenaged American social media users, this paper looks past these foreclosed rhetorics on adolescence and girlhood to closely consider the social forces involved in young women’s choices to go online, and to understand the broad role social media play in their lives. It finds that the confinement and surveillance these teens experience offline motivates them to move their attention to the social spaces of the Internet, where they become involved in social media migration in a quest for a better life online.","Mobile Media, Digital Media, and Youth",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0696,2014,Paper Session,Metastatic Cancer Patients’ and Care-Givers’ Use of an Intervention on Interpersonal Communication Regarding End-of-Life Issues,9,"Metastatic cancer patients and their care-givers often do not participate as much as they would like to during a consultation. Question Prompt Lists (QPLs) have been used extensively to enhance patients’ and care-givers’ participation. However, it is unknown how patients and care-givers are using QPLs. The objective of this study was to provide insight into how metastatic cancer patients and care-givers use a QPL. Audiotaped consultations and follow-up nurse phone calls of 28 metastatic cancer patients were coded and content analysed. Most patients reported that they used the QPL. Questions asked by patients and care-givers from the QPL were predominately from the prognosis section. Patients and caregivers rarely asked questions literally from the QPL, instead they tailored questions to their disease characteristics and needs. A QPL is an useful tool to stimulate communication on prognosis. However, the effectiveness of tailored communication interventions for metastatic cancer patients should also be examined.",High-Density: 2014 Interpersonal Potpourri,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0697,2014,Paper Session,Negotiation of Competing Discourses by Primary Caregivers of Hospice Patients,2,"The researchers adopted relational dialectical theory to examine the discourse of twenty primary caregivers of hospice patients. The research questions that guided the study were: what competing discourses do primary caregivers experience during end-of-life care, and how do primary caregivers communicatively manage competing end-of-life discourse? The analysis of in-depth interviews revealed five major competing discourses which were connected physiologically to the patient's dying trajectories: care versus cure; prolong-life versus end-life; open versus hidden; theodicy; and move-on versus don’t-move-on. These competing discourses were communicatively negotiated by the primary caregiver through educating the family, by the use of black humor, spiritualizing, ignoring opposing views, and regulating conversations. Study findings can help facilitate health care professional’s awareness of end-of-life communication.",High-Density: 2014 Interpersonal Potpourri,Interpersonal Communication

Most patients prefer their physicians to convey some measure of hope when delivering bad news. The current study intended to investigate the relationships between perceived cancer diagnosis disclosure strategies and cancer patients’ hope in China. A total number of 89 effective questionnaires were collected from cancer patients in China. Results indicated that perceived patient-centered communication strategies of cancer disclosure were positively correlated with levels of hope, that perceived disclosure of multiple treatments options was negatively correlated with patients’ levels of hope, and that the perceived levels of the completeness of information are positively correlated with the levels of hope. Perceived use of euphemisms was marginally significant and that greater perceived physicians’ use of euphemisms predicts higher levels of hope.",High-Density: 2014 Interpersonal Potpourri,Interpersonal Communication

This study aimed to assess the association between sex, specifically sex constellations of the sibling dyad, and perceptions of maintenance strategy behavior. Data from 327 adult siblings from across the United States indicated many sex-specific findings. As predicted, both participant and sibling sex influenced participants’ self-reported maintenance behavior for all maintenance strategies (aside from networks), sibling sex influenced perceptions of sibling maintenance behavior, and sex constellations influenced both self-reported and perceptions of sibling maintenance behavior. In general, participants in sister-sister dyads reported using more and saw their sibling as using more maintenance strategies than those in mixed-sex and brother-brother dyads. Openness and networks displayed distinct patterns from the other three maintenance behaviors. The principle of femaleness is utilized to make sense of the majority of findings.",High-Density: 2014 Interpersonal Potpourri,Interpersonal Communication
2014-0700,2014,Paper Session,The Effect of Family Communication on Adult Children of Alcoholics’ Perceptions of Stigma and Their Associations With Emotional and Psychological Resilience,2,"Alcoholism is a highly stigmatized condition, with both alcohol dependent individuals and family members of the afflicted experiencing stigmatization. This study examined severity of a parent’s alcoholism and family communication about the topic of alcohol as two antecedent factors that may impact individual family members’ perceptions of stigma. Three dimensions of stigma were considered: discrimination stigma, disclosure stigma, and positive aspect stigma. In addition, this study assessed individuals’ experiences of depression, self-esteem, and resilience as outcomes of stigmatization. Adult children of alcoholics (N = 623) were surveyed about family conditions, perceptions of stigma, and their emotional and psychological well-being. Regression analyses revealed that the severity of a parent’s alcoholism was positively associated with discrimination and disclosure stigma, but the effects for positive aspect stigma were non-significant. In addition, topic avoidance about alcohol was positively associated with discrimination and disclosure stigma and negatively associated with positive aspect stigma. In turn, discrimination stigma and disclosure stigma were positively associated with depression and negatively associated with resilience and self-esteem. Positive aspect stigma was negatively associated with depression and positively associated with resilience and self-esteem. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for promoting a family environment that can mitigate stigma and, consequently, encourage emotional and psychological well-being.",High-Density: 2014 Interpersonal Potpourri,Interpersonal Communication

Drawing on extant literature on privacy, the PPM comprises aspects of objective, individual and interpersonal privacy mechanisms. First, it identifies an objective privacy context, which is subdivided into informational, social, psychological and physical dimensions. Second, it examines individual privacy perceptions, which are divided into the same dimensions. Third, it observes interpersonal privacy behaviour, which is the amount of self-disclosure people show. If either privacy perception or privacy behaviour differ from a desired status, people will engage in a privacy regulation, meaning that they will try to alter their privacy context or their privacy behaviour. Accounting for online as well as offline contexts, the PPM offers a novel and universal approach for an improved understanding privacy.",High-Density: 2014 Interpersonal Potpourri,Interpersonal Communication

2014-0704,2014,Paper Session,The Re-Emergence of Classical Stasis for Analysis and Execution of Apologias: A Review and Application,1,"Dating from the Athenian academies of Plato, Isocrates, and Aristotle, classical rhetoric is the most enduring form of communication, within Western civilization, studied at the university level. Modern scholars, however, lament a lack of praxis, of current application. A primary element of classical rhetoric is stasis: the identification of the key point of contention within a debate and the consequent development of communication strategies. Stasis is enjoying a quiet resurgence within communication studies, including legal, political, and crisis communication. This paper reviews the classical concept of stasis and strives to enhance the case for modern praxis by applying stasis theory to a recent instance of quasi-judicial/crisis communication: the defense of athlete Luis Suarez and his Liverpool Football Club against charges of using racially abusive language. The Suarez/Liverpool FC apologia is unusual – and theoretically flawed – in that the defense employed all three primary forms of stasis: fact, definition, and quality.",Communication History High-Density Panel,Communication History

This advocacy included what appeared to be a de facto alliance among themselves, the populace of those emerging nations, and the Soviet Union, which the editorialists initially saw as a better hope for extending independence, democracy and freedom to Africa. This posture quickly changed, however, as the elite black press shifted its focus back to domestic civil rights concerns, and even advocated for tepid support of America’s war on communism abroad as a means to advance the interests of blacks at home.",Communication History High-Density Panel,Communication History

However, these approaches ignore the unique constellations of social and technical conditions that inform the actual creation and dissemination of historical media texts. Further, such approaches impose a conceptual distance between the cultural and ideological artifacts of the past and those of the present. Drawing from archival materials as well as contemporary press accounts, this project explores the case of industrially funded animation studio John Sutherland Productions, and the discourses of subtle salesmanship that attended the creation and dissemination of animated economic education films to public audiences of millions in the United States.

It addresses how activism and journalism come together in the Asian American press, post-Civil Rights era activism, and the Asian American Movement in community issues with national and international significance. In the case of the publication of Seattle’s International Examiner, the newspaper reiterated the activism of the Asian American Movement through a journalistic genre and agenda.",Communication History High-Density Panel,Communication History

I argue that through the conceptualization of Gibraltarians as passive listeners, British officials projected their condescending way of listening to Spanish into the minds of Gibraltarians-qua-crowd in terms of a psychological deficiency, suffusing a post-World War II fear of the masses with a feminized and Orientalized Spanish-Mediterranean psyche. This conceptualization of Gibraltarians as passive listeners served to exclude Gibraltarians, specifically men, from the rational political subjectivity thought by colonists to be central to democracy and autonomous self-rule. By focusing on listening, I intervene in two visiocentric historiographies, those of the crowd and postcolonialism, which have wholly ignored the role of listening in disciplining the body politic.",Communication History High-Density Panel,Communication History

Of the 44 men who anchored the paper in local communities, at least seven were Free Masons. The concentration of agents in port towns along the Atlantic and Lake Ontario suggests that copies of the Journal were transported from New York mainly by seamen, especially black sailors who constituted significant portions of ship crews in the nineteenth century. Five of the 44 distributors (and their customers) lived outside the United States, suggesting a trans-Atlantic focus.

While moviegoers had several decades between Charlie Chaplin and “Platoon,” video games grew to mainstream popularity in the 1980s and the first debates about their violent content took place in the early-1990s. But no journalistic community has more at stake in these debates and discussions than video game journalists. This historical analysis examines the most popular video game journalism magazine in the 1990s, GamePro Magazine, and how GamePro journalists mediated the debates about violence.

If the ideal Habermasian public sphere never historically existed, how did the ‘imperfect’ public spheres of the past nevertheless contribute to democratic political participation? The late 19th century is particularly appropriate for comparison, as it is also a time of transition into new media technologies and notions of publics. Focusing on newspapers, posters and other mediated public communications, I identify consistent invocations of publics as other: the othered audience to persuade and influence, and speaker as a distinct other from the crowd. This othering was not pathological to the public sphere, but a constitutive part of publicity in the age of nascent mass media.

However, inequities exist that make nutrition information less accessible depending on socioeconomic status (SES). Studies indicate that individuals with lower income are more likely to have lower levels of nutrition knowledge. Dietitians from SNAP-Ed, nutrition education for persons eligible for government assistance, are working to change these inequities by providing resources for low-income individuals. Given the complexity of nutrition education and consumers’ preferences, this study attempts to contribute a theoretical framework, which emerged as a result of the qualitative method of interviewing, to better understand if nutrition information provided through social support from dietitians can help those with low SES. Findings suggest that storytelling between dietitian and participant, and “empathic witnessing” on the part of the dietitian can aid in the development of participant-centered content.

Effective communication about cancer risk and prevention is an important component of cancer control. Yet research in this area is very limited in China. This study used probability sample survey data from two Chinese cities (Beijing and Hefei, Anhui Province) to investigate potential predictors of self-initiated cancer information seeking. Analysis showed that cancer information seekers in China were likely to be married, relatively educated, earning modest incomes, living in rural areas, smoking occasionally, having a family cancer history, relatively trusting of the media for health information, somewhat knowledgeable about cancer, having non-fatalistic attitudes about cancer, and seeing a personal need for more cancer information. The pattern of results, particular the lack of influence of personal health and risk perception factors, highlights the possibility that seeking for others might be more prevalent than seeking for self in China.

According to many of our mediatization of politics indicators – which included sound and image bites, lip flaps, journalistic visibility, ‘wrapping up’, live and interpretive news – broadcasters with the greatest public service responsibilities supplied the greatest level of mediatized political news. Our study thus appears to challenge conventional academic wisdom that US journalistic interventionism is greater than other advanced Western democracies and that enhanced commercialization is a precursor to higher degrees of mediatization. We suggest that the form, structure and style of journalism should be understood more carefully by scholars when making sense of how far news is mediatized, since the greater length of UK television news conventions and the ability to ‘go live’ longer allowed journalists greater freedom to interpret politics.","New Media, New Practices?

Under what circumstances, then, do reporters exercise their skepticism after all? - The present study is the first systematic attempt to determine the presence or absence of cross-verification in every news item, and to reconstruct the work process which underlies it, on the basis of a large-scale quantitative data set (N=847), including Israeli print, radio, online and television news. We find, inter alia, that the nature of events, the institutional roles and seniority of sources, editorial involvement in the news item, reporters' frequency of contact with sources, perceived importance of information, and technological channels through which information is attained, are all related to reporters' decision to cross-verify. These patterns of reliance on sources call for an epistemological theory of journalism which conceptualizes reporters as economists of skepticism, who regard it as a scarce resource used only under specific organizational, social and technological circumstances.","New Media, New Practices?

Through content analysis of print and online news stories in the Israeli media, this article establishes a link between temporal orientations in different types of media outlets and the temporal constraints of news cycles. The study shows that a future temporal orientation is more dominant in print media, which assume the role of projecting future events, analyzing potential outcomes, and shaping collective expectations. In contrast, online news outlets tend to focus on the near past, thereby fulfilling the ""traditional"" journalistic function of reporting on recent events. Further analysis suggests that these cross-media differences are associated with both the topical focus of news stories and the temporal conditions of news production. It is consequently argued that different media have divergent “temporal affordances”, which shape and reshape their social functions in changing media landscapes.","New Media, New Practices?

We found that investigative reporters in China form a close-knit community. On average, reporters claimed to know about more than thirty colleagues from various media institutions. The top three popular forms of collaboration are to share informants, to share background information on a news topic, and to offer materialistic help. Meanwhile, reporters seem to hold pretty positive thoughts toward such favor exchange behavior, believing that collaboration could bring truth to the public and could facilitate reporters’ investigation. Reporters’ social network size and closeness showed strong predictive power in predicting collaboration frequency but not so much in predicting one’s attitude toward collaboration.

In open investigative reporting, citizens and journalists form a powerful alliance in which citizens monitor the power holders and thus gain agency in the public sphere. Open journalism also provides tools with which citizens and power holders can monitor journalism, thus creating reciprocal dynamics in the modern manifestations of power in panopticonism.

We found that (a) bias is a significant predictor of commenting, and (b) presence of comments lowers self-other differences and perceptions of story bias. Additionally, we found that subjects were more likely to comment on stories they found bias against their position (a form of corrective action), and that subjects were more likely to share and like stories they found biased in favor of their position as a form of promotional action.",Citizens as Collaborators: Extending the Voices of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0731,2014,Paper Session,Strike a Pose! How Pose and Expression in Online Profile Pictures Affect Impressions of Interpersonal Attraction and Intelligence,4,"While the profile picture is one of the most prominent features of social networking sites, little is known about how the way one is depicted on a profile picture affects impression formation. This study investigates how the type of online profile picture affects impressions of physical attraction, social attraction and intelligence. This was investigated in a 3 (camera distance: full body vs. head and chest vs. face only) x 2 (body angle: frontal vs. 45º angle) x 3 (expression: neutral vs. smiling vs. sexy / duck face) experimental design in which 232 participants each rated four profile pictures. Facial expression has the strongest impact on impression formation: profile pictures in which the profile owner is smiling are rated more attractive than neutral or sexy expressions. Although men found a sexy expression (a “duck face”) equally attractive as a smiling expression, women did not. Profile owners with a sexy expression on their profile picture are rated lower on intelligence. Close-up pictures were rated as less attractive than pictures taken from further away. Camera angle seemed to have no effect on ratings of interpersonal attraction and intelligence.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0732,2014,Paper Session,Negative Hyperpersonal Intensification Effects of Religiosity in E-Mail Signature Blocks,1,"This research explores the intensification of email receivers’’ negative attributions of a message sender based on the inclusion of varied religious quotations in the sender’s signature line. Competing hypotheses are tested, drawing from previous research into the inclusion of religious disclosures in professional communication and the hyperpersonal model. Additional hypotheses assess the influence of the strength of a receiver’s religious beliefs and the relational context of the message. A 3 (Christian, Islamic, or Secular signature line) × 2 (personal or professional context) experiment generally supported the hyperpersonal model’s explanation and intensification of attributions and supported two moderation effects. Findings revealed subjects attributions of a sender were more negative when the sender and receiver identified with disparate social (i.e., religious) categories. This perceptual effect was intensified when a) senders more strongly held their religious beliefs; and b) in a professional relational context.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0733,2014,Paper Session,Counting on Friends: Cues to Trustworthiness in Facebook Profiles,1,"Social network sites are frequently used for accessing information about others. Thus, it is important to understand how users evaluate one another on the basis of these profiles. The present study examines how the perceived trustworthiness of Facebook profile owners is shaped by information present in their profiles, or profile cues. Drawing on uncertainty reduction theory, warranting theory, and hardwired perceptions of facial displays, we identify a set of cues utilized by observers when assessing strangers’ trustworthiness on Facebook. Results show that five profile cues (number of friends, number of tagged photographs, number of “about me” categories filled out, comments received from friends, and smiling photographs) explain a third of the variance in trustworthiness perceptions. Theoretical and design implications of the findings are discussed.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0734,2014,Paper Session,Determining Attraction of Online Dating Site Profiles,3,"The aim of this study was to investigate which cues available on dating site profiles determine attraction towards a profile owner. 400 online dating sites profiles were rated by 40 participants, who each rated 10 profiles. The profiles were rated on social and romantic attraction, physical attraction, and perceived similarity. Furthermore, we calculated actual demographic and lifestyle similarity based on the profile owner’s information and the information provided by the participant who rated that specific profile. Finally, we coded the matching score the dating site provided. Results revealed that physical attraction was the strongest indicator of romantic and social attraction. Similarity also affected attraction. Lifestyle similarity and matching score were related to perceived similarity while demographic similarity was not. Findings indicate that the main factors influencing attraction in regular dating also seem to be the most important factors in the online dating process.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology

Youth’s experience and use of social media for political purposes has become critical for these groups. Therefore, it is relevant to ask: How can we motivate online political participation? Online Political Efficacy, defined within a social cognitive theory framework (Bandura, 1997) as individual’s perceptions that they are capable of using online media for political purposes, was proposed to resolve weaknesses and inconsistencies in prior theories of online political participation. College students’ perceptions of online political efficacy were increased by successful experiences using social media for political purposes. The relationship between online political efficacy perceptions and online political participation was stronger than that between a measure of internal political efficacy employed in prior research and online political participation.",Collective Action Mobilization With Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0736,2014,Paper Session,Cultivating an Active Online Counterpublic: Examining Usage and Political Impact of Internet Alternative Media,2,"While alternative media have long been playing important roles in the politics of protests and resistance in many countries, the Internet has led to the emergence of online alternative media and arguably expanded the reach of such outlets. This article focuses on the audience of Internet alternative media. It examines the factors associated with usage and whether and how usage relates to political participation. Analysis of survey data (N=1,018) in Hong Kong shows that, not surprisingly, Internet alternative media usage was driven by pre-existing political attitudes and critical views toward the mainstream media. But social media usage could also drive alternative media usage even among people who did not hold congruent pre-existing attitudes. Meanwhile, alternative media usage leads to protest participation and support for unconventional protest tactics. The study thus provides empirical evidence regarding how Internet alternative media can facilitate the formation of an active online counter-public and the role of social media in potentially enlarging the counter-public.",Collective Action Mobilization With Social Media,Communication and Technology

It employs data from a repeated cross-sectional survey before, during and after the 2011 students’ demonstrations in Chile. The results suggest that Facebook and—to a lesser degree—Twitter are related to protest behavior, but this relationship is not constant. Rather, Facebook use becomes increasingly predictive of street protesting, whereas the impact of Twitter is only significant at the height of the student movement. Furthermore, the diffusion of social media has not altered major gaps on the likelihood of protesting. These findings highlight the value of studying the time dynamics of the social media-protest relationship.",Collective Action Mobilization With Social Media,Communication and Technology

Results showed that college students with more civic voluntarism predictors (i.e., resources, psychological engagement, and recruitment) tend to participate more in political activities. The findings further revealed that individual subcomponents of each civic voluntarism predictor have different effects on political participation online and offline.

Based on uses and gratifications theory, the current study explored structural relations among individuals’ specific motivations for using the Internet, their specific use of the web, credibility perceptions of online information and trust in the press using structural equation modeling method (N=996). Consistent with our predictions, the distinct motivations (i.e., information seeking, social utility, and entertainment) were associated with the use of web portals, news websites, and social networking sites, respectively. Our findings also indicated that the use of news websites particularly influences users’ perceptions of the credibility of online information as well as trust in the press. Furthermore, a significant association between credibility perceptions of online information and trust in the press was revealed.

Koreans were more likely than U. S. Americans to prefer entertainment messages that induce conflicting responses (e.g., feeling positive and negative, laughing and crying). Furthermore, this cultural difference was larger for positively-valanced (i.e. comedy) than for negatively-valanced message (i.e., sad films).

2014-0744,2014,Paper Session,Effects of Hedonic and Eudaimonic Television Clips on Viewers' Affective States and Subsequent Program Selection,2,"Typically, research on enjoyment motivations for media selection has centered on hedonic, or pleasure-seeking motivations. Recently eudaimonic, or truth-seeking, motivations have also received attention. Most investigations into hedonic and eudaimonic motivations for media consumption have conceptualized these motivations as traits, rather than as states, using surveys to determine that long-standing hedonic and eudaimonic motivations influence entertainment preferences. This experiment explored the possibility that more temporary hedonic and eudaimonic states can also be induced by media exposure. A laboratory experiment successfully manipulated hedonic and eudaimonic states using clips with either hedonic or eudaimonic tone from three different television programs, with clip tone affecting participants’ reports of hedonic and eudaimonic states as well as meaningful and fun affect. The experiment also found partial evidence that clip tone might influence subsequent program selection, but only with one program of three in the study.

An online questionnaire of Harry Potter fans (N = 235) examined how specific individual differences among these fans relate to their involvement in fan communities, and how fandom is associated with affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses. Findings indicate positive associations between consumption of Harry Potter products, eudaimonic motivations, and reflectiveness, and fandom. Further, fandom is positively related to enjoyment, appreciation, physiological reactions, knowledge acquisition, and intentions to seek Harry Potter-related products. Implications of the role of fandom in extending entertainment scholarship in the area of media effects are discussed.",Affect and Emotion in Mass Media,Mass Communication
2014-0746,2014,Paper Session,Testing the Reliability of the Intuitive Motivation-Affect Misattribution Procedure (IM-AMP),5,"Previous research using an intuitive motivation-affect misattribution procedure (IM-AMP) has demonstrated that the portrayal of moral domains in entertainment can influence the short-term salience of moral intuitions. Two experiments extended this research to examine whether (a) news content could increase the accessibility of specific moral intuitions and (b) the overall pattern of domain salience portrayed in news content could influence the pattern of domain salience observed in viewers. Although mixed support was found for specific predictions in study one, findings from both studies were consistent with predictions from the model of intuitive morality and exemplars (MIME) suggesting that news can prime specific moral intuitions. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the overall pattern of domain salience portrayed in news can shape patterns of moral domain salience in viewers. The findings support the theoretical logic underlying the MIME, and the ability of the IM-AMP to reliably measure the salience of moral intuitions.",Affect and Emotion in Mass Media,Mass Communication

The same MMT mechanics have also been assumed to aid in media-induced recovery experience, but such effects have not been tested. To this end, the present study examines the impact of hedonic valence and arousal regulation on the satisfaction of recovery needs through the use of non-interactive media with opposing affective valences (positive vs. negative). Results demonstrate that entertaining media contribute to recovery through distinct mechanisms: negative-valenced media aided in recovery through increased arousal while positive-valenced media aided in recovery via increased positive affect. Overall, individuals higher in need for recovery and those experiencing chronic stress were less able to recover using non-interactive media. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research on media-induced recovery via distinct pathways.",Affect and Emotion in Mass Media,Mass Communication

Data were collected through online experimental surveys at two large universities in the Northeastern United States. Advancing research based on the RISP model, information insufficiency and attribution of treatment responsibility were experimentally manipulated. Results indicate that perceived issue salience triggered negative affect and information insufficiency, both of which prompted systematic processing, which subsequently led to greater policy support and stronger intention to adopt more pro-environmental behaviors. Further, with a few exceptions, these relationships were consistent across the experimental conditions. From an applied perspective, this study suggests important pathways to encourage greater message elaboration, which may lead to increased public support for mitigation policies and adoption of pro-environmental behavior.",Risk Models and Communities at Risk: From Climate Change to Asbestos,Environmental Communication

PROCESS models suggest both direct and indirect negative impacts of aggressive risk communication, particularly in the case of likability. Agreement with the underlying message both moderated the impact of aggressive communication and had direct impacts on perceptions and behavioral intentions of the respondents. Much of the impact of exposure to aggressive communication was also mediated by either perceived aggressiveness (experiment 1) or perceived politeness (experiment 2). There was no evidence of positive impacts (i.e., higher perceived communication quality) from aggressive risk communication.

They are characterized by corrosive and long-lasting community divisiveness, and often severe and long-term mental health problems among victims. We tested a model that specifies pathways whereby community social dynamics influence psychological adaptation in this class of disasters. Data were collected in Libby, MT, where decades’ long and widespread amphibole asbestos exposure has caused more than 400 deaths; more than 2300 have been diagnosed with asbestos-related disease (ARD). Prior research found that people with ARD experience worse psychological problems than other community members. Results supported the model’s hypothesized pathways. Specifically, greater community conflict was associated with greater interpersonal conflict. In turn, the relationship between interpersonal conflict and psychological adjustment was mediated by stigma and social constraints. Results identify potential points of intervention for preventing or ameliorating mental health problems associated with this class of disasters.",Risk Models and Communities at Risk: From Climate Change to Asbestos,Environmental Communication

Video captures speaking performances then is utilized for student self-evaluation. Use of video in the basic communication course became prominent in the 1970s and continues to be utilized presently. We estimated students’ perception of their presentation after viewing their performances and answering self-evaluation criteria. We generated composite scores that assessed the difference between students’ estimated earned grade minus their actual grade earned for both speeches. These composite score resulted in three estimator forms: under-estimators, accurate-estimators, or over-estimators. We found that the majority of students were over estimators. We then applied the Meaning Extraction Method (MEH) used to generate specific themes generated in speech self-evaluations based on their estimator type. We found that under estimators generated twelve themes and accurate and over estimators generated ten themes. Additionally, the under and accurate estimators’ themes were more specific and detailed than over estimators describing the similar speechmaking components. These findings illustrate how students estimate their public speaking performance differently based on their perceived public speaking capability.","Narratives, Self-Presentation, and Cheating: From Edutainment to Lying in the Classroom",Instructional & Developmental Communication

By comparing advocacy organisations’ communicative practices to journalism, I devise a framework for understanding these practices. I draw upon this framework to explore two models of social media information use at advocacy organizations that address contrasting advocacy values (comparable to news values) vis-à-vis social media information – particularly its source metadata. The evidence model sees social media information as evidence to support advocacy claims and is thus concerned with source credibility and expertise. The engagement model is more interested in the volume of source participation, seen as corresponding with source emotion. The normative implication of drawing parallels between advocacy and journalism is that, just as we hold journalism to account on its ability to foster pluralism in the public sphere, so should we hold advocacy accountable.","Spaces of Contestation: Information, the Press, Advocacy, and Elites","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

During the last ten years however, we have seen a continuous expansion of public space via social networking media, and today most public institutions in Western states use social networking sites to communicate with their ‘citizens’. Although there are several severe problems connected with this, little have been said about it so far. In this article however, I will address the discussion in The right to the city by an analysis of a public institution vainly trying to establish communication with its ‘citizens’ in an urban space in a virtual world. My analysis concludes that the users of this new media platform did not regard themselves as citizens when dwelling in the urban space online, but as the consumers they are addressed as in this environment.","Spaces of Contestation: Information, the Press, Advocacy, and Elites","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Through frame analysis, the paper argues that beyond differences that are largely attributable to national and political contexts and 'particularities' , the elite mediated European Public Sphere presents remarkably clear and coherent narratives about the nature of the crisis and of Europe. These frames present a limited range of views and solutions and treat Europe not as a polity of citizens but one of elites, States and spatially defined tiers.

This paper develops a heuristic framework for examining information activism as a key element of social movement communication. It briefly summarizes dominant understandings of information and presents Floridi’s constructionist and semantic theory of information as a more relevant way for communication scholars to conceptualize information and related concepts, such as data and knowledge. It then reviews dominant approaches to social movements studies, highlighting the (sometimes problematic) understandings of communication practices in each approach. Although these approaches vary in their ability to account for social movement communication practices, and the role of information within them, they nevertheless provide a useful framework for conceptualizing different domains of communication activity. The paper discusses what Floridi’s work on information contributes to understandings of information activism within each of these frameworks. It concludes with a short discussion of important areas for future investigation.","Spaces of Contestation: Information, the Press, Advocacy, and Elites","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

An argument pro homine--the inverse of the ad hominem argument--is characterized by the frequent casual insertion of stakeholders into organizational discourse without context, relevance, or materiality. We catalogued and counted stakeholders appearances in the 2011 CSR annual reports of the 36 U.S. firms within the Global Forbes 2000. Firms' stakeholder inclusiveness scores were compared against each other and a wider population of discourses supplied by DICTION 6.0. Within the sample, five firms had insufficient levels of stakeholder inclusion, and six had excessive levels. When compared to DICTION's population, only one firm had an insufficient level, and no firms had excessive levels. We discuss the use of argument pro homine, where the presence of third-parties substitutes for arguments about CSR performance, legitimacy, transparency, and adequate disclosure.","Stakeholders, Corporate Strategies, and CSR",Public Relations

An experiment was conducted with three versions of a newspaper article: no anger, mild anger, and extreme anger. This article reported on plans to cancel a TV-show. Participants who were watchers of the program were expected to deem anger displays regarding the cancellation as generally more appropriate than non-watchers, because they likely have more positive pre-existing attitudes towards the program. Results showed that displayed anger about the cancellation influenced attitudes of watchers in the intended direction. For non-watchers, a boomerang effect was observed such that their attitudes towards the show were actually more negative when anger was displayed. These findings indicate that appropriateness is an important variable to consider when trying to understand the persuasive effects of anger.",News and Public Opinion,Mass Communication

Results show that issue public members with concern about a specific issue, exercised their issue-specificity in seeking information (i.e., issue-based selectivity) with exposure to both attitude-consistent and counter-attitudinal perspectives. Issue public membership also had significant effects on issue-specific knowledge, and generating rationales for their own and other’s oppositional viewpoints. These direct effects were mediated by issue-based selectivity. The relationships highlight the importance of issue publics in contributing to the deliberative democracy. In addition, issue publics play a significant role in contributing to the participatory democracy in that issue public members have greater intentions to participate in issue-related activities than nonmembers.

2014-0766,2014,Paper Session,"Policy Decision-Making, Public Involvement and Nuclear Energy: What Do Expert Stakeholders Think and Why?",5,"Despite new governmental initiatives aiming to engage the general public in policymaking related to nuclear energy, little is known about how expert stakeholders involved in the decision-making process perceive such activity. This study examines how a series of social, cognitive and communication factors influences expert stakeholders’ attitudes toward public participation in policy decisions related to nuclear energy. Using data from a survey of 557 experts, we find that among those perceiving public opinion as being split, not-for-profit stakeholders (e.g. governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations) are more likely to think public involvement is important than scientists and stakeholders from the private sector (e.g. industry and lobbying groups). The perception of a split public for the issue of nuclear energy seems to be driven by frequent use of online media (e.g., blogs and social networking websites). Implications of the findings with respect to promoting meaningful stakeholder participation in making policy decisions are discussed.",News and Public Opinion,Mass Communication
2014-0767,2014,Paper Session,Adolescents’ Antisocial Media Use Increases Their Cyberbullying Behavior: A Longitudinal Study,2,"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of adolescents’ antisocial media exposure on cyberbullying behavior over time. Following previous research, we proposed that exposure to antisocial media content would increase cyberbullying behavior. Furthermore, we assumed boys and girls to differ in this respect. These assumptions were tested in a longitudinal design with three waves (N = 1006). Results of mixed model analyses showed that higher levels of exposure to media with antisocial content significantly contributed to higher initial rates of cyberbullying behavior. Furthermore, an increase in exposure to antisocial media content was significantly related to an increase in cyberbullying behavior over time. Additionally, boys had higher initial cyberbullying rates than girls and both in boys and girls, an increase in exposure to antisocial media content was significantly related to an increase in cyberbullying behavior over time. Results will be discussed in view of adolescents’ media use and the larger theoretical framework.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0768,2014,Paper Session,Developmental Trajectories of (Cyber)Bullying Perpetration and Social Intelligence During Early Adolescence,2,"The purpose of the present study is to examine bullying perpetration and social intelligence (SI), which is a socio-cognitive characteristic that has been proposed as a possible regulator of on- and offline bullying. We compared SI for perpetrators and non-perpetrators of traditional bullying and/or cyberbullying and examined longitudinal associations. A four-wave panel study with 6-months time intervals was conducted among 1,103 adolescents aged 10 to 14. Latent class analysis was used to examine developmental trajectories of bullying across two years. Four profiles of bullies were found. In a next step, latent growth curves of SI were calculated for each profile. Cyberbullies have a higher level of SI in comparison to non-involved and traditional bullies. Traditional bullying does not require a high level of SI. For cyberbullies, the difference between their level of SI and that of others seems to matter as it may create “power”.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0769,2014,Paper Session,Gender Differences in the Association Between Peer Rejection and Adolescents’ Moral Judgment and Preferences for Antisocial Media Content,2,"The aim of the present study is twofold: 1) replicating and further validating previous findings indicating a relation between peer rejection and antisocial media use using more ecologically valid assessments of peer rejection, and 2) identify gender differences within this relationship. In Study 1, peer rejection (vs. acceptance) was manipulated using an autobiographical mood induction procedure, while in Study 2, peer rejection was measured using peer nominations. In line with previous research, peer rejected adolescents reported higher levels of anger instigating more tolerable moral judgments and preferences for antisocial media content in comparison to their accepted counterparts. Furthermore, gender differences were revealed in boys reporting higher levels of rejection-based anger than adolescent girls. Additionally, boys and girls at a lower educational ability level showed similar media preferences following social exclusion. That is, when peer rejected, both boys and lower educated girls showed increased preferences for antisocial media content. Gender and educational differences in media use for coping purposes is further discussed.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media

Adolescents (N = 363, age range 10-16, M T1 = 12.84, SD = 1.93) were examined twice with a six-month delay. Controlling for social support in general terms, moderated regression analyses showed that Internet-related communication quality with parents determined whether Internet use is associated with an increase or a decrease in adolescents’ verbal aggression scores over time. A three way interaction indicated that high Internet-related communication quality with peers can have disadvantageous effects if the communication quality with parents is low. Implications on resources and risk factors related to the effects of Internet use are discussed.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0771,2014,Paper Session,Liked Characters Get a Moral Pass: Young Viewers’ Evaluations of Social and Physical Aggression in Tween Sitcoms,4,"The goal of this study was to examine how young audiences evaluate the social and physical aggression that is endemic in tween sitcoms. Preadolescents (N= 176) were randomly assigned to watch a tween sitcom that featured a likeable or unlikable character committing social or physical aggression (two exemplars at each level) to examine whether preadolescents’ moral evaluations of aggression were determined primarily by the extent of the aggression, or if tweens were swayed by affective dispositions toward the characters. Collectively, our results support Raney’s (2004) assertion that character liking precedes moral judgments. Moreover, the results of this study did not support the idea that viewers who like or feel similar to the victim will empathize more with the victim and disapprove of perpetrator aggression. These results are discussed in terms of disposition-based theories of media enjoyment.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0772,2014,Paper Session,Television Exposure and Fear of Crime in Adolescents: Exploring the Mediated Fear Model,2,"The potential impact of the mass media has been virtually neglected in the study of adolescent fear of crime. Research on adults posits an indirect relationship between television viewing and fear, mediated by perceptions of risk, control, and seriousness of crime. In an online survey of 3372 12- to 18-years-olds the relationship between TV exposure and fear of crime was mediated by at least one of the three cognitive factors. Exposure to News, Soap Operas, Music Videos and Crime Drama were all associated with either decreased or increased feelings of fear. For each genre this relationship was mediated by one or more of the three cognitive components. Some relationships differed significantly dependent upon age and gender. Our findings suggest that the age of 14 to 15 is pivotal: some relationships became either significant or non-significant or even changed signs around that age. Implications for future research are discussed.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0773,2014,Paper Session,The Individual or the Class: A Multilevel Analysis of Cyberbullying Behavior in School Context,3,"In previous research, cyberbullying was often analyzed from an individual-based perspective. The literature on traditional bullying in school, however, shows the socio-structural character of the phenomenon. We transferred these considerations to the media-based context of cyberbullying and explained this behavior using individual predictors, the social position of a person as well as context effects of the school class. In order to obtain individual and socio-structural data, we conducted a survey study in German schools (N=5656). Using network data and multilevel modeling, we show that attributes of the school class contributed only to a small extent to the risk of being involved in cyberbullying. On the individual level, previous experience with bullying in school as well as an intensive, unrestricted social use of the Internet were the strongest predictors of cyberbullying behavior. Based on these findings, the underlying social mechanisms and consequences for prevention and intervention strategies are discussed.","Aggression, Bullying, and Fear in a Media-Rich Environment: High-Density Session",Children Adolescents and Media

Even though peer delinquency has been extensively linked to an individual’s delinquent behavior in criminology, this study is among the first to consider it as a moderator of the relationship between violent video games and delinquent behavior. An online survey of 3372 [nationality deleted] adolescents, aged 12 to 18, found a significant relationship between violent video gaming and delinquent behavior, controlling for gender, age, overall gaming volume, sensation seeking, aggressiveness and peer delinquency. The relationship between violent video gaming and delinquency was positive for respondents with low aggressiveness scores, and negative for respondents with high scores. The relationship between violent video gaming and individual delinquency became stronger for respondents scoring higher on peer delinquency.

Family members are in a unique place to provide support yet research shows that this life period is marked by a drastic decrease in family contact and closeness. This mixed-method study explores how family identification is communicated to others. Transition variables such as self-esteem, uncertainty, social loneliness, and family satisfaction are explored in association with family identification. Data from 453 first-year college student participants illustrate how emerging adults communicate their family bond to others. Grounded theory analysis is used to discover how family identification is expressed through verbal and nonverbal communication from the participants’ point of view. Additionally, structural equation modeling reveals that family identification is positively associated with family satisfaction and self esteem, and is negatively associated with loneliness. Theoretical and practical implications for organizational identification and families with children entering emerging adulthood are discussed.",Top 4 Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

This paper presents diverse patterns of children’s nonverbal and verbal interrelationships of congruent/incongruent communication and explores them simultaneously. The study used a mixed multi-variant design to analyze parent-child interactions (n=160) in structured joint game-sequences, filmed in their homes. The findings explain children’s incongruence communication patterns (ICP) and reveal the effect of social and situational factors, including child’s gender, parent’s gender, socio-economic status, and task difficulty.

This study tested the alternative possibility that seeker behavior causes support provision. Weiner’s attribution-emotion-action model served as a theoretical framework for an experiment testing whether helpers’ decisions to provide esteem support are mediated by attributions and emotions about the job seeker. We also examined whether helper efficacy moderated support provision. A hypothetical job seeker’s preparation for the job market and current search behaviors were experimentally varied, with participants (N = 241) offered the chance to provide esteem support. Contrary to predictions, participants were more likely to give a message to less active job seekers. Controllability attributions mediated that effect and provider self-efficacy was associated with message provision.",Top 4 Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Heterosexual transmission and multiple sexual and concurrent partners have been identified as main drivers of the epidemic. Tchova Tchova Historias de Vida: Dialogos Comunitarios (TTHV) was a community and group-based communication intervention designed to address underlying social determinants, especially gender norms that directly fuel the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Through facilitated group dialogue, adult men and women in the provinces of Sofala and Zambezia in Mozambique engaged during 10 weeks, in critical thinking and discussion regarding gender norms and their intersection with HIV infection. The results of the evaluation after the project ended showed that TTHV participants increased their perception of risk and HIV, increased HIV discussion with sex partners, and changed their views about the roles of men and women in society, and how inequitable gender norms contribute to HIV infection.",Social Norms and Health Interventions,Health Communication
2014-0780,2014,Paper Session,Social Norms and Involvement in Health and Environmental Behaviors,3,"The Theory of Normative Social Behavior (TNSB) specifies the moderators of the descriptive norm-behavior relationship. Although specified in the model, the role of involvement as a moderator has not been fully explored. As such, this paper predicts that different forms of involvement (i.e., value-relevant, impression-relevant, and outcome-relevant involvement), function in different ways as moderators of the norm-behavior relationship. The paper presents data on 3 health and environmental behaviors examined in prior social norms studies: drinking of alcohol, fast food consumption, and recycling. Data from the study indicate that the nature of the relationship among the study variables is dependent on the focal behavior and that for fast food consumption, the descriptive norm-behavior relationship is moderated by value relevant involvement and behavioral identity. For recycling, the descriptive norm-behavior relationship is moderated by impression-relevant involvement. Other direct effects were evidenced in the data.",Social Norms and Health Interventions,Health Communication
2014-0781,2014,Paper Session,Tapping Into Traditional Norms for HIV Prevention: Harnessing the Influence of Grandmothers (Agogos) in Malawi,4,"Young girls are disproportionately infected with HIV/AIDS in Malawi.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a pilot training that sought to enhance the skills of Agogos to discuss issues related to sex with young girls. Data from 8 focus group discussions were analyzed, comparing trained Agogos and the girls they counseled to untrained Agogos and the girls they counseled. Trained Agogos and the girls they counseled reported being more comfortable in communicating sexual issues with young girls at earlier ages, were more likely to have interactive, two-way discussions, and were more likely to stress HIV prevention and the importance of finishing school as reasons to delay sexual activity, rather than focusing on marriage prospects.

2014-0782,2014,Paper Session,The Mediating Effect of Emotion on the Comparison Between Descriptive Norm Information and Recycling Behaviors,2,"Based on the focus theory of normative conduct and perspectives on discrete emotion, it was predicted that the effect of descriptive norm messages on satisfaction and guilt, and behavioral intentions toward recycling would be moderated by prior recycling behavior. It was also predicted that the descriptive norm message–intention relationship is mediated by emotional responses which result from a discrepancy between prior recycling and the descriptive norm message. In the main experiment, one hundred-eighty-eight college students were exposed to either a high- or a low-prevalence message. Prior recycling, aroused emotions, and intention to recycling were measured to see if any differences existed as a function of the individual’s prior recycling behavior and descriptive norm message exposure. Overall, results indicated that prior recycling moderated only the relationship between descriptive norms messages and intention to recycling. Descriptive norms message was a significant predictor of satisfaction while prior recycling was a significant predictor of guilt.",Social Norms and Health Interventions,Health Communication

Primarily due to speeding, young drivers are over-represented among traffic participants injured or killed in accidents. The processes of segmentation and targeting were conducted on the basis of 1,168 face-to-face interviewed German car drivers, aged between 17 and 24. Based on motivational models of health behavior, we identified four different types of risk drivers in the sample who differ in their motivational profiles. In a second step, typical communication behaviors of these driver risk groups were extracted from the data. By linking these risk and communication profiles, we were able to derive strategic implications for developing tailored road safety campaigns. Conceptual conclusions regarding promising segmentation and targeting strategies are discussed also beyond the current case of anti-speeding campaigns.",Risk Communication and Health,Health Communication

To be specific, when Republicans were exposed to messages emphasizing anthropogenic responsibility (worldview incongruent argument) for an emergent infectious disease shared by humans and animals (here, Lyme disease), they showed even lower levels of anthropogenic attribution compared with before they read the message. In turn, Republicans showed lower levels of prevention intentions (conservation intentions). Importantly, this worldview backfire occurs when a participant’s psychological mindset is set in a concrete one with a proximal temporal marker (i.e., the disease is a public health threat today) whereas the backfire was not found when the disease was construed in an abstract mindset with a temporally distal marker (i.e., the disease is a public health threat in the next ten years).",Risk Communication and Health,Health Communication

Findings suggest that higher risk perception is associated with lower intention for binge drinking, and the association is marginally significant. Risk messages in both tabular and graphic formats are more effective in increasing risk perception than those in textual format, and that there is no significant difference between table and graph in terms of risk perception. Numeracy and its interaction with message formats do not predict risk perception. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications and potential strategies for risk-message design and implementation.

Yet deliberation is often treated as an event format or process rather than as a communicative practice. This paper complements these existing treatments of deliberation by theorizing what we call deliberative moments by suggesting key elements of how deliberation is co-constructed and accomplished in interaction. Similar to their analog dialogic moments, deliberative moments are intense moments of awareness of self, other, and issue. Deliberative moments involve three elements: a reason-giving exchange marked by disagreement, stance indicators of listening and respect, and inclusion. We define each of these categories and provide empirical examples. We conclude by noting how scholars and practitioners can use the concept of deliberative moments.","Discursive and Cultural Constructions of Politics, Public Discourse, and Deliberative Moments",Language & Social Interaction

We set out to fill that gap by drawing on theories and methodologies within the tradition of the ethnography of communication. First, we lay out the problem of the gap between Anglo and non-Anglo interpretations of public speaking. Next, we use Hymes’s SPEAKING framework and Carbaugh’s Cultural Discourse Theory to reconstruct the Anglo optimal form (Wilkins, 2005) of public speaking from an article by the rhetorician J. Michael Sproule. Then, we highlight alternative cultural models of public speaking we identified through a review of fifty anthropological studies. Finally, we discuss four potential benefits of cultural reflection on the dominant Anglo ideal of public speaking: facilitating cultural immersion, exploring alternative contexts for public speaking, importing advantageous practices, and exporting emancipatory practices.","Discursive and Cultural Constructions of Politics, Public Discourse, and Deliberative Moments",Language & Social Interaction

Thus, it is surprising to find only a few accounts of how people are doing 'being insulted' or of how, in public discourse, responses to insults are strategically employed for various ends. This paper analyzes the meta-pragmatics of “hurt feelings” in order to understand how speakers do things with emotions. By examining instances in which public figures have stated their insulted feelings in Israeli public discourse (1997-2012), I show both how hurt feelings are employed to protest against ‘politically unacceptable acts,’ and how public actors sometimes explicitly refuse to be insulted, shifting the meaning of what is perceived as an insult by side-participants into a compliment. I conclude by discussing the consequences of expressive perlocutionary acts in public discourse.","Discursive and Cultural Constructions of Politics, Public Discourse, and Deliberative Moments",Language & Social Interaction

Results of this study indicate the efficacy of social networking through global communication networks to promote social justice is not easily accomplished, even though a spectacular viral video seen by 100 million people. The online social capital accumulated through a global communication network was not enough to fuel coordinated social action. Social action and long-term social change costs much more than the social capital of bridging processes; it instead requires the hard work of bonding processes.

2014-0799,2014,Paper Session,The Japanese Console Game Industry: Capcom and Level-5,1,"This paper explores how Japan’s major console game development studios have moved from a strong early history of game development and sales to an industry allegedly on the brink of global irrelevancy. To do that this paper examines two companies –Capcom and Level-5. It compares the operations of a more traditional game publisher and developer with a comparatively younger and smaller company that has been remarkably successful despite any extensive efforts to create games for western audiences. A few key findings emerge. First, there is a certain larger discourse at work, that some ineffable difference exists between Japanese and western game studios. Japanese studios simply cannot make games for westerners—there is something so different about Japan that it cannot be translated or compensated for. Thus, Japanese studios must purchase, partner or hire western studios to do the work for them. Yet Level-5’s games sell well in the west due to strong localization, solid gameplay and studio expertise in creating RPGs and puzzle-style games. Capcom’s studio partnerships are based on expertise in particular tools, solid market research, and proven genre expertise. Both companies work hard to establish transparent work routines when communicating across studios and cultures; and both have global top sellers as well as games and series that are targeted to specific markets. All of these elements suggest that it is not a cultural chasm that limits global game sales—although player expectations and preferences can differ from one culture or region to another, based on past experiences as well as marketing efforts.",Industry and Public Perception of Video Games: Crafting Tools for A Good Life,Game Studies

The results show that videogame journalists are young men, often with little formal journalism training, who have deep-held beliefs about the relative worth of “Hardcore” and “Casual” games, even if the definitions are elusive – and they are deeply conflicted about the roles women are and should be playing in the gaming industry, both on and off the screen.",Industry and Public Perception of Video Games: Crafting Tools for A Good Life,Game Studies
2014-0801,2014,Paper Session,Virtual Stereotype Lift: Effects of Arbitrary Gender Representations on Quantitative Task Performance in Avatar-Represented Virtual Groups,3,"This experiment investigated how social category representation via avatars affects stereotype-relevant task performance. In particular, building on and extending the Proteus effect model, we explored whether and how stereotype lift (i.e., a performance boost caused by the awareness of a domain-specific negative stereotype associated with outgroup members) occurred in virtual group settings involving arbitrary gender representations. Female and male participants (N = 120) were randomly assigned either a female avatar or a male avatar through a process masked as a random drawing. Placed in a numerical minority status with respect to virtual gender, participants performed a mental arithmetic task either competitively or cooperatively. The data revealed that participants who were arbitrarily represented by a male avatar and competed against two ostensible female avatars showed strongest performance compared to others, and this pattern occurred regardless of participants’ gender. Additional mediation tests showed that task motivation partially mediated the effect.",Top Four Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2014-0802,2014,Paper Session,Immersive Virtual Environments That Promote Environmental Behaviors Also Encourage Indulgent Eating via the Licensing Effect,3,"According to the licensing effect (Miller & Effron, 2010), eliciting a desirable behavior in one domain may paradoxically lead to transgressions in another. When people feel they earn moral credits doing good deeds, these credits may then license bad behavior. Using a 2 (immersion) x 2 (virtual rewards) design, the current experiment aimed to explore whether a good deed in the virtual world would encourage participants to transgress in the physical world. After performing a virtual good deed in one domain (pro-environmental behavior), participants had the opportunity to transgress in a different domain (diet) by eating candy. Engaging in a virtual good deed in a highly immersive virtual environment and receiving virtual rewards led individuals to perceive the highest levels of psychological licensing and feel that they have earned the most moral credits. These credits helped lower their inhibitions about transgressions and led them to indulge in eating more candy than participants in the other conditions.",Top Four Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology
2014-0803,2014,Paper Session,The Impact of Structure on Response Decisions for Recipients of Distressing Disclosures: The Bystander Effect,2,"Research has largely ignored confidants’ decision-making processes, especially in social networking sites. The present study examines the impact of structural features of an SNS environment on confidants’ responses to disclosures of distress decisions, against the backdrop of research on the bystander effect, a psychological phenomenon in which larger amounts of bystanders present leads to decreased likelihood and speed of the victim’s receipt of aid. Participants were led to believe they were viewing an acquaintance’s distressing post on Facebook, and were given the option to either publicly comment or skip the posting. Response decisions and latencies were recorded. Findings indicate that structure indeed impacts response decisions: individuals were less likely to help in the presence of greater numbers of bystanders, and those who left a comment took longer to help when those bystanders included more friends. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.",Top Four Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

This study relies on a multidimensional network perspective, where both people and ICTs are viewed as multiple relations within a single communication network. In this study we survey a random sample of diverse stakeholders who received multiple emergency notifications. The findings suggest that text messages sent by official sources played a pivotal role in reaching members of this organization and this pattern changed over time. Personal communication technologies—mobile phones—were harnessed to reach specific stakeholder groups and ICT use varied based on people’s location when the emergency happened. ICTs typically considered more of a mass medium (i.e., television and radio), or social medium (Twitter and Facebook) did not play a key role in the attention-getting phase of this emergency.",Top Four Papers in Communication and Technology,Communication and Technology

2014-0806,2014,Paper Session,The Performer Metaphor: “Mother Nature Never Puts on the Same Show Twice”,1,"This study ethnographically identifies and examines the commonsense Western metaphor of nature as performer. The performer, or “show,” metaphor is in line with deep-seated Western ecocultural conceptions, in which humans are perceived as separate from, and audience to, a spectacular nature,. To call attention to the cultural cohesiveness of “show,” I draw attention to the term’s prevalent use as a publicly available symbol for human-nature encounters, its network of metaphoric entailments, and its generally unreflected or unremarked upon meaning. In the materiality and physicality of ecotourism, “show” becomes an apperture to explain phenomenological experience and processes of involvement. At the same time, the apperture constrains dialogical meaning-making and is wrapped up within particular unsustainable economies, ideologies, and histories. I illustrate a range of case study expressions of “show” and examine the struggle in using alternative metaphors that might allow for re-encountering nature anew.",Critiques of Environmental Discourse and Ideology,Environmental Communication

Disney Aulani Resort Discourses of Indigenous Hawaiian Ecocultures,2,"Dominant U.S. American material and symbolic practices produce discourses about Hawaiian culture that forge problematic representations of colonial history, indigenous identities, and the environment. Hawai‘i’s burgeoning tourism industry casts structural shadows of Western development and globalization on indigenous Hawaiian ecocultures. In 2011, Disney opened its first resort in the Hawaiian islands, calling it the Disney Aulani Resort (DAR). Our study critically inhabits how indigenous Hawaiian culture and Hawai‘i’s environment are discursively produced and positioned in texts created by and discussing the DAR. We, through an integrated postcolonial ecocultural approach and critical discourse analysis, reveal and critique discourses surrounding an ideology that suggests that Disney is Hawai‘i’s cultural, economic, and environmental savior. An innovative process of disneyification emerges as we argue that the DAR marks a magically disguised (neo)colonization of indigenous Hawaiian ecocultures.",Critiques of Environmental Discourse and Ideology,Environmental Communication

To examine how this human privilege operates, I study primetime television’s characterization of ethical vegetarianism via the rebellious dietary choices of America’s longest running vegetarian characters -- Lisa on The Simpsons and Phoebe on Friends. In analyzing how their animal rights identities are perceived and negotiated by the shows’ meat-eating mainstream, I articulate how, and to what extent, these strong, progressive vegetarian females serve as a challenge to the hegemony of carnism (Joy, 2010), a violent ideology rationalizing the consumption of certain animals as normal, natural, and necessary. Drawing upon Bergson’s (1956) theory of laughter, my findings reveal how comedic themes around vegetarians function to both reinforce and challenge carnism. Ethical vegetarianism ultimately represents a nonconformity that is democratically tolerated but not emulated or encouraged in television’s “carnonormative” social environment.",Critiques of Environmental Discourse and Ideology,Environmental Communication
2014-0809,2014,Paper Session,Neural Systems Associated With Self-Related Processing Predict Population Success of Health Messages,7,"Mass media can powerfully affect health decision-making, however the results of health campaigns vary. Converging evidence demonstrates that neural activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing can predict individual behavior in response to health messages. Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups can forecast population level campaign outcomes. No studies have investigated the psychological processes that underpin the link between neural activity and population level outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. The current investigation: 1) demonstrates that neural activity predicts population level responses to an anti-smoking campaign above and beyond self-report data; 2) demonstrates that activity within independently-localized self-related processing regions during health message exposure predicts population level campaign responses; and 3) demonstrates this relationship depends on message content—self-related neural processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral images.",Mass Communication and Health,Mass Communication

It conceptualizes a model for audience members’ parasocial interaction and identification with cast members and explores antecedents and outcomes of parasocial interaction and identification. Data analysis suggests the following direct relationships: (1) audience members’ exposure to the show is positively associated with parasocial interaction, which in turn is positively associated with identification, (2) parasocial interaction is positively associated with exercise self-efficacy, whereas identification is negatively associated with exercise self-efficacy, and (3) exercise self-efficacy is positively associated with exercise behavior. Indirect effects of parasocial interaction and identification on exercise self-efficacy and exercise behavior are also significant.

The framework is built on the influence-of-presumed-influence model, which allows us to examine how media and peer influence interact with each other and exert joint effects. We conducted paper-and-pencil and online surveys of 555 university students in Singapore. Results of the surveys suggest that, in addition to its direct effect, cosmetic surgery related media content produces an indirect effect on young people’s attitudes toward cosmetic surgery via their presumed influence of such content on peers. Practical implications for educators of this study are also discussed.",Mass Communication and Health,Mass Communication

2014-0814,2014,Paper Session,Does the Gold Medal Really Matter for Every Country?: A Panel Study on the Foreign Countries’ Image Among Chinese Audience After Beijing and London Olympics,1,"Abstract
Based on data from a cross-year panel survey, and the 2008 & 2012 Olympic medal index, this study largely confirmed the conclusions from 1st phase of this project that overall performance of a country in the Olympic Games was positively correlated with both its current and comparative scores of national image in the minds of Chinese audiences. However, an increase in the number of medals collected during the two Olympics by economically lower-tier countries was not correlated to the rise of their national image. Knowing of foreign countries and relevant media issue may also play a significant role of image construction.
With the theoretical perspectives of agenda setting and cultivation analysis as a guide, the current project intends to test whether the highly publicized Olympic Games have the effect of promoting national images, as politicians and governments claim they do. Here, national image is operationally defined with three indicators: a country’s athletic ability, its general strength, and favorable feeling toward the country. The study also tries to identify a logical path and the relative size of influence between these three indicators.
A probability sample of 803 subjects in Shanghai and Guangzhou, China, were interviewed face-to-face in after 2008 Beijing Olympic and 289 of them were successfully interviewed again after 2012 London Olympic. In both survey, subjects were asked to score 18 representative countries on the aforementioned three national image indicators. In addition, for each of these 18 countries, the medal totals in both the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games were collected and standardized into the Olympic Medal Index scores.","Rights, Ideology, and Diplomacy: Key Issues for Intercultural Communication",Intercultural Communication

With the increase in international students enrolling in colleges and universities in the United States, there are increased opportunities for public diplomacy but also a new array of challenges as well. This paper develops the relationship between public diplomacy and international student education and includes a description of a number of public diplomacy obstacles related to international student education. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of improved community, cultural, intercultural and institutional resources in order to provide positive international educational experiences that further public diplomacy goals. Two short case studies are presented on 1.) How policy and structural changes at a southeastern university could improve the international student experience and 2.) How such concerted efforts are justified based upon the experience and career of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi.

Three identified ideologies that support and prop-up such a belief include: 1) meritocracy: belief that sheer hard work will pay off and allow one to achieve the American Dream; 2) self-made/self-willed individualism: belief that an individual’s identity is recognized strongly as self-chosen rather than the culture identity one born into; and 3) universalism: belief that despite privilege, we are all equally-created, and such liberty and equality should be celebrated. Implications for teaching/theorizing in a “post-racial” era are discussed.","Rights, Ideology, and Diplomacy: Key Issues for Intercultural Communication",Intercultural Communication

A 2 (proactive CSR: CSR vs. no CSR) x 2 (crisis type: preventable vs. victim) x 3 (reactive CSR strategy: high-fit vs. low-fit vs. no CSR) between-subjects experiment was employed. A total of 371 consumer samples were used for the analysis. The findings of the study suggest the ability of CSR communication to counter potential reputational damage caused by a crisis, which add empirical evidence of CSR as a promotional method of impression management, but it does not play a role as a remedy after crisis. The study also suggests that CSR history would fit in a SCCT model as the variable that can be added as an intensifier of attribution of crisis responsibility. The mediating role of perceived altruism suggests the importance of sincerity in CSR messages embedded with the value of proactive, voluntary, and consistent commitment.",Best Faculty Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

However, most of existing research is dominated by a functionalist understanding of country promotion as an external process of communication aimed at foreign audiences and by a focus on efficiency and better mastering instruments and technics. This article takes a step forward and bridges isolated perspectives in the three literatures, in order to propose a social constructivist and interdisciplinary approach for the study of country promotion that looks at the entire process – the internal debate within the nation about what is representative for the nation and the external communication campaigns aimed at foreign audiences.

Results of surveying 748 participants online support the utility of STOPS to identify the hot-issue public with active communication from the general population in a Chinese context. Results of examining the two cross-situational variables’ impact on the situational variables (program recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and referent criterion) indicate that party identity serves as a better identifier of subgroups of the hot-issue public than trust in the government. Theoretical implications for STOPS model in a hot-issue situation and the composition of hot-issue publics as well as practical implications for effective communication targeting the active public arising from the controversy are discussed.",Best Faculty Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

Furthermore, the study examined if personification of an organization could lead to an increased perceived relationship investment of the organization, eventually leading to an increased perceived relationship quality with the organization.
The results revealed that increased interactivity and conversational tone enhanced the organization’s personification as well as its personality trait associations, leading to an increased perceived relationship quality with the organization. More importantly, among the examined five personality dimensions, the sincerity dimension mediated the influence of personification on perceived relationship investment, suggesting that sincerity might be an important dimension for organization-public relationship building.",Best Faculty Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

Pornography (named by 22% of children who mentioned risks), conduct risk such as cyber-bullying (19%) and violent content (18%) were at the top of children’s concerns. The priority given to violent content is noteworthy insofar as this receives less attention than sexual content or bullying in awareness-raising initiatives. Many children express shock and disgust on witnessing violent, aggressive or gory online content, especially that which graphically depicts realistic violence against vulnerable victims, including from the news. Video-sharing websites such as YouTube were primary sources of violent and pornographic content.

Results from a national survey of 2,747 parent-child dyads revealed optimistic biases on the part of parents and children. Children experience greater optimistic biases as they grow older, and their view of their own skills in information evaluation converge with their parents' assessment of their skills over time. Moreover, significant antecedents of children’s and parents’ optimistic biases—including demographic background variables, cognitive thinking style, and perceived self-efficacy—were also uncovered. Greater parental optimistic biases were also related to increased mediation strategies used to regulate children's Internet use, and greater optimistic biases in children were associated with less tendency to believe online information and more analytical information evaluation behavior. Findings are considered in terms of optimistic bias and online credibility research, and the implications of the role of parents for children's digital information literacy are explored.",Young People Making Sense of Online Media,Children Adolescents and Media

2014-0827,2014,Paper Session,Jazz Vernacular and the Rhetoric of the Dispossessed in Spike Lee’s When the Levees Broke,2,"This essay proposes the “jazz vernacular,” a discourse structured by musical repertoire, as a tool for understanding racial discourses of disposability in Creole New Orleans. The jazz vernacular channels black Diasporic pain, playing in the background, both literally and figuratively, of communication in and about New Orleans. We argue that Spike Lee’s When the Levees Broke utilizes the jazz vernacular to reinforce residents’ use of jazz to process the rhetoric of the dispossessed in post-Katrina New Orleans. Through testimonials and affective visual and aural imagery, When the Levees Broke foregrounds jazz undertones to structure Katrina’s narrative. The elements of the jazz vernacular, which include displacement, embodiment, brashness, and improvisation, connect contemporary Creole New Orleanians to a long history of structural oppression and violence. Lee’s film performs a jazz intervention into neoliberal discourses about freedom, defense, safety, and heroism, contrasting these discourses with the despair and the resistance of black America.","Popular Communication, Everyday Imaginaries, and Transnationality",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Considering the confrontation between Asala and Assad as a clash between a celebrity and a dictatorial body, the paper grapples with the mix of gender, politics, and identity driving the controversy against the backdrop of a bloody civil war, via the following questions: What happens when a celebrity’s popular/commercial capital is reinvested in a political crisis? To what extent can the social capital of celebrity be “transferred” to revolutionary politics? What happens if we were to focus on the political dimensions of celebrity in a revolutionary context that offers sharp contrasts with the liberal democracies where celebrity-politics relations have been traditionally articulated?

Their careers are intimately tied to narcocorridos, a style of music and lyrics that narrates the lives, deeds, and adventures of people engaged in drug traffic. In addition, their personal brands and their brands’ circulation in the music industry harbor notions of authenticity that rely on mystifying claims about place and biography. This article examines the branding tactics that Ortiz and Rivera use to constitute their commercial identities in relation to a fictitious imaginary in which identity, place, violence, and consumption are central to authenticity. Considering their efforts to highlight their connection to Mexico and the manner their music circulates with their fans who, for instance, regularly comment that Ortiz sings “la pura verdad” (“the real truth”), authenticity matters.","Popular Communication, Everyday Imaginaries, and Transnationality",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

Using multiple resource theory and threaded cognition theory, this study investigated the effects of second-screen viewing on cognitive load, factual recall and comprehension of news. Second, we examined the effects of relevant (i.e., looking up information related to the news story) and irrelevant (i.e., looking up information unrelated to the story) second-screen viewing on learning from news. Results from an experiment (N=85) showed that second-screen viewing led to lower factual recall and comprehension of news content than single-screen viewing. These effects were mediated by cognitive load: second-screen viewing led to a higher cognitive load than single-screen viewing, with higher cognitive load, in turn, leading towards lower factual recall and comprehension of news content. Contrary to our expectations, we found no statistically significant differences between effects of relevant and irrelevant second-screen viewing.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

Radio speeches were developed with either a positive or negative frame and either rhetorical or no rhetorical formulations. By using short radio speeches for fictitious local political parties, speakers’ reputation, physical attraction, or gestures did not bias attention effects. Real-time measures of attention were collected. In Experiment 1, moment-to-moment self-reported attention measures showed that both rhetorical formulations and negative framing attracted immediate attention, but there were no effects on recall. In Experiment 2, immediate attention was measured with secondary task reaction times for the same speech manipulations on other topics. Similar effects were established for immediate attention, together with recall effects. In a multiple mediator model indirect effects of attention-getters on recall were analysed. Instead of immediate attention, comprehensibility mediated the effects on recall.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

An experimental study employing a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial between-subjects design was conducted (N = 189). First, participants were presented with an article using either emotional or rational language in order to induce attitudes primarily based on either affect or cognition. In a second step, participants were confronted with a strong or respectively weak persuasive appeal using either emotional or rational language. The results show a significant interaction between type of attitude induction, tone of the persuasive appeal, and persuasion strength. Participants showed greater susceptibility to persuasion appeals that matched their attitude base (e.g., attitude based on affect challenged with an emotional persuasion appeal) when the persuasion appeal was weak. On the other hand, participants confronted with a strong persuasion appeal showed greater susceptibility to mismatched persuasion (e.g., attitude based on affect challenged with a rational persuasion appeal).

As these methods rely on positive correlations between items, its assumptions will not be satisfied by bipolar scales (e.g., emotional moods or certain attitudes).

Unfolding takes into account the characteristics of bipolar concepts and allows for an ordering of items that do not necessarily positively correlate with each other on one scale. Furthermore, unfolding acknowledges that the difference between items on one scale is commonly not one of two extremes, but one of a gliding scale with intermediate classifications The procedure and use of unfolding are explained with a case study of soft versus hard news viewing behavior, and the created scale is compared with how previous studies have operationalized this concept.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems
2014-0835,2014,Paper Session,A Culture-Centered Approach to Infant Feeding: An Inverse Quest,1,"Breastfeeding is a basic public health issue linked to many health benefits to the mother and the infant. Despite these benefits and the scientific and medical discourse on the importance of breastfeeding, the rates of breastfeeding in the US remain very low especially among low-income mothers. From a Culture-centered Approach framework, this study looks at the constructions of infant feeding among WIC clients as they reflect on their decision to breastfeed or not. It further locates infant feeding as a site of agency performance situated within cultural practices and structural realities. Using Constructivist Grounded Theory, this study analyzed 32 in-depth Interviews with WIC clients, and 7 with WIC staff members along with my ethnographic account on breastfeeding and WIC. The study concludes by a proposition of an intervention plan receptive to marginalized communities acknowledging the structures and cultural norms.",Cultural Issues in Health Communication,Health Communication
2014-0836,2014,Paper Session,"Communication Processes and the Latino Health Paradox: Exploring Relationships Among Loneliness, Cultural Values, and Health",2,"This study aimed to explain the Latino health paradox (i.e., superior health of Latinos compared to Anglos despite socioeconomic disadvantages) through a social relationships perspective. Loneliness was hypothesized as a key mediator in the relationship between Latino cultural value of Spiritual well-being (SWB) and three health outcomes: overall health, depression and health practices. Spiritual well-being was predicted to be inversely related to loneliness, and reduced loneliness was predicted to be associated with good health. Ethnicity (i.e., being Latino) was hypothesized to predict endorsement of SWB. Participants were 319 adults (116 Anglos and 139 Latinos) ages 19-88. Results indicate that ethnicity predicted endorsing SWB. Spiritual well-being predicted better health through reduced loneliness for both Latinos and Anglos, and the effect size was greater for Latinos. Age did not moderate the impact of SWB on health through loneliness, suggesting that the indirect effects on health through loneliness are consistent throughout the lifespan.",Cultural Issues in Health Communication,Health Communication

The contested, challenged, and contradicting meanings articulated around health are often signs of power struggles and social injustices. In this presentation, we examine family care as such a contested space of meaning making. This paper explores understandings of care in the backdrop of left behind families in rural China when the middle generation from rural families in China have gone to cities to work. We work with the culture-centered approach to foreground local meanings of care, suggesting that projects of health communication can serve the goal of promoting care as a site of social change amid global flows of labour.

2014-0838,2014,Paper Session,Autism and Online Ethnography,2,"Ethnographic research on autism shifts from the bio-medical approach that dominates autism research and intervention to focus on sociality, social actors, community and culture. Since 1992 online autistic communities have emerged run by and for people with autism. Drawing on our previous work on autistic communities online, we argue that the ethnographic approach provides the opportunity to uncover the web of meanings that construct the autistic identity and culture. Online ethnography for research has been debated for years, and we revisit the ontological and practical challenges facing ethnography on the move from the field to the internet in the context of health communication research. The paper discusses the methodological challenges facing online ethnography through the critique of Whittel (2000) on online ethnography and respond to them in the context of autism research. We also discuss the feasibility of two possible conceptual solutions: Engaged Listening (Paechter, 2012) and User-Centered approach (Beneito-Montagut, 2011).",Cultural Issues in Health Communication,Health Communication
2014-0839,2014,Paper Session,Characterizing Discussion About Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Routine Visits Among Advanced Cancer Patients and Their Providers,4,"Background & Objectives. Cancer patients are among the top users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and research has shown that people with advanced cancer use CAM more frequently than others. The aim of this study is to characterize the conversations between providers and patients or caregivers about CAM during routine oncology visits.
Methods. Ethnographic methods were conducted over a 3-year period with a cohort of 80 advanced cancer patients and their providers. Participant observation fieldnotes were analyzed using discourse analysis to characterize CAM talk.
Results. CAM was mentioned in 78/229 (34.1%) of observed visits. Patients or caregivers overwhelmingly initiated talk about CAM (75.6%) compared to providers (24.4%). How a provider responded to CAM talk determined discussion (42.3%) or non-discussion (33.3%). Discussion was characterized by positive, neutral, or negative provider responses that encouraged further CAM talk. Non-discussion was characterized by unexpanded acknowledgment or disattention that discouraged further CAM talk.
Conclusions. Discussion and non-discussion are interactional outcomes contingent on providers’ responses. Providers should be aware that their communication behavior can encourage or discourage further talk about CAM.",Talking About Cancer: Patient Self-Disclosure and Willingness to Communicate,Health Communication
2014-0840,2014,Paper Session,"Disparities in Awareness, Opportunity, and Willingness to Participate in Clinical Trials Among Patients and Caregivers Attending a Minority-Serving University Cancer Center",1,"Background. Advances in cancer treatment are contingent on accrual of patients to cancer clinical trials (CCTs), but national recruitment rates are low, with particularly low rates of recruitment of ethnic minorities and underserved communities. These disparities are limiting the generalizability of research findings and might enhance inequities in cancer outcomes experienced in these communities. Whereas system-related barriers to accrual of underrepresented patients are largely well understood, few studies focused on patient-level barriers and facilitators to participation in CCTs in non-African American minority patients in the U.S. In view of the increasing ethnic diversity in the U.S., and the different historical and cultural experiences of different minority groups, it is important to explore perceptions of patients from different communities. The goal of this study was to examine CCT-related awareness, opportunity, and willingness to participate in CCTs in a sample of patients and caregivers attending a minority-serving university cancer center in the Southwest. Methods included cross sectional design was utilized, with 250 participants who completed questionnaire regarding their awareness, attitudes, and experiences concerning CCTs. Findings. Minority and low socio-economic status patients and caregivers were significantly less likely to indicate that they have heard about CCTs in the past, and less likely to report that a physician offered them participation in CCTs. Conclusion: The disparities in awareness and opportunity to participate in CCTs provide support to the importance of education of patients and of providers regarding CCTs in diverse populations. Future studies should examine culturally appropriate interventions.",Talking About Cancer: Patient Self-Disclosure and Willingness to Communicate,Health Communication

The present paper demonstrates the theory’s applicability to diagnosis disclosures and elucidates the information provider’s role as initiator in the information management process. The results indicate that the principles of TMIM explain a cancer patient’s decisions to disclose. More specifically, the findings advance understanding of how cancer patients make assessments about targets and their own communication abilities and how these evaluations influence the decision to disclose their cancer diagnosis to social network members. A modified version of the TMIM model is proposed for information providers and the implications of this are explored.",Talking About Cancer: Patient Self-Disclosure and Willingness to Communicate,Health Communication

Broadly, studying addressivity allows discerning how participants in interactions mark both their identities and the ratified recipients of their messages. My ethnographic study of structuring of addressivity takes places in semiotically and communicatively rich environments offered in heritage museums. Specifically, my illustrations are taken from two Jewish heritage museums, located in the US and Israel. I study visitors’ texts in visitor books (and similar public platforms) in these museums, and examine how various visitors position themselves performatively through their written utterances. I firstly ask: who are the visitors writing to and who they recognize as the museum’s imagined addressees or audiences? Then I critically address the consequences of different addressivity structures in terms of conjuring – including and excluding – imagined audiences and publics.","Exploring Multiple Modalities in Language and Social Interaction Research: Writing, 'Arabizi', Graffiti, and Sign Language",Language & Social Interaction

Using a combination of Roman letters and numbers, they have created a new “language” increasing exponentially in popularity. However, scholars, teachers, parents and some young people are increasingly concerned about the loss of Arabic writing skills. Through historical review, interviews and surveys, the core values users feel are achieved by the use of Arabizi are compared with skillsets which non-users believe are being lost forever.","Exploring Multiple Modalities in Language and Social Interaction Research: Writing, 'Arabizi', Graffiti, and Sign Language",Language & Social Interaction

The study makes several contributions to the study of the graffiti. Firstly, the study shows the dialogic nature of a particular sample of graffiti in a women’s university restroom which was characterized by a rapid response rate. Secondly, the space of the women’s lavatory allowed contributors to discuss their concerns relatively free of male interlocutors. In this space, the women were assured a particular audience in a room associated with private functional activities embedded in an institution also with particular functional activities. Thirdly, the graffiti discourse in this study appropriates and is made possible by the educational/disciplinary apparatus of the University. Given this space, women employed a mix of dominant popular and academic discourses, whereas others were dismissive of these discourses.","Exploring Multiple Modalities in Language and Social Interaction Research: Writing, 'Arabizi', Graffiti, and Sign Language",Language & Social Interaction

Overlapping speech communities is one area of the discussion that remains largely untheorized. In this paper, I explore how we might study overlapping speech communities by considering characteristics of a particular case with complex patterns of membership: Signers in Panama. I offer a new approach, Holographic Methodology, drawn from recent technological advances allowing firefighters to visualize target objects behind flames. By picturing target social systems as emitting cultural hotspots through social drama on different stages, ethnographic tools gather information that is decoded through juxtaposing the stages to offer a holographic image depicting potential speech communities. At this time, Holographic Methodology applied to Signing Communities of Panama displays two overlapping speech communities and language groups: Chiriquí and Panamanian Signing Communities.","Exploring Multiple Modalities in Language and Social Interaction Research: Writing, 'Arabizi', Graffiti, and Sign Language",Language & Social Interaction

The massacres went unreported in the press and received minimal attention in civil war histories. The people of Asaba now wish to re-inscribe their story into the collective memory of Nigeria. We have been working in partnership with Asaba leaders, interviewing survivors and presenting their story in various forums. Such public “memory work” is inevitably contested; especially a country still embroiled in ethnic conflict. We explore challenges inherent in contesting a story that was contained in “old media” age, while examining the potential of new media to open new narratives. We conclude with a discussion of the role of “memory work,” as a form of justice that grapples to exhume the experience of shameful moments, in hopes of using that memory to transition into a more just future.",New Perspectives in Global Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change

This paper examines the dialectic between the forces of hegemonic globalization and resistance by critically analyzing the content of the television series, the ensuing discourse, and policy actions in Ghana. Borrowing the concept of interlocalization, we argue that Jungle Gold, though a hegemonic global form, amplifies a serious development challenge, sparking a debate, leading to mobilization, policy actions, and real potential for social change and development. We also examine the role of local television co-producers, social media, and activists in the interlocalization process.",New Perspectives in Global Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change
2014-0849,2014,Paper Session,Twitter Diplomacy: A Content Analysis of Eight U.S. Embassies’ Twitter Feeds,3,"In recent years, the Twitter feeds of U.S. Embassies have sparked controversies, angering both American political leaders as well as politicians in the local countries. This study examines how U.S. Embassies use Twitter, specifically analyzing whether embassy Twitter use furthers the mission of the U.S. Department of State as well as whether these Twitter feeds can be viewed as a barometer of tensions in varying regions. By examining the tweet output from eight embassies (four on the State Department official “watch list” and four not on the list), this study demonstrates a lack of consistency among Twitter use by embassies and irregularity with regards to furthering the State Department mission. These irregularities pose a threat to U.S. diplomatic efforts, suggesting that there is a strong need for the State Department to implement procedures to ensure use across all embassies is consistent with U.S. diplomatic goals.",New Perspectives in Global Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change

In searching for a media culture that fosters cosmopolitan sensibilities among citizens - the “mediapolis” (Silverstone, 2007) - this study used ESS-data covering fourteen European countries and over 70,000 respondents. Findings make important contributions to contemporary theoretical debates on the conditions under which cosmopolitan outlooks are cultivated as results showed that no “mediated cosmopolitanism” (Rantanen, 2005; Robertson, 2010) existed on the level of mass mediation across various media systems. This suggests that the “mediapolis” is more a normative category than an empirical one, and that theorizing around the relationship between media and cosmopolitanism is in need of recalibration.",New Perspectives in Global Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change

Amid this challenge, the Internet continues to evolve as a major medium of information and communication with potential externalities to confront the experiences of marginalization. The problem is there is a limited and skewed access to household Internet in South Africa. But what does this reveal about the nature of social inequalities and marginalization among South Africa’s youths? Based on a study conducted with 1,044 students from 10 South African universities, it is revealed that pattern of Internet access replicates existing pattern of marginalization in this country. Students that bear the brunt of inequalities are further marginalized by lack of access to the Internet. Their experience of marginalization is further exacerbated by digital inequalities, with a resultant effect on their ability to participate in society through digital means.",New Perspectives in Global Communication Research,Global Communication and Social Change

A sample of 140 respondents was recruited in a street-survey, including Indians, Pakistanis, Indonesians, Whites and some other ethnic group members. Perceived host environmental factors, along with host communication factors, are confirmed in CFA. Hierarchy regression with host acceptance and host conformity pressure replicated the earlier findings that the two factors predicted satisfaction with life in the same direction.

Participants provided self-reports of liking of the violent characters, liking of the violent show, perceptions of others’ liking of the violent characters, and exposure to violent TV programming. A parent of each child reported on active mediation efforts. Results showed that active mediation of violent TV was associated with the accessibility of children’s negative attitudes about TV violence and that the accessibility of these attitudes was related to the types of programming children watch and to children’s reactions to watching violent TV. Importantly, results also showed that children with low to moderately accessible negative attitudes about violent TV tended to benefit most from active mediation.

Structural equation modeling using data from a two-wave panel survey of mothers of one- to four-year-olds (N = 404) demonstrated that mothers’ working hours affect children’s television time. Unexpectedly, this association arises from two different underlying processes. When mothers work longer, their well-being improves and their children consequently watch less television. Conversely, when mothers work longer hours, they experience more parenting time pressure, which undermines their well-being, which, in turn, leads to children watching more television. The findings emphasize the importance of mothers’ life circumstances as contributors to children’s television time.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media

In particular, the paper focuses on children’s media socialization through everyday talk and the role of parents’ stance-taking in the making of children’s media culture. Two examples of parent-children interactions collected during extended fieldwork in a family are discussed adopting a culturally contextualized conversation-analytic approach. The case study is intended to illustrate a) how family’s media ideologies are reified and maintained on the micro order of everyday life and b) how children are socialized into these ideologies in and through their participation in naturally occurring, unplanned talking activities. In the discussion we contend that talk occasioned by media use is organized by the worldviews of a given community. Yet, at one and the same time, it (re)produces the value system, moral order and the canonical versions of the world for those who engage in these talking activities.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media

Building on the theory of planned behavior, the present study investigates whether parents’ cognitions predict children’s television viewing through parents’ intentions to allow or not allow their children to watch television. The most important parental cognition to target in interventions is parents’ perceived behavioral control, because children watch more television when parents have limited control over children’s television exposure. The findings also point to a strong need for strategies for dealing with social pressure, because parents’ intentions to allow or not allow children to watch television primarily depend on perceived social norms.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media

From new communities forged as a result of technologies that allowed association between individuals with shared interests, to the leveling of previously calcified hierarchies, ICTs are portrayed as representing a definitive break from our previous (material) existences. It is this paper's contention that this view is wrong, and will show that the goals of post-war urban planners, influential intellectuals, and architects were meant to create a type of American who would think and act like what we would now call networked individuals inhabiting the network society. By striving to produce flexible, mobile, well-adjusted American citizens, these individuals were creating procedural communities: process based groupings of individuals who were connected both through a material recreation infrastructure that helped inculcate shared modes of embodied interaction in the world.","Technologies, Social Media, and New Histories",Communication History

Online social media is amplifying the sheer amount of information communicated, the diversity of information sources, the interactivity between content and end users, and the narrowcast communication within a niche audience. All these characteristics have generated new effects on the diffusion process that have not been systematically incorporated into existing diffusion theories. Based on data collected from social media platforms, new research findings have questioned some assumptions and hypotheses in the early diffusion research and pointed out potential directions for developing a more appropriate diffusion mechanism. In this paper, I summarize the traditional diffusion research as the Mechanism of Diffusion as Adoption and propose an expanded diffusion model, Mechanism of Diffusion as both Adoption and Retransmission, and discuss future research directions.","Technologies, Social Media, and New Histories",Communication History

Reader comments (N=1,079) from two online news stories were coded for health literacy themes that might be overlooked by current measures of health literacy, yet play a role in its development. A number of themes emerged from the data including understanding the difference between private and public health, referencing outside information, and differences across gender recommendations. Extracting themes from these conversations could shed light on how individuals demonstrate health literacy in everyday discussions about health and areas in which health literacy can be improved through intervention.",Health Literacy and Message Design,Health Communication
2014-0868,2014,Paper Session,Adapting Health Messages to Health Literacy Level: The Role of Text Difficulty and Added Illustrations,4,"Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality in western societies, which can often be prevented by early cancer screening. To encourage screening participation, people need to be properly informed about the benefits. However, people’s health literacy influences someone’s ability to process this information. The aim of our study is to investigate how information about cancer screening can be optimally designed, and whether people with different health literacy levels need different messages. Using a two (illustrated vs. text-only) by two (non-difficult vs. difficult text) between subjects design we studied the effects of message design on perceived message complexity, recall, attitudes, and intention. Results showed that illustrations improve recall of difficult texts, especially among people with low health literacy. Illustrated difficult texts were also perceived as less complex than their text-only counterparts. Both recall and attitudes mediated the relationship between message complexity and people’s intention to participate in cancer screening.",Health Literacy and Message Design,Health Communication
2014-0869,2014,Paper Session,Examining the Impact of Gaming-Related Friendships on Social Capital Among Social Online Game Players,2,"Concern about the social impact of games is on the rise, as online players are feared to be exchanging their offline social contacts for online ones. While this process has been documented in previous research, scholars have failed to account for the impact of the social context of the play on these relationships. We aim to fill this academic void by examining the impact of different game-related friendships on players’ perceived social capital among a representative sample of social, online players (n = 395). The results indicate that gaming-related social contacts have a significant impact on social capital outcomes. Engaging in online game play with pre-existing offline contacts was found to strengthen friendships, particularly in terms of instrumental support. Conversely, playing with online contacts was found to negatively impact instrumental support. Online gaming frequency was not found to significantly impact a player’s perceived social capital, indicating an absence of direct media effects.",Video Games and Social Dynamics: A Good and Connected Life,Game Studies
2014-0870,2014,Paper Session,Examining the Relationship Between Online Video Game Involvement and Gaming-Related Friendships Among Emotionally Sensitive Individuals,2,"Some researchers believe that online gaming spaces can be socially accommodating environments for socially inhibited individuals, such as the socially inept, socially anxious, or shy. Whilst previous research has examined, and found, significant links between these populations and online video game play, it remains unknown to what extent these spaces are contributing to tangible social benefits for the socially inhibited. The current study addresses this question by evaluating the link between gaming-related friendships and shyness, as quantified by emotional sensitivity. Drawing from a representative sample of German game players, the results indicate that emotionally sensitive (shy) players are using online gaming spaces differently than their less-shy counterparts and reporting tangible differences in their in-game friendship networks. This suggests that online games hold the potential to be socially advantageous for shy individuals by allowing them to overcome their traditional social difficulties and generate new friendships as well as strengthen old ones.",Video Games and Social Dynamics: A Good and Connected Life,Game Studies

Addressing this issue, the present research examines the female player experience in one of the world’s most popular games, League of Legends. Two studies—one qualitative, the other quantitative—confirm that there is a dearth of female players and finds that those who do play are less confident in their skills and often focus on supporting a romantic partner’s advancement, not their own. This work suggests that one way to address the gender gap in gaming is to better understand and improve the social dynamics within popular games.",Video Games and Social Dynamics: A Good and Connected Life,Game Studies

Motivation focused studies are powerful in explaining users' experiences for many different types of media. However, they are limited in providing insights about the influence of structures of a particular medium on media use. Game scholars have started to note the importance to look at unique characteristics of video games to understand players' experiences. Hence, this paper places emphasis on understanding how social structure of video games influence players' in-game experiences. Flow framework is integrated with the concept of affordance to explore players' engagement in social features of a popular online game, World of Warcraft. Twenty-five players of World of Warcraft were recruited for think-aloud protocol and semi-structured in-depth interview. Three affordances are influential in players' social experiences: bonding social ties, detaching social ties, and achievement. Two themes are developed to explain how choices to engage in social features, players' affective states, and in-game group experiences are intertwined: social connectedness and attractiveness. Theoretical contributions and study limitations are discussed at the end.",Video Games and Social Dynamics: A Good and Connected Life,Game Studies
2014-0873,2014,Paper Session,This Guild Isn’t Big Enough for the Two of Us,1,"This research investigates how underlying code affects roles within an online community, perhaps limiting those roles and in turn limiting community membership. To do so, the number of top-ability characters per guild was measured in an MMO. Characters, with the skills from their class, are filling a role within their community, and only so many of any one type are needed. This has wider applicability to online communities that have explicit or implicit roles, via norms or code, as once those roles are filled other community members may have to fit different roles or seek other communities. The MMO EverQuest 2 was used, with data from over 27,000 characters from 2,879 guilds. Generally, the data supported the hypothesis that there is a limit to the number of top ability characters for each class for every guild, mostly regardless of guild size.",Video Games and Social Dynamics: A Good and Connected Life,Game Studies

Our survey sample consists of 405 adults that are randomly selected to elicit information on their perceptions of pressing community issues and issues that provoke neighborhood discussion. A total of 279 news stories are coded from 10 media outlets that address local issues. We find a significant relationship between media agenda and neighborhood discussion agenda, but neither of the two agenda are correlated with the pressing community issue agenda. The results suggest a shortage of local news that may undermine the social roles of journalism and jeopardize the process of civic engagement. This study provides evidence that highlights the urgent need for solutions to the dramatically decline of local news. We discuss the implications of participatory online journalism as a possible venue to increase local storytelling.",Journalism and its Communities,Journalism Studies

2014-0876,2014,Paper Session,Reporting Resilience: Narratives of Preparedness and Recovery in the Joplin Globe,1,"The American city of Joplin, Missouri, was devastated when an EF5 tornado touched down in the city on the afternoon of May 22, 2011. The community newspaper, The Joplin Globe, resumed publishing the following day, and documented how the community adapted to the post-hazard environment. Resilience theory, a product of social cognition theory and behavioral psychology, was used to identify pre-existing relational trends in the news coverage and evaluate traces of both individual and community capacities. This study identified those processes in individuals and groups in the Joplin community in the year before and after the May 22, 2011 tornado by looking for narratives and themes represented in articles over a two year time period. A narrative textual analysis found post-disaster stories focused on affirming and rebuilding.

2014-0878,2014,Paper Session,The Influence of Editorial Lines on Human Rights Reporting at Mexican Newspapers,1,"This paper, based on a media ethnography of Mexican newspapers, examines how these newspapers view human rights reporting in light of the journalistic norms and economic goals of their editorial lines. At newspapers that meet economic goals through traditional cash-for-coverage relationships with state actors, human rights coverage detrimental to their benefactors is suppressed. At newspapers that look to the market for their economic goals, human rights coverage is pursued, in part because it signals that these newspapers are independent of the state, a desirable feature for audiences and advertisers. Human rights reporting is also emblematic of these newspapers’ democratic journalistic norms. This paper concludes by examining the implications of these dynamics for the explanatory potential of particular theories of the liberal and critical approaches to media and power.",Journalism and its Communities,Journalism Studies
2014-0879,2014,Paper Session,The Interplay of Intrinsic Need Satisfaction and Facebook Specific Motives in Explaining Facebook Addiction,1,"With the recent popularity of social network sites (SNSs), it has been questioned whether SNS usage can become compulsive. Focusing on Facebook in particular, we developed a scale measuring addictive behavior on SNSs. Further, we investigated how intrinsic need satisfaction in the offline context, and SNS specific motives influence SNS addiction. We hypothesized that 1) a lack of autonomy generates higher motivation to use SNSs for self-presentation and escapism, 2) a lack of competence predicts the motives information seeking and self-presentation, and 3) a lack of relatedness fosters the motive to use SNS for self-presentation and meeting new people. We assumed further that these motives, in turn, positively influence SNS addiction. All proposed mediation models were supported by the data. The results emphasize the importance of incorporating both offline need satisfaction and gratifications sought through the use of SNS to provide a comprehensive perspective on addictive behavior on SNSs.",Addiction to Communication Technologies,Communication and Technology

The hypothesized path model was based on the cognitive-behavioral model of pathological Internet use and we tested if the same proposition can be verified in mobile phone addiction. Findings suggest that those with a higher depression score are more likely to fall into the trap of mobile phone addiction through alleviation motivation and pass-time motivation. Among these two motivations, people who use mobile phone to relieve or alleviate their negative feelings are more prone to mobile phone addiction than those who use mobile phone habitually or ritualistically to pass time.",Addiction to Communication Technologies,Communication and Technology
2014-0881,2014,Paper Session,Predictors of the Initiation and Persistence of Internet Addiction Among Adolescents,5,"Purpose: The present study examined the psychosocial factors associated with the initiation and persistence of Internet addiction among adolescents in Taiwan.
Methods: A total of 2,315 students from 26 high schools were assessed in the 10th grade, with follow-up performed in the 11th grade, in Taipei, Taiwan. Self-administered questionnaires were collected in each year to assess the pattern of changes in Internet addiction and psychosocial factors.
Results: Of the 1,602 students without an Internet addiction in the 10th grade, 253 (15.8%) had initiated Internet addiction by grade 11. Multivariate analysis results indicated that greater engagement in online activities (i.e., social network website use, online gaming), depression, and lower school bonding in grade 10 coupled with an increase in online activities, depression, and smoking from grades 10 to 11 predicted the initiation of Internet addiction. Of the 605 students with Internet addiction in the 10th grade, the addiction had persisted for 383 students (63.3%) in grade 11. An increase in the existence of depression and alcohol use from grades 10 to 11 predicted the persistence of Internet addiction.
Conclusions: Online activities, depression, and substance use were important predictors of youth initiation and of the persistence of Internet addiction.",Addiction to Communication Technologies,Communication and Technology
2014-0882,2014,Paper Session,Technology Addiction’s Contribution to Mental Wellbeing: A Mediation Model,2,"This research examines the mediating effect of online social capital and the Internet upon the normally negative effects of technology addiction, particularly regarding individuals who are predisposed to concealing their personal and/or private information. We investigate the hypothesis that communication technology addiction may not negatively affect wellbeing for those prone to self-concealment provided the content of the online communication is positive, develops social relationships, or fosters a sense of community. The proposed model hypothesized that self-concealment directly positively predicts communication technology addiction and negatively predicts wellbeing. However, those associations are mediated by online social capital. Results were consistent with all of the hypotheses regarding associations between communication technology addiction, online social capital, self-concealment, and mental wellbeing. Overall, the proposed model offers qualified support for the continued analysis of communication technology addiction as a potential source for the increase of mental wellbeing for psychologically vulnerable users.",Addiction to Communication Technologies,Communication and Technology
2014-0883,2014,Paper Session,Connective-Collective Action on Social Media: Moderated Mediation Path of Cognitive Elaboration and Perceived Source Credibility on Personalness of Source,4,"Research has provided concrete evidence on the strong influence of personal networks in motivating collective action via social media, but seemed to have neglected the underlying processes from the information-processing viewpoint of the uninitiated individual. This study fills this gap by examining whether cognitive elaboration on invitational messages received from different sources (personal: friends, family v. impersonal: organizations) mediates willingness to participate between different types of connective-collective activities on social media (e.g., commenting, “Liking,” uploading/sharing materials); and whether this conditional effect is biased by the perceived credibility of the different sources. Results from an online-based experiment (N = 208) indicated the significant influence from personal sources mediated by cognitive elaboration (positive mediation), that is conditionally affected by high source credibility instead of low (positive moderation). Theoretical contributions (i.e., cognitive demands at individual level) and practical implications (i.e., enhancing organizational credibility, popularity of easy-to-do acts such as “Liking,” “Following”) of findings are discussed.",Collective Action Predictors in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology

Drawing on conformity theories, we investigated how opinions and behaviors of online peers affect the individual’s responses to an ethically questionable initiative. In a 2x2 between-subjects experiment (N = 127), others’ responses to a call to vigilantism on Facebook were shown in form of textual comments and numeric displays (e.g., the number of people who “liked” a message before). Results showed that the interplay of comments and numeric displays exerted impact on the individual’s intention to support this call online. Offline support intentions and attitudes toward the call were only affected under conditions of high identification with commenters. Personality factors such as altruism and empathy directly influenced individuals’ willingness to participate in this initiative of vigilantism – independently from other users’ reactions.",Collective Action Predictors in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology

In a period of two weeks a harmless party invitation developed into a cross media event and eventually into an evening full of riots, looting and damage. Although mobilizations of small and large crowds are of all times, new communication channels such as Facebook and Twitter, besides (mass media) traditional channels, have changed the way in which such event mobilizations come about.

We situate We the People within the context of the Obama Administration's articulated commitment to “open government.” We consider research that has examined similar e-petitioning enterprises in Great Britain and Germany, and on this basis, present a set of data analyses that enable us to compare the US experience with prior research. We find that petitioning behavior in WtP is similar in that relatively few petitions attract the majority of signatures and that the majority of petition signing happens early in the life of a petition.

Group membership and ingroup identification are both thought to set off and increase the HME. Consonance is introduced as a new possible moderator of the effect. The concept was described by Noelle-Neumann 40 years ago and has since been associated with powerful media effects. As Peter (2004) pointed out this notion has so far barely been assessed. An experiment set within the context of a conflict held between practitioners of complementary and academic medicine, revealed group membership to qualify the HME. Yet high ingroup identification and the perception of consonant news reporting led to even stronger effects.","News, Politics, and Stereotyped Portrayals",Mass Communication
2014-0888,2014,Paper Session,Effects of Right-Wing Populist Political Advertising on Implicit and Explicit Stereotypes,3,"This study investigates the consequences of exposure to anti-foreigner political advertisements from right-wing populist parties on implicit and explicit stereotypes. While stereotypical associations (e.g. “criminal” when thinking about “foreigners”) may become automatically activated regardless of whether a person considers them as accurate or not (implicit stereotypes), individuals can decide not to use them for an overtly expressed judgment (explicit stereotypes). We hypothesize that even if citizens are aware of stereotypical content and negate it, advertisements may still have an impact on implicit stereotypes. This assumption was tested using an experiment (N = 186) where participants were exposed to zero, two, four, or six advertisements with media stereotypes. Results showed no effect on explicit stereotypes. However, stereotypical right-wing populist posters influenced implicit stereotypes, even in critical recipients who negated the stereotypical content. We discuss the implications for political communication research and argue that the complementary use of implicit measures is indispensable.","News, Politics, and Stereotyped Portrayals",Mass Communication
2014-0889,2014,Paper Session,Reconsidering Ethnic Media Research: An Argument for a Diasporic Identity Framework,1,"Since Robert Park’s (1922) foundational work on the ethnic press, the assimilation-pluralism paradigm has dominated research on ethnic media. Ninety years later, with changes in the audiences and environment of ethnic media, it is appropriate to consider new theoretical directions. This article proposes that dialogue happen between ethnic media and diasporic media research to advance future scholarship. Ethnic media research would provide direction in better conceptualizing media of ethnic groups/diasporas, and diasporic media research would address the limitations of the assimilation-pluralism framework and its inability to incorporate globalization, transnationalism, and hybridity. Diasporic media research can address these weaknesses by re-imagining assimilation and pluralism as not two ends of a pole but unified aspects of diasporic identity. This essay proposes that ethnic media be conceptualized as specific to media produced by a diasporic or indigenous ethnic population within the host society and that future research engage a diasporic identity framework. By reconsidering ethnic media research, future scholarship will advance in productive directions.","News, Politics, and Stereotyped Portrayals",Mass Communication

Drawing from findings in social psychology, we argue that media coverage on outgroups should also lead to effects on ingroup evaluation. In an experiment we, therefore, investigate the impact of positive and negative news portrayals of Russians in Switzerland as an outgroup on attitudes toward that group and attitudes toward the ingroup (i.e., the Swiss). The results indicate that negative outgroup depictions in the news increase outgroup devaluation while positive portrayals of the outgroup improve the image of the social group. Additionally, negative and positive portrayals of Russians boost ingroup attitudes as compared to a control group. The findings are discussed against the background of intergroup relations theories.","News, Politics, and Stereotyped Portrayals",Mass Communication

The goal of this paper is to extend this view through an examination of conversations with pro-ana bloggers, an online community for people with eating disorders. This analysis takes on the challenge of fusing Goffman’s ideas about identity performance and stigma with more recent theories about boundary maintenance, in finding out how the pro-ana community uses an online environment that is both anonymous and public.

In order to address this gap, we conducted an explorative study based on four-week media diaries of 59 students. These were used to identify four different types of multi-media theme repertoires and the ways in which they are employed for practices of identity as performance and categorization by the participants. While drama-lovers and sports-fans differ strongly in their thematic interests, they share a similar identity style, relying mostly on practices of identification and of expressing their affiliation to certain in-groups via media content.

Studies exploring picture selection on SNS suggest that beauty standards portrayed in popular media serve as role-models in the choice of profile pictures. However, there is a lack of empirical research on this topic. The present study explores the relationship between the internalization of beauty standards portrayed in the media and profile pictures on Facebook. The study combines two analyses: first, a survey among 288 undergraduate students, and second a content analysis of their profile pictures on Facebook to assess the relationship between media internalization and the types of profile pictures selected. Results show internalization to be a strong predictor of body-ism, revealing clothing and the display of seductive behavior in the profile pictures of both female and male students.

2014-0896,2014,Paper Session,Media Diversity Policies for the Public: Empirical Evidence Examining Exposure Diversity and Democratic Citizenship,2,"It is the right of the public to receive “information from diverse and antagonistic sources” via media for a healthy democracy (AP vs. US, 1945). To promote this diversity, policymakers have regulated broadcast ownership, and scholars have acknowledged that focus have been heavily on ownership diversity rather than exposure diversity of audiences. Thus, using the 2010 Pew Media Consumption Survey and the 2006 midterm Congressional elections survey, this paper operationalizes audiences’ exposure to information from diverse and antagonistic sources (i.e., respectively “politically diverse viewing” and “liberal/conservative content viewing”), and examines their relations with political knowledge and participation. Exposure to information from diverse sources may be positively related to political participation, and may especially be beneficial for light users of news media in gaining political knowledge. The role of news media use in democratic citizenship might depend not only on how much it is but also on how diverse it is.",Rethinking Public Service and Support in Today's Media,Communication Law & Policy

As a result, the larger epistemological question remains under-theorized and under-considered: how can we think through these issues in a productive fashion, rather than reducing them to an artificial dichotomy of “spatial” versus “social?” Based on a critical discourse analysis of localism policies in Canada, the US and the UK, I argue that the theory of critical regionalism (Frampton, 1983) is a useful lens from which to approach this question.

On the other hand, the legitimacy of the license fee on the ownership of a TV or radio set to fund public service media is waning. Yet large-scale comparative research looking into the public funding of news organizations is rare. In the present paper, we thus ask the questions of which models exist for supporting news organizations with public money and whether implemented models keep up with media change.

The purpose of this paper was to understand the public opinion about this controversial renewable energy. Using an experiment embedded within a representative survey, this study examined the interactive effect of party identification and risk/benefit perception on public opinion about biofuels. The findings suggest that the effect of party identification on opinion about biofuels varied when individuals consider risk/benefit of biofuels in different domains. More self-identified Democrats tend to support funding biofuels research when primed with economic risks or social/ethical risks of biofuels. For those who thought of social/ethical benefits of biofuels, more self-identified Democrats are likely to support biofuels production and use. However, more self-identified Democrats are less supportive of biofuels production and use when they considered the political risks of biofuels.

Although studies indicate the contribution of media to learning, limited understanding exists on how this can influence attitudes and behaviors toward an issue. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine a model that integrates media exposure and resulting knowledge about an environmental issue into the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework. This model was developed in the context of hydraulic fracturing (HF). We found that media exposure is associated with better knowledge of consequences and procedures of HF, but not its regulation. Also, knowledge of consequences and procedures were associated with positive attitudes towards HF, while more knowledge of regulation led to negative attitudes on the subject. Positive attitudes towards HF predicted subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitude toward behavior.

However, few experimental designs have examined both in tandem, and few have demonstrated behavior change. Immersive virtual environment technology can create vivid and personal interventions that place the user directly into environmental scenarios. This study investigates the impact of vivid and/or personal messages on energy savings related to hot water use. Participants were placed in a virtual shower and received feedback (based on vividness and/or personalization) on the amount of energy used during their virtual shower. Participants’ hot water use during hand washing was tracked. Participants exposed to vivid messages used cooler water compared to non-vivid messages. There were no significant effects for personal messages nor was there an interaction effect. This research suggests that although there has been a trend towards customization, media technology that leverages vividness may be more effective in promoting pro-environmental behaviors.","Energy Issues: Public Opinion, Attitudes, and Behavior",Environmental Communication
2014-0903,2014,Paper Session,"National Support, Local Opposition? Effects of Communication on Opinion About Local and National Energy Issues",1,"When renewable energy projects are concerned differences between national and local political level often become apparent. Although the overall public support for renewable energies and the nuclear phase-out in Germany is high, local projects such as wind farms often face local resistance. If local opposition arises while there is a nation-wide support of renewable energies the opinion formation at local and national level seems to differ. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effects of communication on the acceptance of energy policy measures at local and national level comparatively. In the context of the “Energiewende” in Germany, surveys about the opinion formation about the local construction of a wind farm and the national issue of the nuclear phase-out were conducted. Results show that newspaper use increases the acceptance of the wind farm at local level and political self-efficacy leads to support of the nuclear phase-out. Opposition to local energy projects cannot be solely attributed to feelings of affectedness due to the proximity of the projects.","Energy Issues: Public Opinion, Attitudes, and Behavior",Environmental Communication
2014-0904,2014,Paper Session,The Use of Message Framing in the Promotion of Eco-Driving,1,"The study explored how message framing can influence drivers' intention for eco-driving, their eco-driving behavior, and their experienced or perceived control belief. Participants heard persuasive messages to promote eco-driving while they were navigating in a simulator. A half of participants were exposed to gain-framed messages that highlighted the anticipated benefits of eco-driving. The other half of participants heard loss-framed messages that focused on anticipated losses from driving in a non-ecofreindly way. Results showed that the gain framed messages were more effective to increase future intention for eco-driving, eco-driving behavior, and control belief of eco-driving.","Energy Issues: Public Opinion, Attitudes, and Behavior",Environmental Communication
2014-0905,2014,Paper Session,From Visibility to Presence: Theorising Aesthetic-Affective Communication in Digital Space,1,"The notion of presence conceptualises the aesthetic and affective dimensions of the experience of being-there and being-with in digital cultures. It problematises and complements visibility as a dominant, rational-technical mode in which we theorise questions of digital sociability, publicity and political participation. Presence is an effort to organise our knowledge of different lived experiences of online connections under a coherent conceptual umbrella, and to connect the affective-aesthetic dimensions with ongoing critiques of algorithmic power.

The paper articulates this perspective through three short cases to demonstrate its usefulness: (1) our speculative, felt senses of sufficient and probable visibility on Twitter; (2) distant and digital communication of embodied political presence, exemplified by self-immolation; (3) data mining and the emergence of ‘trace-bodies’ composed of data, where the key paradox is that I knows my data is being exploited, but I often do not feel the presence of my own trace-body or its exploitation.","Now You See It, Now You Don't: On Codes, Screens, Visibility, and Erasure","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

On Erasure and the Queer in the I Am Bradley Manning Campaign,1,"This article works with pertinent theories and concepts to critique and investigate frameworks and philosophical underpinnings of erasures, instability, and queerness in the I am Bradley Manning Tumblr campaign. As social media increasingly provides digital places for people to create, convene, and participate in social movements and protest, there is a corresponding need to understand how these movements work, what they mean for individuals as an exercise of citizenship, and what they mean as movements in communities, cultures, and states. Many of these movements are not disruptive in the same sense of traditional forms of protest as we have understood them: protests in physical spaces and places that disrupt everyday life and living. Instead, these are protests that take place in virtual digital places, which at times provide little physical or material disruption of the everyday.","Now You See It, Now You Don't: On Codes, Screens, Visibility, and Erasure","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2014-0907,2014,Paper Session,Beyond Interactivity: The Interpassive Hypothesis on Good Life and Communication,1,"The paper discusses the theory of interpassivity and aims at relating it to the current discourse of interactivity in communication science. The theory of interpassivity has been developed in art philosophy and in cultural philosophy, especially by Austrian philosopher Robert Pfaller and by Dutch philosopher Gijs van Oenen. The debate refers metaphorically to interactivity but is not yet received by communication science. In order to take first steps towards an ap-proach of interpassivity in communication science, the article treats the question how the theory of interpassivity challenges the discourse on interactivity by positioning its subjects ‘beyond’ a supposed interactive feed-back loop of information flow, and how this irritation contributes to changing the understanding of interactive communication itself. The article also refers to cybernetics as a meta-theoretical reference to interactivity.","Now You See It, Now You Don't: On Codes, Screens, Visibility, and Erasure","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

It also elicited their suggestions for ways in which public relations practitioners could interact with whistleblowers for the betterment of the organization and the whistleblower. This study explored the implications of four theories on whistleblowing: organizational justice theory, normalization of corruption theory, resource dependence theory, and relationship management theory. It found that whistleblowing has a negative impact on relationships; government whistleblowers feel corrupt practices were institutionalized in their organizations; their organizations relied on wrongdoing; and their treatment by their employers was unjust. The study also pointed out the negligible role those public relations practitioners have played with whistleblowers within government organizations.",Public Voices in Crisis Management,Public Relations

The Crisis Communication of Metaorganizations,2,"The overall goal of this paper is to make communication scholars aware of an important dimension of organizational crises, crisis management and crisis communication, which have remained under-researched for too long, that is, the inter-organizational dimension. It is defined as the relations between one or more companies in crisis, the competitors, one or more trade associations, and the industry in question. Using the product recall crisis of the Bestseller clothing company, in 2011, as case study, the following research questions are addressed:
(1) What mutual expectations do the trade associations and their members have to each other concerning the handling of organizational crises?
(2) Do the trade associations apply the same crisis response strategies as Bestseller? And how do they handle the built-in conflict between the following three different types of reputation: the reputation of the industry, the reputation of the trade associations, and the reputation of the member in crisis.",Public Voices in Crisis Management,Public Relations

To explore the complex interrelations and communications between domains, this study builds on a more advanced understanding of communication and framing processes by adopting a semantic-network approach. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the crisis frames of the domains align over time. To empirically analyze frame alignment, an automated semantic-network analysis is introduced to compare implicit framing among the domains. By examining press releases, news articles, and social-media manifestations of four Dutch crisis cases, the dynamic character of crisis framing became apparent. The study documents the rise of crisis-frame alignment among PR, news media, and the public over time. After frame alignment the domains’ discourses move away from one another resulting in more variation between frames.",Public Voices in Crisis Management,Public Relations

Latent growth curve modeling was applied to assess the shape of the developmental curve and investigate the predictors of the curve. It found that people are more depressed in adolescence than in adulthood. The depression trajectories show a decreasing pattern over time. Significant difference was observed across gender. And depression scores of heavy television viewers in early adolescence decrease more slowly than light television viewers. Regarding the influence of parents on adolescents' depression development, relationship with father is relatively more important than relationship with mother for male. In contrast, father and mother are almost equally important for female with regard to their influence on adolescent depression both concurrently and in later stage.",Measuring Key Concepts and Considering Emotional Well Being in CAM,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0915,2014,Paper Session,Development and Validation of a Survey Instrument to Measure Children’s Advertising Literacy,3,"The aim of this study was to develop and validate a survey measurement instrument for children’s advertising literacy. Based on the multi-dimensional conceptualization of advertising literacy by Rozendaal, Lapierre, Van Reijmersdal, and Buijzen (2011), 39 items were created to measure two dimensions of advertising literacy (i.e., conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy) and their underlying components. The survey was administered to 1026 8- to 12-year-olds in the first wave, and 519 in the second wave. Structural equation modeling revealed that the Advertising Literacy Scale for children consists of two separate and unrelated subscales: the Conceptual Advertising Literacy Scale (CALS-c) and the Attitudinal Advertising Literacy Scale for children (AALS-c). Both scales performed well in terms of test–retest reliability and construct validity. In addition to the full-length scale, shortened versions were created.",Measuring Key Concepts and Considering Emotional Well Being in CAM,Children Adolescents and Media

Two scales were developed, one to measure a child’s one-sided perceived friendship with a media character (parasocial interaction), and one to measure a child’s desire to become or behave like a media character (wishful identification). Original scales of Hoffner (1996) were modified to suit the cognitive skills of very young children. The questionnaire was administrated to 104 4- to 6-year-olds, after one and five exposures to a picture book character. A two-factor model described our data best, with the 8 character involvement items clustering into the anticipated parasocial interaction and wishful identification subscales. Shorter versions of each subscale were also created. The full-length and shortened scales met the standards of reliability and validity. As anticipated, parasocial interaction and wishful identification correlated positively with character similarity and character liking.",Measuring Key Concepts and Considering Emotional Well Being in CAM,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0917,2014,Paper Session,Validating the Narrative Transportability Scale With Children 9 - 13,4,"Narrative transportability determines how likely an individual is to become involved in a story. Past research has suggested that involvement may be central to understanding narratives and to motivating reading behaviors in children. Unfortunately, measures of transportability have not been validated with children, and transportability’s relationship to theoretically-derived outcomes (e.g., leisure reading) is not known. To address this gap, children 9 -13 years of age (N = 136) completed a revised version of Dal Cin and colleagues (2004) transportability scale. A 13-item version of the scale was found to be unidimensional, reliable, and predictive of 6% of the variance in leisure reading (when controlling for gender, age, reading ability, and student performance). Transportability was also related to genre preferences and some gender effects. The transportability scale provides researchers with a psychometrically sound measure of narrative involvement to advance research in several fields, including mass communication, narrative research, and reading studies.",Measuring Key Concepts and Considering Emotional Well Being in CAM,Children Adolescents and Media

Although communicating one’s displeasure with a partner’s behavior would seem to be an effective tool for controlling negative behavior, intimates often withhold their complaints. This online study examines reasons for withholding complaints in relationships and the negative emotional and relational byproducts associated with withholding. We hypothesized that the length of withholding relates positively to experiencing regret as the irritating behavior increases in frequency, importance, and emotional resources. We hypothesized that this positive relationship would be mediated by two separate sequences involving reduced intimacy and helplessness. A mediation analysis of friendships, romantic relationships, family relationships, and roommate relationships supported all three hypotheses.

It was hypothesized that when communicating a positive FTAs Ps’ concern for providing social cues would increase and therefore Ps would select a channel that would allow them to do just that. It was hypothesized that when communicating a negative FTAs Ps’ concern for offering receiver control would increase and therefore Ps would select a channel that would allow them to do just that. Results indicated that the presence of social cues was an important factor when deciding upon a channel to select for both positive and negative FTAs.

How to give constructive criticism has always been an intriguing topic for interpersonal communication researchers. The current scenario study examined two factors (order and enhancement specificity) that might affect people’s perceptions of negative evaluations from their partners. Findings showed strong support of an order effect in that positive-first messages (enhancement before negative evaluations) were perceived more positively than positive-after messages (enhancement after negative evaluations) and bald-on-record negative evaluations. No significant enhancement specificity (issue-specific enhancement or general enhancement) effect was detected except that general enhancement messages were perceived as more polite when they were said before rather than after negative evaluations.,The Darker Side of Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

The current study employed a profanity) by credibility by sex pre-post experimental design to investigate the intersection between message source and message feature holding implications for perceived speaker composure. Perceived message lewdness was found to have negative effects on message and speaker evaluation, however, the opposite effect was present for perceived message intensity. Together, these results suggest an antagonistic relationship. Intensity may prove a successful persuasive strategy, but when lewdness becomes a factor, both message and source evaluations are negatively impacted.

Two hundred and forty seven undergraduate students completed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ; Graham et al., 2011) and a facial emotion recognition task (PERT ER-40; Gur et al., 2002), in addition to indicating the number of lies told in a 24-hour period. Results indicate that the moral foundation of harm/care is associated with both sensitivity to anger and fear facial expressions as well as the tendency to tell fewer lies. Additionally, individuals who reported telling fewer lies also showed greater accuracy in recognizing facial expressions of anger.

Analyzing newspaper articles and television transcripts, this study examines how the national news media has framed child sexual abuse (CSA) in the United States from 2002 through 2012. This content analysis seeks to define and apply attributions of responsibility, categorized as individual or societal level causes and solutions, to the framing of CSA in news articles. Implications derived from the findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are made.

One potential promising message strategy for raising sexual knowledge and awareness may be the use of humor. However, humor as a strategy for sexual health promotion and education has received inadequate investigation. The current study extends knowledge in this area by investigating the potential merit of humor by varying the amount of humor used in a short video about condom use. Results indicated that greater perceived humor was positively associated with desirable message characteristics, and negatively related to undesirable message characteristics. Notable differences by sex and age were also observed. Implications of this research for the design and implementation of sexual health interventions is considered.

2014-0928,2014,Paper Session,Examining Interpersonal Communication as a Mediator of Campaign Effects on Smokers' Quit Behaviors,5,"This study examined the role of interpersonal communication in the context of a mass media anti-smoking campaign. Specifically, it explored whether conversations about campaign ads and/or about quitting mediated campaign effects on quitting behaviors, as well as the relationship between ad-related and quitting-related conversations. We performed 16 monthly cross-sectional telephone surveys among a representative sample of 3354 adult Philadelphian smokers and re-interviewed 890 participants after three months. Cross-sectional and lagged mediation models with bootstrap procedures assessed the indirect effects of campaign exposure on outcomes through conversations. In addition, lagged logistic regression analyses tested the causal direction of associations between the variables of interest. Results indicate that conversations about quitting may mediate campaign effects on quitting-related behaviors, and that conversations about the ads may have indirect effects on quitting-related behaviors by triggering quitting-related conversations. These findings demonstrate the importance of measuring interpersonal communication as an intermediate outcome in future campaign evaluations.",Communication Issues in Health Campaigns,Health Communication

In the context of an ongoing health campaign, IVEs coupled with pamphlets are proposed as an effective strategy to elicit greater personal relevance and involvement with the risk of soft drink consumption. Construal level theory guided the design of a 2 (other vs. self) x 2 (pamphlet only vs. pamphlet with IVEs) between-subjects experiment to reduce soft drinks consumption over one week. Immediately following exposure, tailoring the message to the self seemed to be effective in reducing intentions to consume soft drinks. The effect of tailoring dissipated after one week and measures of actual soft drinks consumption demonstrated that coupling IVEs with the pamphlet was more effective. Results prescribed a messaging strategy that incorporates both tailoring and coupling IVEs with traditional media to increase behavioral changes over time.",Communication Issues in Health Campaigns,Health Communication

From the universe of calls 1999-2011, stratified random sampling yielded 1237 calls; manual coding: caller sex, age, proxy status, and health concern. Among all calls, the top three call-generating health topics were specific symptoms/conditions, sexual/reproductive health, and gastrointestinal concerns. The top 9 topics were consistent among women, men, and proxy callers; however, relative frequency of topics varied across groups. Nearly one-quarter of calls were initiated on behalf of someone, generally a child, spouse or sibling, or parent. Sixty percent of callers were women; women made seventy percent of proxy calls. The talk format of the show provides a uniquely personal channel for communicating important health information while leveraging the cost-effectiveness and wide reach of a mass medium.

2014-0933,2014,Paper Session,Journalism-Business Tension in Swedish Newsroom Decision-Making,3,"This study applied Kohlberg’s levels of moral cognition to three ethical dilemmas posed to a group of 19 Swedish newspaper mid-level editors. By using a qualitative approach to analyze interviews conducted by think aloud protocols, we found that all three Kohlberg’s levels appeared in editor responses, but most editors decided at a post-conventional level. Pre-conventional-level decisions – or more selfish-oriented choices – evinced themselves in a dilemma addressing whether to spread news of the newspapers’ eminent closure. Almost half the editors considered withholding or sharing such news only after evaluating likely outcomes. In the other dilemmas, editors were mainly concerned with their credibility or newspaper reputation, although the punishment/reward system was not as clear. The conventional level of moral reasoning was more evenly spread throughout the dilemmas. In all three scenarios, editors were concerned with themselves and their employees. Still, they remained tied to ideas of company loyalty and duty.",Negotiating New Tensions in News Production,Journalism Studies

Based on in-depth interviews with Israeli journalists who covered the social protest that erupted in Israel in 2011, this paper investigates how journalists negotiate different influences on their work, associated with individual conditions, political/economic organizational agendas, and professional values. It analyzes journalists’ construction of synchronic and diachronic relationships between the different influences and distinguishes between narratives in which the protest is treated as either a routine or critical news event, leading in turn to either paradigm repair or changes in journalists' practices and consciousness. The paper thus seeks to shed light on both the contextual factors that shaped the production of protest coverage and the ways in which the social protest was used by Israeli journalists in their own professional and economic struggles.",Negotiating New Tensions in News Production,Journalism Studies

A more important question than understanding this process of adoption of web analytics in the newsroom is how access to audience metrics impacts the journalism that journalists produce. In this essay, we pose three interconnected concerns about the use of web analytics in journalism. First, we warn against the dangers of romanticizing the audience and arguing too strongly against journalistic autonomy, which removes journalistic ethics from the narrative. Second, we call for greater distinction between the public interest and what the public is interested in. Third, we warn of the danger of viewing the audience as disaggregated segments based on consumer preference as communicated through web analytics, and how this view threatens the communitarian function of journalism.",Negotiating New Tensions in News Production,Journalism Studies

Crowdmapping is a new trend of communications of place. Research on the subject dispersedly refers to social or digital crowdmapping, locative media, psychogeography, or geovisualization by new spatial media. In front of the conceptual chaos, this paper suggests visual mediatization as a possible critical integrative and heuristic approach. It suggests exploring mapping practices beyond the strictly technological conditions of the devices and understanding geomedia and locative media as a cultural field of production in which power also intervenes. Finally, the theoretical discussion by Adams and Jansson (2012) is turned into an analytical tool for cases of digital participatory mapping practices.

Explaining German Television Audiences’ Preferences by Cultural Proximity in Crime Series,3,"In this study we rely on the concept of cultural proximity to explain German TV audiences’ liking of crime TV. First, we ask in how far cultural proximity explains German TV audiences’ preference for TV crime series. Building upon related work relying on the Model of Susceptibility to Imported Media (Elasmar, 2003), we interrogate in how far younger German audiences prefer US crime content more than German content. Second, we expand the concept of cultural proximity to explain the popularity of Germany’s most successful TV crime series Tatort by regional cultural proximity. To do so, we carried out a paper-pencil survey (N = 455). Findings indicate that Germans equally value US and German crime series. With few exceptions, we did not find effects of regional cultural proximity for Germany’s most popular crime series Tatort.

2014-0938,2014,Paper Session,The Formation of a Public Countersphere in Russia of 2008-2012: Media Diets of the ‘For Fair Elections’ Protest Movement and Their Perceived Political Impact,2,"The wave of protest movements of 2008-2012 in many countries in the world was fostered by many various factors, of which one common factor could be the role(s) of new and social media. But often the conceptualization of the roles of these media does not go beyond purely organizational functions or stimulating political protest by circulating certain images or videos. Taking the example of the Russian political protest movement ‘For fair elections’ of 2011-2012, the authors show that previous years were crucial for forming and speeding up the protest, as new clusters of media (Facebook as a locus, oppositional radio, alternative-agenda online media) created communicative milieus that played not only organizational and informational but also ‘cultivational’ roles in terms of forming shared political attitudes. The cleavage in media diets of protesters and non-protesters was huge enough to hypothesize a major public sphere cleavage and formation of a nation-wide public counter-sphere.",European Media in Transition,Global Communication and Social Change

Using original 2013 survey data from three countries in Eastern Europe, we examine citizen attitudes about media freedom by grounding our investigation in media dependency theory and motivated cognition. Our results indicate that in a free media system, judgments about free media attitudes are a result of media use behaviors and political orientations. In unfree media systems, they arise primarily from political orientations. Directions for future research are discussed.",European Media in Transition,Global Communication and Social Change

However, while analysis of socio-political networks such as civil society advocacy or multi-level politics recognizes both vertical and horizontal dimensions, research on the role of communications networks too often focus only on the horizontal dimension of communications. As a result, the role of multiple platforms and technologies in supporting networked civil society advocacy is too often missed. By illuminating the multiple roles of civil society within the European ACTA debate, and the multiple dimensions through through which these actions took places this paper demonstrates the importance of examining the range of technologies that support different communicative acts and networked activism within the networked public sphere",European Media in Transition,Global Communication and Social Change

The data collected suggest strongly that the prevailing wisdom about the slow death of watchdog reporting is simply wrong. Using the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as a case study, the paper will demonstrate that watchdog reporting is actually very much alive and well. The data suggest that newspapers in particular still produce high amounts of accountability reporting. In fact, some sectors of the American newspaper industry—namely medium-sized metropolitan dailies—have vastly increased the amount of watchdog reporting they provide for their readers over the past two decades, and now dedicate considerable resources to doing so. These results have important ramifications for our understanding of the newspaper industry today, suggesting that it has not abandoned its all-important watchdog role.",Challenging Expectations in Journalism Studies Research,Journalism Studies

and increase its credibility. However, little research has been conducted to assess the
connection between transparency and credibility. This study utilizes an experimental
setting with, in total, 1320 respondents to measure what impact transparency have on
source and message credibility from the user perspective. The results reveal an almost
absence of any transparency effect on both source and message credibility although some
small significant effects could be observed primarily regarding internal hyperlinks,
comments and contextual information. Although further research is needed in this area
the study suggest that transparency does not affect the credibility of journalism in the
eyes of the contemporary audience and thus have limited appeal as a new norm in

Medium differences were not only statistically significant but also cut across all studied aspects. As hypothesized, patterns of reporting were much less meticulous and more source-dependent in the immediate media (online and radio) compared to daily media (print and television). Contrary to its infamous reputation, the most complex and rich reporting patterns were found on television. Findings indicate that different news media are not only unique packing and distribution houses of similarly obtained raw materials, as suggested by the generic approach, but also unique manufacturing houses of news, as suggested by the particularist approach.",Challenging Expectations in Journalism Studies Research,Journalism Studies
2014-0944,2014,Paper Session,Blogging Back Then: Annotative Journalism in I.F. Stone’s Weekly and Talking Points Memo,1,"This article develops the concept of “annotative journalism” with a close review of two muckraking investigations, fifty years apart, by the newsletter I.F. Stone’s Weekly and the website Talking Points Memo. Both cases stand out in hindsight as investigative coups, though neither relied on the tools we associate with that kind of journalism: anonymous sources, secret documents, and so on. Instead, each investigation proceeded mainly through the critical analysis of news reports and other public documents. I argue that this annotative style of newswork unsettles core practices and assumptions of objective journalism in which “the facts speak for themselves”; it rejects the narrative coherence so well explored by Tuchman (1980) in favor of a set of critical textual practices. These cases of annotative journalism complicate the inherited distinction between “reporting” and “opinion,” unearthing hidden facts through the framework of a wider media and political critique.",Challenging Expectations in Journalism Studies Research,Journalism Studies

How Social Media Efficacy Impacts Information Evaluation Online,3,"Social media comprise a dynamic and rapidly expanding resource in today’s information environment. This study proposes the construct of social media efficacy, or a person’s perceived ability to reach desired outcomes in the social media environment, and suggests that a person’s level of social media efficacy can impact how he or she evaluates information found online. Results of this representative survey of adult Internet users in the United States (N=3,568) indicate that users with higher social media efficacy find information shared via social media to be more trustworthy than those lower in social media efficacy. These self-efficacious social media users also rely more both on the opinions of others and on social media specifically when evaluating or verifying the information they find online, suggesting that they may be more prone to seek out and be influenced by input from others.",Evaluating Online Information,Communication and Technology

As these features facilitate the recipient´s interaction with a media persona, they can be assumed to influence the perceived parasocial interaction (Horton & Wohl, 1956). The goal of the present paper was to investigate the connection between crossmedial extensions of a social TV series and the parasocial interaction to the protagonist of it. In order to investigate this, a social TV series was used in which the viewer even had the possibility to add the fictitious protagonist of the series as a Facebook friend. In line with this, the fictitious character was even able to communicate with the audience actively. An online survey with 218 participants showed that especially the Facebook friendship and thus the communication with a protagonist has an impact on the degree of parasocial interaction.",Evaluating Online Information,Communication and Technology

However, the consequences of online taste performances for an individual’s consumption of media content are not well understood. This study tested the influence of public commitment and feedback on subsequent attitudes toward media content following computer-mediated sharing. Taste performances were expected to result in an identity shift process when online sharing occurred publicly. Valenced feedback was also predicted to influence identity shift. A 2x3 (publicness x feedback) between-subjects experiment (N = 203) tested these predictions. Participants receiving negative feedback held less positive attitudes toward shared photos, an effect that persisted for a week. Positive feedback yielded a sleeper effect on the appeal of alternative photos. No main effect of public sharing was evident, yet public sharing led to positive attitudes among individuals who frequently displayed their tastes online but to negative attitudes among individuals who rarely shared.",Evaluating Online Information,Communication and Technology

Contemporary research on information credibility has for the most part focused on the cognitive nature of credibility assessment, and this concept fills a perceived gap in that literature at a time when it is most relevant. Results of two nationally representative surveys showed that SCA is quite prevalent, both on its own and in relation to more individualized cognitive processes. In addition, although adults report engaging in SCA more frequently, kids believe it to be more important when evaluating a number of different types of information. Finally, the use of SCA is positively related to belief in the credibility of user-generated information on Wikipedia.

Based on the two competing views concerning the antecedents and consequences of online communication (social enhancement vs. social compensation), the joint effect of affiliative tendency and communication competence was hypothesized and tested. For those high in affiliative need, communication competence positively predicted Twitter use for network expansion and negatively predicted intrapersonal Twitter use, but no such effect was found for those low in affiliative need. Those using Twitter for surveillance spent more time on Twitter and maintained a larger Twitter network, while those using Twitter for network expansion retweeted others’ posts more frequently.",Twitter Studies,Communication and Technology

2014-0952,2014,Paper Session,Did You See That? Shared Attention to Media Events on Twitter,4,"“Media events” such as political debates generate conditions of shared attention during which users engage with social media with a mutual awareness that their audiences are simultaneously engaged with traditional media. How do these patterns of “dual screening” influence individual and collective discourse? Using data from a population of approximately 200,000 politically-active Twitter users, we compare features of individual and population level behavior across four levels of shared attention during the 2012 U.S. presidential election season. We explore the response to media events in terms of both the average levels of user activity and shifts in communication modality and the collective distribution of these activities and tweeters’ attention to them. We find that individuals become more active during shared attention to media events and shift their messages from an interpersonal to a topical orientation. Despite the fact that these tendencies in message production are broadly shared by many tweeters, we find that attention to tweets becomes much more highly concentrated under shared attention, with a small number of users, tweets, and hashtags garnering a larger portion of the audience’s attention. Our work is the first study on distinguishing patterns of large-scale social behavior under condition of uncertainty and shared attention, suggesting new ways of mining information from social media to support collective sensemaking following major events.",Twitter Studies,Communication and Technology

This paper looks at how the museum-goer is invited to explore archival and oral contents of Vietnam’s revolutions as politically constructive and instructive means for understanding postcolonial national identity. I posit that the Museum employs participatory strategies to remember revolution and construct pacifism as the very ideology foundational to national identity. Instead of remembering war for the purposes of honoring troops and victims, or for the purposes of constructing winners and losers of wars, the Museum puts forward the fundamental notion that peacemaking begins with remembering the human cost of war in the past as well as at present. This paper argues that the Museum constructs Vietnamese national identity as historically rooted in postcolonial self-determination and pacifism and contemporaneously inspired by racial affirmation.","Images, Cultural Identity, and Politics",Visual Communication Studies

It is found that the negative association persists despite the controls. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the relevant multitasking behavior and its possible predictors (i.e., multitasking motivations and learning variables). It is found that multitasking behaviors are positively related to multitasking motivations and negatively related to self-regulation behaviors.

Despite this popularity, Gramscian theory has not crossed over to rhetoric outside of select debates concerning the possibility of a rhetorical materialism. Given Gramsci’s training and tendency to write what communications scholars would recognize as close textual analysis Gramsci appears to have important contributions to make to rhetorical theory. I demonstrate that a close reading of The Prison Notebooks shows two important insights for rhetoricians. First, the very nature of the notebooks demonstrates the importance of conditions of production, gesturing towards the need to reconsider the question of rhetorical materialism. Second, Gramsci offers a more politically empowering role for the rhetor and critic than what is typically acknowledged by other critical authors.",Topographies of Rhetoric and Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The solution to this problem, I argue, can be found in the work of Slavoj Žižek. For Žižek, the existence of the perverse subject position is dependent on its articulation as a disavowal of the subject’s actions. I argue that this emphasis on the articulated nature of perversion leads Žižek to adopt from clinical psychoanalysis the rhetorical strategy of preemptively managing the audience’s ability to articulate their perverse disavowal. In such a strategy, rhetoric is not only a matter of content, but also of managing the audience’s ability to respond.",Topographies of Rhetoric and Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The researcher chose the NGO Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) for the project and conducted a case study to examine how this NGO affects the national branding of South Korea. Interviews were conducted with employees from VANK via Skype, followed by additional in-depth interviews with officers from government agencies who worked or are working with VANK. Most interviews were conducted by phone, and some were by email. Both groups of interviewees agreed that the expertise of the government and NGOs is different, so VANK’s various activities are effective in fulfilling what the government does not carry out. The respondents understand soft power as culture and that social media enables interaction between VANK members and foreign audiences. Findings show that VANK conducts voluntary two-way communication efforts to convey positive information about South Korea with its strategic publics.

The analyses revealed the following major findings. Even though SNS users perceived stronger persuasive intent for the strong tie than the weak tie, they still considered the strong tie more credible and involving less ulterior motive in sharing the advertisement than the weak tie. The advertisement shared by the strong tie led to better attitude towards both the advertisement and the advertised brand. The advertisement shared via private channel by the weak tie on SNS led to the strongest perception of persuasive intent for the advertisement. Strong tie boosted the forwarding intention for the advertisement shared via public channel.

This paper investigates whether adopting and using a brand’s app have an impact on purchase behaviors. By comparing purchase behaviors of mobile app adopters and non-adopters individually matched based on adopters’ pre-adoption purchase behaviors, we found that mobile adopters purchase more frequently and spend more in subsequent months after they download the brand’s app. Among adopters, the level of usage with the app further increases purchase behaviors. We also found that discontinuing the use of the app may potentially decrease purchase behaviors. These results suggest the importance of a brand’s apps as a channel for deepening brand-customer relationship and as an effective advertising tool, while carrying risks for apps which may result in the decrease of purchase behaviors.",Mobile Phones and Consumer Behaviors,Communication and Technology

Their responses are presented and discussed to open the door to further research on assessment methods in virtual environments and incorporation of generative learning environments. This will provide a basis by which instructors can take better advantage of the tools available to them in the virtual environment.",What's Going Online?

Measures of knowledge gain and attitudes revealed significant differences across time showing success of the instruction, but non-significant differences between the modes of instruction. However, a behavioral measure found that significantly more students in the online condition were able to successfully find empirical articles to use in their projects than those in the in-person instructional condition. With empirical research living less at brick-and-mortar libraries and primarily in online repositories, teaching students how to find empirical research may be most successful when it is taught via online platforms.",What's Going Online?

Although this study uncovered multiple significant relationships, students’ perceptions of their teacher’s verbal immediacy and presence in their instructional design were found to be most predictive relative to students’ emotions in online classrooms. Ultimately this study addresses the need to more fully examine students’ emotions and related social experiences with virtual teachers and course content in higher education.",What's Going Online?

Predictions are based on Objectification Theory. Results show that time spent on Facebook did not predict scores on the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) or Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26©). However, spending more time on Facebook predicted paying more attention to physical appearance while controlling for weight difference. For women who wanted to lose weight, time on Facebook predicted paying more attention to physical appearance and more negative feelings. For women who wanted to gain or maintain their weight, more time on Facebook did not predict more attention to physical appearance or more negative feelings.",Social Media and Health Communication,Health Communication

In total, 396 websites retrieved with US engines and 335 websites from Austrian searches were assessed in terms of usability and quality of content. In both countries, websites retrieved with method-related search terms (e.g. how to hang yourself) contained more harmful and fewer protective characteristics as compared to the term suicide. Help-related search terms (e.g. suicidal thoughts) yielded more websites with protective characteristics. Websites retrieved with U.S. search engines generally had more protective characteristics than searches with Austrian engines. Resources with harmful characteristics were better ranked than those with protective characteristics.",Social Media and Health Communication,Health Communication

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is a promising approach, yet there are many issues act as barriers to the effective implementation of it. This study examined social representations around PrEP on Twitter. 1,435 Tweets were collected and 774 English Tweets were content-analyzed to explore propagation of various issues around daily oral PrEP and the sources of those Tweets. We also examined how characteristics of sources and Twitter messages influenced information propagation. Our findings revealed that PrEP-related information on Twitter covered a wide range of issues, and individual users constituted the majority of the Tweet creators among all the sources including news media, non-profit and academic groups, and commercial entities. Using Poisson regression, we also found that Tweet source’s Klout score and Tweet’s affective tone were predictors of message propagation frequency.

In participating in that dialogue, the audience takes on the role of press critic and, therefore, a potentially powerful player in the journalistic field. An examination of reader comments on more than 400 ombudsman columns from National Public Radio, The New York Times, and the Washington Post suggests an audience that is more ally than enemy in journalists’ efforts to preserve their cultural capital. Commenters mostly evoked traditional journalistic standards in their criticisms and often expressed nostalgia for a time when those standards were more consistently upheld. Commenters also, however, held journalists to social as well as professional norms, a move that could be a seen as a threat to journalists’ professional autonomy.","Journalism, Accuracy, and Criticism",Journalism Studies

One of the more common forms of interactivity involves commenting on news stories. These interactive features are often heralded for enabling virtual public deliberation of current events. Yet, there exists a widespread belief that these spaces fail to meet that lofty goal, instead exhibiting hostile and vitriolic discourse, which undermines the deliberative potential of online interaction. This article aims to integrate normative and contextual conceptual definitions of hostility and civility in online interactions. Building on these, we develop operational definitions of the two concepts and analyze the presence of hostile and civil discussion in user comments posted to YouTube news videos. Further, we explore the possibility that the content and source of those news videos, as well as popularity and engagement metrics, may explain the degree of hostility and civility in comments.","Journalism, Accuracy, and Criticism",Journalism Studies

The evolution of the fact-checking site reflects an effort to gain legitimacy and consistency amid environmental disruption and clashing institutional logics. Results of a content analysis reveal a media population that began to cohere toward a blend of network and traditional journalism logics, but then shifted, becoming more varied, specialized and personalized within the last two years. Yet fact-checking sites showed signs of legitimation, despite ongoing challenges from some news professionals and political partisans. It appears that both forces of legitimation and (political, economic and technological) disruption will continue to shape the emergence and development of this population.","Journalism, Accuracy, and Criticism",Journalism Studies

How Journalists and Academics Prioritize Two Conflicting Values,1,"Journalists have to report the news accurately and to deliver important information quickly. In pres-sing situations, this causes a dilemma between publishing a result quickly and waiting to check it carefully. Academics occasionally face a comparable dilemma. Journalists’ and academics’ prefe-rences to act are compared and explained based on a quantitative, comparative survey of 134 Ger-man journalists (34 %) and 163 academics (33 %) from different subject areas. Asked to rate a fictiti-ous dilemma between publishing an uncertain claim and waiting to confirm it, journalists prefer pub-lishing, whereas academics prefer confirming it. Based on regression analyses the differences are explained by respondents’ anticipations of the potential consequences of publishing an uncertain result. Journalists’ preference is predominantly influenced by their anticipations of positive conse-quences. Academics’ preference is equally influenced by their anticipations of positive and negative consequences of publishing uncertain claims. Concluding, the risks of errors in modern journalism are discussed.","Journalism, Accuracy, and Criticism",Journalism Studies

Claims like these are often advanced on the ground of research focusing on the US and the UK. This study tests whether these claims do apply to foreign correspondents in other Western countries, taking the German-speaking countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany) as a case study. Based on responses from 211 foreign correspondents gathered through an online survey, this study reconstructs the working conditions of foreign correspondents. It finds that the traditional correspondent may be more resistant to change than expected.

This article discusses journalist-source relationship of foreign correspondents in two stages: news access and news interaction. This article employs ethnography and semi-structure in-depth interview. Six months of ethnography was undertaken and 56 Taiwan correspondents based in mainland China were interviewed. The result shows that news access is a strategic action, which is influenced by the news control of Chinese government and the nature of news in the context of changing cross-strait relations. The result also shows that journalists and news sources coexist symbiotically through instrumental, expressive and composited interactions, in which instrumental interactions are adopted to report general news and the latter two are adopted to accomplish the exclusive or in-depth news reports. This article helps delineate the sourcing behavior of foreign correspondents, develop the theory of news production of foreign correspondents, and has practical implications on journalists’ practice, for both foreign correspondents and domestic journalists.",Reporting Across Borders: Foreign Correspondents and NGOs,Journalism Studies

This paper answers those calls with an analysis of the information production practices of humanitarian and human rights NGOs. Drawing primarily on interview data and NGO materials, this paper shows how NGO professionals become aware of issues, how they decide which issues to investigate, what the investigation process looks likes and how the research is written up. It argues that the overarching aim of human rights NGO research is to link together three distinct story elements: violations, violators and remedies. Within this framework, I suggest, NGO reporting is impartial in a manner similar to journalist reporting; advocacy work appears after the reporting process is complete. In detailing the process of news production, the paper offers an empirical analysis of newsmaking beyond newsrooms while clarifying debates about the “blurring boundaries” between advocacy and journalism.",Reporting Across Borders: Foreign Correspondents and NGOs,Journalism Studies

2014-0991,2014,Paper Session,A Communicational Approach to Strategy-Making: Exploring the Constitution of Matters of Concerns,4,"This paper develops a communicational approach to strategy and strategy-making as an attempt to bridge the growing bodies of literature on organizational communication and Strategy-as-Practice. Based on a “communicative constitution of organization” approach (CCO), it provides a conceptual framework to define strategy-making as a series of communication episodes where specific matters of concerns are invoked, evoked and negotiated, defining and appropriating value to the organization. More specifically, the paper proposes to focus on fleeting moments of strategy to highlight how collective endeavors are progressively born as effects of the contributions, and therefore do not exist prior to the practices that generate them. Applying this framework to the analysis of a board meeting in a community organization, it shows that favoring a constitutive view of communication allows for a definition of strategy-as-practice that goes beyond human action broadening the analysis to other agents and “web of practices” (Vaara and Whittington, 2012).",As Good as New: Emerging Paradigms/Directions in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

To make this contribution, I first discuss the ways in which the notion of “difference” is conceptualized in extant organizational communication research. I then proceed to outline the driving metatheoretical assumptions behind queer theory and explain how it has been incorporated into organizational research thus far. Afterwards, I identify three constructs within organizational research that I argue could especially benefit from a queer analysis: occupational segregation, glass metaphors, and the gendered organization. I conclude by reflecting on what the discipline of organizational communication has to gain by the pursuit of this new line of research rooted in queer theory.",As Good as New: Emerging Paradigms/Directions in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

In some cases, this usage may follow from Orlikowski and Scott (2008) who suggested an assemblage approach to understanding technology in organizations. However, there seems to be a need to better define and develop this concept as a unit of analysis for organizational communication research on the sociomateriality of organizations. Here, I suggest that Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987) concept of “assemblage” provides a unique way to understand the relationship between humans, materiality, and discourse in a way that previous theories have not. In this paper, I outline Deleuze and Guattari’s theory, showing how it connects to organizational communication theory.

We follow Schoenenborn and Scherer’s (2012) suggestion and attempt to provide a truly communicational perspective of organizational membership by focusing on “communicative events,” rather than using complete in-dividuals as a starting point. We show that ethnomethodology’s notions of accounts and sanctions are useful in recognizing the interactionally-performed nature of membership. However, we extend ethnomethodology’s intuition by viewing membership as being achieved through the contribution of actions to the organization. This view is possible because people are “dividuals,” meaning that their own ownership of their actions is not intrinsic, but rather the outcome of negotiation practices. Two cases allow illustrating this proposal in the case of “organizations of organizations.”",As Good as New: Emerging Paradigms/Directions in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

Role and Demeanor Congruity as Predictors of Robot Attraction and Use Intentions Among Senior Citizens,4,"Using a robot designed for the elderly in a naturalistic, retirement home setting, an experiment (N = 59) was conducted to investigate whether variations in the role (companion vs. assistant) and social demeanor (playful vs. serious) of a robot influence senior citizens’ perceptions of the robot’s social attraction, intelligence, anxiety, and eeriness. Study results show that assistant robots are perceived as more socially attractive and intelligent if their demeanor is playful rather than serious. In addition, companion robots were evaluated as less anxious and less eerie when their personality was serious rather than playful. Finally, analyses of indirect effects show that companion robots with a serious demeanor have a positive serial indirect effect on robot use intentions via heightened perceptions of intelligence and social attraction, while assistant robots with a playful demeanor have a positive indirect effect on intentions via lower perceptions of anxiety. These findings test and extend the assumptions of prominent theories pertaining to human-robot communication (CASA and uncanny valley) and inform the successful design of socially assistive robotics for the elderly.",Emotive Expression Effects in Technology-Mediated Communication,Communication and Technology
2014-0996,2014,Paper Session,Mediation and Interpersonal Attraction: A Comparison of Verbal and Nonverbal Expressions of Affection in Audiovisual CMC and FtF,4,"Computer-mediated communication (CMC) applications are becoming progressively richer and new innovations even allow direct eye-contact. However, the question arises how well these novel applications mimic face-to-face (FtF) contact and if they allow for the development of interpersonal relationships to the same extent as FtF communication.
Recent studies on the effects of mediation on interpersonal attraction have found that communicators in CMC generally like their conversational partner more compared to FtF interaction. However, earlier studies focused on text-based or video-only forms of CMC. As contemporary audiovisual CMC is able to transmit many of the same cues as FtF communication, the question arises whether previous findings persist.
This study has two aims: (1) directly compare (non-) verbal expressions of affection in audiovisual CMC that endorses eye-contact with (non-) verbal expressions of affection in FtF communication, and (2) examine whether these differences in expressions of affection account for differences in interpersonal attraction.",Emotive Expression Effects in Technology-Mediated Communication,Communication and Technology

The current study examines the role of emoticons in improving the perceived politeness level of email messages used in face-threatening situations. In investigating politeness function of emoticons, this study draws on the Social Information Processing (SIP) theory, which posits that Internet users adapt to online environments over time by using a variety of online devices and, when encountering such devices, they imbue messages with social meanings. The results of two experiments corroborates the main argument of the SIP theory showing that using emoticons in favor-asking emails increased the perceived politeness of messages with multiple exposures to the emoticons. The effects of emoticons did not depend on the size of request. The findings indicate that familiarity with emoticons resulting from perceptual fluency is a key component of online devices and paralanguage.",Emotive Expression Effects in Technology-Mediated Communication,Communication and Technology

A one way factorial experimental design is utilized that manipulates the number of emoticons in a teacher-student email to be absent, one, few (three), many (seven), or very many (twelve). Participants (N = 534) completed measures to assess perceptions of credibility (competence, character, caring) and liking. Results for competence, character, and liking indicate that conditions with absent, one, and few emoticons are equally perceived as the most positive. However, perceived caring indicates an inverted curvilinear relationship with few emoticons perceived to be the most positive. The use of many and very many emoticons indicates a negative relationship for all variables. Overall findings indicate that emoticons exert a mild effect on student perceptions.",Emotive Expression Effects in Technology-Mediated Communication,Communication and Technology

A study among a representative sample of the Dutch population revealed that although the emphasis on the digital divide has begun to incorporate skills and usage, motivational and material access remain relevant since they operate throughout the whole process of Internet appropriation. A lack of physical access might have been reduced in developed countries, material access remains relevant.

Recently, studies have enhanced our understanding of the participation divide by differentiating types of online content creation.

We suggest that social cognitive theory (SCT) helps explain why and how socio-demographics influence different forms of online participation. Based on SCT, we analyze the mediating effect of two cognitive constructs, self-efficacy and privacy concerns, on different types of online content creation. We conduct a survey among German Internet users and apply structural equation modeling in order to compare three distinct theoretical models.

Need for cognition was included as a moderating factor. The findings revealed that SNS users perceived less persuasive intent, generated more favorable attitude and higher forwarding intention towards viral ad when it was shared by a friend than by a company. Vivid advertising message led to more perceived persuasive intent and lower forwarding intention, but more favorable attitude and purchase intention towards the advertised product than the pallid ad. Need for cognition moderated the effects of agent and vividness on attitude towards viral message. Perceived persuasive intent served as the mediator for the effects of both message agent and message vividness on forwarding intention.

In the field of persuasion, a century of experimental research has given rise to an extensive body of knowledge, but advertisers rarely make use of it. Persuasion knowledge, in the form of evidence-based principles, was used to create an index model. The predictive validity of this advertising principles index was tested using 96 pairs of print advertisements and associated recall data. Predictions (n=480) based on ratings of self-trained novices were correct for 60% of the pairs. After combining the ratings for each principle across five raters, predictions were correct for 73% of pairs. Predictions from unaided judgment by experts (n=96), were correct for 55% of pairs, and novices (n=563) for 53% of pairs. Combined expert judgments were correct for 57% of pairs and combined novice judgments for 58%. At 59% correct, predictions from copy testing were also less accurate than predictions from the advertising principles index.

Results show Advertising Age expressed attitudes consistent with those of the industry through the framing of the issue in its news stories – but not through the sources chosen to express their views on the issue. In this respect, the publication’s journalistic values of choosing appropriate expert sources to speak on an issue took precedence over institutional isomorphism tendencies to include industry “insiders” over “outsiders.” Coverage of online advertising increased over time, was increasingly positive, and indicated a sense of industry control over the situation. Online advertising was also increasingly framed as an opportunity, rather a threat, over time. However, the coverage did not portray an increasing sense of gain rather than loss, and comparative statements did not decrease over time.

As one of the most popular television programs in the United States, Super Bowl has long been the focus of advertisers’ concern. It also attracts more and more attention from advertising researchers due to its naturalistic context. Effective variables such as length, frequency and serial position that contribute to the success of Super Bowl advertisements have been detected in previous literature. However, few studies considered product involvement’s role in terms of information processing model. Therefore, based on a twelve-year longitudinal dataset, this research attempts to test moderating effect of product involvement from heuristic and systematic model perspective. Findings from quasi-experiment showed that changing commercials’ length, frequency and serial position is more effective for low-involvement products than for high-involvement products.

Evidence shows that media attribute network agenda can set both the implicit and explicit public attribute network agendas. Moreover, the media attribute agenda is positively associated at a higher level with the implicit public salience than explicit public salience of this attribute network.

The key variables include message salience, construct importance, construct accessibility, attributional judgment, and audience attitude. The first part of the model posits that priming a construct to make it salient in the media message (message salience) is likely to increase its importance in the audience’s mind and the ease of its retrieval from the audience’s memory. Importance and accessibility are two independent dimensions of perceived salience. The second part suggests that both increased construct importance and accessibility impact the audience’s attributional judgment of an observed action but in different types of process.

2014-1010,2014,Paper Session,Beyond Cognitive Framing Processes: Anger Mediates the Effects of Responsibility Frames on the Preference for Punitive Measures,3,"Traditionally, the effects of news frames on policy preferences have been explained by cognitive processes. A new avenue in framing research focuses on the role of emotions in framing effects. Following appraisal theories of emotion, it is assumed that certain news frames can elicit emo-tional responses that, in turn, influence policy preferences. Empirically, it has indeed been demonstrated that some news frames elicit emotions and promote specific policy preferences. However, two questions remain unanswered. First, only a few studies have investigated whether emotions mediate framing effects on preferences; however, these studies have not controlled for cognitive processes. Thus, it is not clear whether emotions are mediators of framing effects. Sec-ond, no study has addressed the moderators of such emotional mediation processes. The present study addresses both research questions and tests a moderated mediation model.",Framing and Agenda Setting,Mass Communication
2014-1011,2014,Paper Session,Framing Cancer in Online News: Implications for Popular Perceptions of Cancer,4,"News frames have long been observed to influence perceptions on issues, very often political in nature. In these studies we seek to explore framing effects in a non-persuasion health news context. First, we conduct a content analysis to examine the current landscape of frame usage in online cancer news and compare these results with previous work published by the authors. Second, we employ commonly used health frames in a multi-message design experiment with the goal of assessing the influence of popular cancer news frames on individuals’ perceptions about cancer, cancer interventions, and those that are dealing with the disease. Implications for framing research and health news production are discussed.",Framing and Agenda Setting,Mass Communication
2014-1012,2014,Paper Session,Bringing Class to Light and Life: A Case Study of Reality-Based Television Discourse,2,"This paper explores representations of class and status differences in American reality-based television programs and examines some of the ways they are designed to engage audience members in dialogue. This inquiry is situated in the context of two contemporary social phenomena: a polarizing ambivalence regarding class stratification in U.S. public discourse at a time of increasing class stratification, and a growth in the production and viewership of status-based reality television shows aired on U.S. broadcast and cable networks. A year of episodes of two programs, one from network television set in the world of work, and one from cable television set in home life and leisure, were studied. A selection of four cases taken from this corpus is examined using a multimodal analysis of talk and images as text, drawing from theories on the discursive construction of identity and agency, and focusing on members’ methods of categorization and ventriloquism.","Language and Mediated Interactions: Reality and Chat Television, Yiddish Interviews, and Holistic Health",Language & Social Interaction

It became common treatment for sinus/allergy relief after Dr. Oz introduced it on Oprah in 2007. In this article, we analyze U.S. popular press and new media news (1999 – 2012) about the neti pot using Critical Discourse Analysis. Three main themes emerged: exoticizing the neti pot, commodifying the neti pot, and warning about the dangers of the neti pot regarding two “neti-related” deaths. This paper highlights discursive ways media texts contribute to the Americanization and commodification of cultural health practices.","Language and Mediated Interactions: Reality and Chat Television, Yiddish Interviews, and Holistic Health",Language & Social Interaction

This religious community restricts the use of media to protect its boundaries and enhance its unity. This research is the first to study interactions in Yiddish and its interrelation with other languages on Ultra-Orthodox phone hotlines. Affiliate accommodation (convergence) processes enhance the community’s unity whenever interviewees accommodate interviewers by either switching to their dialect or code-switching to Yiddish. Disaffiliate accommodation (divergence) processes mark the boundaries of the community whenever an interviewer switches from Yiddish to English to ostracize an interviewee. Since generally interviewees accommodate interviewers, these processes resemble the relations between interviewers and interviewees in other media. Additionally, Enhancing the community’s linguistic ideology, interviewers use the interviews to construct Modern Hebrew as sacrilegious language.","Language and Mediated Interactions: Reality and Chat Television, Yiddish Interviews, and Holistic Health",Language & Social Interaction

2014-1016,2014,Paper Session,Pornography as a Creative Industry,1,"Much academic writing on pornography focuses on the genre’s exceptionalism (the ways in which it is different from other forms of culture). This paper rather focuses on its typicality as a Creative Industry. As with other Creative Industries, in the production and distribution of pornography it is producers who make most money. While a small number of on-camera performers become wealthy and powerful the majority lack creative control and are poorly paid. The careers of performers are typically short examples of “nomadic labour”. Many creative workers are involved in the production of pornography apart those in front of the camera, and the skills of these behind-the-camera creatives can be transferable across sectors. Like other Creative Industries, the pornography business is facing challenges from increased digitalization and globalization; and like other Creative Industries the solutions to these challenges lie in branding, niche marketing, and exploiting new technological possibilities.",Creative Industries: From PR to Porn,Popular Communication
2014-1017,2014,Paper Session,Understanding Public Relations as a Cultural Industry,1,"This paper deals with the question of how one might categorise the work done by one important distribution mechanism in the cultural industries: public relations (PR). PR has grown rapidly over the last three decades, due in large part to the increased need for promotional communication in the context of neoliberal markets (Davis, 2013). It continues to be a growth industry despite the lingering effects of the global recession, as evidenced by the healthy growth rates of the largest global PR firms (Holmes, 2013). Hesmondhalgh (2013: 19) suggests that PR, alongside other promotional functions, can be considered a cultural industry because it is concerned primarily with the production of symbolic meaning through a range of different texts. However, other than Hesmondhalgh’s book, very little attention has been paid to the claim that PR constitutes a cultural industry in itself. In this paper I argue that the claim that PR is a cultural industry requires further attention, for two reasons. First, I suggest it is insufficient to accept the claim based on an understanding of PR’s role in cultural industries contexts. Second, while there are some structural similarities between PR and other cultural industries, important characteristics that shape cultural industry work, including the nature and management of risk, production and reproduction costs, and the semi-public status of cultural ‘goods’, do not directly translate to PR. As a first step towards greater clarity, the paper explores how the specific nature of PR work, and the ‘social logics’ of the industry (Miege, 1987), shape its identity as a cultural industry.",Creative Industries: From PR to Porn,Popular Communication

Placing Big Bad Boo Studios in the context of the global the global children's media industry, the article considers the strategies that the small producer employs in order to compete against multinational corporations such as Disney and Viacom. In particular, we consider Big Bad Boo's careful balance of universal and culturally specific understandings of childhood. Using 1001 Nights as a case study, the paper argues that Big Bad Boo’s vision of a global childhood as an experience defined by multicultural collision reveals the dynamics of adjustment and negotiation available within the circumscribed spaces of conventional industry practices and flows of global capital. Ultimately, Big Bad Boo puts forth this unique perspective in order to appeal to a wide swath of potential program buyers, including both public and commercial broadcasters.",Creative Industries: From PR to Porn,Popular Communication

2014-1020,2014,Paper Session,It Takes Two to Tango: The Relationship Between the Celebrity Magazines and Celebrities in Belgium,1,"The objective of this paper is twofold. The first aim is to examine the characteristics of the celebrity press in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) in comparison with the foreign gossip press. The second aim is to characterize the relationship between local celebrities and journalists. To this end, a content analysis was first performed on the three Flemish celebrity magazines and, second, leading journalists, editors and the celebrities themselves were interviewed. The results show that the majority of the articles cannot be labelled as gossip stories and that the relationship between the celebrities and the journalists is typified by negotiation. However, it was found that Flemish magazines are adopting more and more practices typical of foreign celebrity tabloids. Particularly the new celebrities who gained fame from reality shows have a weaker negotiating position .",Creative Industries: From PR to Porn,Popular Communication

An experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of stealing thunder and other moderating variables. Findings indicate that while stealing thunder showed relatively weak main effects, it interacted with forewarning of persuasive intent and brand attachment. When the crisis was forewarned without the persuasive intent, participants positively evaluated stealing thunder information, compared to when the persuasive intent was forewarned.

2014-1022,2014,Paper Session,"Economic Condition, Policy Cycle, and Media Visibility of Environmental Organizations",1,"The extent to which social movements have access to the space of the news media has important implications on the capability of the social movements to communicate with and garner support from the general public. Factors that shape movement organizations’ media visibility thus deserve scholarly attention. This article deals with the case of news coverage of environmental movement organizations (EMOs) in Hong Kong. It combines a quantitative analysis of the structural factors shaping news coverage with in-depth interviews examining activists’ perceptions and responses. The quantitative analysis shows that economic conditions, policy cycle, and number of EMOs in society all influence the amount of environmental news coverage and media visibility of EMOs. The in-depth interview data then show that the impact of each of the structural factors is related to activists’ perceptions and strategies differently. The study illustrates how structural factors and movement strategies interlink with each other in shaping movement organizations’ media visibility.",Source Perceptions: Using Media to Inform and Persuade,Mass Communication
2014-1023,2014,Paper Session,Disasters and Information Source Repertoires: Information Seeking and Information Sufficiency in Postearthquake Haiti,1,"This study adopted a “repertoire” approach to interrogate how Haitians used combinations of information sources to meet information insufficiencies following the devastating 2010 earthquake. Using survey data gained in the field starting six weeks after the earthquake (N = 1,808), the study explored what demographic and structural factors predicted the number of sources used and common combinations of information sources following the earthquake. Results showed that Haitians used relatively few sources to seek information in the weeks following the earthquake. Cluster and factor analyses revealed two distinct repertoires of information sources: a “traditional” repertoire of radio, TV, church, and word of mouth; and an “elite” repertoire of newspapers, the Internet, short-message-service (SMS), billboards, and the national police. Education was the strongest predictor of using more information sources, spending more time on information seeking, and the adoption of an elite information source repertoire. Results suggested that greater reliance on a traditional repertoire led to decreased information sufficiency. Implications for practice are specifically directed at international development and aid organizations in planning post-disaster information provision efforts.",Source Perceptions: Using Media to Inform and Persuade,Mass Communication
2014-1024,2014,Paper Session,Media Violence From Parents’ Perspective: Exploring the Determinants of Attitudes Toward Media Effects and Their Role in Online Science Communication,1,"Potential harmful effects of media violence on children and teenagers have been discussed extensively. The point of view of parents and how they deal with this debate, however, has been largely unexplored. Therefore, we conducted two studies with a sample of parents (N = 121) in order to examine the factors that influence their attitudes toward potential media effects on children. Moreover, we tested whether parents’ prior attitudes influence their selection of respective information and examined the degree to which attitudes are affected when reading articles in a setting of online science communication. As a result, in particular, experiential and motivational factors were related to parents’ attitudes toward potential media effects. These attitudes, however, did not influence parents’ selective exposure to online information on media violence. A second study showed that parents’ attitudes toward media violence were less negative after the reception of two-sided scientific information online.",Source Perceptions: Using Media to Inform and Persuade,Mass Communication

Presented here is an exploratory study of doctor-patient communication in China. Interviews and surveys of twenty four doctors in China show that doctors consider themselves as both saviors and victims. This conflicted professional identity affects how doctors perceive doctor-patient relationship and how they communicate with their patients. By exploring the dialectical tensions in doctor-patient communication, this study demonstrates how doctor-patient communication in China is situated within the larger social and cultural context of the country and how the mismatch between the culture of the newly privatized medical system and the traditional culture of China is a major cause of the strained doctor-patient relationship in the country.",Health Issues and Intercultural Communication Research,Intercultural Communication

The present study investigated cross-cultural differences in sexual coercion in the United States and Korea. College-aged students from the United States (N=200) and Korea (N=188) were surveyed. The findings of this study signify that there are differences in experiences of sexual coercion between the US and Korea. Specifically, US participants reported experiencing sexual coercion more than Korean participants, and US participants reported being recipients of more coercive tactics than Korean participants. Despite differences in experience, there were similarities in perceptions of perpetration and victimization of sexual coercion across cultures.

Study 1 content analyzes all 7,215 messages posted in this Weigroup since its launch on January 18th, 2011 till September 14th, 2012. The analysis reveals that social support provisions are far more frequent than social support requests; moreover, informational support is the most dominantly requested and provided in this group. Study 2 further examines how social support exchanged in the HIV/AIDS Weigroup using social network analysis and MANOVA. It reveals main effects of both contact frequency and reciprocity on the amount of information support exchanged within each dyad. Moreover, dyadic partners with a high frequency of contact exchange a larger amount of emotional support than their counterparts. However, strongly reciprocal dyads do not exchange significantly more emotional social support than those dyads with a low level of reciprocity.",Health Issues and Intercultural Communication Research,Intercultural Communication

Study 1 tests the prediction cross-culturally. Consistent with the prediction, Japanese women (n = 80), presumed to be more self-critical for possessing an interdependent self-construal, tended to overestimate body weight more than their American counterparts (n = 63) with an independent self-construal. The level of overestimation, however, did not predict the willingness to adopt healthy behaviors. Study 2 tests the same prediction with a U.S. sample only, incorporating measurements of individual attributes (e.g., self-construal, levels of self-criticism). Consistently, results indicate a positive association between self-criticism and weight overestimation.",Health Issues and Intercultural Communication Research,Intercultural Communication

Through a careful analysis of content produced by DR and its youth section since 1951, the article argues that four distinct periods of children’s television can be identified, leading up to today’s competitive period. The article shows how Danish public service children’s TV has played an important role in the modernization of the view of children, serving as an experimental platform for putting the perspective of active and independent children on the agenda. The argument is that this agenda has been contested by the increased demands for entertaining content due to increased competition among TV channels and due to obeying demands for ever more content to complete programming schedules.",Opportunities and Barriers to Learning From Television,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-1030,2014,Paper Session,Media Use and ADHD-Related Behaviors in Children and Adolescents: A Meta-Analysis,4,"There are several theoretical reasons to believe that media use might be related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-related behaviors (i.e., attention problems, hyperactivity, and impulsivity). Although studies into this relationship have accumulated, they have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, we still do not know whether children’s media use and ADHD-related behaviors are related, and if so, under which conditions. To fill this gap, we first identified six hypotheses that explain why media use in general, and use of fast-paced or violent content might be related to ADHD-related behaviors. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 empirical studies investigating the relationship between media use and ADHD-related behaviors in children and adolescents. Our results indicated a small, but statistically significant relationship between media use and ADHD-related behaviors (r+ = .12). Finally, we identified several specific gaps in the existing literature and presented five crucial directions for future research.",Opportunities and Barriers to Learning From Television,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-1031,2014,Paper Session,Participatory Cues and Program Familiarity Predict Young Children’s Learning From Educational Television,1,"Fisch’s capacity model predicts that increased working memory allocation and decreased narrative processing demands should support children’s learning from educational television. These predictions were experimentally investigated with a sample of 187 American children (M = 4.35 years). Increased working memory allocation was operationalized as the inclusion of participatory cues in a television program (e.g., cues that encourage children to respond to queries when viewing). Decreased narrative processing was operationalized as program familiarity. Children were randomly assigned to view one of two versions of Dora the Explorer – one with participatory cues and one without. All children completed a program familiarity assessment before viewing and an educational content assessment post-viewing. Program familiarity was positively associated with educational content comprehension. There was no significant main effect for participatory cues. Familiarity moderated the relationship between participatory cues and comprehension – high program familiarity and participatory cues led to the greatest educational content comprehension.",Opportunities and Barriers to Learning From Television,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-1032,2014,Paper Session,Personalized Interactive Characters for Toddler’s STEM Learning From a Video Presentation,3,"Children's media is rooted in children's relationships with characters. In this study, 18-month-old toddlers were exposed to one of two previously unfamiliar interactive media characters for 3 months. In one condition, the character was personalized to them. In another condition, the character was not personalized to them. At age 21 months, toddlers were tested on a transfer seriation STEM task that was presented onscreen by the character. These children's seriation performance was compared to that of a 21-month-old control group. Toddlers learned significantly more from the personalized character, but not from the non-personalized character, when compared to the control group. Children in the personalized condition also increased in parasocial, nurturing behaviors directed at the character during play sessions over time, and these scores were linked to better seriation performance. The results suggest an important role for social relationships with interactive characters as a mechanism for teaching early mathematics skills.",Opportunities and Barriers to Learning From Television,Children Adolescents and Media

The scant existing research has focused on various program attributes rather than differences in the viewers, but individual experiences with a program can vary greatly from one child to another. This goal of this study was to provide an empirical test of the capacity model, with a focus on viewer characteristics. 78 preschool-age children watched a short educational television program and completed assessments of cognitive abilities, interest in the program, prior knowledge related to the program, and comprehension of the program content. Regression analyses revealed general support for Fisch’s predictions that viewer characteristics can influence the allocation of working memory resources for narrative comprehension and educational content comprehension.

This paper undertakes an alternative reading of Prislam. Utilizing the Newburgh Four case – in which four African-American ex-convicts were convicted of a terrorist plot in 2010 – this paper examines the complex relationship between race, mass incarceration (and the cycle of imprisonment and want in puts into motion) and the tactics used to combat homegrown terrorism (particularly, the use of informants) to show the potential for their confluence to exacerbate the unequal experiences of citizenship of African-Americans. Ultimately, this paper argues that the American-ness of jihad lies not in the convergence of (black) criminality and terror but only in the tragic confluence of age-old racial anxieties, prejudicial policies and fears of infiltration.","Race, Class, Myth, and Neoliberal Agendas",Ethnicity and Race in Communication

This paper argues that the video is much more than a study aid; it furthers the myth of American freedom, a myth that effectively erases the struggles of minority and marginalized groups. Situated within Critical Cultural Studies and Semiotics, this paper describes the content of the video and reads the myth. The video is then briefly compared to another acculturation video produced in the Netherlands. The deployment of diversity and the socio-political context in the U.S. video are considered, along with implications for immigrants who intersect with some of the marginalized or absent groups.

A 37-question telephone survey was conducted in Orleans Parish in June and July of 2012. There were 414 completed surveys, gathered from 278 landlines and 136 cellphones. The overall margin of error was +/- 4.8% at a 95% confidence interval. Four hypotheses were tested for each of two research questions: 1) race; 2) class (socioeconomic status, or “SES”). Indices for trust and SES were created. After controlling for SES, Whites expressed significantly more trust in mass media, local community leaders and spokespersons, and interpersonal communication than Blacks did. After controlling for race, SES was found to be negatively correlated with trust in local TV news, non-news websites, and social media sites. Tests of correlation were run on frequency of media use and trust in sources of risk messages.

This essay focuses on the effects of contemporary “modern-day slavery” discourses, strategies, and policies—which I coin the War on Trafficking—on the lived realities of African Americans. Rather than offer a solution to trafficking, this essay seeks to expand discussions of the interconnectedness of rhetoric and antiblack criminal injustice to include the War on Trafficking. It argues that the collective erasure of chattel slavery from America’s consciousness and anti-trafficking rhetoric, albeit unintentionally, work in tandem to obscure the intersecting historical and contemporary plights of African Americans in the United States and the underlying structures that enable trafficking and other systems of control and exploitation.","Race, Class, Myth, and Neoliberal Agendas",Ethnicity and Race in Communication
