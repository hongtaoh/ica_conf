2017-0000,2017,Paper Session,"Exemplar Effects on Public Opinion Perception, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions: The Moderating Role of Exemplar Involvement",1,"Citizens expressing their opinions in the news are an increasingly popular feature used in modern journalism. Often, these citizens serve as exemplars, helping to illustrate abstract or complex issues. However, citizen exemplars can differ according to their level of personal involvement in the issue they talk about. Affected exemplars have some kind of personal experience with the issue (e.g. people suffering from an illness) whereas non-affected citizens, as ordinary “men-from-the-street” do not. Hence, the current study, for the first time, examines how exemplars’ personal involvement moderates their effects on recipients’ perceptions of public opinion, personal attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Results show that exemplar involvement functions as a moderator of these effects, however, in different directions: Compared to non-affected exemplars, affected exemplars weaken effects on public opinion perceptions, but strengthen effects on people’s behavioral intentions.","Exemplars, Stereotypes, Stigmas in Media",Mass Communication
2017-0001,2017,Paper Session,Improving Attitudes Toward Stigmatized Immigrants With First-Person Narratives. Moderating and Mediating Variables,3,"We assess the mechanisms whereby first-person narratives featuring stigmatized immigrants improve outgroup attitudes and encourage intergroup contact among prejudiced individuals. We rely on a 2 (imagined contact) x 2 (similarity) experiment on a systematic sample of native British adults. We find that encouraging imagined contact prior to reading a narrative message that presents an immigrant protagonist who is similar to the recipients enhances identification with the protagonist, thereby improving outgroup attitudes and encouraging intergroup contact, and only among those who are strongly negative toward immigrants (i.e., high on modern racism). We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings for the work on imagined contact, narrative persuasion, and identification, as well as for public communication campaigns.","Exemplars, Stereotypes, Stigmas in Media",Mass Communication
2017-0002,2017,Paper Session,Intergenerational Stereotypes and Perceptions of Others’ Vulnerability to the Influence of Media,1,"Since the publication of Davison’s seminal work about the third-person effect (TPE) in 1983, scholars have been interested on people’s media perceptions and their behavioural consequences. Traditionally, research on TPE has used survey as method, and has focused on the different factors and variables that can impact on people’s perceptions about the influence of media. However, the present research uses focus group as a method to measure to what extend people perceive a different between the impact of media on oneself and on the other. We performed four focus groups with young people and four with adult people in different cities in Spain. The results show that TPE emerged spontaneously. Young people perceived adults as being more vulnerable to media effects because of their lack of knowledge, and on the contrary adult people perceived young people as being more vulnerable because of their lack of experience. The study also shows how critical perspectives about media manipulation persist across generations. Participants also propose corrective strategies to compensate the influence of media, such as guiding children in interpreting media contents.","Exemplars, Stereotypes, Stigmas in Media",Mass Communication
2017-0003,2017,Paper Session,News and Islamist Radicalization Processes: Investigating Muslims’ Perceptions of Negative News Coverage of Islam,3,"This study investigated how Muslims perceive negative news coverage of Islam and how these perceptions possibly contribute to radicalization processes. Utilizing qualitative interviews with former Islamists, Study 1 indicated that radicalized Muslims perceive a governmental infiltration of the media resulting in negative content. Analyses indicate that perceptual phenomena (hostile media, third person), negation, and anger play an important role in radicalization processes. We built on these findings in Study 2, utilizing a laboratory experiment in which Muslims were exposed to negative news content. Indeed, Muslims engaged in negation, perceived news as hostile, and perceived strong effects on non-Muslim Germans. These effects were stronger among Muslims with religious fundamentalist beliefs. Interestingly, negative news elicited anger, independent of such fundamentalist beliefs.","Exemplars, Stereotypes, Stigmas in Media",Mass Communication
2017-0004,2017,Paper Session,"Here We Listen: Positioning a Hybrid ""Listening Station"" to Circulate Marginalized Voices Across Physical and Digital Channels in a Neighborhood",3,"Listening to marginalized voices takes deliberate effort, and may demand new methods to guide technology design and neighborhood engagement. Hybrids that weave together the physical and digital are increasingly viable. Distinct ways to listen are emerging, as public spaces are increasingly filled with ""smart"" devices and wired objects. This case study advances research methods for positioning hybrid ""listening stations,"" especially when the goal is to alter the circulation of audio stories and marginalized voices. Preliminary findings support the claim that gaps in the circulation of key stories could be filled by hybrid designs that integrate physical presence with digital responsiveness – including as mobile media. Methodologically, this paper advances the study of Communication and Technology by demonstrating how communication asset mapping can help to positioning hybrid designs.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 2,Communication and Technology
2017-0005,2017,Paper Session,Harnessing Technology to Resist Surveillance: A Case Study of Low-Income Individuals in West Philadelphia,1,"Individuals in society who have been excluded or marginalized are often the first ones who are surveilled. (Ogura, 2006) Many of these individuals are racial minorities and/or are poor, whose “bad situation is defined by present neo-liberal globalization and the ‘War on Terror.’ (Ogura, 2006, p. 292) While online surveillance can affect anyone who conducts work online, “chronically underserved communities are potentially more vulnerable to the harmful effects of surveillant technologies.” (Gangadharan, 2012)

This paper explores how low-socioeconomic status (SES) individuals in West Philadelphia harness technology and other techniques to resist surveillance and protect their privacy. More specifically, this paper asks:
• How do low-socioeconomic status individuals living in West Philadelphia experience surveillance and privacy issues?
• What types of responses, both technological and non-technological, do they engage in to counter privacy and surveillance issues?

There is limited research focused on how low-socioeconomic status individuals utilize technology to avoid surveillance and protect their privacy, despite the fact that vulnerable populations are more likely to be surveilled by the state. My research questions will help to detangle the homogenous concept of privacy currently held by many in the field by examining the role information and communication technologies play in the lives of low-SES individuals in West Philadelphia. Key words associated with this research paper include surveillance, low-income, privacy, technology, and low-socioeconomic status.

I expect to find individuals ambivalent about the role of technology in their lives, in part because of technology’s dual-edged nature. I also anticipate I will find that individuals are uncertain about how to use technology to improve their privacy and evade surveillance, although some may have found creative ways of doing so.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 2,Communication and Technology

This identity comes from what viticulturists call the terroir. There is a new terroir where some, but not all, cultural, economic, and political identities of wine have taken root, this is the Domain Name Space (DNS). This research will use the .wine and .vin case-study to answer the question: How can one read the top-level domains (TLD) of .wine and .vin as cases demonstrating the role of protocological control in creating domain imperialism? Specifically, the investigation will focus on how the protocological power of the Donuts registry over the ‘.Wine’ and ‘.Vin’ top-level domains acts as an example of ‘domain imperialism.’ This type of imperialism rests upon protocological power, which has enabled those with said power, the ability to define new digital name spaces in ways that minimize the diversity of cultural spaces through a rigid hierarchical power structure.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 2,Communication and Technology
2017-0007,2017,Paper Session,Gaps and Omissions in the Study of Digital Media Use and Engagement,1,"Hundreds of studies have examined how digital media use relates to engagement in civic and political life. With such an abundance of research, it is difficult for scholars to identify areas for further study. This presentation will examine patterns in the study of digital media use and engagement in 275 manuscripts (reporting 1582 coefficients) from across the globe. The objective of the presentation is NOT to summarize the findings, but rather to identify what types of methods (measures, samples, etc.) have been used in this area of study. The presentation is designed to help identify gaps in the current state of research in this rapidly growing field of study. The presentation will be particularly useful for graduate students, early career researchers, or those scholars launching new studies in the field.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 2,Communication and Technology

Specifically, we examined the effects of member self-disclosure and team composition on team performance in crowdsourcing activities. We collected a sample of 5,082 self-organized teams in a crowdsourcing platform, Kaggle. By examining the relation between member self-disclosure, team composition, and team performance, our preliminary findings showed that 1) expertise self-disclosure and social media self-disclosure in teams positively predicted team performance in crowdsourcing activities; and 2) disparity of team member expertise negatively predicted team performance in crowdsourcing.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 2,Communication and Technology

In addition to examining whether social media participation relates to Internet skills, the paper introduces platform-specific skill measures to see how those perform in relation to more general skills. Using a unique survey data set collected in summer 2016 on a diverse group of young adults in their mid-20s, the paper shows that platform-specific skills play an important role in who is especially engaged on social network sites when it comes to diverse types of content sharing.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 2,Communication and Technology

2017-0012,2017,Paper Session,Media Agenda-Building in Health: Perceptions of Public Health Information Officers and Health Journalists,1,"The purpose of this study is two-fold. The first purpose is to investigate how public health information officers and health journalists perceive media agenda-building differently. The second is to examine how medical jargon usage in a press release can affect their media agenda-building perception and perceived credibility. An experiment with 28 pairs of public health information officers and health journalists who work with closely each other showed that both professions’ media agenda-building perception is similar, however, they wrongly estimate each other’s perception. Each of the profession also thinks that their own perception will be different from their own perception. Based on coorientation model, the results showed high agreement, low accuracy, and low congruency between public health information officers and health journalists toward media agenda-building.","Factors Influencing Health News Content, Exposure, and Effects",Health Communication
2017-0013,2017,Paper Session,Exemplar Use and the Stigmatization: Investigating National News Coverage of Depression,1,"A content analysis was conducted to examine the news coverage of clinical depression among three national gatekeeping media outlets (CNN.com, The New York Times, and The Washington Post) (N = 991) to understand how exemplar use may be associated with other communication themes typically known as contributing to stigmatization. Exemplar was found frequently used in the news reports. Particularly, the use of exemplar was associated with an increasing presence of all stereotypes, as well as biomedical and personal attributions. Stories with exemplar appeared more often in the social crime, and culture, entertainment and celebrity contexts, and less often in the healthcare, lifestyle, and science and research contexts. Implications on exemplar use in the journalistic coverage of stigmatizing health issues were discussed.","Factors Influencing Health News Content, Exposure, and Effects",Health Communication
2017-0014,2017,Paper Session,Predicting the Temporal Dynamics of Online News Popularity: The Interplay Between Social Influence and Message Features in Health News Exposure,1,"This study examined how social influence and message features jointly shape the temporal dynamics of online news popularity using time-series behavioral data of audience exposure to New York Times (NYT) health news articles and associated article content and context data. The results identified strong social influence-driven cumulative advantage effects, such that news articles which stayed longer on the list of most-viewed articles invited more frequent subsequent news selections. The results further revealed that message features modulated such effects in two ways: (a) social-influence effects operated more strongly for articles presenting efficacy information than those without such information; (b) articles conveying controversial content became popular quickly, making the most-viewed list early on in the course of news diffusion.","Factors Influencing Health News Content, Exposure, and Effects",Health Communication
2017-0015,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Online Mammography News Commentary: Comment Characteristics Shape Reader Risk Perceptions,1,"The effects of online mammography news commentary on reader risk perceptions are not well understood. In an online experiment embedded in a survey, women (N = 1,108) between the ages of 38 and 48 who had no history of breast cancer or BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions: no information control, news article only control, or one of six conditions in which participants read a news article and comments that varied on topic and inclusion of exemplars. In the full sample, presence of exemplars did not have an effect on perceived breast cancer risk, but there was evidence of a positive effect for participants with higher education, history of a prior mammogram, or family history of breast cancer. Additionally, pro-mammogram comments about mammogram-detected breast cancer led to higher perceived risk of developing breast cancer than anti-mammogram comments about false-positive mammogram results.","Factors Influencing Health News Content, Exposure, and Effects",Health Communication
2017-0016,2017,Paper Session,Health Issue Weighing on Your Mind? The Influence of Topic Salience and Visual Position on News Choice and Memory,2,"Considering the scarcity of health coverage online, this study investigates how the learned motivational relevance of a story indicated by perceived topic salience and automatic motivational relevance of a story indicated by story location on screen interact during health news processing. 210 participants navigated a news website with 8 stories – half reporting on a public health issue. The browsing pattern and recognition memory was assessed. Stories higher in perceived salience were clicked-on earlier than less salient ones. Stories placed in the top left position were remembered best followed by those in the top right, bottom left, and bottom right positions. Stories in the center were remembered better than those in periphery. Topic relevance aided encoding of stories in the periphery.","Factors Influencing Health News Content, Exposure, and Effects",Health Communication
2017-0017,2017,Paper Session,Youth Resilience to Internet Censorship in China: Circumvention Technology as the Path to Self-Actualized Citizenship,1,"Chinese government conducts the most extensive Internet censorship in the world. But there is a group of people uses circumvention technology to bypass the state surveillance. We highlight the socio-economic background, motivation, Internet regulation preference of the users. We discuss the political implications of the counter-censorship technology use in China. Based on the survey of 1175 Chinese circumvention technology users, we demonstrate a compelling case where Chinese youth are motivated to gain uncensored information and free communication. Almost all (97%) users oppose the Internet censorship imposed by the government. Users are young with a mean age of 26 years old, and the majority (78%) have a university or above degree. Users tend to live in affluent municipalities and provinces. There is a rather strong positive correlation (r=0.78, p＜0.001) between the counter-censorship technology use and economic development. The young Chinese use the counter-censorship technology primarily for the purpose of using uncensored web search, accessing social media, and reading news from foreign sources. We consider the online resilience to censorship constitutes an integral form of self-actualizing citizenship and political participation. We conclude with a discussion on how the technology empowered youth have expanded the space for deliberation in the authoritarian China. Our research represents one of the first studies on social and political implications of counter-censorship technology use.",Censorship & Self Censorship in Authoritarian and Authoritarian Leaning States,Political Communication
2017-0018,2017,Paper Session,Affect-Risk Model of Online Political Expression in Authoritarian Contexts,2,"Political and legal restraints on the uses of information and communication technologies often conflict with individuals' engagement in online political expression. Although previous research recognizes this phenomenon, existing works primarily focus on the sources, implementation and the outcomes of these restraints in authoritarian settings. We believe that an examination of citizens' experience is necessary for a better understanding of the extent to which government-led restraints succeed (or fail) to maintain control over individuals' online political activism. In this study, we investigate how citizens navigate the tension between the perceived risks of online political expression promoted by authoritarian or authoritarian-leaning governments, and the desire to express grievances openly and freely online. By applying concepts from the area of risk and decision-making research, we propose a serial mediation model to explain online political expression in authoritarian contexts. To test our framework, we use data collected from a two-wave online survey of over 900 Turkish Internet users conducted around the June 2015 parliamentary elections in Turkey. Our analyses show that individuals' feelings and resulting risk perceptions influence their perceived supply of freedom of, and engagement in, online political expression. We discuss the importance of adopting a risk framework for understanding political activism in authoritarian settings and future directions for research.",Censorship & Self Censorship in Authoritarian and Authoritarian Leaning States,Political Communication
2017-0019,2017,Paper Session,"Fear of Isolation, Willingness to Self-Censor, and Refrain From Expression on Social Media: The Moderating Role of Network Characteristics",3,"Using a two-wave survey in Hong Kong, this study examines the spiral of silence process on social media. It argues fear of isolation plays a significant role in influencing willingness to self-censor on social media, which in turn enhances refraining from expression. While willingness to self-censor mediates the relationship between fear of isolation and refraining from expression, network heterogeneity and network publicness play a moderating role between fear of isolation and willingness to self-censor. Results from the moderated mediation analysis suggest that the indirect influence of fear of isolation on refraining from expression operates through willingness to self-censor at different levels of network heterogeneity and network publicness. A higher level of network heterogeneity and publicness will enhance the spiral of silence process. In addition, findings indicate the spiral of silence refrain people from expressing disagreeing opinion, but not self-promoting political expression. Implications of the findings are discussed.",Censorship & Self Censorship in Authoritarian and Authoritarian Leaning States,Political Communication
2017-0020,2017,Paper Session,A Psychological Firewall? Risk Perceptions and Public Support for Online Censorship in Russia,3,"Authoritarian regimes commonly justify internet censorship by framing the internet as a threat to their citizens that must be tightly controlled for their own protection. This threat rhetoric underpins institutional censorship and creates a “psychological firewall” driving public support for a censored internet. Based on the risk and decision-making literature we evaluate how mass media and partisan regime support promulgate these threat perceptions, and in turn how they influence citizen attitudes about censorship. Employing Russia as a case study, we tested our hypotheses with a nationally representative survey (N=1600) conducted in May 2014. We found that reliance on Russian national TV news predicted greater internet threat perceptions, and in turn these threat perceptions significantly increased support for online political censorship. Approval of the Putin government further amplified the impact of these threat perceptions on support for censorship. Implications for understanding psychological foundations for support for censorship in authoritarian contexts are discussed.",Censorship & Self Censorship in Authoritarian and Authoritarian Leaning States,Political Communication
2017-0021,2017,Paper Session,"Media Multiplexity in Romantic Relationships: A Longitudinal Test of Relational Closeness, Relational Uncertainty, and Multimedia Communication",2,"People rely on numerous media to maintain communication with their romantic partners. This study investigates how romantic partners utilize multiple media in daily communication and the effects of using multiple media on their relationships. Guided by media multiplexity theory (MMT), relational closeness and relational uncertainty are proposed as predictors of how people use multiple media in romantic relationships. A 6-week longitudinal study tracked 151 college students’ communication across media with their romantic partner. Results suggest that relational closeness and relational uncertainty are unique predictors of how people use and disclose across multiple media. Lagged analysis found that relational closeness was not associated with any multimedia use patterns in the previous week, but variability in self-disclosure across media predicted relational uncertainty in the following week. The geographic distance of the couple moderated these effects. Results advance knowledge about the connection between relational characteristics and multimedia use, identify new ways to capture multimedia use, and computer-mediated communication (CMC).","Social Media, Interactions, and Relationships",Communication and Technology
2017-0022,2017,Paper Session,Passive Social Interaction in Social Networking Sites,3,"This study examines the prevalence of “passive social interaction” on SNS (i.e., profile browsing) and the effects of such passive interaction on information propagation between users. Data come from a study of 42 million users of the Chinese equivalent of Facebook called Renren. We analyze over 1.8 million profile browsing events collected unobtrusively from the network to understand the prevalence and nature of passive versus more active and visible forms of social interaction. Drawing upon scholarship on social capital, we then evaluate the capacity of passive social interaction to propagate information within a network and thus potentially affect social capital. Results challenge some commonly-held notions about passive consumption behavior on SNS and its capacity to increase social capital.","Social Media, Interactions, and Relationships",Communication and Technology
2017-0023,2017,Paper Session,The Effect of Interaction Topic and Social Tie on Media Choice and the Role of Four Underlying Mechanisms,5,"This study employed a scenario-based approach where participants were asked to choose which communication channel they prefer in certain situations. The first aim was to determine the effect of topic of the interaction and social tie on media choice. The second aim was to examine the underlying mechanisms (controllability, anonymity, co-presence, and affective understanding) in the relation between interaction topic and social tie and medium choice. A questionnaire was administered among 238 participants, who were presented five communication scenarios with topics of low and high intimacy and four social ties, ranging from weak to strong. Results revealed that preference for face-to-face (FtF) communication was highest, followed by audio-only computer-mediated communication (CMC) and text-based CMC. Preference for FtF communication was higher when people valued feeling co-present and decreased when people valued feeling anonymous. Our results showed that medium choice is strategic and the choice for FtF communication, audio-only and text-based CMC largely depends on controllability, anonymity and co-presence.","Social Media, Interactions, and Relationships",Communication and Technology
2017-0024,2017,Paper Session,Two Tests of Social Displacement Through Social Media Use,3,"The present manuscript presents two tests of the hypothesis that social media use decreases social interaction, leading to decreased well-being. Study One used experience sampling over five days with a combined community and undergraduate sample (N = 116). Social media use at prior times did not predict future social interaction with close others, future face-to-face interaction, or future well-being. Study Two used the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (N = 2,774) to test associations among new media adoption in 2009, new media use in 2011, social contact frequency across years, and change in well-being. Although new media adoption in 2009 predicted less social contact in 2011, increasing social media use positively predicted well-being. Neither study supported the social displacement hypothesis.","Social Media, Interactions, and Relationships",Communication and Technology
2017-0025,2017,Paper Session,"Different Audiences, Different Behaviors? How Relational Closeness to the Audience Influences Facebook Users' Opinion Expression",1,"This research examines whether and how people’s opinion expression behavior varies with the relationship to the audience they encounter via social networking technologies. While the spiral of silence theory assumes that perceiving congruence with the opinion climate increases people’s willingness to publicly voice their opinion, the theory has left open whether this mechanism works equally for every audience one could get confronted with. In a laboratory experiment (N = 119), participants were presented with one of four types of audiences on Facebook: (a) 15 close friends b) 15 acquaintances (c) 15 random strangers, or (d) a mixture of all three groups. Results showed that the relational closeness to the envisioned audience on Facebook does not directly affect people’s likelihood to express their opinion on a controversial topic. However, findings revealed that users’ certainty about the prevailing opinion distribution among the particular audience is a crucial predictor of people’s outspokenness.","Social Media, Interactions, and Relationships",Communication and Technology
2017-0026,2017,Paper Session,"Frame, Emotion, and Online Opinion: The Formation of Public Opinions in Weibo",2,"This study explores the formation of online public opinions in a disaster context in China. Based on framing theory and affective intelligence theory, the study employs a content analysis of 506 media posts and 2908 individuals’ Weibo posts to examine the online discussions of Tianjin port explosion incident. Results show that media frames keep consistent throughout different stages of the incident, while online emotions and online public opinion frames experience significant shifts with time passing by. Moreover, the effects of media frames on public opinions are moderated by public emotions. When the public are experiencing positive emotions, they are more likely to be affected by media frames; however, when people are in negative emotions, the impacts of media frames will be tempered. The results suggest that the framing effects of the media on public opinions are conditional in the online space, depending on the emotional state of the public.",Social Media in China,Communication and Technology

Through the theoretical lens of the forbidden virtual border zone, this study investigates the dynamic interaction between the state and the Internet users in the Chinese Twitter sphere. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic model to a sample of Chinese tweets that focus on the issue of censorship. We identify 5 distinctive thematic clusters characterizing this discursive space and they span across three types of activities, including sharing technical knowledge, expressing political opinions, and disseminating alternative news items. We discuss how these discussions demonstrate the empowering potential of Twitter, as well as the persistence of state power even in a digital space where it has been diluted.",Social Media in China,Communication and Technology

2017-0030,2017,Paper Session,Do the Media Fulfill Their Functions? The Mass Media’s Political and Social Functions From a Recipients’ Perspective,2,"There is currently a lively social debate about the normative functions of media and their actual achievements – due to a hostility and distrust towards the media, emerging online alternative media sources and difficult and at times entangled relationships between media and politics or media and economy. This critical discussion, espe-cially in politically uncertain times (e.g. because of the worldwide rise of populism (USA, Western Europe) and declining political stability (e.g. in the European Union), leads to the question what the media should do in and for a democratic society and how the media performance is actually rated by the audience. Until now the dis-cussion about the normative functions of the media remained on a theoretical level, empirical research about the recipients’ perceptions of the media’s functions is missing. Thus, the present study aims to examine the political and social functions of media from a recipients’ perspective. The results of an online survey in Ger-many (N=559) show that there is a significant gap between the respondents’ expectations of the media’s func-tions and the media’s actual performance. Regression models reveal that trust in the media and use of (certain alternative) media sources explain the expected and perceived functions of the media.",Rethinking Media/Communication Effects,Mass Communication

This paper provides an initial description of the multi-screening behaviors that people engage in while watching narratives, identifies several types of multi-screening that may take place while viewing a narrative, and investigates how these behaviors affect narrative engagement. Multi-screening was significantly positively associated with story world engagement. Relevant and independent multi-screening behaviors may be more strongly associated with story world engagement than irrelevant and social multi-screening behaviors. Several questions for further research into the complex ways in which multi-screening affects narrative engagement are proposed.",Rethinking Media/Communication Effects,Mass Communication
2017-0032,2017,Paper Session,Social Norms as Communicative Phenomena: A Communications Perspective on the Theory of Normative Social Behavior,2,"In this article, we apply a communications perspective on the theory of normative social behavior (TNSB). We do this a) by taking into account recent and significant changes of our (social) media environment and b) by applying the TNSB to communication behaviors, that is, to mass media and to computer-mediated communication behavior. Key result of this theoretical examination is a modeling of peer communication and peer observation in norm-building and norm-moderating processes, thus, the integration of new interpersonal exchange opportunities of normative information via mediated channels into the TNSB. Further, we provide examples for the application of the TNSB to different communication behaviors and discuss behavioral attributes on which normative social influences might depend. By theorizing on social norms as communicative phenomena, this contribution provides a fruitful basis for further research on normative social influences.",Rethinking Media/Communication Effects,Mass Communication
2017-0033,2017,Paper Session,"Teens and the ""Social Self"": Ad-Elicited Neural Activity Associated With Perceived Effectiveness and Sharing Intention",5,"This study examined the neural processes associated with exposure to effective health messages and interpersonal communication about these messages. Thirty-eight adolescent nonsmokers viewed anti-smoking ads in an fMRI scanner. We used neural data from regions in hypothesized self-relevance and social cognition networks to predict subsequent ratings of perceived effectiveness and intention to share each ad. Neural activity in the self-relevance network did not predict perceived effectiveness or intention to share. By contrast, neural activity in several regions within the social cognition network (rTPJ, lTPJ, and DMPFC) was positively associated with perceived effectiveness, and activity in rTPJ was marginally associated with intention to share ads. Our findings highlight the central role of social cognition in adolescent information processing. We discuss the possibility that the mental processes responsive to effective and shareworthy messages are divergent in adolescents relative to adults, and may reflect the developmental differences that distinguish these two populations.",Rethinking Media/Communication Effects,Mass Communication
2017-0034,2017,Paper Session,The Signal and the Choice: Agenda-Setting Effects of Traditional News Media During the Transition From Low- to High-Choice Media Environments,2,"This study analyses whether the agenda setting influence of traditional news media has become weaker over time – a key argument in the “new era of minimal effects” controversy. Following profound media environmental transformations, an increasing number of media outlets and growing opportunities for media choice, aggregate public opinion is assumed to be less responsive to the agenda of the traditional media. Despite the theoretical validity of such arguments, few attempts have been made to empirically test this hypothesis. Based on media content and public opinion data collected in Sweden over a period of 23 years (1992-2014), we analyze both aggregate and individual-level agenda setting effects on public opinion concerning 12 different political issues. Although the agenda setting impact of single nationally leading news outlets (Dagens Nyheter) appears to have weakened over time, we find no evidence that the collective media agenda (several prominent outlets) has become less influential. Taken together, citizens today appear as responsive to issue signals from the collective media agenda as during the low-choice era.",New Research on Agenda Setting and Priming,Political Communication
2017-0035,2017,Paper Session,"The Economy, the News, and the Public",2,"This paper studies the tripartite relationship between the economy, economic news and public economic perceptions. Our analysis is two-fold: We investigate the impact of the real economy on the amount of economic news in seven major Dutch newspapers (2002-2015). Second, we analyze the impact of the real economy on public economic perceptions, while taking the mediating role of economic news coverage into account. We go beyond general concepts by distinguishing between economic levels and economic change, volume and tone of coverage and people’s evaluations and expectations regarding the national state of the economy. Time-series analysis shows that negative economic conditions (both levels and changes) are positively associated with the volume of economic news, while equivalent positive conditions do not provoke any effect. The media are found to present the public with a somewhat distorted version of economic reality that affects people’s expectations above and beyond real economic conditions.",New Research on Agenda Setting and Priming,Political Communication

However, there is little empirical research about the factors that shape the public’s uptake of media frenzies. This paper examines the divergent public’s uptake of media frenzies related to two events that took place in Argentina between October 2015 and January 2016: the 2015 presidential elections and the prison escape of three felons convicted for crimes linked to drug trafficking and the political establishment. The analysis reveals that while the presidential election and its immediate aftermath captured the attention of the public to a high degree, the prison escape did not achieve a comparable effect. We draw upon these findings to elaborate on some key factors driving the public’s uptake of media frenzies, and to reflect on broader issues concerning the dynamics of attention in an age of information abundance.",New Research on Agenda Setting and Priming,Political Communication

Yet news values can produce misleading views. What consequences accrue for democratic accountability? Here, we test how public support for the president and other leaders changes when crime and other problems lose prominence in news for a sustained period. We created a novel choice-filled news environment that aggregated and coded real articles online in real-time. We then experimentally controlled news stories seen by 1,200 nationally diverse panelists for one week. We find strong causal evidence that reductions in crime news raised presidential approval. No other political figures are credited, and reducing all problems produced no further gains. These effects persist hours and days after cumulative news exposure ended but dissipate by the following week. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings for journalistic practices, presidential power, and responsible government.",New Research on Agenda Setting and Priming,Political Communication

2017-0039,2017,Paper Session,Subjectivity as a Journalistic Ideal,1,"This paper discusses different notions of subjectivity as an ideal in journalism and relates them to epistemological philosophy from Descartes to Foucault. The paper argues that subjectivity – once a dominant ideal in journalism – again is rising in significance, and that there therefore exists a need to better understand what subjectivity as an ideal is, and can be, to journalism. The paper argues for a distinction between byline subjectivity and source subjectivity and discusses four different notions of subjectivity in journalism: Moral subjectivity journalism, political subjectivity journalism, existential subjectivity journalism and fragmented subjectivity journalism. The paper concludes that subjectivity should not been considered as something that opposes and obstructs objectivity; rather it should be viewed as a necessary prerequisite for objectivity.",Reporting in a Postfactual Age: Epistemic Challenges in Journalism,Journalism Studies
2017-0040,2017,Paper Session,Scientific Evidence and Science Journalism: Analyzing the Representation of (Un)certainty in German Print and Online Media,5,"Science journalism in print and online media is an important source of information for laypersons. While science journalists established their own professional routines and standards, different actors (and scientists in particular) often criticize science journalism for not being transparent and accurate enough. One critical point raised concerns journalists’ representation of scientific evidence. Against this background, the present study investigated which kind of information about scientific evidence is represented in science articles in German print and online media. The results of a quantitative content analysis (n = 128), in which variables were coded for the represented scientific results (n = 225), showed that scientific evidence is rarely part of science articles and scientific findings are predominantly depicted as scientifically certain. However, information about uncertainty is more common within explicit science sections of the media, as well as when the article is of natural scientific or medical scientific content. In addition, the scientific results that are presented first in an article contain most information about scientific evidence.",Reporting in a Postfactual Age: Epistemic Challenges in Journalism,Journalism Studies

Looking at climate change, do we observe the contours of post-normal journalism? This conceptual paper addresses this question based on a review of the concept of post-normal science and on the current literature on changes in climate journalism. We argue that we witness the emergence of post-normal journalism that is fundamentally interpretive and is characterized by the blurring of institutional boundaries between journalism, science and advocacy. The effects for the sustainability of the debate are ambiguous. Conscious bridge-building efforts will be necessary on the part of journalists, re-focusing the debate away from contrarian voices who deny the existence of anthropogenic climate change.",Reporting in a Postfactual Age: Epistemic Challenges in Journalism,Journalism Studies

Research has focused on the ways in which women include mHealth in their lives and if the behavior changes advocated by health apps align with current behavior change theories. Recently, researchers have begun questioning the behaviors and knowledges that are prioritized through mHealth design. This study contributes to this conversation by using a technofeminist perspective to decode the politics of dominant discourses about women’s health empowerment by examining women’s health apps as a cultural node through which these discourses circulate. Results show that the healthy female body promoted by women’s health apps can be understood through two primary archetypes. 1. Barbie with booty and 2. Earth goddess. Together, these archetypes show that white, skinny, young and fertile female bodies are the standards for health. Women are encouraged to achieve these bodies through practices of self-surveillance, disclosure and self-advocacy, which are encouraged and normalized through routine use of women’s health apps. Thus, the analysis reveals that postfeminist ideas of health empowerment have displaced technofeminist perspectives in area of health apps.","It's All About the ""Right"" Body: Communication and Media Use Concerning Health and Body Care",Feminist Scholarship
2017-0043,2017,Paper Session,"An analysis of Iowa Community Leaders’ Discourse, Governmentality, and the Battleground for the Childbearing Teen Body",3,"The contemporary state of teen childbearing in Iowa is positioned by community leaders as a discursive battleground for intervention. In focus groups of community stakeholders from a variety of Iowa’s industry sectors, the discourse surrounding the childbearing teen body is framed as a public health “problem” due to absent-minded or led astray teens and, thus, in need of organizational intervention. Utilizing Foucault’s (1980) framework of governmentality, this study draws out the role of self-sufficiency in grooming teens to self-govern and how community stakeholders see themselves as interventionists while at times struggling with cultural and religious practices, such as Hispanic Catholics, in Iowa’s most diverse towns. Yet, the interventionist discourse does much more than attempt to prevent early pregnancy: it delineates acceptable and unacceptable pregnant bodies, sustains a heterosexual hegemony, and hails individuals and organizations to govern childbearing teen bodies in specific ways.","It's All About the ""Right"" Body: Communication and Media Use Concerning Health and Body Care",Feminist Scholarship

Through audience research on Korean reality shows about body/beauty, Get It Beauty and The Body Show, we attempt to understand how the discourses of body care work at the individual level. Our interviewees’ feelings of being stressed, burdened, and annoyed about the discourses in the shows signify their (un)conscious acknowledgment of the false promises of the self-care rhetoric. However, the discourses of willpower and the embedded voyeuristic pleasure of watching the shows make it difficult to place such feelings in the public domain. We conclude that individuals’ feelings lose their potential for resistance when “feeling bad” is discounted as personal, while a feeling of individual achievement is excessively celebrated.","It's All About the ""Right"" Body: Communication and Media Use Concerning Health and Body Care",Feminist Scholarship
2017-0046,2017,Paper Session,Why the Feminine? A Framing Analysis of the Iranian News Reporting on the Fight Against Heterosexual HIV/AIDS Transmission,1,"This paper examined the framing of the Heterosexual HIV/AIDS Transmission in the Iranian news media to examine the relationship between heterosexual HIV transmission and portrayal of Iranian women with HIV in the context of the UNAIDS’ global call for the fight against heterosexual HIV transmission. The implications of such framing in the Iranian news was further put into analysis against the inherently liberal feminist backdrop of UNAIDS global strategy to eradicate sexual stigma and empower women sex workers. Historically, scientific reporting of HIV/AIDS is associated to victimization of people living with HIV. Framing analysis of the heterosexual HIV/AIDS transmission in three online national newspapers supports this finding and shows how the local news messages contests UNAIDS’ global message by further stigmatizing women and framing them as a social group responsible in the transmission of HIV to the young male population. This finding contradicts with a liberal feminist interpretation of social contract theory which emphasizes on the role of government in the empowerment as well as the active role of women living with HIV/AIDS in taking control of their lives. The implications of this study for the implementation of global scale public health interventions at the local level are further discussed.","It's All About the ""Right"" Body: Communication and Media Use Concerning Health and Body Care",Feminist Scholarship

Physicians are often reluctant to initiate discussions on CAM approaches with their patients even as research has shown that provider discussions in other realms are influential in shaping patients’ decisions (Olufowote, 2010). This study employs a poststructuralist feminist perspective to privilege alternative modes of performing subjectivities by patients employment of CAM approaches in their care and thus to open ways of reconfiguring power relations situated within the clinical encounter (Butler, 1993; Dutta-Bergman, 2004) and asks: How do CAM patients’ approach CAM perceptions in the self-management of their health conditions to understand how CAM supports their healing? Emerging findings from partial coding and analyses of part of the semi-structured interview data (N=13) supplemented with in-person observations of CAM provider-patient interactions and video recordings are presented.","It's All About the ""Right"" Body: Communication and Media Use Concerning Health and Body Care",Feminist Scholarship

This theoretical paper outlined a feminist epistemological approach for evaluating communicative interventions. Inspired by the feminist works that problematized essentialism, the paper argues that current communication research on health issues focuses heavily on the effectiveness of health promotion; such preoccupation may result in essentialist thinking and narrowing research inquiries. To fill in the gap, the paper advocates researchers to adopt a more socio-cultural perspective that pays attention to the contextual reasons that shape the formations of health perceptions and practices. The paper also prompts researchers to take advantage of new media to gather more organic, layperson discourse to battle essentialist assumptions. Citing substantial feminist works, the paper speaks to the collective academic effort for interdisciplinary research.","It's All About the ""Right"" Body: Communication and Media Use Concerning Health and Body Care",Feminist Scholarship

Some of this material has influenced public relations scholarship. However, critical evaluation reveals profound confusion and interchangeability between these concepts.
This paper explores the convergent and divergent uses of these terms and introduces literature from wider fields, such as professional development and human development, which also deploy competency and capability frameworks. The literature from human development represents an intervention in that it emerges from philosophical and economic approaches to well-being rather than organisational advantage. The paper takes a critical approach and is conceptual.
The implications for theory include moving away from the instrumentalism of previous applications toward a more humanistic and holistic understanding of professional capability in public relations, and by inference, professions generally.
The implications for practice include more culturally sensitive capabilities frameworks, reflecting variations in professional priorities both within and across national borders.",Public Relations Theory Interventions,Public Relations

A Quantitative Review of Three Decades of Public Relations Research,2,"The work of Jürgen Habermas has been frequently cited in public relations research. Still, it has been maintained that only bits and pieces of his extensive work have been applied. This study investigates the influence of Habermas’ in the public relations body of knowledge through a systematic quantitative review of research publications between the 1980s and today. The analysis of 263 research articles shows that the use of Habermas has grown considerably. Most importantly, however, we find scant references to more recent work of Habermas. This is crucial for two reasons. First, it indicates that analytical potential remains unused, specifically with regard to issues of public deliberation and legitimacy in public relations. Second, because over the years Habermas has consistently revisited and reworked his concepts. The lack of references to the newer publications suggests that public relations scholars are missing out on crucial turns in the theory.",Public Relations Theory Interventions,Public Relations

Based on a survey of public relations practitioners in Singapore, this study found that four environmental variables—perceptions of the degree of democracy, level of economic development, level of economic freedom, and level of media freedom—are significantly related to public relations practitioners’ orientation toward relationship management as a conceptual locus for public relations theory and practice. However, findings suggest that not all environmental variables are equally important.

Recognizing the importance of advancing relationship management theory and existing gaps in the current literature, this essay proposes a Social Capital Model of Relationship Process that accounts for how relationship cultivation strategies affect both relationship quality and relationship structure. The model brings together insights from the relationship management theory and social network research. Further, the essay draws upon the concept of social capital to connect these two bodies of literature. The model suggests that social capital is a type of relationship outcome that includes both relationship quality and relationship structure aspects. As organizations deploy different relationship cultivation strategies, they may contribute social capital to local communities and the broader society.

While the sudden popularity of It Gets Better presented a unique moment for LGBT politics in the digital age, this paper argues that the roots of the campaign can indeed be traced to long-held practices in LGBT media histories and video activism. Investigating the antecedents of this type of participatory action before social media also reveals the evolution of the ideologies and rhetoric of LGBT movements from collective action frames to more personal and diffused connection action. Studying these changes informs the emergence of widespread LGBT discourse and video practices online throughout the past twenty years.",Digital Media Practices and Consequences,Popular Communication
2017-0056,2017,Paper Session,"Lurkers, Posters, and the Fantasy of Persuasion",1,"This chapter revolves around political discussions in forum discussion threads on the Swedish online LGBTQ community Qruiser. Political discussions in online forum threads are studied as cultural participation in an online cultural public sphere. The specific question the paper seeks to answer is what role lurkers play for active participants’ meaning-making practices. Lurkers could be understood as a fantasy, an imagined audience willing to listen and be persuaded by active participants’ arguments. However, applying a Lacan inspired analytical framework, the paper concludes that the fantasy is not so much about the lurkers themselves, but the belief in persuasion. Hence, the answer to the question of why users participate in verbal battles with each other online would be because they are driven by a fantasy of persuasion as a way to cope with the lack of enjoyment in terms of them being split from a harmonious world of political unity.",Digital Media Practices and Consequences,Popular Communication

While these expressions may potentially constitute a form of collective power, so far they have not been subjected to systematic examination. A grounded analysis of 270 Weibo posts that relate to nine prevalent subversive keywords aims at shedding light on the alternative symbolic map such expressions facilitate. Results show that popular subversive expressions tend to describe social groups, rather than other entities. Microblogers appear to identify with the groups that are least governmental, while clearly dissociating themselves from those connected to the regime. At the very same time, the expressions reveal a set of contradictory values, shedding light on the paradoxes facing Chinese society and ‘the Chinese Dream.’",Digital Media Practices and Consequences,Popular Communication
2017-0058,2017,Paper Session,Entrepreneurship as Practice of Resilience: Women Entrepreneurs’ Communicative Design of Resilient Careers,1,"This study investigates how women entrepreneurs from China, Denmark, and the United States (n=40) constitute resilient careers to deal with challenges, setbacks, and changes in their start-up experiences. Conceptualizing everyday accomplishment of entrepreneurship as practice of resilience, women entrepreneurs derived a set of design principles to create the “new normal” of entrepreneurial careers: (a) “be enthusiastic but not too passionate”; (b) “go with the flow to gain control”; (c) “actively make mistakes for improvement”; and (d) “construct meaningfulness by invoking identities.” Women’s communicative constitutions of resilience not only offer strength and purpose in times of difficulty but also enable women to transform the inherent career paradoxes of passion, control, change, and identity on a daily basis. Introducing the communicative career design framework, this paper extends existing understandings of everyday resilient processes, alternative organizing logics, and career paradoxes in the entrepreneurial contexts.",Identity and Gender in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

However, larger social changes in what is constructed as ""normal"" sexuality is not necessarily reflected immediately across social institutions. Historically, workplaces strictly regulate conversations and behaviors related to sex and sexuality through policy and practice. Given the sweeping social change in how sexual identities are constructed, employees, regardless of sexual identities, must navigate new and shifting terrain of organizing around a fluid sexual “norm.” This paper introduces the concept of co-sexuality, or the communicative process of organizing around “normal” sexuality. We specifically explore how employees engage in silencing practices to push toward or pull away from the normalized sexual center within a highly regulated environment and discuss the cycle of sexual silence.",Identity and Gender in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

I propose that otherwise publicly identifiable companies involved in oil and gas drilling can be classified as what Scott (2013) refers to as shaded organizations. Shaded practices lead to some aspects of the organization being made public while others are not, thereby producing tensions that workers must negotiate. Through the lens of dirty work, I argue that the secretive operations for which the drilling industry has come to be known, such as regulatory exemptions, non-disclosure agreements, and the suppression of community and journalistic voices, create stigma that organizational members associated with the industry must manage in their everyday work practices.

However, recent support from fat activists coupled with empirical studies from researchers, have contributed to the resurge of the fat acceptance movement and emergence of the body positive movement, reframing how individuals identify with being fat, and how organizations see themselves fitting into the larger societal narrative (Dickins, Thomas, King, Lewis, & Holland, 2011). The following study utilized grounded theory to examine and identify tensions of identification among attendees and organizational members who participated in the fat positive event, Full Figured Fashion Week. 29 hours of participant observations were conducted over the course of two years. Results from a thematic analysis indicated identity and organizational tensions regarding inclusive versus exclusive organizational decision making and approving versus disapproving fat talk that exist within a larger dialectic of control versus resistance to conventional fashion industry norms.",Identity and Gender in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

A quasi experiment (N = 461) was conducted with a 2 (narrative perspective: first-person vs. third-person) X 2 (framing: gain vs. loss) design among smokers at the pre-contemplation and contemplation/preparation stages. Smokers were more likely to produce reactance and negative cognitive responses when exposed to a loss-framed (vs. a gain-framed) third-person narrative; the reverse was found when smokers read a first-person narrative. For smokers in the pre-contemplation stage, a loss-framed first-person narrative induced significantly higher self-referencing and quit intentions compared to a gain-framed first-person narrative. On the other hand, a gain-framed (vs. a loss-framed) first-person narrative enhanced self-referencing, which in turn led to greater quit intentions among smokers in the contemplation and preparation stages. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",Features That Shape Exposure and Effects of Smoking-Related Messages,Health Communication

One of the easiest and most widely used tactics of tailored communication is using an exemplar character similar to the target audience. However, the effect of character-audience similarity may significantly differ depending on other message features. An experiment found a consistently negative and significant two-way interaction effect between character-audience similarity and message theme: Seeing a similar smoker character harming his/her own health increased engagement with the message and identification with the character, which in turn was associated with greater perceived effectiveness. However, seeing a similar smoker character endangering innocent others via secondhand smoking caused a boomerang effect on message effectiveness.",Features That Shape Exposure and Effects of Smoking-Related Messages,Health Communication

Based on Construal Level Theory (CLT), a causal model delineating the relationships among four variables—perceived temporal distance, personal relevance, perceived susceptibility, and behavioral intention—was proposed. The model was validated by an online experiment with a sample of 222 current smokers, revealing the effects of perceived temporal distance on behavioral intention via personal relevance and perceived susceptibility. Following the CLT-grounded model, the effects of different temporal frames (near-future vs. distant-future) on the four variables were tested. The near-future frame featured a risk perceived to be more temporally proximal (i.e., heart attack), and the distant-future frame featured a risk perceived to be more temporally distant (i.e., larynx cancer) among current smokers. Participants exposed to the near-future frame reported significantly shorter perceived temporal distance, greater personal relevance and perceived susceptibility to the risk portrayed in the message, and greater intention to quit smoking than participants exposed to the distant-future frame. Implications for anti-smoking communications are discussed.",Features That Shape Exposure and Effects of Smoking-Related Messages,Health Communication

We conducted a selective exposure experiment with a national sample of youths (ages 15-21 years; N = 614) to address this question. In a 10-minute browsing session, participants were given a set of 16 videos (8 smoking and 8 non-smoking) and were asked to view video(s) of their choice. Browsing was unobtrusively logged. Behavioral data revealed that youth with higher interest in smoking were more likely to select pro-smoking videos more often and spend more time watching them compared to youth with lower interest. View count was manipulated such that smoking videos either had high or low views. This did not affect selection patterns. Exposure to high view count smoking videos was associated with more positive attitudes toward smoking.

Although literature explores disclosure processes, much of it focuses on the discloser. This manuscript focuses on the inherently dyadic nature of disclosure processes by utilizing an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) to predict interaction effectiveness in mental illness diagnosis disclosures. In doing so, we incorporate the unique perspectives of both the discloser and recipient, as well as possible interactions between the two. Participants were 51 college-student friend dyads (N= 102) from a Midwestern university in which one individual had disclosed their mental illness to a friend. We test a series of APIM analyses with closeness, dimensions of recipient response, and interaction effectiveness. Findings suggest that closeness positively predicts support and negatively predicts topic avoidance. Furthermore, supportive response promotes evaluations of increased interaction effectiveness while reports of topic avoidance are associated with decreased interaction effectiveness.",Interpersonally Communicating About Mental Health,Interpersonal Communication

Individual, semi-structured interviews with 24 young adults revealed that families, mainly parents, tell stories about the MIs of individual family members and these stories reflected four themes: struggle, communicated perspective-taking (CPT), resilience, and caution. In addition, young adults learned several important lessons from these MI narratives (i.e., awareness, communicated perspective-taking). Findings illuminate the ways family narratives about MI shape younger members’ expectations for managing these illnesses and in some instances, reinforce the stigma surrounding MI.",Interpersonally Communicating About Mental Health,Interpersonal Communication
2017-0070,2017,Paper Session,"Stress, Stigma, and Willingness to Communicate",1,"Disclosing about stressful and traumatic experiences, such as stigmatized topics, can lead to more positive health outcomes for people (Chang & Bazarova, 2015; Pennebaker & O’Heeron, 1984; Pennebaker & Susman, 1984; Rains, 2014). Similarly, being willing to communicate about stigma helps to fight the cycle of silence surround stigmatized topics (Gelb & Corrigan, 2008; Meisenbach, 2010). Therefore, it is important to determine when and if people are willing to communicate about stigmatized topics, like stress, in order to inform future health and stigma communication interventions. A theoretical model is proposed to examine the relationships between stigma, stress, and willingness to communicate in the context of talking about stress to a mental health professional. A cross sectional survey was conducted with college students to test the model. Results indicate that this model may be a viable way to look at willingness to communicate. Findings and implications are discussed.",Interpersonally Communicating About Mental Health,Interpersonal Communication

With this in mind, the current study examined intergenerational transmissions of taking conflict personally from 110 (N = 330) child-mother-father triads. Results revealed significant associations between mother and child reports of persecuted feelings, positive relational effect, and negative relational effect. Conversely, there were significant associations between father and child reports of persecuted feelings and stress reactions. Results also showed significant indirect effects from parent-child taking conflict personally (TCP) transmissions and child reports of verbal aggression, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Overall, this study demonstrates that children model different aspects of TCP from each parent. Moreover, this research demonstrates that TCP is associated increased presence of mental health problems in adult children.",Interpersonally Communicating About Mental Health,Interpersonal Communication
2017-0077,2017,Paper Session,A Cross-Country Analysis of Consumer Online Badmouthing,2,"Voicing negative comments about companies and brands via social media is a worldwide phenomenon. This research identifies two types of individuals that share their unfavorable thoughts publicly on the internet (complainers vs. brand assailants) and demonstrates that both groups are driven by a distinct set of personal and collective goals, but also other background conditions. Multi-country research data obtained from an online survey (n = 812) provides evidence for the existence and stable characteristics of these two groups but also point to some significant cross-country differences. Amongst other insights, results indicate that the novel typology and the role of consumer nationality both help to better predict individual reactions to online service recovery attempts (i.e., webcare), such as post-complaint satisfaction, brand attitude and loyalty. In addition, this paper provides a rich description of the circumstances and patterns of online badmouthing.","From Social Media to Traditional Media: Badmouthing, Selfie, Foreign TV, and Burkini",Intercultural Communication

By reinvestigating this issue, this study further explores whether “hasty” discussion moderates the relationship from a cross-cultural perspective by comparing South Korea with the United States. The authors posit that hasty discussion—a term that was coined to explain South Korean’s fast lifestyle as reflected in discussion processes—is a South Korean characteristic that can have deleterious effects on deliberative democracy. Nine hundred and sixty survey participants (480 South Koreans, 480 Americans) showed meaningful results: 1) Hasty discussion comprises two factors (ignoring discussion processes and pursuing discussion efficiency). 2) Americans are exposed to more cross-cutting opinions than South Koreans, but the positive relationship between cross-cutting exposure and tolerance is more significant in the South Korean sample. 3) In the South Korean sample, ignoring discussion processes negatively affected tolerance. 4) An interaction effect of ignoring discussion processes and cross-cutting exposure on tolerance was found among South Koreans. That is, ignoring the discussion process lowered tolerance.","From Social Media to Traditional Media: Badmouthing, Selfie, Foreign TV, and Burkini",Intercultural Communication
2017-0079,2017,Paper Session,Inside Out: An Examination of the Role of Cultural Characteristics in Selfie Usage,2,"Despite of increased prevalence of selfies in social media, little is known about individuals’ selfie usage on social media. Although there are different aspects of behaviors regarding selfies among different individuals, little is known about the relationship between individuals’ cultural backgrounds and their selfie practice.
This study explored the relationship between individuals’ cultural characteristics and selfie practices, including posting and editing selfies on Instagram. This study investigated selfie users on Instagram using an online survey via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Selfie users in the U.S (N=354) and India (N=396) were examined to explore cultural difference in selfie usages.
Most previous cross-cultural studies assumed that nationality defines one’s cultural characteristics. However, through measuring personal traits of independent and interdependent self-construal, this study explored the relationship between cultural characteristics and selfie practice at both individual and country level. Implications for the relationship are discussed.","From Social Media to Traditional Media: Badmouthing, Selfie, Foreign TV, and Burkini",Intercultural Communication

While these sites have brought people from all over the world into contact, they have also increased the risk of misunderstandings due to cultural norms. This study examined the differences between US and Chinese students to better understand how culture translates into a digital space. It found evidence that suggests cultural norms are impacting the motivations and behaviors associated with SNS use. While exploring cultural differences, this study also provided additional literature to support the integration of the active-audience and structural paradigms of media research. By using the Active within Structures conceptualization of Cooper and Tang (2009), further empirical evidence supporting a consolidation of these theories was provided. Findings suggest that elements of culture, individual factors and external structures all play a role in SNS use.","From Social Media to Traditional Media: Badmouthing, Selfie, Foreign TV, and Burkini",Intercultural Communication
2017-0081,2017,Paper Session,In Search for Missing Link in the Studies on Foreign TV programs Flow,1,"The purpose of this paper lies in showing in-text level cultural similarity and dissimilarity embedded in foreign television programs. Although the theories of cultural proximity and audience studies have been examined cultural flows of foreign television programs, in-text comparison of the domestic program with the foreign program is rare. By conducting comparison, the paper attempts to fill the gap of micro-macro links on consumption of foreign television programs. We have selected one Korean and one Japanese soap opera as a case study. Our analysis result confirms our prediction that both of cultural similarity and dissimilarity exist in a text level and we argue that in-text analysis can link the missing link of the two theories.","From Social Media to Traditional Media: Badmouthing, Selfie, Foreign TV, and Burkini",Intercultural Communication

Debates touched upon issues related to secularism, identity, religion, and freedom. The present article examines discourses about the burkini ban in newspapers from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Exploring foreign perspectives on the burkini ban enabled to investigate which representations were brought forth to discuss the situation in France. Using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) in order to explore data (N= 167) in depth, this study examined which categories were evoked in newspaper articles to represent the situation in France. Findings indicate subtle shifts between old and refined categories that suggest punctual and progressive reconstruction of commonalities and differences.","From Social Media to Traditional Media: Badmouthing, Selfie, Foreign TV, and Burkini",Intercultural Communication

Besides, though the social media offer consumers an equal access to participate in eWOM communication, people with higher opinion leadership can make better use of ICTs, they showed stronger trust on eWOM information, more willing to seek for and contribute eWOM content, and gratifying more from participating in eWOM activities at social media.","Social Media, Marketing, and Consumer Studies",Communication and Technology
2017-0084,2017,Paper Session,Differences in Characteristics and Perception of Sponsored vs. Organic Reviews,2,"Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has become a critical element of two-way communication between consumers and companies. Online consumer reviews (OCRs), a particular form of eWOM discussing post-consumption experiences, may be influential when they are believed to be unbiased. However, marketers are increasingly incentivizing consumers to write reviews, which can mislead consumers because it is difficult to discern the difference between the two when they are displayed together. In response to this situation, regulators have introduced policies requiring disclosures of such incentives. This study is one of the early studies that examine the differences between sponsored and organic product reviews. By using a secondary analysis of online reviews data, this study found the differences between sponsored and organic reviews in terms of review length, review extremity, detailedness and perceived level of helpfulness. This paper provides theoretical implications on motivation, reciprocity, persuasion knowledge literature as well as practical implications for OCR platform management.","Social Media, Marketing, and Consumer Studies",Communication and Technology

This study took a webometric approach to collect social data and used a generalized estimating equation model for longitudinal data. Correlation analysis, longitudinal panel analysis, and regression analysis were conducted. The hit count estimates of search engines and social media correlated with the number of offline visits, and offline visits somewhat correlated with the frequency of post-visit photo-sharing. The increase in the number of search results of search engine and Facebook postings affected the number of offline visits to tourist sites. Offline visits and social media postings influenced photo-sharing behaviours. We investigated the structure of the destination network.","Social Media, Marketing, and Consumer Studies",Communication and Technology

Three studies investigated which type of post content triggers more envy and its underlying mechanism from both reader’s and poster’s perspectives. Readers reported a higher degree of envy after seeing other’s experiential purchases than material purchases, and it is mainly because experiential purchases were more self-relevant than material purchases to them; However, from a poster’s perspective, people thought posts about material purchases would trigger more envy than experiential purchases. Partially due to this wrong estimation and a tendency to avoid other’s envy, experiential purchases were more frequently posted than material purchases. This paper provided insight into when and why browsing social network sites leads to envy, and contributed to the literature on experiential vs. material purchases and the emotion of envy.","Social Media, Marketing, and Consumer Studies",Communication and Technology

We explore this possibility here, focusing on the tone of both newspaper and Twitter content following changes in the US unemployment rate, from 2008 to 2014. Results strongly support the expectation that while the tone of newspaper content exhibits stronger reactions to negative information, the tone of Twitter content reacts more strongly to positive economic shifts.","Norms, Values, Biases in News Coverage",Mass Communication

The Uses and Effects of “Radical Islam” and its Function as a Proxy Term for Terrorism,2,"The debate over the term “radical Islam” as a proxy term for terrorism has become fierce in American politics in recent years. Some believe “radical Islam” stands as a specific movement in opposition to “the West,” while others resist monolithic understandings that paint Muslims with a broad brush. This study examines how the news media have used the term “radical Islam” as a framing device and how it influences news audiences. A content analysis revealed that “radical Islam” is a recent addition to the public lexicon and is rapidly rising in use. The term is more recently associated with negatively charged emotions and also linked to terrorism. An experiment found that reading about a perpetrator associated with “radical Islam” (as opposed to “terrorism”) led to an increase in Islamophobia – indicated through fear of Muslims and Islam. However, conservatives did not differentiate between “radical Islam” and “terrorism,” but liberals did.","Norms, Values, Biases in News Coverage",Mass Communication
2017-0089,2017,Paper Session,The World at War: Three and a Half Decades of New York Times Conflict Coverage,3,"This quantitative content analysis uses 36 years of New York Times international news to understand how conflict coverage functions in terms of quantity and geographic focus, whether conflict is covered because of a linkage of the conflict to U.S. interests, and, whether the Times relies on its own correspondents for first-hand coverage. Additionally, a contemporary history approach was used to gauge how representative coverage is of conflicts in varying regions. Data reveal an imbalance in coverage; stories about low-income nations focused more on conflict and were more likely to link the event to U.S interests. However, despite the high focus on conflict in low-income nations, coverage of these countries was minimal and often overlooked the most severe crises. According to social construction of reality theorists, this inequity can lead to audience perception that more conflict occurs in low-income nations than in other, more developed parts of the world.","Norms, Values, Biases in News Coverage",Mass Communication
2017-0090,2017,Paper Session,Video Killed the Copy Editor? Comparing Multimodal Framing Effects in News Videos and Articles,4,"Current technology allows videos shot at the scene of far-flung news events to be instantly beamed across the world, making it easier for audiences to experience the visceral reality of stories than ever before. But do vivid news videos have a meaningful impact on citizens’ political opinions and behaviours compared to news articles that use text and images? In an experiment we used carefully matched videos and articles depicting counter-frames from the European refugee crisis to compare the relative power of medium on framing effects. Counter to expectations, results show that articles produced stronger effects on intentions to help refugees than videos, and this was mediated by the depth to which the news story was processed. Moreover, the effect of the verbal frame was especially strong in article form compared to video form. These findings provide clear insights for journalism practice and multimodal framing theory by showing that, despite their increasing prominence, news videos do not deliver more powerful effects than news articles.","Norms, Values, Biases in News Coverage",Mass Communication

2017-0092,2017,Paper Session,Examining the Role of Perceived Norm Conflict in Tobacco Use,3,"One unaddressed question of current theories of norms is whether perceived norm conflict operates in behavior change. Building on recent work that examines the role of norm-conflict in the attitude-behavior link, we measured US young adults’ perceived descriptive norm conflict—defined as the perception that their social referents engage in opposite behaviors—and assessed whether perceived norm conflict, measured from both offline and online social groups, is correlated with their intentions to smoke or use tobacco in the next 3 months. We found cross-sectional evidence that people’s perception that their social referents engaging in opposite behaviors based on their online interactions was associated with higher intentions to use tobacco, over and above the role of perceived norms. This research builds on existing theories on the influence of social norms on behavior and represents a first step toward understanding the unique role of norm conflict in influencing health behaviors.",Health Communication in the Context of Tobacco (High-Density),Health Communication

We conducted a systematic literature review, pre-tested survey measures of tobacco norm conflict, and surveyed 616 young adults aged 18-25 from an opt-in online panel. Young adults reported encountering tobacco norm conflict during their routine use of social media. Tobacco norm conflict was not previously described. We found that measures that asked respondents directly about their exposure to tobacco norm conflict performed better than indirect measures in terms of being associated with nomological criterion variables including recall of contradictory information about smoking and frequency of social media usage. However, direct measures posed more respondent burden based on qualitative feedback. Further research is needed to refine measures of norm conflict exposure and determine the predictive validity of these measures on tobacco use behaviors.",Health Communication in the Context of Tobacco (High-Density),Health Communication

Using quasi-experimental data, this study examines the potential influence of exposure to GHWs on support for GHW-related and other tobacco control policies among smokers and nonsmokers (N=183) from low socioeconomic position.
There was a significant increase in support for tobacco control policies after exposure to GHWs, irrespective of smoking status. Additionally, the majority indicated after exposure that they would support or strongly support GHW-related policies. In pre- and posttest most participants supported banning smoking in cars with children, with no differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Yet, smokers were less likely to support smoking bans in public places (p<.01).
The findings suggest that GHWs are not only a promising point-of-sale communication strategy for modifying individual behavior but also for increasing public support for tobacco control in general.",Health Communication in the Context of Tobacco (High-Density),Health Communication
2017-0095,2017,Paper Session,Examining the Potential for Narratives to Correct Misinformation About Natural Tobacco: A Test of Emotional Flow,3,"Studies have demonstrated that correcting misinformation by simply providing accurate information does not eliminate its persistent effects on attitudes, a phenomenon referred to as belief echoes and affective perseverance. As a result, researchers have suggested the use of enhanced correctives. Engaging corrective narratives can invoke emotions in a dynamic way, shifting the reader from the misleading emotion to another emotion. We propose that corrective narratives with dynamic emotional changes may be able to dislodge belief echoes through cognitive and affective routes. The proposed experiment exposes readers to a dramatic story about characters discussing the misleading misinformation that natural cigarettes are healthier than regular cigarettes. The protagonist later learns that the hope engendered by natural and organic tobaccos is misleading. Readers are randomly assigned to read one of six endings to the story, four of which end using an emotional corrective (fear, anger, sadness, or happiness), one serves as a control and provides a simple (non-emotional) corrective, and another control presents only the hope-driven misinformation, without any correctives.",Health Communication in the Context of Tobacco (High-Density),Health Communication

Research on communication inequalities indicates that communication can be an important contributor to health disparities. We use data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study, to examine (1) patterns of exposure to different forms of tobacco marketing, (2) receptivity to tobacco marketing, and (3) self-reported impact of tobacco marketing across racial and socioeconomic groups. To address these aims, we analyze data on reported exposure to tobacco marketing from the PATH Wave 1 youth survey.

The relational framing theory was used as a lens for studying how message framing may influence social media audience engagement. Specifically, posts from Tobacco Free Florida’s Facebook page were assessed for framing as either dominant-submissive or affiliate-disaffiliate and the extent to which a direct call for engagement was used for engagement with implied audiences of smokers, non-smokers, active quitters, or a mixed audience. A three-way interaction for the level of engagement through comments was significant, F(3,217)=7.11, p<.001, ηp^2=.09, and showed that framing, a call for engagement, and varying implied audience choice played a role in audience engagement with tobacco prevention posts.

Effects of these new possibilities on the public are not well researched yet. This abstract outlines a study that examined how Instagram users build up parasocial interactions (PSI) towards athletes that present themselves on Instagram. The study examines the effect of perceived addressing and attractiveness and additionally considers Instagram usage habits and the general interest in sports. An online experiment with a total of 261 participants was conducted to test the hypotheses. Neither the frequency of Instagram use nor the users‘ affinity with the medium Instagram were found to influence PSI with an athlete. PSI were significantly influenced by addressing and perceived attractiveness of the athlete. All effects are moderated by the users’ general interest in sports: The less an Instagram user is interested in sports, the stronger are the effects.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks I,Information Systems

Recent studies demonstrated that specific psychological mechanisms shape the influence of Facebook on mood. The present study argues that the number of friends might contribute to a positive affect after exposure to a SNS through perceived belongingness to online friends and the engagement in social comparisons. An online survey posted on Facebook newsfeeds (N = 111) revealed that the effect of amount of friends on positive affect was completely mediated by the engagement in downward social comparisons. Further, more online friends were associated with a higher perceived belongingness.

While prior studies either employed network analyses or surveys to identify opinion leaders, the present investigation combines these two approaches to address the relationship between “actual” and self-perceived influence. For this purpose, retweet networks of Twitter communication on the Brexit debate were analyzed in relation to a survey on motives and personality traits that was filled out by active users (N = 100). Results showed no significant correlation between self-perceived opinion leadership and eigenvector centrality (as an objective measure).

To advance our understanding on the flow of information in the hashtag network, a social network analysis was conducted, using a large-scale Twitter data (n = 21,870). Results showed that neither influentials nor interpersonal hypothesis accounted for the pattern of information flow of the network since the leading actors were active “recipients” of information rather than “intermediaries.” Moreover, the leading actors commonly played three roles (i.e., conversation starters, influencers, active engagers) and three attributes (i.e., the number of follows, followers, tweets) of the key actors were associated with their leading status in the network.

Data come from a content analysis of newspapers and television and two additional waves of a representative panel survey study before and after the referendum. Waves from 2014 showed that the news about Ukraine evoked inconsistent political opinions, e.g. against labour immigrants from Ukraine, but in favour of a strong EU response against Russia. News about the Ukraine in self-selected media influenced perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of the treaty.

This six-phase content analysis charts major shifts in the scale of coverage over this period that cannot be explained by reference to external factors alone, such as increases in net migration and growing public attentiveness to the issue. We show that since 2005 a disconnect has emerged between media coverage of the issue and external indicators of its scale and importance. The analysis also reveals a shift in the ownership of the immigration issue in formal campaign settings, with the UK Independence Party becoming the most dominant issue associate in electoral coverage of immigration issues.

Data come from an automated content analysis of newspapers and television news in the Netherlands and from additional waves of a 2012-2016 public opinion panel survey. The paper documents frame transmission from the news media to voters. Are refugees victims rather than intruders, and can we afford to help because we are affluent rather than deprived?

2017-0109,2017,Paper Session,"Social Identity, Message Choice, and Attitude: How Priming National Identity Shapes Attitudes Toward Immigrants via News Selection",2,"This study examines social identity’s influence on political attitudes, both directly and as mediated through exposure to political content. We argue that increasing a social identity’s salience will promote affective polarization, and we consider whether it has an indirect influence mediated by information selection processes. We use an online experiment with a diverse sample of American immigration opponents to test the effects of priming national identity on the selection of attitude-affirming and counter-attitudinal information about immigration, and on several indicators of affective polarization. As anticipated, priming national identity directly reinforces affective polarization. Its net indirect effect, however, is negligible. Priming national identity makes people more likely to select stories both supporting and opposing their attitudes, and the two types of exposure have opposing influences on polarization. Although priming national identity strengthens attitudes, subsequent information choice does not exacerbate, and may actually minimize, resultant polarization. We discuss practical and theoretical implications.",Framing Immigration in Europe,Political Communication

Based on a data from a quantitative comparative content analysis we conclude that Lampedusa can be regarded a key event for immigration coverage, but only in Italy, where journalists devoted a considerable amount of attention to the disaster. We also find that the thematic structure and the general tone of immigration coverage changed after the event. However, those changes were only short-termed and immigration coverage quickly returned to its routine level.",Framing Immigration in Europe,Political Communication
2017-0111,2017,Paper Session,Do You Feel Private on SNSs? Development of the Multidimensional Online Privacy Perception Scale,1,"Privacy on social network sites (SNSs) is an important issue for many users and reaches increasing
attention in research as well. In this work, a new and comprehensive privacy scale will
be developed; The scale is based on the theory by Burgoon (1982) that claims the existence of
four privacy dimensions: informational, social, psychological and physical privacy. In a study
an item pool was derived from the theory and tested with a convenience sample (N = 195).
Factor structure was analysed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Seven dimensions
of online privacy were identified: (1) surveillance, (2) the control over who can access
information, (3) the control over data usage by the provider, (4) the availability of personal
information (5) uselessness of information available, (6) the control over duration and frequency
of interactions, and (7) the influence of others on emotions. The new scale still needs
to be cross-validated with a representative sample. Implications for the privacy theory are discussed.","Social Media, Privacy, and Security",Communication and Technology

Structural equation modeling on data from survey of 11,534 Internet users revealed that one indicator of weak self-control (i.e., willingness of risky investments) and two indicators of routine Internet activities (i.e., online shopping and opening emails from unknown sources) positively predicted being an Internet scam victim. Subsequently, being an Internet scam predicted increased online privacy concerns, which, in turn, predicted elevated privacy protection behaviors. Moreover, we found that being an Internet scam victim mediated the effects of Internet routine activities on privacy protection behaviors and that online privacy concerns mediated the effect of being an Internet scam on privacy protection behaviors.","Social Media, Privacy, and Security",Communication and Technology

Using online survey data (n = 605), the study finds that Facebook users employ a total of nine privacy coping strategies reflecting emotion-focused strategies, problem-focused strategies, approach strategies, communication strategies, and avoidance strategies. The results also show that these discrete coping strategies have selective relationships with theoretical antecedents such as cognitive appraisals (i.e., threat appraisals and coping appraisals) and emotional/cognitive reactions (i.e., anger, worry, regret, and helplessness). For instance, retrospective feelings such as anger and regret lead to approach coping strategies whereas prospective feelings such as worry and helplessness lead to communication strategies and avoidance strategies.","Social Media, Privacy, and Security",Communication and Technology
2017-0114,2017,Paper Session,"The Impacts of Privacy Hypocrisy, Victim Characterisation, Gender, and Context on Bystanders’ Guilt Attribution in a Cyberbullying Suicide",4,"While most people would do everything to conceal the sensitive and private information of their own, they are often apathetic, or even cheerful, when other people’s secrets are aired out in the open. Such a “privacy hypocrisy” may lead to misattributions of guilt and victim blaming in cyberbullying cases where the victims often suffer severe public humiliation after their private information has been stolen and exposed by cyber criminals. In this study, we conduct an online experiment using Amazon’s MTurk platform (n = 660) to examine four factors that might affect bystanders’ guilt attribution and victim sympathy in a fictitious story about a teenage girl’s suicide caused by the publication of private information and cyberbullying: 1) a perceptual difference between “invading privacy” and “exposing secrets”, 2) the characterization of the victim as defined by the exposed information, 3) the source of data breach, and 4) bystanders’ gender. The results from our study show that bystanders were less likely to hold the publisher of private information accountable when the information about the victim being exposed the victim was morally questionable (i.e., being a teenage prostitute). On the other hand, female bystanders were more likely to attribute guilt to the publisher of private information than their male counterparts. Additionally, a perceptual discrepancy between “invading privacy” and “exposing secrets” and the source of the personal data breach were important moderators to consider when it comes to guilt attribution and victim sympathy in cyberbullying cases.","Social Media, Privacy, and Security",Communication and Technology
2017-0115,2017,Paper Session,Look on the Bright Side (of Media Effects): Pokémon Go as a Catalyst for Positive Life Experiences,4,"Recent appraisals of communication research have called for deeper exploration of conditional, indirect, and positive media effects. Using predictions from positive psychology’s broaden-and-build theory and placing them within the framework of the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects model, the current study sought to understand the effects of playing the augmented reality video game Pokémon Go. A survey of 398 U.S. adults revealed that gameplay was associated an array of positive outcomes, including increases in positive affect, nostalgic reflection, bonding with friends, and walking. In turn, some of these positive outcomes predicted beneficial shifts in respondents’ evaluation of their personal well-being. However, gameplay was not associated with increases in positive affect for people high in social anxiety, which forestalled one mediating pathway to enhanced well-being. These results present encouraging evidence regarding the utility of merging theories from positive psychology within media effects frameworks as a way of understanding how media use contributes to well-being, especially in the context of video game play.",Mobile Apps and Narratives,Communication and Technology

Revisiting the complex relationship between mobile communication technology, users, space, and context, this article investigates how Butterfly makes available an embodied and embedded queer space for users to engage in situated communication practices. Drawing on digital ethnography and offline interviews, I report on what users meant by using Butterfly, how they used Butterfly to come together, and why using Butterfly was meaningful to users’ (in)visible queer lives. I argue that technological proliferation provides a mobile heterotopic infrastructure for users to momentarily withdraw from heteronormative sociocultural discourse and scarce living space in the context of Hong Kong. However, users’ communication on and off the app is not a free and stable act.

This is a complex process which takes place within a heterogeneous sociotechnical network, consisting of humans and nonhumans. This paper is an attempt to decompose this heterogeneous network to better understand the performative role of material and technological objects in the process of assembling archaeological narratives and to understand the nuances of data-recording and information organization in archaeology. We argue that archaeologists need to enroll allies in order to reinforce the assembled narratives. Enrollment of allies from other disciplines requires the ability to exchange data and perspectives. Different norms, practices or social factors create different tectonic plates of practice which move in different directions and at various paces. Friction between these plates results in tensions which impede the process of narrative co-construction.

The mediating power of interaction is then analyzed related to socially curated news consumption and civic engagement. Specifically, the civic engagements were measured with political knowledge, political participation, and endorsement of civic duty. An online survey was conducted among U.S. residents. The results were analyzed using a structural equation model (SEM). The data suggests that (1) people with social surveillance motivation prefer full coverage news consumption, while people with personal needs satisfaction motivation prefer socially curated news consumption; (2) full coverage news consumption increases the level of civic engagement; and (3) socially curated news consumption increases civic engagement when mediated by interaction.

In an experiment combining eye tracking and content analysis, participants (n = 72) in this study were exposed to one of three TV clips with different media frames (based on a full-sample content analysis) that focused on Alzheimer’s disease. After exposure, participants used the Internet to inform themselves about the issue. Framing was found to influence the individual online searching and reading of information on a descriptive level (such as entering search words and viewing a website’s contents), but not on a procedural level (such as selecting online search results).

How were US examples perceived, incorporated and adapted in various national contexts? It discusses “Americanization” as a discursive label that was used to deal with the up- and downsides of modernity and mass society and critically engages with the “grand narrative of journalism history” which frames the development of journalism in terms of professionalization and modernization. It shows how influential this normative framework has been over time and how it impacted journalism, while simultaneously making a plea for understanding European traditions of journalism in their own right.","Politics, Journalism, and Discourses of Modernity",Communication History

What are the main changes and continuities that have driven the study of politics and the media in the last decades? How to approach this interaction in the light of the challenges that democracy is facing or the continuing technological revolution that at times hampers the media? This paper explores the main premises that have guided the study of politics and the media for more than half a century. In so doing, it questions past categorizations that no longer match up with current developments of both, political regimes and the media. In searching for clarification about current discrepancies between democracies and media’s distinctive forms and functioning, the paper puts forward an alternative analytical framework for the analysis of the political-media complex.","Politics, Journalism, and Discourses of Modernity",Communication History

It argues Morel’s reportage during 1900-1908 about systemic slavery and atrocities in the so-called Congo Free State provided the “moral shock” that social movement theorists James Jasper and Jane Poulsen claim can mobilize people who share no prior common identity. It analyzes the Mail’s collective action frames to illuminate how it served Morel’s daunting task: to mobilize Britons with no material incentives to aid a geographically and culturally distant people. The findings place Morel in the muckraking genre of journalism popular in the United States in the early 1900s. The topic is important because protecting human rights remains a global struggle, and hype about digital activism obscures the central role that print social movement media historically have played in social change.","Politics, Journalism, and Discourses of Modernity",Communication History

Drawing on interviews with 60 journalists in the two countries, it argues that adoption occurs when new technologies are integrated into existing work routines. Such integration, it finds, matters more than other potential reasons for adoption (e.g., management directives, diffusion from tech-savvy journalists). Media system differences are also found to shape adoption. American media’s greater exposure to commercial forces leads many journalists to view social media as tools for audience engagement, while lower levels of commercialism in France corresponds with journalists using social media primarily to seek peer recognition. These findings thus provide a cross-national perspective on the importance of journalistic routines and media systems in shaping technology adoption.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies

Results from a survey of 1,250 journalists show individual factors influence awareness and reporting uses while organizational factors more strongly relate to branding. Findings also point to important differences in uses across platforms, highlighting the need to understand social media use through a disaggregation of its components. Further, results show journalists have yet to fully embrace the participatory potential of social media as only trust on information posted by other journalists relates to adoption.

We argue that news media use these captions to bridge the gap between objective reporting and the more interpersonal and subjective logic of social media. To investigate this we used computational text analysis to measure whether captions from newspapers on Facebook contain more subjective and positive language compared to headlines and leads. Our analysis, covering nine newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years, confirms that captions are more subjective and more positive. We conclude that newspapers use captions to outsource emotion to the social media format, and call for research into how this takes shape and affects the audience.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies

It finds that building a brand, even if it is seen as boring, can be an effective social media strategy because audiences align with the overall message rather than individual attributes.

Uniquely, the participants were drawn from a range of news organizations—including the BBC, CNN, and Thomson Reuters—and had first-hand experience working with robo-writing software from a leading provider. The results reveal journalists’ judgements on the limitations of automation, including the nature of its sources and the sensitivity of its “nose for news”. Nonetheless, journalists believe that automated journalism will become more common, increasing the depth, breadth, specificity, and immediacy of information available.

This is one of the key questions I will address in this paper by defending a relational ontology, that is, an ontology that takes into account the relational character of the agentive dynamics of organizations, a dynamics where communication plays, as we will see, an essential role. Although the question of the relationship between organizational structure and human agency seems as old as the social sciences themselves (O’Donnell, 2010), I argue that defending this ontology does not force us to downplay what Bandura (2001) calls “the capacity to exercise control over the nature and quality of one’s life” (p. 1). Instead, I show that a relational ontology allows us to demonstrate that this human capacity, which is, of course, always relative and finite, must, by definition, deal with other forms of agency, and that there are analytical pay-offs to acknowledging them.",B.E.S.T.: Materiality and the Communicative Constitution of Organizations,Organizational Communication

In this piece, I argue that attempts to disrupt the anthropocentrism of the field and attribute agency to nonhumans could benefit from an intersectional, critical lens. I do so by showing how the charge that discourse has become too complete an explanation for organizational phenomena applies most fully to discourse associated with the gendered and raced status quo.

2017-0143,2017,Paper Session,How the Body Participates in the Communicative Constitution of Organizations,2,"Despite expanding literature drawing attention to the key part played by the body in various organizational phenomena, and to the way organizations shape the bodies that populate them, the constitution of organizations has, to this day, been limited to either discursive practices or to a variety of non-human artifacts. Yet, the body is also an object – although a human one. Through the study of three vignettes drawn through various data-collection strategies, we show that the body participates in the constitution of organizations, in particular by attributing actions to the organization it thus constitutes. We conclude that the communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) perspective is already well-equipped to extend its ontological generosity to the body – it must simply be willing to do so. This study therefore shows that a CCO framework can be used to study the body’s participation to the constitution of organizations, without reducing it to its discursive dimension.",B.E.S.T.: Materiality and the Communicative Constitution of Organizations,Organizational Communication
2017-0144,2017,Paper Session,Alternative and Normative Discourse in Action: Proposing a Theory of Metaventriloquization in Organizations,1,"To date, much of the work on ventriloquism has focused on either (a) the role of organizational texts or values, or (b) how more abstract concepts such as ideologies can be seen to animate and be animated by human actors in interaction. I propose in this paper however that the two concepts are linked, and that organizational rules, policies, and values, are themselves ventriloquizations of cultural Discourses. Thus, when an individual within an organization invokes a policy they are also inviting into the interaction the Discourse(s) that provided the framework for the policy. By proposing a theory of metaventriloquism I seek to unpack this relationship. Using interviews, document analysis, and observations of two homeless shelters, I analyze how anarchist and neoliberal Discourse are invited into organizational interaction through the articulation of particular policies and values.",B.E.S.T.: Materiality and the Communicative Constitution of Organizations,Organizational Communication
2017-0145,2017,Paper Session,Substitute Address for a Political Ideology: Communicative Constitution of a Social Movement Organization in Facebook Admin Conversations,2,"In this paper we study how an informal organization is constituted through online conversations between the administrators of a Facebook-group, and how the elements of organization emerge in these discussion. Building from the Luhmannian perspective to communication as constitutive of organization (CCO) approaches (see Schoeneborn, 2011) we conceptualize the admin chat logs as a form of managerial talk and decision communication. The analytical starting point for this exploration is the concept of partial organization. Our analysis shows how behind the public perception of a flat and network-like online group there exist organizational elements and activities in the managerial conversations. The findings illustrate the ways in which closed conversations in the backstage of organizing a self-referential boundary to the environment is created in particular through the internal and external texts. Hence, contrary to Luhmann’s theorizing, our case organization is not only stabilized using internal referencing but also through external references such as news articles and statements given by notable persons.",B.E.S.T.: Materiality and the Communicative Constitution of Organizations,Organizational Communication

Spectacles are at the heart of a range of organizational communication processes, including the production of identity, culture, relations, responsibility, and power. Organizations become present and knowable to us by “displaying the actual, the artificial, and the fantastic” (Shapiro, 2003), and these processes of visualization and their importance in studies of organization are what we seek to articulate. By focusing explicitly on the relationship between spectacles and organizations, our paper seeks to sketch a fertile research agenda in this area by unpacking three possible perspectives on spectacles – as fetishism, as hyper-reality and as performativity.

2017-0149,2017,Paper Session,Autocommunication and Organizational Identity Transformation,2,"The aim of this paper is to investigate why and how contemporary organizations communicate themselves into new identities. To that purpose, we draw on and extend the theory of autocommunication according to which senders communicate with themselves, even when addressing other audiences. While usually depicted as a self-centered activity, we argue that autocommunication is essentially a social undertaking in which the surrounding world plays a central role. In today’s communication environment, where critical scrutiny of organizational identity claims is constantly lurking, organizations are likely to engage more intensively with their own messages, sometimes even before they are uttered. Such proactive and preemptive behavior has transformative potential. To unpack this potential, we develop a process model that explains organizational identity change along three steps of autocommunication (foundational, attentive, and precautionary). First, we contribute to the literature by providing a coherent “short route” explanation of identity transformation driven by intensified organizational engagement with its own identity-related messages. Second, we show how, paradoxically, increased organizational vigilance toward its environment can result in intensified self-referentiality. Third, we develop the notion of autocommunication into a comprehensive process theory of organizational identity transformation.",B.E.S.T.: Materiality and the Communicative Constitution of Organizations,Organizational Communication

This critical, theory based, essay positions dialogue within rhetoric as an “intervention,” in keeping with the convention theme, showing how the two concepts, both often misused and misunderstood, provide a foundation for ethical communication and relationships. To engage in dialogue is to seek to understand others and co-create meaning. To engage in rhetoric is to intervene, challenge and change everyday communication relationships in positive ways. Integrating both dialogue and rhetoric into individual and organizational communication creates opportunities for more ethical relationships at multiple levels of society. The paper discusses the nature of dialogue and its role in building relationships and long-term commitment between organizations and publics. It explores the possibilities of dialogue in public relations and offers the metaphor of Homo Dialogicus to guide future research and practice.",Let's Talk Dialogue!,Public Relations

Drawing on a wide range of literature, this paper proposes a model of multi-level interconnectedness between engagement and dialogue where dialogue is not only an orientation within which engagement occurs, but also a process or a specific type of two-way communication occurring within engagement. The development of this model begins with clarification of the concepts of dialogue and engagement. Building on this platform of definitions, the paper presents a conceptualization of the inextricably intertwined relationship between engagement and dialogue. The principles of dialogic engagement proposed within this model will point the way toward building richer communication-based experiences and relationships between organizations and their stakeholders.",Let's Talk Dialogue!,Public Relations

This study examined how nonprofit and for-profit organizations used social media to establish dialogic relationships with their publics and compared their usage patterns. Specifically, it focused on the dialogic principles employed on Twitter by various organizations and the interactions with Twitter followers on Twitter through a content analysis of the tweets posted on their official Twitter sites. This study found that organizations paid most attention on the usefulness of information principle and organizations’ Twitter feeds targeted various stakeholders. Nonprofit organizations focused more on the principles of usefulness of information, conservation of visitors, and generation of return visits, while for-profit organizations paid more attention to the dialogic loop principle. Additionally, there were significant relationships between dialogic principles used by organizations on Twitter and their followers’ interactions.

2017-0153,2017,Paper Session,"Churn, Conversations, and Engagement: A Communication Model of Social Impact",2,"Organizations operate within complex environments characterized by regulatory, political, social and environmental pressures. There is also a social expectation that organizations demonstrate a level of responsiveness to stakeholder expectations and awareness of the impact of their decisions. This expectation is particularly important when organizations are making complex decisions with complex social impacts. Social impact assessments (SIA) commonly employed by organizations and governments to identify impacts of current or proposed organizational actions. However to gauge any actual or proposed impact require that stakeholders understand the complexity of the decision, and nature of the impact, at both an individual and a social level. Public relations often works at this interface. This conceptual paper challenges the traditional SIA and recognizes the role and nature of social processes that both create and represent the differing levels of social reality that determine perceptions of those impacts. The implications suggest that through a process of social churn, community members can understand and articulate potential impacts at both an individual and community level. The model advances understanding of public relations engagement and its role in facilitating community relations, and contributes to the growing knowledge of social impact assessments.",Let's Talk Dialogue!,Public Relations
2017-0154,2017,Paper Session,Relationship Building Strategies on Facebook: A Longitudinal Analysis of Leading Companies in Germany,3,"Facebook has become a particularly suited tool for organizations to build and maintain user relationships. We distinguish three strategies for social media relationship building: dialogue orientation, information disclosure, and adapted communication style. This study examines the extent to which leading companies in Germany adopted these strategies for building relationships on Facebook and their effects on the quantity and quality of user interaction. We conducted two multi-level content analyses in the years 2012 and 2015. The findings of the longitudinal study indicate a growing importance of dialogue orientation and information disclosure while the strategy of an adapted communication style declines. Thus, the examined companies do not fully exploit the platform’s potential. Both studies showed that dialogue orientation positively correlates with the number of fan page fans and the extent of user interaction.

Findings from a study of 126 memorable messages about mental health revealed three general types of messages about mental health transmitted by family members: strategizing, normalizing, and minimizing. Statistical analyses indicated that memorable message types were significantly related to young adult satisfaction with the message, perceptions of relational closeness between the message source and the young adult message recipient, and attitudes about mental-health help seeking.

The results supported moderation. For Latina/o students who thought their parents’ anti-substance use messages were legitimate, many of the anti-substance use messages were negatively related to substance use, but the associations were positive or non-significant for Latina/o students who thought their parents’ anti-substance use messages were not legitimate.

Against this background, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with arthritis patients and their significant others (n = 32 patients; n = 8 companions). Three main themes were analyzed: (1) To what extent are family members involved in decision making? (2) What are the functions of family involvement? (3) What characteristics determine the degree or function of family involvement? Our results demonstrate that significant others are important advice givers. The degree of family involvement varies on a continuum from patient led to family led.

2017-0158,2017,Paper Session,Conversation With Nondonor Families: Refusing Organ Donation During Imminent Death,2,"Family refusal to consent remains one of the largest contributing factors to the dearth of organ donation in the United States. The present study uses a normative theory approach to examine family refusal at the time of imminent death. In particular, attention is given to the contextual and relational nature of the organ consent request. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with family members who had been approached by an organ procurement organization (OPO) between December 2013 and December 2015. Non-donor families described their decisions to refuse donation as (1) last acts of love (2) responses to unnecessary requests, and (3) efforts to uphold the strongly held beliefs of their loved one. Interestingly, there were contradictions in participants’ experiences; although they held positive views of the hospital and staff, they were more suspicious of the organ procurement representative. This study offers many implications for health communication scholarship. First, it demonstrates that patient families’ decisions to donate should be understood at a relational level. Second, patient families viewed end-of-life decision-making as an extension of caregiving. Third, participants articulated a tension in their experience with the OPO as both nice/professional and high-pressure/exploitative. Scripts used by medical staff to introduce the OPO to the family during imminent should be analyzed, with attention to the testing of highly tailored and relational messages.

Building on existing work in behavioral science, we argue that users’ willingness to accept a monetary price to obtain enhanced privacy when downloading a mobile app (privacy as default) will be higher than their willingness to pay for it (no privacy by default). Furthermore, we propose that expert recommendations will guide users’ behaviors toward privacy enhancement more than recommendations from an app developer. We tested these assumptions in a 2 (privacy premium default / no privacy premium default) x 2 (expert recommendation / app developer recommendation) experimental design with an additional control group. Participants (N = 309) configured four apps with respect to costly privacy premium features. We found that participants presented with apps with a privacy premium default were more likely to keep the higher-costing privacy feature. However, expert recommendations did not have a significant effect on this relationship.",Top Ranked Papers in Mobile Communication I,Mobile Communication

Using a complementary approach, this study used habit strength and the theory of planned behavior to predict online gambling and problem gambling. A sample of adult Belgian respondents (N=1841) was recruited via a panel agency. Measures included habit strength, subjective norms (GINS), attitudes about gambling (GAS), gambling self-control / efficacy (GSEQ), gambling intentions (GIS), and the problem gambling severity index (PGSI). Structural Equation Modeling was used to test paths and mediation. Results show that online and mobile media are frequently used to engage in gambling. Both habit strength and the perceived online playing behavior of family and friends (norms) were associated with online gambling intent, which in turn contributed to an increase in problem gambling.

2017-0167,2017,Paper Session,The Aggression Lottery? Psychometric Properties of Common Aggression Measures From Four Studies,2,"The debate on video game aggression reached a point were some researchers question the validity of the aggression measures that are commonly employed. While researchers often rely on single measures to assess aggressive outcomes, aggression should be considered as a multi-dimensional construct encompassing aggressive cognitions, aggressive affect, and aggressive behavior. However, it is unclear to what extent measures for these aggression components possess adequate validity. With the goal to investigate the psychometric properties of common aggression measures in the field of game studies, we present an analysis of four experimental video game studies. We assessed aggression using measures for all aggression components and trait aggression to investigate construct, concurrent, and predictive validity. The results reveal that measures for aggressive affect are highly correlated, but that their correlation to measures for aggressive cognitions and aggressive behavior go into the opposite direction as expected.

A Video Game Demand Scale is proposed and confirmed using a split-half method, demonstrating a robust, four-factor solution; validation of the subdimensions is achieved via predictive validity tests with measures of affect, arousal, entertainment outcomes, and need satisfaction metrics.","""Let's Research It All!""

Building upon existing decision-making research, we investigate how differences in motivational states guide information sampling (news) and the conclusions drawn from information accumulation. We use a sequential sampling task, in which participants pay for reading (valenced) economic news titles in order to make correct decisions about the direction of the economy. Based on a regulatory focus theory perspective, we expect sampling to depend on people’s dispositional tendencies towards promotion or prevention foci. In addition, we anticipate that a focus on avoiding losses causes participants to choose for a negative direction of the economy more often, due to differences in certainty change between the two focus conditions. We discuss implications of these results about how biases in information sampling and judgment formation at the micro-level can account for how economic news may drive market responses at the macro-level.","Bias, Cues, Judgment and Decision Making",Information Systems

In a 2 (sponsorship: sponsored/not sponsored) x2 (liking: positive/negative) between-subject experiment, participants viewed screenshots from YouTube product review videos and then indicated their evaluations and behavioral intentions of subscription. The results showed that participants were more likely to subscribe to the YouTube channel when the videos they viewed were not sponsored and received more ""likes"" from other viewers. An interaction effect between sponsorship and liking valence on participants’ evaluations toward the video creator was also observed. However, the effect of sponsorship and liking valence on participants' evaluations toward the content and the product was not found.","Bias, Cues, Judgment and Decision Making",Information Systems

Specifically, we explore how different interface modality features increase the sense of social presence of the prospective date including location-awareness, pictures, or video. We find a strong gender difference in user response to interface features. Male users feel more social presence to location and accessibility cues, such as when Location-Based Information Sharing (LBIS) features indicate that a possible dater is close to them. Female users feel more social presence from richer modality and non-verbal information, such as video profiles rather than just images. The response of these cues of augmented social presence leads to greater desired social interaction and intention to use the service. Specifically feelings of increases social presence leads to greater intention in both male and female users to meet in a face-to-face setting and to buy paid memberships on dating sites. Moderating these effects, desire for uncertainty-reduction is positively associated with social presence only for male participants.","Bias, Cues, Judgment and Decision Making",Information Systems

Policymakers are increasingly interested in the potential of community mesh networks, which rely on a decentralized architecture. Both local and state agencies have attempted to expand residential connectivity in Los Angeles by subsidizing grassroots mesh networks. Community WiFi initiatives in U.S. cities rarely receive public funding, making these projects unique. This study, grounded in a public goods framework, examines the role state and city agencies played in implementing three wireless initiatives in diverse sections of Los Angeles. Each of these networks proved unsustainable over the long-term, despite a combined $700,000 in government funding.",ICT Infrastructure and Divides,Communication and Technology

Hence, it is key to explore why people, despite having connection, do not go online. As the third part of a three-year project on digital inclusion in isolated communities, this study relies on focus groups with non-users from three of these villages to unravel the elements associated with their decision to remain excluded. The main results indicate that strong ties within the community shelter their sense of isolation providing a feel of closeness, where technology is perceived as disruptive. Also, negative attitudes emerge from the discourses as the internet is associated with addiction and isolation. Finally, the absence of digital skills makes smartphones and computers a black box that leaves people with an overwhelming task. Yet, many are facing a hard choice due to their need to remain in contact with those outside the community as well as promote and develop their small ventures. Therefore, there is a cultural construction of the net as a needed progress that nonetheless does more harm than good to a tight community.",ICT Infrastructure and Divides,Communication and Technology

To date the construct has qualitatively explored the negative effects of disconnection on health and employment outcomes. In a validation and extension, 748 undergraduates were surveyed about technology maintenance practices and academic achievement. As expected, ownership and use of laptops and cellphones was nearly universal, but roughly 20% of respondents had experienced difficulties achieving and maintaining access. Students with lower socio-economic status disproportionately experienced hardships, and reliance on poorly functioning laptops were associated with lower grade point averages. Focus group and open-ended response data round out implications of these findings. In the process of taking steps to build a new theoretical framework, these data highlight often overlooked nuances in digital access that may inform larger social disparities, which may also have implications for policy.",ICT Infrastructure and Divides,Communication and Technology

Seeking a comprehensive understanding of cyberloafing, this study uses the theory of interpersonal behavior to test a model of antecedents and consequences of cyberloafing in the Malaysia ICT industry. Also, according to work-family border theory, private demands could influence cyberloafing activities; this study verifies it. This paper examines the consequences of cyberloafing on job stress and work performance. Data from a survey of three hundred ICT employees was analyzed with variance-based structural equation modelling (Smart-PLS). The results reveals that perceived favorable consequences, affect and social factors are significant factors for intention to cyberloaf, while private demands is not significant. Furthermore, intention, habit, and perceived favorable facilitating conditions are significant factors for actual cyberloafing behavior. Cyberloafing was found to increase stress but does not have any significant impact on work performance. The study discusses these findings, implications and concludes with limitations and future recommendations.",ICT Infrastructure and Divides,Communication and Technology

Exposure to a politician’s personal messages on Facebook, as compared to impersonal messages highlighting the politician’s public activities, induced more positive evaluations of the politician, which in turn, heightened vote intention. Such effects, however, were more pronounced when the politician was male and among those who rated Facebook to be more appropriate for building and maintaining interpersonal relationships. Female politicians’ posts were better recalled when they concerned personal stories, rather than work-related matters, but male candidates’ posts were remembered equally well, regardless of the content. Also, the tendency to recall personal messages better than impersonal messages was found only among those who perceived Facebook to be highly appropriate for interpersonal goals. Results are discussed in light of expectancy violations theory and the task-media fit hypothesis.","Elites, Technology, and Politics",Communication and Technology

For the first time in extant research, we also systematically examine the factors that drive political actors to react in the commentary field of a post. Findings indicate that politicians using low-reach and private profiles were more likely to react to user comments compared to politicians using high-reach and official fan profiles. Organizational profiles were least successful in stimulating user engagement. On the post level, we found that reasoning can increase user engagement, but is still rarely used by political actors. Moreover, negative tonality is more successful in stimulating user engagement as compared to positive tonality, but expressing positive emotions in a post has a stronger effect as compared to negative emotions. Additional findings on issues, humor, and mobilization cues are discussed.","Elites, Technology, and Politics",Communication and Technology

However, what happens when inspiring media are accompanied by cues related to the opinion of others, such as comments? Does the sentiment of readers’ comments moderate the effects of inspiring media or elicit unique effects on elevation-related outcomes? An online experiment was conducted to answer these questions using a 2 (news type: inspiring vs. non-inspiring control) x 3 (comment type: positive vs. negative vs. no comment control) between-subjects design. Results revealed that news articles accompanied by either positive or negative comments elicited lower affective states associated with elevation.

In this paper, we analyze how deviance characteristics and techniques of neutralization in potential hate speech comments influence reporting behavior of uncivil comments about refugees. Therefore, we focus on the type of norm violation, subtlety, type of victim, and justifications/excuses. Moreover, we examine the influence of individual’s moral foundations and social context on reporting hate comments. Results of an online survey (n = 457) that included a choice-based conjoint design suggest that incitements for violence are more likely to be reported than conspiracies, rumors, defamations or agitation. Direct offenses were more likely to be reported than indirect offenses. Individualizing moral foundations, indicative of liberal political orientations, fostered reporting behavior, but binding foundations, indicative of conservative orientations, reduced reporting behavior.",Online Comments as Audience Research,Mass Communication

However, most studies reporting such effects are based on measurements directly after the reception, and no research has been conducted regarding the long-term effects of comments. Therefore, this study transferred the sleeper effect in persuasion to news sites with comment sections. In a 2x2-experiment, the persuasiveness of a news article was measured immediately after reception and after a delay of two weeks. The media brand credibility as well as negative and positive user comments were operationalized as discounting/acceptance cues. Results suggest that negative user comments can cause a relative sleeper effect, implicating that they can impede the persuasiveness of an article in the short term, but not in the long term.

The current study provides a more candid picture of people who experience celebrity obsession. In a content analysis of celebrity worshippers' online forum posts, we found that repetitive behaviors providing some form of escapism were more common than behaviors associated with pathological over-identification with the celebrity.

This process detaches hip-hop from its historical racial roots and promotes a color-blind narrative that denies racial differences and subsequently discrimination. The current study examines the relationship between user-generated definitions of hip-hop, attitudes towards hip-hop, and color-blindness among college students (N = 63). Color-blindness was negatively correlated with perceptions of hip-hop as empowering, positively predicted defining hip-hop using music and beats (i.e., non-lyrical musical components), and negatively predicted defining hip-hop using lifestyle and culture. Furthermore, White participants reported greater color-blindness, but were less likely to define hip-hop using lifestyle and culture, regardless of their agreement with color-blind ideology.

Understanding locality as a property of social life with regard to a certain time and space is becoming problematic under the conditions of globalization. This situation is critically linked to the function of the media that have extended their connective power to people across the globe in spite of physical and temporal distances. Specifically, scholars have noted that ethnic minorities, who have used transnational media from their country of origin to connect with their homeland, engage more actively in their imagined community via mediated spaces. Employing Appadurai’s theoretical framework, this study will examine how locality is realized and global imagination is negotiated within the Korean American community in the Philadelphia metropolitan area in response to the popularity of the Korean media culture as an alternative cultural space in the U.S.","Understanding Populism, Celebrity, and Pop Culture",Mass Communication

There is a dearth of research, however, investigating whether expressing anger in mediated messages is indeed effective as a persuasive strategy. In the present research, we hypothesized that anger expression generally does not foster persuasion because it runs counter to well-established social norms for the polite expression of opinions. This expectation was borne out, as the results of three experiments showed that expressing anger in a persuasive message had a small but consistent negative effect on persuasive outcomes as compared to expressing non-emotional disagreement. Messages containing anger expression were perceived as less appropriate than non-emotional messages, and perceived appropriateness mediated the negative persuasive effect of anger expression.",Emotion in Political Communication,Political Communication

To resolve this seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon, this article tackled the widely accepted assumption that the tragic cases of mass shooting is useful in boosting public support for gun control initiatives. In line with the terror management theory, experimental evidence from three studies found this assumption problematic. The results showed that news exposure to mass shootings heightened individuals’ death anxiety, which in turn reinforced their pre-existing attitudes toward gun policies.

In one condition a norm-violation vocabulary was emphasized; in a second otherwise comparable condition the same opposing opinions were characterized as honest differences among reasonable citizens.

mediation model was proposed whereby message source and audience political party
identification shape humor, anger, fear, and hope responses to the message, which in turn shape
intentions to work for and to work against the candidate at the heart of the satirical message. The
results suggest both message and audience factors influence different emotional responses to

Results suggest that although correlational data provided evidence for the beneficial effect of positive emotional framing, this effect disappeared after controlling for gender, relationship status, former knowledge, and attention in further analysis. But, negative emotional framing and the associated emotional experience runs the risk of producing unwanted fear control responses, which can lead to subsequent maladaptive behavior. These findings are consistent with former research, provide further evidence against the use of fear appeals, and the beneficial effect of positive emotional cues in health communication.",The Role of Emotions in Health Message Effects,Health Communication

Specific predictions were made for smoking cues’ ability to provide cognitive resources for message encoding when simultaneous message elements are so highly aversive that they begin to deplete resources (i.e., during a defensive cascade). Measures of selective attention indicated greater resources expended on encoding headlines but not pictorial elements when smoking cues were present. Additionally, free recall was better for highly aversive PSAs with smoking cues as opposed to those without. Results also corroborate previous research findings that show the addition of smoking cues is not effective at improving attention or recall among moderate to less averse PSAs.",The Role of Emotions in Health Message Effects,Health Communication

The result revealed a strong positive overall effect of guilt (r=. 49, 95% CI 0.31-0.64) despite the heterogeneity. Guilt had a stronger power in changing attitudes/intentions when paired with text-only messages than text-picture mixed messages.

This paper puts the homogenization thesis to a test and contrasts it with two other hypotheses: the honeymoon hypothesis, and the political context hypothesis. Based on a content analysis of newspaper coverage in Chile between 1990 and 2011 (N= 20,201), the analysis shows no increase in watchdog journalism during the 21-year period, nor a consistent decrease of interventionism. The watchdog model was most important in the first years of the transition, and presence of the civic and interventionist model showed significant fluctuation over time. These findings demonstrate that changes in journalism practice, at least for these three journalistic roles in Chile, can better be explained by both the honeymoon and political context hypotheses than by the homogenization thesis.",Putting Journalistic Roles Into Perspective,Journalism Studies

This study examines the professional status and identity of those news aggregators, many of whom operate within news organizations but remain on the margins of the profession. Using participant observation and in-depth interviews of news aggregators from a variety of organizations, the study explores their relationships with their organizations and their field, and the ways they are articulating and enacting professional norms in light of those relationships. It finds that aggregators are marked with a deep sense of inferiority due to the secondary nature of their work relative to reporting, leading them to seek to align themselves with the work of reporting and use ethical norms to make case for their own professional legitimacy.",Putting Journalistic Roles Into Perspective,Journalism Studies

Using the lens of “authoring” claims and grants (Taylor and Van Every, 2014), to illuminate an ethnographic study of a Danish municipal department, we display the complex relationship between shared and hierarchical leadership. Our findings suggest that issues of time and timing are fundamental to understanding their interrelationship. We highlight discursive devices such as “bookending,” including the creation of authoritative texts, which render the shared and hierarchical leadership configuration an ambiguous space that requires interrogating leadership outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the centrality of leadership as a concept for both hierarchical and collaborative decision-making situations.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

Using the Theory of Reasoned Action and Social Information Processing Theory, this study examines three factors that influence intentions to adopt six health innovations across the system of 1,849 state health departments in Bihar, India. The collective attitudes of advice network members and organizational co-members influence government healthcare workers’ (N = 6,776) attitudes and perceptions of social norms toward each innovation. Perceptions of social norms and attitudes influence the intentions to adopt each innovation, a reliable precursor to innovation adoption behaviors. However, individuals’ decision making status moderates these relationships, such that the collective attitudes of advice network members have a greater influence on decision makers (n = 953) and the collective attitudes of organizational co-members and perceived social norms have a greater influence on non-decision makers (n = 5,823).

In the case we examine, account sequences exploit the multiple frames available in a situation and appeal to incompatible authorities in order to accomplish “being morally principled.” This case study illustrates how mediated public conversations around social changes provide participants opportunities to perform moralities and define the terms of debate in relation to particular institutions.

It is prevalent in high reliability organizations (HROs) in which members act quickly, sometimes at the expense of fully identifying and addressing hazards. Safety climate literature examines how members counteract production pressure through communicating to question and refuse assignments. These studies often focus on individuals’ discretionary communication behaviors while ignoring how team practices perpetuate or mitigate production pressure. This mixed methods study develops a construct, team safety communication. A qualitative study compares two wildland firefighting teams, identifying dimensions of team safety communication, and hypothesizing how the construct relates to production pressure, team interpersonal climate, and the team’s valuing of after action reviews (a learning practice).

Additionally, a path analysis found that some of the personal dimensions of inclusion (i.e., decision-making, information networks, and participation) predicted volunteer need satisfaction (i.e., competence, relatedness, and autonomy). All dimensions of need satisfaction predicted volunteer intended behavior. There was a significant indirect effect of volunteering inclusion on volunteer intended behavior through need satisfaction. Results suggest that nonprofit organizations should encourage need satisfaction of their volunteers, and this can be accomplished in part through creating an inclusive environment. Other important theoretical and practical contributions to the public relations literature are discussed.",Interventions in Research on Publics,Public Relations
2017-0216,2017,Paper Session,Exploring Gendered Assumptions of Social Media Expertise and Practitioner Power in Public Relations,3,"The purpose of this study was to expand upon previous literatures in public relations power, and fill the need for more scholarship regarding practitioners’ perceptions of social media work, power, and gender. Through a survey of PRSA members in the public relations industry, we examined the relationship between gender, level of experience, and social media expertise on their perceptions of power. Results show that there is a gendered difference in power perception between males and females, with social media potentially serving as an equalizing force. We argue that social media expertise may serve to reduce a gendered power divide in public relations; however, continued critical exploration of social media and gender inequality in public relations is necessary.",Interventions in Research on Publics,Public Relations

2017-0218,2017,Paper Session,Handling Negative Publicity: The Influence of Employing CSR Communication in Apology Statements,2,"Based on the framing theory and the associative network theory, this study develops and tests a model that examines the impact of employing CSR communication in apology statements after negative publicity. Specifically, this study examines the role of CSR fit and CSR history in reducing anger and negative word-of-mouth. This study also examines whether perceived CSR motivation and skepticism towards the apology statement mediate the effect of CSR fit and CSR history on anger and NWOM. The findings of this study suggest that employing CSR communication when CSR fit is high and CSR history is long may reduce negative consumer reactions. However, while CSR history had a positive impact on perceived CSR motivation, it may not have an impact in reducing skepticism towards the apology statement that may result in mitigating consumer anger.",Interventions in Research on Publics,Public Relations
2017-0219,2017,Paper Session,"Linkages Among Reputation, Value Congruence, and Brand Identity on Publics’ Positive Word-of-Mouth Intentions",2,A consumer relations model was tested to determine if reputation is positively associated with positive Word-of-Mouth Intentions (WOM) whereby value congruence was examined as a moderator. The model also posited that the positive magnitude of the moderating effect of value congruence would be stronger for companies with brand identity than for those without. An intercept survey was conducted during which participants were asked about their perceptions of the store they are mostly like to purchase coffee from among five options including multi-nationals and local shops. Results showed that reputation and value congruence are positively related to positive WOM although value congruence did not moderate the relationship between reputation and WOM. Respondents indicated more positive WOM intentions toward companies without brand identity. Theoretical and practical considerations for public relations are offered.,Interventions in Research on Publics,Public Relations
2017-0220,2017,Paper Session,Radical Activist Group and Publics’ Supportive Behaviors on Social Media: The Role of Perceived Reputation of Networking With Stakeholders,2,"To contribute to the literatures on word-of-mouth (WOM), This study examines the influence of attitudes on publics’ positive and negative WOM behaviors on social media, and the moderating role of perceived organization’s networking ability with stakeholders. PETA is used to examine these relationships. The finding shows that publics’ attitude toward PETA is a strong predictor of positive and negative WOM on social media. The perceived reputation of networking with the general public (e.g., supporters and non-supporters) has a positive influence on their positive WOM behaviors. Also, the perceived reputation of networking with governmental and other non-profit organizations hinders individuals’ negative WOM behaviors on social media. However, the perceived reputation of networking with political parties and media organization is positively related with negative WOM behaviors. There is a moderating effect of the perceived reputation of networking with the government in the relationship between individuals’ attitudes toward PETA and positive WOM behaviors.",Interventions in Research on Publics,Public Relations

Previous research about police agencies, journalists and the public showed that public information officers (PIOs) in police departments play a mediating role in communicating with the media. However, it is still vague how the PIO mediates the relationship of the police, media and public triad. In the current study, two cases (Cary Ball’s case in 2013 and Mansur Ball-Bay’s case in 2015) were selected to explore the communication style of police information officers with the media. The rhetorical generic theory was applied to guide the study. Inspired by the dialogic theory, this study offers a checklist for PIOs when responding to OIS cases and also provides seven dialogic suggestions for remedying the police system.",Interventions in Research on Publics,Public Relations

This opens new research avenues in the pursuit of understanding how social influence is exercised in the virtual space. The current study experimentally manipulated the exposure dosage of descriptive norm information about e-cigarette use, and simulated the experiential aspect of norm perception formation process with online comment boards, the media platforms that approximate offline social-group settings where individuals can infer descriptive norm information. Results show that individuals were able to correctly perceive the local behavior choice distribution within the online comment boards, and such quasi-statistical picture affected their prevalence estimation about the reality. Negativity bias was observed in the perception formation process, such that indication of not using e-cigarettes decreased the prevalence estimation substantially.

2017-0223,2017,Paper Session,E-cigarettes Warning Labels and Modified Risk Statements: Tests of Messages to Reduce Recreational Use,3,"Recreational use of electronic cigarettes has increased substantially in recent years, and this is concerning because the use of e-cigarettes can potentially lead to nicotine addiction in individuals who do not already smoke. Through a 4 (warning text) x 2 (modified risk statement), plus control, experiment, we test variations of the warning label both alone and in the context of a modified risk statement on the dependent variables of risk perceptions, ambiguity perceptions, systematic counter-arguing, reduced effectiveness and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that gender, smoking status, and the language used in the warning statements interact to influence risk perceptions. Furthermore, using a build-out of the Heuristic-Systematic Model, results demonstrate that the addition of a modified risk statement alongside the warning label increases ambiguity perceptions which leads to reduced effectiveness and behavioral intentions to use e-cigarettes. While the systematic and heuristic pathways are both explanatory, heuristic processing provides the better fit.",Content and Effects of Communication About E-Cigarettes,Health Communication

Results (N=1016) indicated that e-cig users who joined user-created e-cig brand groups had significantly more negative attitudes towards quitting, lower perceived behavioral control, intention to quit and self-efficacy than those exposed to ads or following brand pages, while also having significantly greater brand involvement, self-brand connection, brand usage intent and eWoM intention. Exposure to two or more types of e-cig marketing messages had an additive effect on health- and brand-related outcomes. Social identification, attention to social comparison and subjective norms also moderated between exposure to e-cig marketing messages and key dependent measures.

2017-0225,2017,Paper Session,Formative Research for a Youth Anti-Electronic-Cigarette Campaign: Avoiding Unintended Consequences Across Subgroups and Behavior,3,"Mass media campaigns should favor messages which address beliefs related to the target behavior for a particular audience. This analysis uses survey responses from 13-17 year old youth to identify the promise of specific candidate e-cigarette beliefs to influence intentions to use e-cigarettes. However, a promising belief for one target behavior and for one audience may have problematic effects for other behaviors and audiences. Here we contrast the promise of beliefs for influencing never tobacco users and their intention not to initiate use of e-cigarettes, with the promise of those beliefs for influencing intentions to use tobacco cigarettes among those who already have experience with either tobacco or e-cigarettes. While many beliefs would be strong candidates for a campaign against e-cigarette use among never users, some of these beliefs are associated with an increased intention to use tobacco cigarettes among youth with tobacco experience. Implications within the domain of e-cigarettes and for those engaged in formative research are discussed.",Content and Effects of Communication About E-Cigarettes,Health Communication

We employed the Social Media Analytic and Research Testbed (SMART) dashboard, which was used to identify and download (via a public API) e-cigarette-related tweets. E-cigarette-related tweets were collected continuously using customized geo-targeted Twitter APIs. A total of 193,051 tweets were collected between October 2015 and February 2016. Of these tweets, a random sample of 1,000 were selected and manually coded for information regarding source, context, and message characteristics. Our findings reveal that although over half of tweets were positive, a sizeable portion was negative or neutral. Additionally, among tweets mentioning stigma of e-cigarettes, most confirmed that stigma does exist. Conversely, among tweets mentioning harmfulness of e-cigarettes, most denied that e-cigarettes were a health hazard. We also observed a noticeable absence of any official public health voice within the e-cigarette discourse.

Specifically, the study was interested in testing whether such mechanisms impact the extent to which journalists perceive changes over time in their role conceptions. Such an exploration is timely and important. The roles journalists conceive of are shaped, in part, by what they think audiences expect from them. Such expectations are now communicated to journalists routinely and easily through new audience feedback mechanisms: reader comments, social media, and web analytics. Based on an online survey of 358 news journalists in Australia, this study found that reading readers’ comments frequently is related to an increase in the perceived importance of both consumer and citizen orientations. In contrast, exposure to audience feedback through web analytics is related to an increase in the perceived importance of consumer orientation.",How the Public Shapes the News: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Audience Relations,Journalism Studies

This paper uses Williams and Delli Carpini’s “media regimes” as a theoretical framework to argue that studying the current open-arms approach to the news audience – and the ambiguity surrounding it – is vital to understanding journalism’s transition from one rapidly disappearing model to one that is yet to fully emerge. In doing so, it offers a definition of audience engagement that synthesizes prior literature and contributes an important distinction between reception-oriented and production-oriented engagement. It concludes with a call for more research into audience engagement efforts to better understand what journalism is, and what it might become.",How the Public Shapes the News: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Audience Relations,Journalism Studies

This article examines such developments via a quantitative content analysis of personalisation features at 15 major news outlets in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. Both websites and mobile apps were studied, allowing comparisons to be made across countries, type of news outlet, and platforms. Longitudinal comparisons were also made. The results reveal significant changes over the last six years with, for example, rises in personalisation on mobile platforms, falls in the use of recommendation by friends, and convergence and commodification in content recommendation platforms. This study provides evidence to support continued debates on classical concerns such as selective exposure, but also raises new concerns about effects of personalisation, including whether it is degrading the ‘Chinese wall’ between editorial and advertising content.",How the Public Shapes the News: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Audience Relations,Journalism Studies
2017-0230,2017,Paper Session,Just Big or Better Loyal? The Quest for Institutionally Effective Audiences in Distributed News Environments,1,"News organisations’ relationships with their audiences are increasingly intermediated by big technology companies. Acting in an environment of increasingly distributed content, news organisations engage into a competitive quest for institutionally effective audiences. This paper suggests a heuristic along the dimensions envision, enact, evaluate to examine this quest. The analysis is based on a bottom-up grounded theory analysis of 49 interviews with senior editors, managers and social media strategists of news organisations from four high-income Western countries. Building on the concept of audiencemaking, this paper argues that the notion of loyal audiences works as core mechanism underlying the constant attempt of “reconfiguring” audiences. The analysis shows how the reconfiguration of audiences is increasingly a focal point in editorial considerations. As such, the constant reconfiguration of audiences rises as institutional practice that exemplifies how news organisations operate in times of uncertainty.",How the Public Shapes the News: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Audience Relations,Journalism Studies

How Ordinary News Subjects Navigate Interviews With Journalists,1,"This paper analyzes how ordinary citizens experience being interviewed by journalists for news stories. Findings are drawn from a larger project based on interviews with 83 private citizens who were named in mainstream news stories in the United States. Here I explore how subjects jockeyed with journalists during their interviews over what information should be included in the published news story, and how it should be presented there—what I call the ¨story frame.¨ I describe four categories that capture the range of contests over the news message that interviewees described. In the first two categories, subjects felt they and reporters were basically in agreement over how the story should be told in what should be included. In the second two scenarios, subjects sensed their own story frame did not align with reporters’, so the interview felt like a negotiation or outright struggle over what the story frame should be.",How the Public Shapes the News: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Audience Relations,Journalism Studies
2017-0232,2017,Paper Session,Comparing Cyberbullying Perpetration on Social Media Between Primary and Secondary School Students,3,"This study aims to explore factors associated with cyberbullying perpetration on social media among children and adolescents in Singapore, based on the theory of reasoned action and the parental mediation theory. More specifically, the relationships between attitude, subjective norms, descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and active and restrictive parental mediation with cyberbullying perpetration on social media were investigated. Moreover, we examined the moderating effect of age on the relationship between parental mediation and cyberbullying perpetration. Multi-stage cluster sampling was used, in which 635 upper primary school children (i.e., Primary 4 to 6 students) and 789 secondary school adolescents participated in our survey. The results revealed that attitude, subjective norms, and the two parental mediations – active and restrictive mediation – were positively associated with cyberbullying perpetration on social media. Age was a significant moderator of both parental mediation strategies and cyberbullying perpetration. Implications and limitations of this study were discussed.

This study uses secondary data from the 2011 Parents/Teens Digital Citizenship Survey, which includes 799 teenagers and one of their parents in the U.S. Based on OLS hierarchical regression analysis, the results revealed that intensity of SNS usage, traditional victimization and restrictive parental mediation were positively associated with cybervictimization. In contrast, perceptions of peers’ kindness on SNS was negatively associated with cybervictimization. Moreover, the intensity of SNS usage amplified the relationships between perceptions of peers’ kindness on SNS, traditional victimization, and cybervictimization.

Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate how negative peer interactions are associated with the daily interactions of early adolescents with peers, both offline and online. To this aim, photo-elicitation interviewing was used to gather data amongst a sample of 34 [NATIONALITY] early adolescents. A thematic analysis revealed that adolescents experience a wide range of different types of negative peer interactions offline and online. Most of the negative interactions take place exclusively offline or online and only a minority of the events are carried-over from the offline environment to the online environment or vice versa.

A User Experience Study on a Reflective Interface to Reduce Cyber Harassment on Social Networking Sites,4,"Creating reflection with interfaces can reduce cyber harassment amongst adolescents on social networking sites (SNS). However, it is necessary to assess the user experience with reflective interfaces, as this might affect adolescents’ evaluation of SNS. We explored the user experience of 24 adolescents (14 to 16 years) with several reflective cues and messages discouraging them from harassing. Participants commented on a newsfeed page of a SNS with reflective messages implemented into its design. Participants were asked to take the role of a harasser and were instructed to regularly post a harassing comment. When the system recognized harassment, one of the reflective cues or messages was randomly shown. Afterwards, they completed a questionnaire and expressed their thoughts on their experience. The reflective interface was not experienced as disruptive, but a potential fatigue effect appears in the long-term. It is important to avoid unnecessary exposure to reflective interfaces.",Friend or Foe? Peer Interactions in Offline and Online Spaces,Children Adolescents and the Media

The internet adds flexibility to these relationships because adolescents can exercise greater independence in choosing peer groups. This study examined how young people negotiate their social status in offline and online spaces. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adolescents (aged 12-18) in Canberra, Australia (N=17) from February to June 2014. The type of power exerted online differs from that exerted offline; different skill sets are required to attain social status. Offline power translates into online power but not vice versa. However, participants appreciated the broader social networks that were afforded online and explored new boundaries of social interaction. In doing so, they were skeptical of the partial depiction that were portrayed online. Different values and status ladders were explored, which provided them with opportunities to develop new power relationships.",Friend or Foe?

2017-0237,2017,Paper Session,Digital Political Infographics: A Rhetorical Palette of A New Genre,2,"Digital political infographics are a recent incarnation of a longstanding tradition of relying on visualizations for education and inducement. Though widely used by a variety of political actors, this emergent genre has received scant academic attention. Informed by literature about political persuasion and visualization conventions, we conducted a grounded analysis of 100 successful politically-oriented infographics on Twitter. We identified eight infographic rhetorical sub-types according to the foundational dimensions of narrative, data, and visualization strategies, and created the first rhetorical typology of this format. An integrative analysis revealed that the digital political infographic is a hybrid genre, characterized by three influence trajectories between political campaigning and infographic conventions: politicizing infographic traits (manifest in persuasive objectives, subtle emotionality, and temporal causality), infographing political tactics (entailing a shift towards issue-based narratives), and creating new common ground (using the aura of big-data's credibility to produce overloaded, even overwhelming, visualizations).",Information Graphics and Graphic Representations,Visual Communication Studies

In terms of the type of infographic, bar graphs were more successful in attracting viewer’s attention than simple tabular presentation of information. In addition, the study showed that infographics positively predicted recall of numerical information from television news, and that quantitative ability of participants was also positively related to information recall. The study is the first one to directly measure attention allocation to infographics in television news and relate it to orienting response.

The primary objective of the research was to capture visual constructs of abstract or complex concepts, using knowledge as a case study. Over 1300 drawings across five different sites were collected and analyzed for shared visual languages constructed through the use of pictorial depiction. Engelhardt’s (2002) typology of graphic representations types was used to categorize all the drawings, and individual graphic objects were identified and coded. Two of the most popular graphic objects identified, brains and light bulbs, are symbolic in relation to knowledge and highlight a metaphoric correspondence.

Four focus group discussions were conducted in which Telecinco, a Spanish television channel, broadcast a news story about a new television channel run by Egyptian women journalists wearing the niqab (Maria TV). Most participants criticized the approach adopted by the television channel, although in a second level of discussion, they expressed opinions on journalists in niqab in line with the representation proposed by the channel.

I analyzed the discourse using a Critical Discourse Analysis approach that most closely follows Fairclough. I then discussed findings from the study that include participants’ subject positioning within the discourse, the implications of students’ constructions of racism and white privilege within educational contexts, and how these constructions can reinforce social practices that reify hierarchies, power relations, and status positionings.

In-depth interview were conducted with security expert (n=3), terrorist expert (n=1), communication and media experts (n=2), psychology expert (n=1), Islamic studies expert (n=1) and political science experts (n=2) to elicit information about factors contributing towards the development of Islamic extremism. The data were analyzed using Charmaz’s grounded approach. Findings indicated that ideology, heroism and, practicality contributed towards the development of Islamic extremism by creating an appeal for individuals to become Islamic state followers and sympathizers that appeal to the individuals to be IS followers and sympathizers. This study contributes to the understanding of persuasive elements of Islamic extremism from intercultural communication perspective.

A quasi-experimental design that measured American domestic students’ ratings of a fictional CIS described in scenarios demonstrated that the reticent CIS was rated as more typical, less likable, and less socially-approved. A thematic analysis of American domestic students’ general impression about CISs suggested two main themes: 1) some American students stigmatized CISs due to their poor English and reticence in the classroom; 2) others were more open-minded to approach CISs’ reticence with high intercultural communication competence by taking CISs’ perspective. The findings indicated: the overwhelming stereotype held by American students that typical CISs are reticent leads to negative evaluations of CISs; while perspective-taking skills resulted in better intercultural-communication experience for American students. The implications are discussed and directions for action that universities can take are provided.","Perceptions, Prejudices, and Racism",Intercultural Communication

Analyzing the association requires a preliminary analysis of the corpus using a topics classification method for text analysis, but current methods are either expensive or less appropriate to hypothesis testing. In this paper we present a process that combines topic modeling and a deep neural network model that together create a method for topic classification that faces this challenge. In the paper we show the efficiency and usefulness of the method, explain how to set up and validate the method, and elaborate the different layers of the deep model. We demonstrate this process on news article collected from news websites, showing that it is resulting in a meaningful identification of issue frames.",Computational Methods in Journalism Research,Computational Methods
2017-0250,2017,Paper Session,Investigating the Gatekeeping Role of Social Media Editors of Newspapers Using Computational Text Analysis,2,"Due to the rising popularity of social media as news sources, social media editors of newspapers are becoming important gatekeepers. This begets the question to what extent and how the content published by social media editors differs from the content of the newspaper. In this paper we contribute to this investigation by comparing one year of news coverage of five national newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders to the news items that they published on Facebook. In addition, we make a methodological contribution. Building on the conceptualization of gatekeeping as a function that transforms an information distribution (i.e. input into output) we propose a computational text analysis approach where information distributions are directly extracted from texts. We demonstrate that this method can be a powerful tool to study gatekeeping on social media, and the code that we develop is published open-source as a package for the R statistical software.",Computational Methods in Journalism Research,Computational Methods

The cross-platform approach is aided by custom-built data mining tools designed for extracting comments to the same article from the three platforms, while automatically computing parameters such as the comments’ average count and length. In addition, topic modeling is used to characterize comments across platforms as well as journalistic genres (following Tuchman’s distinction between hard and soft news). Our findings suggest that although there are more comments to news articles posted on a newspaper’s Facebook page than on its website, these are relatively short and emotionally intense, which might indicate a bias in the discussion of news on these two platforms.",Computational Methods in Journalism Research,Computational Methods

2017-0253,2017,Paper Session,Technologically Narrowing but Structurally Diversifying: News Consumption on Mobile Internet,3,"The emergence of mobile Internet has changed the way people consume news. On one hand, the abundance of news, broad range of sources and omnipresence of mobile devices empower users to get access news on a more diverse basis. On the other hand, technology encourages users to consume news through a more specific ways. This study empirically evaluates the dynamics of news consumption diversity by using a panel data extracted from a server log of a mobile news application in China. Results demonstrate that mobile Internet has technologically mitigated but structurally facilitated news consumption diversity. News consumption diversity decreases over time, and its decreasing rate varies among individuals. News consumption diversity is enhanced by global information diversity and is dependent on gender. In general, the influence of global information diversity on males is less remarkable than that on females. The diversity of news consumed by males is also less likely influenced by time. This study challenges traditional motivation-driven theories of news consumption by mining the structural antecedents of news consumption. Implications for news recommendation application design are finally discussed.",Computational Methods in Journalism Research,Computational Methods

A Text Mining Analysis of Tweets on Data-Driven Journalism",1,"Data-driven journalism has triggered debates that whether these innovative approaches, such as using data analytical and computational methods, better serve the public. Applying the concept of articulation, wherein an array of terms are juxtaposed and expressed together, this paper examined how the term “data-driven journalism” is discursively constructed by ordinary people on social media. Using the Twitter application programming interface (API), this paper harvested all available public tweets (n = 2,597) containing hashtags or keywords related to data-driven journalism within two weeks in late October 2016. Text-mining indicated these tweets focused intensively on data visualization and data analytical techniques. Further analysis on the hashtag co-occurrence network, i.e., a network established via creating edges between two or more hashtags appearing together within the same tweet, revealed that journalism and visualization-related hashtags were located at important positions in the network; in contrast, public-related terms, such as “#opendata” or “#opengovernment,” were positioned peripherally.",Computational Methods in Journalism Research,Computational Methods

significantly unaware of global affairs. The Department of Education named social media as a
viable option for improving the internationalization of classroom curricula, yet minimal research exists to quantitatively support such a claim. What little research does exist has exclusively investigated Facebook, while no research has looked into the viability of other popular social media platforms, such as Twitter or Instagram. Through an experimental design, this paper probed how the presentation of textually-based (Twitter) and visually-based (Instagram) messages affect American college students’ recall of digital information pertaining to global
affairs. It also investigated how communicator credibility effects how college students consume globally related information. Results showed that participants were most responsive to visually based information published by professional news outlets.

For cost-efficiency reasons, e-learning programs are increasingly being implemented. These programs, however, are not always being used by employees. The present study aims to test whether digital-games based learning can offer a solution for the non-engagement and drop-out of employees in e-learning programs. More specifically, the present study investigated whether the interactivity of a game results in higher motivation to learn using the method, higher levels of enjoyment and better learning outcomes compared to a passive, instructional video. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted among 64 employees working at a large bank, testing an e-learning training program (game or instructional video) aimed at teaching the bank’s basic client-oriented principles in order to improve their loyalty to the bank. No differences regarding motivation, enjoyment or learning outcomes were found between participants receiving the game training and the instructional video. This shows that it might not always be required to –in a corporate context- invest in interactive content, considering it was not able to overcome the motivational issues related to more traditional e-learning approaches.",Technology and Learning,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2017-0258,2017,Paper Session,Using a Gamified Platform in a Blended Learning Environment to Enhance the Critical Thinking Skills of Journalism Students,2,"Training in critical thinking is essential for the professional development of journalism students. To achieve this goal, this study developed a gamified platform and a blended learning curriculum. During an 18-week experimental instruction period, a series of instructional activities, which included online discussions as well as classroom lectures and discussions, were conducted to enhance 32 journalism students’ critical-thinking dispositions and skills. Repeated measure analysis of variance on test scores and analyses of open questions found that the participants significantly improved their critical thinking skills and dispositions through the gamified platform with the experimental instruction in a blended learning environment. The findings suggest that providing clear goals, challenges and quests, feedback, competition and cooperation, actual grading and visible status, access/ unlocking content, onboarding time restrictions, freedom of choice, and new identities and roles, as well as avoidance of overjustfication, contributes to achieving a “meaningful gamification” experience, which may further lead to self-determined learning in critical thinking.",Technology and Learning,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2017-0259,2017,Paper Session,Voluntary Use of Social Media for Formal Learning: An Investigation of Using Self-Regulated Learning Strategies,3,"Myriad social media have provided voluntary options for students to complement and enrich their formal learning in school. Compared to mandatory contexts, students in the context of voluntary use of social media for formal learning are empowered with more autonomy and control over their social media usage and learning activities. Regarding this, self-regulated learning strategies to manage the greater autonomy and control are important to ensure effective learning. Yet, an empirical void remains in the literature regarding students’ self-regulated learning behaviors in the voluntary context. Thus, the aim of this research is to address this gap by investigating students’ use of self-regulated learning strategies, as well as the influential factors and the effects of such behaviors. A conceptual model was proposed to integrate personal factors, the use of self-regulated learning strategies, and learning satisfaction. This model was tested on a sample of 192 university students.",Technology and Learning,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Videoconferencing health information technology enables generalist and specialist providers to co-manage patients with complex chronic illness and can facilitate workplace learning about specialty care. This study analyzes 32 video consultations between generalist and specialist providers caring for patients with chronic liver disease at two US sites to describe the overall organizational features and constituent interactional activities. Results show that video consultations have a four phase overall structure and three distinct consultation types: full cases in which generalists presented new patient cases; updates in which generalists or specialists revisited previously discussed cases; and summaries in which specialists presented new cases. Results suggest that providers take-for-granted the learning opportunities available in each consultation type.

Drawing on an ethnographic field-work in an Intensive Care Unit that adopts a non-conforming policy of antibiotic stewardship, this article analyzes doctor-doctor interaction concerning infectious disease diagnosis and anti-biotic treatment. By analyzing examples of medical decision-making from a corpus of video-recorded morning briefings, we focus on physicians’ stance-taking towards the ward’s non-conforming policy and illustrate how it is contingently situated along a continuum from strong commitment to overt resistance. We suggest that physicians’ oscillating stance-taking is favored by the moral load of following an extreme and “off label” policy and, in turn, impacts on the way this policy is practically accomplished as an interactional highly reflective achievement by the team.

2017-0262,2017,Paper Session,The Morality of Knowledge Claims in Radio Phone-Ins on ADHD,2,"Drawing on a corpus of radio phone-ins, we present a conversation analysis of how mothers claim knowledge of their children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We show that mothers typically claim knowledge about their children’s good intentions, but do not claim knowledge regarding the ‘ADHD-ness’ of their children’s problematic behaviour. By only claiming the knowledge appropriate for a concerned parent, callers treat their children’s behaviour as a matter of expert knowledge and therefore as doctorable. Negotiations of the behaviour as symptomatic of ADHD rather than ‘mere disobedience’ are bound up with the question what constitutes credible expertise. As soon as problematic behaviour is treated as observable from the outside and thus describable by lay persons, this professionally administered category becomes vulnerable to being formulated as ‘normal disobedience’. We conclude that the mothers’ knowledge claims interactionally shape the nature of the children’s behaviour, and the other way around.",Making Knowledge Relevant in Medical and Mediated Contexts,Language & Social Interaction

This style involves a complex mix of forms of audience address which could be problematic and detrimental for a show’s ability to engage users in the communicative activities. We will, however, argue that Superlive has particular qualities that shift its locus from a traditional broadcast communicative ethos to one that stresses the programme as a ‘shared communal experience’. We focus our analysis on a number of aspects of the interactional work in what we see as the performance of a particular form of expertise. In this space, ‘expertise’ is deployed and layered through playful and humorous interaction and audience engagement.",Making Knowledge Relevant in Medical and Mediated Contexts,Language & Social Interaction

However, a critical analysis of the media literacy intervention literature has revealed that these studies show a mismatch between the conceptualizations offered for media literacy as a skill and the measures used to evaluate their effectiveness (Potter & Thai, 2016a). Rather than assessing skill as a performance, self-report items on beliefs about skills are used, leading to studies with questionable content and face validity. The purpose of this study is to address these issues through the development of measures to assess the performance of the media literacy skills of analysis, evaluation, and abstraction based on a strong conceptual foundation. The measure development process included the pilot testing of an initial set of open-ended items with three focus groups, data collection with an undergraduate sample (n=271), development of a codebook, and the content analysis of the qualitative data with the codebook.

In this paper, I situate in-school youth production in the context of pedagogical theories of participatory culture, art education, and digital and media literacy education. Using interviews with four experienced high school media production educators, I examine how educators perceive school situations where behavior or student media work products disrupt or transgress expectations. Teachers experience student transgression as an essential dimension of the dialectic between creative freedom and creative control. They perceive creative control to be a negotiation between students and teachers on issues of content, format, production and distribution processes. Teachers conceptualize the distinctions between students who use transgression as a form expressive creativity, a reproduction of the tropes of mass media and popular culture, the result of novices making mistakes as part of learning, an attempt to gain social power and status among their peers, or a challenge to adult authority.

Among the ways universities are pedagogical agents are the newsletters that universities provide to parents and students. In this study parents (n = 868) completed a questionnaire about parents’ use of university newsletters, their perceptions of students’ university engagement, and their motives and conversations with their students on five university topics: safety, health, careers, academics, and student involvement. The model was confirmed: the credibility and utility of university newsletters and parents’ conversations with other parents were positively related to parent motives for discussing university topics. Parents’ motivation leads to more frequent communication with students, greater student awareness of important topics, and better engagement experience in university life.

Also, almost all the sample videos included background music and these videos featured various public locations. Among the variables related to TAM and emotional appeals, results indicated that only the use of an emotional story predicted positive viewer sentiment (likes per view).

Nineteen news reports on social robots from The New York Times were analyzed to answer how news media frame issues about social robots and what are their assumptions about robotic ontology. Qualitative framing analysis with constant comparative method revealed three emerging frames, i.e. “robots as useful”, “robots emulating animate beings”, and “social-cultural effects of social robots.” Further, discourse analysis revealed that social robots were mostly portrayed as non-agentic objects and inferior to human beings with metaphors and linguistic strategies. Downplaying serious scientific discussions about the nature of human and machine agency and emphasizing social robots’ nature as commodity, news reports on The New York Times reflect a dualist view in terms of ontology and human-centered utilitarianism, consistent with the mainstream American culture.","Understanding Augmented Reality, Social Agents, and Artificial Intelligence",Communication and Technology

Project descriptions, which are supposed to give a full account of the incidents, help compensate for the lack of necessary social cues on which the donors rely to judge the worth of donations. The study examines the influence of donation-based project descriptions from two perspectives, communication modality and storytelling narrative. Using publicly available webpages of a major crowdfunding platform (N = 4,123), the author found that only a limited number of projects took advantage of the benefits of embedding videos and pictures. Although having more videos and pictures generally predicted an increase in revenue, the increase was unevenly distributed across different categories of projects. Meanwhile, topic modeling distinguished two salient storytelling narratives: while the fact-based narrative positively predicted the fundraising outcomes, the need-based narrative seemed to have a negative impact. The findings shed light on the necessity of fostering digital literacy, minimizing the digital divide, and optimizing persuasion appeals with the most appropriate storytelling tools.",Best Papers in Information Systems Division,Information Systems
2017-0281,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Likability of Multiple Layers of Sources on Information Processing on Social Network Sites,2,"Message reposting (e.g., sharing on Facebook) is a common activity on social network sites. For reposted messages, both the original poster and the reposter can be viewed as sources. This study examined how likability of multiple layers of sources influence people’s acceptance of a message based on dual-process models and the unimodel of persuasion. In particular, we examined the mediations through message-related elaboration and source-related elaboration. The results of a web-based experiment indicated that the likability of an original source influenced the receivers’ attitude toward the idea advocated in the message by biasing the valence of message-related elaboration. However, the biasing effects of source likability were not supported for a selecting source who passed along the message. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the amount and the valence of source-related elaboration mediate the effects of original source likability on the attitude by affecting the valence of message-related elaboration.",Best Papers in Information Systems Division,Information Systems
2017-0282,2017,Paper Session,Neural Activity During Antismoking Message Exposure Predicts Subsequent Message Elaboration,5,"Abstract
Recent neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during heath message exposure can predict behavior change. Although self-relevance and value are functions ascribed to mPFC, the underlying mechanisms linking mPFC activity to persuasion are not yet understood. Here we investigated if mPFC neural activity during message exposure is also associated with subsequent message elaboration. A group of adolescent non-smokers participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, in which they viewed and talked about anti-smoking public service announcements. Levels of elaboration were measured through transcripts of participants’ subsequent descriptions of the messages using the LIWC dictionary. We found that neural activity in mPFC during message exposure is associated with subsequent message elaboration.",Best Papers in Information Systems Division,Information Systems
2017-0283,2017,Paper Session,"Thinking About Right and Wrong: Effects of Moral Conflict on Entertainment Experiences, Information Processing, and Knowledge",3,"The model of intuitive morality and exemplars (MIME, Tamborini, 2011, 2013) proposes a dual-process framework that explains audience reactions to fictional media content. Given that news stories feature many morally-laden topics, this study investigated the effect of moral conflict in news stories on entertainment experiences, information processing, and learning outcomes, in particular objective and subjective knowledge. An online experiment (N = 287) using a feature story (moral conflict vs. no moral conflict) as stimulus was conducted. Results show that pondering on a moral conflict does not hamper learning outcomes, but rather facilitates them. However, moral conflict only increases learning outcomes when individuals cognitively elaborate the content. The results are discussed with regard to the influence of entertainment experiences on information processing and learning.",Best Papers in Information Systems Division,Information Systems
2017-0284,2017,Paper Session,A Virtuous Circle for the Few?,1,"According to the virtuous circle thesis, the relationship between exposure to political information in the news media and political engagement is positive and reciprocal. Those who engage most in politics are most likely to seek out political information in the news media, and those who are most attentive to political information in the news media are in turn most likely to become further politically engaged. Using a three-wave panel study from Denmark (N = 2,080) combined with a content analysis of the news media, this study examines the conditional role of motivation (political interest) and ability (education) in this process. The results show that the relationship is indeed positive and reciprocal, but only for people with high political interest. In contrast, the relationship is not moderated by level of education. Thus, motivation plays a key role in the reciprocal relationship, while ability seems less relevant in today’s high-choice media environment.",The Virtuous Circle?

2017-0285,2017,Paper Session,A Healthy News Diet? Investigating the Effects of Individual News Diets on Political Participation Offline and Online,3,"This article focuses on how citizens in a high-choice media environment can compose an individual media diet and its effects on political participation. More specifically we investigate (a) how people combine the use of offline and online media into personal news diets and (b) the effects of different news diets on both offline and online political participation. Based on a two-wave panel study (N = 2,747) covering the 2014 Swedish national election, the study identifies five media diets: minimalists, public news consumers, local news consumers, social media news consumers, popular online news consumers. Firstly, the results show that minimalists are less likely to participate in politics and secondly that there is a positive relationship between a social media news diet and both offline and online participation. The main results of this study thus suggest that the social network characteristics are more mobilizing than the immediate and interactive nature of more ‘traditional’ online news or a traditional offline news diet.",The Virtuous Circle?

2017-0286,2017,Paper Session,The Mediating Role of Political Talk and Political Efficacy in the Effects of News Use on Expressive and Collective Participation,1,"This study examines how media use for news can relate to expressive and collective participation through the mediating role of political talk and internal and external political efficacy. Based on two cross-sectional analyses and one auto-regressive analysis of the data obtained from a two-wave panel survey during the 2012 presidential campaign in South Korea, this study finds that political talk and internal political efficacy mediate the association between news attention and expressive participation, while external political efficacy does not. Political talk and internal political efficacy jointly mediate the impact of news attention on expressive participation. The analysis also reveals that social media news attention and internal political efficacy play a bigger role in connecting news attention and political participation than traditional news attention, external political efficacy, and political talk.",The Virtuous Circle?

This study takes up that question at a time when online news publishers are reconsidering (if not altogether shutting down) comment sections on their websites because of the challenges inherent in moderating the often vitriolic discourse in such forums. Based on survey data from 648 online news users in the United States, we control for established media use (traditional and social) and political discussion variables that scholars have previously demonstrated predict engagement and participation to answer whether commenting on public affairs news has a unique influence on engagement and participation above and beyond these other activities. We find that commenting on public affairs news does appear to have a positive, incremental effect on civic engagement as well as on political interest and attentiveness. This positive effect is evident both among people who comment on news websites and those who comment on news stories on Facebook. Implications for conceptualizing motivators of engagement and participation, as well as practical implications for news publishers determining whether to continue allowing reader comments, are discussed.",The Virtuous Circle?

Data from a Web survey of a national online panel demonstrate that integrated news use, or the degree to which various media platforms are interconnected for news consumption, is positively associated with civic participation. Data also show that integrated political discussion and integrated political information seeking mediate the relationship between integrated news use and civic participation.

2017-0289,2017,Paper Session,Playful and Critical: The Participatory Satire of Political Fakes and Their Publics,1,"This paper investigates user-generated political satire, focusing on fake political accounts. Such fakes, created as social network profiles, satirize politicians or political organizations by impersonating them. Through semi-structured interviews with a sample of Italian fake accounts creators, I explore how the fakes navigate their fakeness vis-à-vis the affordances of social network sites and their public(s). I identify two modes of faking: mimetic and explicit. I map the interactions of the fakes and their public(s) along two axes: one referring to the public’s understanding of the satire, the other to the uses that the public makes of the satire. Furthermore, I argue for fakeness as a playful, yet powerful critique of politics and its pretense to authenticity. By focusing on how the creators of fake accounts manage their fakeness and interact with their public(s), this paper provides insights on the participatory nature of satire and on the characteristics of online publics.","Fakes, Facts, & Misperceptions on Social Media",Communication and Technology
2017-0290,2017,Paper Session,Do Facebook Users Neglect the Facts? An Experimental Investigation of News Consumption on Social Networking Sites,3,"Given the rising importance of Facebook as a news source, this study investigated how the social media environment alters processes of attitude formation. Based on the heuristic-systematic model, it was expected that the high salience of relationships and self-presentation in social networking sites (SNS) induces an impression-motivated mode of reasoning in which readers strive for attitudes that allow for pleasant social interactions and pay less attention to the quality of information. In an experiment (N = 348), the media context in which a news article was displayed (SNS vs. news site vs. newspaper), the argument quality of the text, and the expectation of future discussions were systematically varied. Results showed higher levels of impression motivation and a slightly reduced influence of argument quality when participants expected to write a Facebook post on the topic. However, merely being connected to Facebook did not significantly alter readers’ direction of information processing.","Fakes, Facts, & Misperceptions on Social Media",Communication and Technology

We use an experimental design to consider social correction that occurs via peers, testing both the type of correction (i.e., whether a source is provided or not) and the platform on which the correction occurs (i.e., Facebook versus Twitter). Our results suggest that a source is necessary to correct misperceptions about the causes of the Zika virus on both Facebook and Twitter, but the mechanism by which such correction occurs differs across platforms. Implications for successful social media campaigns to address misinformation are addressed.","Fakes, Facts, & Misperceptions on Social Media",Communication and Technology

Examining Exercise Efficacy and Motivations in a Virtual Environment,2,"The present study examined the effects of avatar embodiment in a virtual world on emerging adult women. Results add to the existing literature on emerging adult women, health efficacy, and avatar embodiment. In a post-test only experimental design, women (N=114) were randomly assigned to a virtual condition either focused on physical activity or physical appearance in Second Life. Additionally, participants were randomly assigned to either a photograph prime or no photograph condition to examine whether priming them to focus on their own physical appearance would influence the effects of avatar embodiment on their health-related attitudes. The present study finds that various combinations of a photograph or no photograph prime and embodiment of a physically active avatar had significant effects on levels of exercise efficacy and exercise motivations. The following manuscript discusses these results in light of research on emerging adult women, virtual embodiment, priming theory, and the Proteus effect.",Technology & Health,Communication and Technology

The current study aims to understand social influence from commenters by answering the following questions: How do online comments impact on subsequent readers’ attitudes and social norms perception regarding the matter covered in newspaper articles? Can such impact vary by the degree of social identification readers feel? Drawing on the literature on social norms (Lapinski & Rimal, 2005) and Social Identification/Deindividuation (SIDE) model (Reicher, Spears, & Postmes, 1995), the current study examined how the valence of comments affects comment readers’ responses and how social identification process influences changes in such responses. Findings from an online experiment supported the SIDE: stronger social identification with anonymous comment posters increased social influence in a way that comment readers who strongly identified with comment posters showed a greater level of changes in their attitudes and social norms perceptions.",Technology & Health,Communication and Technology
2017-0294,2017,Paper Session,How Does Online Patient-Provider Communication Heal? An Exploratory Study in China,1,"China has faced the problem of having health care service that is expensive and difficult to access. Online patient-provider communication may bring a new option for the delivery of health services. However, online communication with doctors is still novel to many people. Also, little is known about how online patient-provider communication can improve health outcomes. Based on an integrated model that incorporated Social Cognitive Theory into the Three-stage model of health promotion using interactive media, this study tested the social mechanism underlying the impact of online patient-provider communication. Results indicated that self-efficacy, behavioral capability and outcome expectation positively predicted online patient-provider communication at stage 1, which in turn increased patient satisfaction at stage 2, which finally improved three types of health outcomes (general, emotional, and physical) at stage 3. In addition, quality of users’ experience in online patient-provider communicate positively moderated this mediation pathway.

This study investigates whether people are equally likely to use the various types of mobile health apps that exist. We examined whether systematic differences exist among people who use and people who not use mobile health apps, and which factors predict the use of different types of health apps. Findings from a large representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 1,079) suggest that mobile health app use is not randomly distributed across users. A person’s gender, age, education, e-health literacy skills, and privacy concerns are all associated with use, but vary in predicting use of specific mobile health app categories.

2017-0296,2017,Paper Session,A Systematic Literature Review of User Performance and Subjective Experience Determinants of Augmented Reality Applications,4,"Although Augmented Reality (AR) technology is still in its infancy, applications have been rapidly developed. Claimed advantages are the ability to visualize processes, to increase motivation of users and to produce safer, cost-reducing and more effective skills training. Recently, a large number of studies examined determinants of AR effectiveness to maximize the potential benefits. However, no overview of AR effectiveness determinants is available to guide researchers, developers, and investors. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of user performance and user subjective experience determinants of AR applications. In our preliminary analyses on 30 papers we identified three types of determinants, i.e. AR system aspects, device aspects and task aspects. Although aspects that simplifies the task, visually supports the user and provide high view quality seems to improve performance and experience, too overwhelming augmentations should be avoided. Further research can use this review to design effective experiments and examine unexplored determinants.",Experimental Research on Virtual Reality and Human Robot Interaction,Communication and Technology

However, research into the effects of AR apps on persuasion outcomes; or the underlying processes that may explain these effects, is still in its infancy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine three underlying processes (presence, perceived personalization and perceived intrusiveness) that could explain the effect of an AR branded app - compared to a branded app without AR - on persuasive responses. An experiment (N = 113) showed that an AR branded app enhanced persuasive responses via presence and perceived personalization. However, AR branded apps also induced higher perceived intrusiveness, which negatively affected persuasive responses.

However, the most efficient type of perspective switch might not always be the best regarding the user experience. We investigated the effects of perspective switching (tracking shot vs. teleport) and the type of camera movement in the switched perspective (free vs. restricted) on spatial orientation, cybersickness and user experience. Additionally, we accounted for the ability of both users to communicate directly with each other, found in collocated virtual setups. In our experiment, participants played a multi-user VR game on a Powerwall in groups of two. Results revealed that tracking shot lead to a better spatial orientation than teleport. Additionally, tracking shots with free movement were rated as the best option. None of the perspective switch conditions showed differences in the feeling of cybersickness.

We introduce the Self-Efficacy in HRI Scale and present two experimental studies. In study 1 (students, n=60) we found that any interaction with the robot increased self-efficacy, regardless of whether this interaction involves customization or not. Moreover, individual increases in self-efficacy predict more positive evaluations. In a second study with elderly users (n=60) we could replicate the general positive effect of the interaction on self-efficacy. Again, we did not find the hypothesized stronger effect of customization on self-efficacy, nor did we find that relationship between self-efficacy increase and evaluation. We discuss limitations of the setting and implications for questionnaire design for elderly participants.",Experimental Research on Virtual Reality and Human Robot Interaction,Communication and Technology

The data presented were collected during the planning and scoping phase of an ICT-based participation platform aimed at improving local governance in Togo. We combine data from a Social Network Analysis and a representative survey of 1.500 households. Based on these data we conclude that the success of an ICT-supported intervention in transforming local power structures depends on its adequate adaption to the political, social and technical environment. Specifically, we argue that decisions about the stage of the public policy cycle at which ICT-projects intervene needs to be informed by the nature of local power relations and the distribution of access to ICT and participation opportunities across different socio-economic groups of the intervention’s target population.",New and Innovative Experimental Work in Political Communication,Political Communication
2017-0301,2017,Paper Session,Eye Movements Reveal the Competitive Dynamics of Social Cues During Political Stereotyping,2,"An emerging body of work has investigated how voters use stereotypes when faced with multiple social cues (e.g., female Republican vs. male Democrat). Some studies show that political candidates are stereotyped by their party affiliation while others show that gender biases exert a greater influence than party cues. In the current study, we examined the possibility of both cues exerting an influence on political stereotyping but at different stages of information processing. We use an eye movement measure of political stereotyping in order to examine how partisan and gender biases unfold across time as voters evaluate political candidates. We find evidence that gender biases can occur at early stages while partisan bias can occur at later stages of processing. Our results suggest that studies that don’t take into account the dynamic nature of stereotyping might under or overestimate the influence of either cues in shaping political judgments.",New and Innovative Experimental Work in Political Communication,Political Communication

Yet, we know little about how individuals manage interpersonal political disagreement with peers: do they avoid it or yield, try to dominate others, or seek compromise? Based on two survey experiments, we study how individuals manage interpersonal political disagreement in relation to ideological (party choice) and issue (family reunification) differences. The results from both experiments show that individuals are more likely to yield and dominate when the level of political disagreement is at a respectively low and high level.

2017-0303,2017,Paper Session,How Censorship of Criticism Reduces Perceptions of Government Responsiveness,3,"Scholars have long argued that authoritarian regimes want to suppress independent voices, especially criticisms of the regime. However, recent evidence from China shows that the government allows criticism to circulate online without censoring it. We provide a citizen-centered rationale for why autocrats might find it beneficial to allow criticism. Using an experiment embedded in a representative survey of urban residents in China, we show that when individuals believe that censorship is wide ranging and encompasses discussions of government policies, individuals view the regime as less responsive to their concerns, and they are in turn more likely to say that they would participate in collective action in the future. Our evidence suggests that allowing for criticism bolsters the public's belief in regime responsiveness and makes the public more likely to voice their grievances through state-sanctioned channels of participation rather than through extra-institutional or illegal means.",New and Innovative Experimental Work in Political Communication,Political Communication

This study analyzed the current international news flow with a big data analysis of 4,708 online news sources from 67 countries around the world in 2015. We also expanded the information news flow literature by incorporating the theoretical perspective of intermedia agenda setting and investigated how news media in different countries influenced each other in covering major topics. Overall, the results showed that stronger, wealthier countries not only continued to be more newsworthy than the rest of the world, they were also more likely to set the media agenda of less powerful countries.

In this essay, we seek to intervene in online research practices by putting forth a feminist approach to privacy, drawing on two studies related to online harassment. Specifically, we argue that feminist theory and methodology informs an approach to privacy that (a) starts from the lives of socially and politically vulnerable groups, (b) takes an intersectional approach to analyzing power relations, and (c) draws on a moral imperative of care and responsibility in enacting feminist principles of context, dialogue, and reflexivity throughout the research process.

Posting mugshots to state-sponsored Facebook pages has lasting impacts on the accused because of the nature of digital footprints (Hess and Waller, 2014). In addition to shaping a person’s identity, publishing mugshots on Facebook gives the public an opportunity to comment, exposing accused individuals to public shaming. In order to illustrate this digital violence, theoretical frameworks are presented and applied to the case of the Utica Police Department—which has been using Facebook to publish mugshots of alleged female prostitutes and the men that solicit them (“johns”). The mugshots of the alleged female offenders have garnered more attention and commentary than those of johns arrested in the same sting. After analyzing the police department’s practices through a postfeminist lens, I conclude that law and policy intervention is needed to protect the accused women.",To Whom Belongs Your Privacy?

Based on the strong correlation between stalking, domestic violence, and intimate partner abuse (Grasgreen, 2012, insidehighered.com), it is fair to say that stalking prevention is synonymous with murder prevention. And because this crime is much more likely to involve women as victims, it is critical that prevention programs are developed to prevent this crime, teach men to respect boundaries and intervene with other men, and provide women with the necessary tools to keep themselves safe and be more aware of predatory strategies. The purpose of this project is to measure the efficacy of a feminist informed, bystander-based stalking prevention program.

2017-0311,2017,Paper Session,Making Sense? The Structure and Meanings of Digital Memetic Nonsense,2,"This paper offers the first systematic analysis of ‘digital memetic nonsense’ – clusters of seemingly meaningless digital texts imitated and circulated by many participants. We evaluated this phenomenon through two conceptual lenses: theories on nonsense in the pre-digital age and the techno-cultural conditions that facilitate contemporary formations. A grounded analysis of 139 nonsensical memes led to their typology into five genres: linguistic silliness, embodied silliness, pastiche, dislocations, and interruptions. An integrative evaluation revealed that if veteran forms of nonsense were often associated with a defiant deconstruction of meanings, digital nonsense serves as a playful social glue that bonds members of phatic, image-oriented, communities. This shift from an intellectual to a more communitive approach transforms nonsense from a reflection on ‘referential meaning’ to a generative source of ‘affective meaning’ that marks the formation of social connections preceding cognitive understanding. We conclude by highlighting the potentially subversive implications of this shift for participatory barriers and community membership.",Understanding Online Irony and Digital Play,Popular Communication

However, literary and legal approaches to parody currently have limited analytic tools to gauge the critical and transformative qualities of such practices. This paper draws on frame alignment theory to offer a novel conceptual framework for such evaluations and demonstrates it in an analysis of 100 music video remakes on YouTube. Focusing on the construction of gender as a thematic anchor, it outlines a typology of five interpretive configurations underlining the relations between music videos and their renditions. Findings suggest a discrepancy between textual and societal forms of critique and possibilities for textual transformation devoid of explicit critical commentary.

Based on a qualitative analysis of 205 ironic texts on Facebook, I explore the ways in which the combination of medium (social network sites), genre (ironic humor) and content (gender and ethnicity) operates in the empowerment of one group and the oppression of the other, resulting in the deepening of social gaps. I show how this triangle leads into the construction of a new overarching social divide, defined here as the physicality-intellect divide. To conclude I assess the broader implications of this new social divide to our understanding of the significant role of social-media-based irony in social segregation and collectivization.",Understanding Online Irony and Digital Play,Popular Communication

Yet, the mechanisms explaining how individual complaints can affect other users’ attitudes toward a company have not yet been granted much attention in research. Drawing on an experiment, this study investigates effects of substantiated (explicative) complaints vs. unsubstantiated complaints (flaming) posted on Facebook on participants’ attitudes toward a company. Results show that substantiated complaints had a more pronounced direct effect on participants’ attitudes than mere flaming. Furthermore, participants assumed flaming to have a stronger effect on other users than on themselves. This difference in presumed effects again resulted in a more positive attitude toward the company among participants.

2017-0317,2017,Paper Session,"To Allow, or to Prohibit? That is the Question: User Comments and Health Campaigns",1,"Nowadays, some public relations officers enable user comments to campaigns, while others do not. With current scholarship focusing mostly on user comments to news, there is still very little we know about user comments to campaigns. This study uses a content analysis of user comments (N = 643) in response to seven videos used in anti-stigma campaigns in Germany, as posted on YouTube and a campaign website. The goal is to investigate the civility and the valence of user comments, as well as to test the impact of five independent variables on these two dependent variables. An important methodological contribution concerns the untangling of comment valence and comment civility. Contrary to previous research on user comments to news (Hlavach & Freivogel, 2011; Jaspal, Nerlick, & Koteyko, 2013; Secko, Talalka, Dunlop, Kingdon, & Amend, 2011), we found that user comments tended to be positive (71.5%, n = 460); most of the negative comments were also civil (54.6%, n = 100). Further, we found that negativity varied mostly based on message interactivity (see Rafaeli, 1988, p. 111) and the target of negativity. The distribution channel was the best predictor of incivility – with comments on YouTube being significantly more uncivil than on the campaign website. It is possible that these results indicate both a different user behavior in the context of anti-stigma campaigns and a tight moderation by campaign managers. Future studies on user comments to other types of PR campaigns and in different countries are needed to verify our findings.",Social Media: Interventions in Times of Crisis,Public Relations
2017-0318,2017,Paper Session,To Post or Not to Post on Organizational Facebook Pages?: Testing a Privacy Management Model for Millennials on Social Media,2,"This study answers recent calls to understand privacy management on social media by millennials. Following the Theory of Reasoned Action and Communication Privacy Management Theory, the current study conducts a survey to the millennial generation and examines the effect of individual privacy boundary as a predisposing factor of privacy concerns as well as the subsequent relationship between privacy concerns and intention to use social media. The findings show that those who have higher privacy rules in boundary permeability and boundary linkage are likely to have lower privacy concerns in social media communications. Additionally, when social media users, who concern their privacy against being monitoring more than others, result in less intentions to use Facebook as the purpose of corporate communications. Through unexpected outcomes, the present study also provides the probability of changed social norms among millennials and the unique feature of social media platforms, affecting individual privacy management.",Social Media: Interventions in Times of Crisis,Public Relations

The purpose of this study was to explore women’s perceptions of media and body image during the perinatal period. Fredrickson’s objectification theory provided a theoretical framework for the study. Data collection involved semi-structured in-depth interviews with 50 pregnant or postpartum women in which they were asked to describe their perceptions of media and its impact on their body image. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Four major themes emerged: 1) participants generally viewed media depictions of pregnant and postpartum women as being unrealistic, 2) participants described complex reactions to media messages including negative impacts on body image and strategies for mitigating negative impacts, 3) participants desired changes in media messages to be more realistic and to depict a more complex portrayal of the life stage, 4) participants discussed the unique role of social media.

Discussion about GM food includes the implementation of mandatory labeling as well as public concerns about potential health hazards posed by GM food. Previous studies mainly focus on traditional press and broadcast media, few investigate such controversial topics on social media. Interested in public opinion about this issue and possible influences of social media on public opinion, this study uses quantitative content analysis to examine the characteristics of user comments on a specific social media platform, YouTube. The purpose of the study is to investigate YouTube comments from several aspects, encompassing attributes, valence, sources cited to support opinions, motivations of commenting, along with other characteristics (uncertainty, interactivity, and hostility) embedded in these comments. In addition, the study also examines whether there are relationships between some of the variables mentioned above. Findings in this study showed that the most discussed issue related to GM food among YouTube users was informative education, and viewers were prone to comment in a negative tone. Interestingly, uncertainty manifested in the comments was associated with interactivity among commenters. Additionally, hostility toward GM food and mass media were highly associated with interactivity among commenters.",Media Portrayals and Public Perceptions of Health-Related Topics,Health Communication

Methods: We conducted six focus groups with 49 mothers of young children (< 6 years). Participants were shown three videos of news stories discussing pediatric injury research (car seats, household poisoning, high chairs).
Results: Discussion of story content revealed clear engagement with the dangers presented in the news stories. Almost all participants (94-98%) recalled key information about the injury event depicted, but recall of statistical information was not as robust (51-82%). Mothers were most likely to report being interested in either the story about a specific child or the injury statistics presented; fewer participants reported prioritizing any preventive guidelines presented in the coverage.
Conclusion: Certain story elements (type of family portrayed, use of statistics) influence whether news injury-informing news stories are compelling to the intended audience (specifically, mothers of young children).",Media Portrayals and Public Perceptions of Health-Related Topics,Health Communication

In this conceptualisation, framing devices and reasoning devices are presented as the building blocks of frames, and news values are perceived as their driving forces in the process of frame-building. It is argued that, in the practice of news production, journalistic news values lead to cultural news frames through the implementation of news pegs and story angles. The challenge for research is to identify the conditions that determine the adherence to news pegs and the predetermined features of story angles. Influencing factors are identified on three levels: institutional, organisational and individual. Based on the understanding of frame-building in journalism practice, this essay concludes by suggesting how journalists may contribute to frame diversity.",Understanding the Framing of News,Journalism Studies

As a context of study, the recent Ebola pandemic (2014 – 2015) was used. An automated content analysis was applied to U.S. newspaper articles (N = 1,079) and GOs press releases (N = 324). The findings of (reciprocal) time series analyses illustrate how different communication processes (news frame diversity, frame alignment) relate to each other and develop over time. The results imply that a level of common interpretation between actors can foster the openness of news media for a variety of narratives and viewpoints.

Integrating theories of media ritual and framing, this study explores how Chinese state media ritualistically manufacture a public consensus on the interpretation of the annual Spring Festival homecoming, a chronic social problem that exposes socioeconomic inequalities and policy deficiencies. An analysis of the 2014 homecoming coverage on China Central Television (CCTV) reveals that state media create and popularize a state-sponsored social drama, reducing a complex, multifaceted social problem to a one-dimensional transportation crisis. This media ritual, in accordance with both the state’s mandate to maintain social stability and the media’s logic of commercial success, contains alternative interpretations and obscures the important social concerns encapsulated in this issue.",Understanding the Framing of News,Journalism Studies

This study examines how increased public awareness of the story of the Aylan’s death impacted the visual coverage of the refugee crisis as an international media event. An analysis of visual framing on four levels (denotative, stylistic, connotative, ideological representations) of refugees published on CNN International and Der Spiegel online news sites (N=438) reveals that the visual coverage of the refugee crisis (2015 and 2016) differed significantly after the publication of the Aylan’s picture compared to the visual coverage before his death. While CNN International shifted toward more humanized visual frames, Der Spiegel’s visual coverage shifted toward increased law enforcement and border control frame interpretations. Differences are discussed in terms of global news outlets compared to national news outlets and their potential of covering a global crisis from a global journalism perspective.",Understanding the Framing of News,Journalism Studies

Ensuring Comparative Equivalence in the Semantic Analysis of Heterogeneous, Multilingual Corpora",1,"Many computational approaches are optimized for treating large quantities of similar textual material, but suffer from severe validity problems if applied to heterogeneous or multilingual corpora. This paper explicates and discusses several tacit assumptions about the homogeneity of analyzed material that are hard coded into many existing tools, and reviews possible biases and artifacts that result from applying these to heterogeneous discourse. Specifically, the paper argues that operational equivalence must be established both at the level of semantic entities, and the level of meaningful associations between these. Introducing Jamcode, a dictionary-based tool developed for the comparative analysis of statements and frames expressed in political debates, strategic communication, news, and social media in eight languages, the paper presents suitable strategies for ensuring equivalence. Presenting results from a sequence of validation studies, the paper discusses specific trade-offs and remaining limitations of the tool, and charts the way for further development.",New Software and Tools for Analyzing Communication,Computational Methods

Moreover, as we move from thousands of documents to millions of documents, data management and parallel computing become crucial to project success, but both are difficult to get right without a strong computational background.

We contribute to solving these issues by presenting a combination of three technologies that complement each other and make the various tasks involved in text analysis easier: corpus management (AmCAT), linguistic processing (NLPipe), and substantive analysis (using R).

In this paper we analyze content-based globalizational tactics utilized by producers who are increasingly targeting global audiences. We briefly review developments in the corporatization of popular Hindi cinema, then examine the impact of globalizational forces on geographical, cultural, political, infrastructural/technological, and artistic dimensions of cinematic content utilizing data drawn from a long-term study of 68 years of top-grossing Hindi cinema between 1947 and 2015.

Drawing on Hong Kong Daigou as an example, the study provides insights into Mainland-Hong Kong cross-border tensions from the perspective of mobility. Through the lens of mediated mobilities, this study demonstrates that bodily movements and virtual and imaginative travelling online are inseparable in producing the specific mobility patterns of cross-border Daigou practices. The assemblage of body, technology, and symbolic flow produces mediated corporeal mobilities for some practitioners to make resourceful engagements with material and immaterial forms of mobility. I argue that the disproportionate utilization of mobilities and discoursing of mobilities by various actors to some extent anchor the social differentiation and inequality in the societies.

Using interviews with focus groups and an advertising practitioner, the author argues that the multilayered structure of cultural proximity in advertising adaptations is created through combinations of national, global, and subcultural characteristics of youth groups presented for consumption in the media materials, in which content reflects a hybrid national culture by reinscribing Turkish national identities. Specifically, national language is closely intertwined with national culture and local humor as key constituents of Turkish nationalism work through localization strategies and distinguish the local identities of national audiences within a global media culture and a format trade economy.",Global Media Cultures and Consumption,Global Communication and Social Change

It is argued that localization involves the interplay of an array of complex forces, the final outcome of which is the result of a process of negotiation. Firstly, the paper details the distinctively Korean practice and Chinese television professionals’ response to these practices. It is shown that the more informal methods employed result in a transfer of decision-making power from the Korean company to the Chinese company in the course of the production. Secondly, as a television format show produced in China, the production of Hurry Up, Brother necessarily involved interaction with political forces as well as cultural differences between China and Korea.

By analyzing the detail of a specific excerpt, we propose, more precisely, to draw a portrait of the various figures that appear to express themselves in what could be called online help in action. Beyond the various psychotherapeutic approaches that are supposed to inform what the volunteers are saying and doing, our goal is to start with their practices to determine the figures that they implicitly or explicitly stage in their turns of talk to help out the callers. By analyzing the relational aspects of these conversations, we thus show that these sessions can be compared to a modern form of exorcism, where the callers’ distress, uneasiness or suffering is meant to pass in and through the conversations.

Examples of video recorded family dinner interactions are discussed adopting a conversation-analytic approach. They illustrate how family dialogues are organized by moral ideas yet, at the same time, they (re)produces the value system, moral order and the canonical versions of the world for the participants. Particularly, we focus on instances where a basic moral principle - the primacy of the other over the self - is made relevant as an organizing principle of the ongoing activity and “talked into being” to manage contingent tasks (e.g. pursuing synchronicity, distributing food).

We present 5 forms of narrative-like extended discourse structures and their relations: a co-constructed full-blown narrative, instruction, recount, exemplum, and small story. The Labovian full-blown narrative is co-constructed since the caller ends their telling in the complicating action, and then the host provides (in her instructions) possible resolution. As the interaction progresses, callers use exemplums and recounts more. Callers use small stories to avoid divulging information.

This study investigated whether speakers’ referential communication benefits from an explicitly stimulated attention to addressees’ perspective. This aim was experimentally investigated among student dyads taking part in a referential communication game in which they were randomly assigned the role of the speaker or addressee. Dyads were allocated to one of three experimental settings, each eliciting a different perspective mindset (none, self-focus, other-focus). In the two perspective settings, speakers were explicitly instructed to regard their addressee’s (other-focus) or their own (self-focus) perspective before construing their referential message. Results indicated that eliciting speakers’ self- versus other-awareness did not influence speakers’ audience design. We did find a relationship between speakers’ self-reported perspective-taking tendency and their actual referential behavior. Self-focused speakers reported a higher perspective-taking tendency than other-focused speakers.

This study approaches issues of intergroup relations from a novel perspective: instead of examining how individuals perceive outgroup members as more or less threatening than ingroup members, we examine the implications of whether individuals perceive ingroup versus outgroup members to be endangered. Because race and gender are frequently used as heuristics for potential threat, we explore whether people support the employment of the AMBER Alert system and other public resources to help recover missing children depending on how endangered they perceive the missing children to be, based on the children’s race and gender. Results indicate that younger (vs. older), female (vs. male), and White (vs. Black) children receive more support when they are missing, and White girls are favored over other children.",Explorations of Prejudice and Bias in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication

A full examination of 100 percent (over 14 hours) CCTV’s broadcast coverage revealed that women athletes received less media attention in terms of clock-time and name mentions. Regarding word-by-word commentary ascribed to the gymnasts, CCTV employees significantly devoted more descriptors related to personality and physicality to women athletes, indicating a noticeable deviation from the Chinese traditional gendered frame of depicting women athletes as tenacious fighters with their non-sport-related aspects rarely covered.

How German Television Viewers Respond to the Precarious Issues of the Rio Olympics,5,"The 2016 Rio Olympics were overshadowed by negative developments in the global sports world and general difficulties of such mega events. Our study argues that these circumstances burden the untroubled enjoyment for the television viewers. The study aims to find out which strategies of coping with this burden are applied by the audience in regard to their reception behavior and which audience characteristics explain the choice for different response patterns. We conducted a conjoint analysis among 300 German television viewers. Measuring viewers’ preferences for varying portions of reporting on positive and negative facets of Rio 2016 and the sports world we identified three response patterns: ignoring the negative issues, escaping into the beautiful façade of Rio 2016, or favoring to get confronted with the problems of the event. Thereby, the viewers’ sports involvement, but not their political sophistication affects the response towards the (sport-) political aspects of sport mega events.","The 2016 Rio Olympics: Content, Uses, and Effects",Sports Communication

The desire for nationalized emulation significantly predicted of televisual media consumption; the desire for nationalized identification and protection significantly predicted both print and digital media consumption. Differential motivations for identifying with Australia, fan involvement, and media consumption all yielded significant relationships with connection to the Olympics as a whole.

2017-0354,2017,Paper Session,Authenticity of an Online Communicator: Toward an Integration of Credibility and Warranting Theory,2,"When people make decisions, they want to know if the information they obtain online comes from authentic sources. Online judgments of authenticity involve evaluating at least two criteria: the warranting value of information and source credibility. The warranting value of information is the extent to which information is perceived to be immune to manipulation by the person to whom it pertains. Source credibility refers to whether a communicator knows and is willing to tell the truth. This paper develops two theoretically novel aspects of warranting theory: meta-warranting (claimants’ tendency to be more truthful when an observer can corroborate their claims than when observers cannot) and meta-meta-warranting (an observer’s perception that a claimant is truthful when the claimant’s social network is accessible). It proposes that future studies on warranting theory should consider the effects of meta-warranting and meta-meta-warranting and how source credibility moderates the warranting value of information.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

We investigated the trade-off between expected benefits and perceived concerns, also known as the privacy calculus, and further asked how social affordances influence both self-disclosure and the privacy calculus. In an online experiment, we asked 160 participants to register on a mock-up SNS. Results showed that expected social support and situational privacy concerns predicted self-disclosure, implying that the privacy calculus can also be replicated in a behavioral setting. Social affordances (i.e., the similarity of participants to other users and the quantity of information disclosed by others users) increased self-disclosure; similarity affected the privacy calculus by reducing situational privacy concerns.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

Given the affordances of internet technologies that enable users to initiate and maintain relationships across temporal and spatial boundaries, the concept of tie strength may need to be reconceptualized for today's highly mediated environment. We first review how scholars have previously discussed and analyzed tie strength in social network site settings, based on a systematic review of 70 academic articles published before June 2016 on the topic. Our results reveal that numerous studies operate without a definition of tie strength and most studies still focus on the dichotomy of strong vs. weak ties. Additionally, scholars frequently mention social media affordances but rarely define them or connect them to the tie strength concept. Based on this assessment of the extant research, we suggest theory-based amendments of definitions and operationalizations, which consider the relationship-building capabilities of today’s social media platforms.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

We employed experience sampling methods (ESM) and collected data over the course of two weeks from a random sample of college students (N = 154), combined with surveys at baseline and endpoint. We show that individuals who prefer to be more available report more rewarding interactions with weak ties. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the quality of weak tie interactions mediates the relationship between availability preferences and changes in social capital. We conclude by discussing the interrelationships between availability, interaction quality, and social capital. We propose availability preferences as an individual differences construct that should be considered in future research.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

Beyond these macro forces, Trumpism was driven by changes in communication itself: the rapid decline of mainstream journalism, shift to social media and accompanying homophily and polarization, the blurring of lines between entertainment and news, and more deeply the decline of fact-based discourse in the formation of political judgment.

Previous research finds mixed evidence as to the issue. Bases on observation of a parallel growing of party polarization and voter turnout in Hong Kong, this study suggests a moderated mediation model to explain voting behaviors in a polarized party system. With a representative sample, results reveal the positive association between perceived party polarization and political learning which is manifested in acquisition of political knowledge and political self-efficacy, and increased voter turnout subsequently. Furthermore, the mediation process is found to be partly moderated by individual’s exposure to political information. Findings suggest that feelings of political self-efficacy serve as moderated mediators, and that levels of political knowledge solely functions as a mediator whose value is not contingent upon levels of political information exposure. These findings are discussed in the context of party polarization and Hong Kong’s democratization under “one country, two systems” arrangement.",Media Researchers' Reflection on Elections,Mass Communication

In contrast to this, less extreme forms of destructive user behavior have received only little attention. The current paper strives to overcome this research gap by focusing on dysfunctional commenting styles in public Facebook discussions. We presented controversial online comments to 256 Facebook users asking them to consider their likely response on several scales ranging from a functional to a dysfunctional style of reasoning. Users’ intended commenting was then linked to several personality traits (Big Five, Dark Triad, sensation seeking, and impulsivity) and their Facebook intensity. Analyses revealed openness, conscientiousness, and experience seeking as negative predictors of participants’ intention to comment dysfunctionally, whereas attentional impulsivity, boredom susceptibility as well as intense Facebook use emerged as positive predictors. No connections were found for the Dark Triad. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

intervention behavior when being offered options from notifying an administrator to direct
confrontation of the offending user. Our results show that not the number of bystanders alone but
the assessment of the situation as an emergency boosts individuals’ intention to intervene

According to the temporal need-threat model (Williams, 2009), ostracism causes instant and universal experience of social pain and negative emotions. Socially anxious people are especially fearful of social rejection. We investigated interplay between ostracism in online spaces, social anxiety, and coping deprivation with a 2 (Exclusion vs. Inclusion) x 2 (Coping Deprivation vs. Control) experimental design that included individuals with various social anxiety levels (N = 142). We used the computerized tool, Ostracism Online, to manipulate ostracism and coping in a social media context. Results showed significant negative effects of ostracism on needs and mood.

We also investigated whether causal attributions moderated this indirect effect. Both studies showed the expected mediation, but only Study 2 supported our moderated mediation model. When participants were inclined to attribute the cause for ostracism to others (i.e., believed they had control over the situation) they experienced anger, which resulted in stronger intentions to watch antisocial clips. When attributions were manipulated (Study 1) and participants were held personally responsible for their exclusion however, it did not result in higher level of anger (compared to an uncontrollable cause). The findings underscore the importance of taking causal attributions into account when investigating effects of ostracism on SNS.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems
2017-0365,2017,Paper Session,Lifecycle analysis of political misinformation on social media,4,"This study examines how political misinformation spreads on social media focusing on three components: temporal pattern, message, and source. We traced the lifecycle of 17 popular political rumors that circulated on Twitter over 13 months during the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Using computational methods combined with rigorous human coding, we found that false rumors (misinformation) tend to come back multiple times, while true rumors (facts) do not. Rumor resurgence often accompanied changes in content, generally in the direction of exaggeration. We observed that rumors resurface by partisan websites that repackage the old rumor into news, as well as by highly visible Twitter users who introduce such rumor content into the Twittersphere. In this paper, we argue that information diffusion researchers should consider mutability of the diffusing content and partisan strategies behind crafting such messages.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

This research examines this specific form of fear, which we name as Fear of Autonomous Robots and Artificial Intelligence (FARAI). This fear may serve to affect how people will respond to and interact with robots. Results from a nationally representative dataset with probability sampling showed that approximately 26% of participants reported experiencing a heightened level of FARAI. Demographic analyses show that FARAI is connected to participant sex, age, education, and household income. Media exposure to science fiction predicts FARAI above and beyond the demographic variables. Correlational results indicate that FARAI is associated with other types of fear, including loneliness, becoming unemployed, and drone use. In sum, these findings render a much needed glimpse and update regarding how much individuals fear robots and artificial intelligence.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Recent studies on effects of CSR, however, have identified that audiences are increasingly skeptical towards CSR. This project examined the effects of CSR advertising in the context of an advertiser with a positive or a negative reputation on audiences’ persuasion knowledge, advertising skepticism, and attitude toward the advertised brand and product under the hypothesized influence of the audience’s expectancy regarding CSR advertising. The study found that while CSR message in an ad reduced skepticism and increased favorable attitudes, it did not significantly reduce audiences’ persuasion knowledge. Audiences’ expectancy toward CSR, furthermore, did not impact the relationship between exposure to a CSR message and skepticism and attitudes.

Study 1 (survey) investigates the relationship between adolescents’ regulatory focus and attitudes and purchase intentions. The results reveal that adolescents with a promotion focus, as compared to prevention-focused adolescents, have more positive attitudes and a higher purchase intention toward targeting in general. Study 2 (experiment) investigates how chronic regulatory focus can alter attitudes and purchase intentions in a concrete setting that includes targeting (i.e. social networking site). In this regard, the focus lies on the degree of personalization of a targeted ad as a moderator. Results show that a low personalized targeted ad is more effective (i.e. attitudes and purchase intention) among prevention-focused adolescents, whereas a high personalized targeted ad results in better advertising outcomes among promotion-focused adolescents.

Research suggests that viewing LGB-inclusive advertisements may turn off heterosexual consumers, while other studies suggest that LGB-inclusive advertisements can greatly increase brand loyalty among LGB consumers, a niche target audience that 21st century marketers are interested in tapping. This experimental study exposed both heterosexual and LGB participants to a faux magazine that either included other-sex couples in the ads or same-sex couples in the ads. Participants then reported on advertisement appeal, likelihood of purchasing the product/brand, and likelihood of recommending the product/brand. Results indicate that heterosexual consumers may be more accepting of LGB imagery in mainstream advertisements than previous studies suggest but that the high appeal of LGB-inclusive advertisements among LGB consumers is short-term and fades three weeks after exposure to the advertisement.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems
2017-0373,2017,Paper Session,Variation Matters: The Effectiveness of Platform Variation and Content Variation in Social Media Advertising as Mediated by Ad Intrusiveness,1,"Social media advertising may vary in place in that it runs on different platforms and vary in content in that it features different ad executions. Drawing upon psychological reactance theory and the repetition-variation literature, this experimental study employed a 2 (single platform vs. multiple platforms) by 2 (repeated ads vs. varied ads) between-subject factorial design to investigate the impacts of platform variation and content variation on brand attitude and purchase intent. Social media users residing in the United States were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete the study (N = 1097). The findings indicate that platform variation has a conditional indirect effect on brand attitude and purchase intent through ad intrusiveness, and this effect is moderated by content strategy. Specifically, when repeated ads are used, the use of multiple platforms reduces ad intrusiveness, resulting in more favorable brand attitude and greater purchase intent as opposed to the use of a single platform. In contrast, when varied ads are used, no significant differences are found in the outcome variables between single platform and multiple platforms.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

The proposed model consisted of three main parts: brand knowledge (awareness and image), brand relationship quality (satisfaction, trust, and commitment), and consumer response factors (brand preference, brand loyalty, and word of mouth). In a within-subjects design, participants (N = 400) responded to two brands of dessert cafes that differed in brand visibility. Preliminary analysis indicated that the high visibility brand was substantially higher across all evaluative dimensions so separate causal models were constructed for the two brands. Path analyses showed strong support for the proposed model with brand image, brand preference, brand loyalty, and brand commitment all driving word of mouth. Implications of the findings for effective branding strategies in the SME sector are suggested for academics, Thai SME owners, and marketing communication practitioners.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

2017-0376,2017,Paper Session,Online Behavioral Advertising: A Conceptual Framework and Research Agenda,3,"Advertisers are increasingly monitoring people’s online behavior and using the collected information to show people individually targeted advertisements. This phenomenon is called online behavioral advertising (OBA). Although advertisers could benefit from OBA, the practice also raises privacy concerns. Therefore, OBA has received a lot of attention of advertisers, consumers, policymakers, and scholars. Despite this attention, there is no strong definition of OBA, nor a clear accumulation of knowledge about it. This paper defines OBA, and provides an overview of the empirical findings regarding OBA by developing a conceptual framework that identifies and integrates all factors that can explain consumer responses to OBA. The proposed framework shows that the outcomes of OBA are dependent upon ad-related factors (such as the level of personalization), and consumer-related factors (e.g., consumers’ knowledge about and perceptions of OBA, and individual characteristics such as age and privacy concerns). Based on this framework, we develop a research agenda, and discuss implications for policymakers and advertisers.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems
2017-0377,2017,Paper Session,Between Sealed Borders and Welcome Culture: Analyzing Mediated Public Diplomacy During the European Migrant Crisis,1,"Due to the heightened relevance of international contexts, governments increasingly aim to communicate with foreign audiences to convince them of their policies. These strategies can be regarded as part of a nation’s public diplomacy. More specifically, they can be called mediated public diplomacy since it is their main goal to distribute messages through foreign media.
This paper analyzes the communication during the European migrant crisis as one of the most salient transnational issues in 2015/16. Herein, the paper compares Germany’s and Hungary’s mediated public diplomacy, their main topics, frames, and their reliance on information subsidies. Through a comparison with the related coverage in CNN and Al-Jazeera it shows that there is a relationship between the (1) reliance on information subsidies and a (2) correspondence between media agenda and the agenda in the mediated public diplomacy. The media’s frame building, however, seems to be unaffected by the application of information subsidies.","News Media, Public Opinion, and Public Diplomacy Across the Globe",Public Diplomacy

In particular, our findings suggest that respondents’ opinions about Russia have been significantly associated with how they see Vladimir Putin. In addition, this study introduces the level of political personalization of a country in another country’s media as a possible factor in the relationship between how international publics view a nation's leader and their view of his or her country.","News Media, Public Opinion, and Public Diplomacy Across the Globe",Public Diplomacy

The analysis follows three main trajectories: (1) What were the Chinese media’s intended frames in terms of assertives, directives and commissives? (2) What were the locally constructed frames in U.S. media in terms of assertives, directives and commissives? (3) To what degree is there congruence or lack thereof between Chinese intended frames and locally constructed U.S. media frames? There are several core findings of the comparative analysis: Chinese media intend to project China as a “responsible world player” to U.S. audience and “middle power” image at the UN. With a high number of commissives speech acts to match its political values, U.S. media differ in their selective reporting of President Xi’s commissives, directives and assertives from China’s media.","News Media, Public Opinion, and Public Diplomacy Across the Globe",Public Diplomacy

Military service is acknowledged as one of many elements voters use to evaluate candidates, but is understudied in current political communication research. As such, this project looks to the role of military service as a heuristic for voter evaluation of female candidates. A survey was administered to determine the extent that veteran status impacted voter evaluation of female candidates, specifically regarding gender roles and military issues. We found no differences in the patterns with which gender and military status affected evaluations on terrorism and foreign policy given by Democratic male and female, and Republican male participants. However, we found Republican women responded outside of this pattern, instead giving no penalty to candidates for civilian status, but rather a reward to specifically female candidates with military experience.

More insidious, was the presence of benevolent sexism, or the belief that women must be protected. This study delineates the benevolently sexist themes in the debate through a framing analysis of 8,841 online comments on the most circulated articles about transgender persons’ public toilet access between September 2015 and September 2016. While opponents of gender-neutral bathrooms viewed men as unable to contain their sexual desires, supporters argued that women are more likely to be sexually objectified or assaulted outside of public toilets. Both sides re-emphasized a centuries-old script of sexual assault as women’s problem. Our findings suggest a pervasive shifting of the debate from the human rights of transgender persons to the protection of women, without recognizing the patriarchal substructures oppressing women and transgender individuals.",Gendered Discourse in American Politics,Political Communication

Despite this trend, early in the 2016 presidential primaries, Republican Carly Fiorina briefly rose to prominence. In this manuscript, I examine how Fiorina articulated and re-articulated gendered discourses of a conservative woman in an effort to move beyond perceptions of moderation. A qualitative semiotic phenomenological content analysis of her campaign’s official Facebook posts reveals three gendered discourses that emphasize her gender while highlighting her identity as Republican politician. These discourses are: From Secretary to CEO, Every B Word in the Book, and Lady Liberty.

2017-0386,2017,Paper Session,Bridging Gaps in Cross-Cutting Media Exposure: The Role of Public Service Broadcasting,3,"Previous studies show that individual political interest is an antecedent of news media exposure, particularly of exposure to differing views. Nevertheless, little is known about this effect from a comparative perspective: how do media institutions affect the relationship between political interest and exposure to cross-cutting viewpoints? One institutional feature that varies between countries is the ownership of broadcast media. This study investigates the extent to which the relative dominance of public service broadcasting alters the relationship between political interest and non-likeminded, or cross-cutting news media exposure across 27 EU countries. The analyses employ survey data from 27,079 individuals and media content from 48,983 news stories. The results confirm that the extent to which political interest contributes to cross-cutting exposure is contingent on the strength of public service broadcasting. The stronger the broadcaster, the smaller the gaps between the most and least politically engaged individuals.","Cross-Cutting Exposure: Content, Cases, and Effects",Political Communication

Less attention has been paid to the issue of what triggers cross-cutting talk in the first place. Here, we argue that partisan media use, characterized by politically slanted or one-sided content, could be a determinant of this type of political discussion. More specifically, we hypothesize that exposure to partisan news, relative to balanced news, polarizes audiences’ affective evaluations of policy issues and public figures, which in turn reduces their interest in engaging in cross-cutting discussions. These relationships were tested in two studies fielded in the U.S. Study 1 is an original survey experiment on the issue of health care reform, Study 2 is a secondary analysis of a representative post-election survey. The results from both studies provide support for our hypotheses.

Predicting Citizenship With Diverse Exposure and Motivations for Cross-Cutting Exposure,1,"Although scholars consider it important for individuals to consume diverse information and viewpoints to be politically informed and engaged, empirical evidence accumulated so far casts some doubt on the presumed relationship between diverse exposure and good citizenship. That is, individuals who consume diverse viewpoints may not uniformly garner democratic benefits by becoming more politically informed and engaged. To explain the mixed effects of diverse exposure on political knowledge and participation, the current study proposes and demonstrates three distinct motivations for exposure to cross-cutting viewpoints—defensive dismissal, defensive deliberation and balanced deliberation—by expanding on the theory of motivated reasoning. The findings of the present study suggest the importance of different motivations for exposure to diverse viewpoints—rather than the mere exposure—in predicting democratic citizenship indicators such as political knowledge and participation.","Cross-Cutting Exposure: Content, Cases, and Effects",Political Communication
2017-0389,2017,Paper Session,“Predisposed” Exposure: Exploring the Personality Basis for Selective and Cross-Cutting Exposure to Partisan News Media,2,"Why do some partisans engage in selective exposure to ideologically like-minded news sources while other partisans also engage in cross-cutting exposure to unlike minded news sources? The current study attempts to answer this question by exploring the link between openness to experience and consumption of ideologically-oriented news sources. Using a pooled sample of two American National Election Study surveys, this study demonstrated that openness to experience is positively associated with consumption of liberal news sources regardless of self-identified party identification. The findings of the current study reveal that openness to experience is associated with selective exposure for Democrats whereas it is related to “cross-cutting” exposure for Republicans. In other words, openness to experience may encourage “predisposed” exposure to liberal media whose narratives resonate with individual predispositions.","Cross-Cutting Exposure: Content, Cases, and Effects",Political Communication
2017-0390,2017,Paper Session,From Studies of Journalism to Journalism Studies: Defining a Field and its Core Propositions,4,"Journalism studies has grown dramatically in the past two decades, offering an apropo moment to reflect on this vein of research and its contribution to the communication discipline. Too often, we argue, a lack of shared definitions and conceptual frameworks has muddied distinctions between “journalism studies” and “studies of journalism” more generally. This raises the question: What distinguishes journalism studies as a scholarly project? In this article, we define and delineate journalism studies as a distinct field of scholarship in its own right. In tracking the development of journalism studies and its literatures, we articulate a series of six conceptual propositions: contextual sensitivity, holistic relationality, comparative inclination, normative awareness, embedded communicative power, and methodological pluralism. These interrelated features accentuate the core dimensions of journalism studies, establishing the boundaries of the field and its relational, cultural, holistic, ecological, and contextual acts of scholarship.",The Study of Journalism as a Field: Capturing a Moving Target,Journalism Studies
2017-0391,2017,Paper Session,Elements of a Practice Approach to News Production,1,"Among news production scholars, interest in the theories of Bourdieu, Giddens, Latour and related authors has grown in the last twenty years. However, few have recognized that these theories contribute to a broader practice perspective in social theory that traces back to the writings of Wittgenstein. In this essay, I outline four basic elements of this approach that are shared across these theories. Among these elements is the notion that social action is organized into discrete practices, and that these practices are produced and reproduced in their performance by individuals. I then assess the practice scholarship in the sociology of news in the context of these elements. I show that while a great deal of research has focused on news practices, relatively little has investigated journalistic performance. Thus, the field has not exploited as well as it might a central principle of practice theory, namely that practices only arise in the context of performance.",The Study of Journalism as a Field: Capturing a Moving Target,Journalism Studies
2017-0392,2017,Paper Session,Finding the Field in the Flow: An Information Network Analysis of News Websites in the U.S. and U.K. Media Systems,1,"This paper develops and implements a recursive method of network analysis that can complement field theory’s focus on studying structured and structuring relationships between actors within relatively autonomous fields (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Beginning with top-level site domains, hyperlinks are discovered and crawled within and across U.S. and U.K. fields of journalism. The resulting information network maps, or “graphs” reveal persistent national differentiations in an era in which boundaries are tested by seemingly easy information flows. This site-focused method is contrasted with a content-focused method developed and implemented by Benkler et al. (2013) that found a relatively unbounded and robust Internet public sphere in which “attention backbone” sites amplified content produced by smaller sites. By building a network graph on what content flows through, rather than on the content itself, the site-focused approach to information network analysis reveals differentiations that offer a foothold for field analysis.",The Study of Journalism as a Field: Capturing a Moving Target,Journalism Studies
2017-0393,2017,Paper Session,"Fields, Flows, and Frankenstein Journalism",3,"Traditional journalism’s beat system allowed newsworkers to report on their neighbourhoods and communities, while efficiently delivering stories. As the industry struggles to thrive in the new digital ecosystem, however, a ‘beat’ is likely to include stories published online from legacy news websites, or from emerging social media sites. Stories like these are often valued for their virality—that is, how far and fast they have already spread—and their power to attract clicks from readers. More news websites now aggregate or curate such stories as part of their own news offering. Based on an ethnographic study of eight digital newsrooms in Singapore we report how newsmakers used journalistic rituals to legitimise second-hand stories flowing into their journalistic field. We observed the use of rituals of objectivity, multiple sourcing and comparison with other news outlets as mechanisms that newsworkers used to validate and justify their use of second-hand content. In Bourdelian terms, the doxa and habitus of the journalistic field are used to legitimise information flowing in from online sources, rather than offering a means to interrogate or modify the field.",The Study of Journalism as a Field: Capturing a Moving Target,Journalism Studies

The present longitudinal study (N=1006) adds to this line of research by examining the reciprocity of sharing alcohol references on social media and binge drinking among late adolescents (age 16-20 at baseline). Our results indicate that binge drinking and alcohol-related self-presentation affect each other simultaneously over time. However, we found no support for the proposition that the perceived feedback of peers can strengthen the association between sharing alcohol references on social media and binge drinking, nor did we find a direct association between the perceived feedback of peers and alcohol-related self-presentation one year later. Overall, the results indicate that binge drinking and alcohol-related self-presentation on social media should be studied as tied behaviors, affecting each other simultaneously.",The Long View: Taking a Longitudinal Look at the Relationship Between Media Use and Behavioral Outcomes,Children Adolescents and the Media

A Longitudinal Analysis Among 9- to 14-Year-Olds,1,"Prior research has examined the influence of media exposure on cognitive aspects of self-sexualization (e.g., body surveillance and self-objectification), but studies on adolescents’ engagement in self-sexualizing behaviors are lacking. The current three-wave panel study among 10- to 14-year-olds (N = 971, Mage = 12.99, SD = 1.03) showed that watching teen television shows (i.e., direct media exposure) was directly related to engagement in behaviors to appear more sexy, one year later. Additionally, discussing media content with friends (i.e., indirect media exposure) was only indirectly related to self-sexualization through perceived pressure and perceived attainability of the ideal appearances in media. Direct media exposure was not significantly related to perceived pressure nor perceived attainability. Results further suggest that the influence of direct and indirect media exposure unfolds in similar ways for boys and girls, although the model fitted better among the girls. Additionally, reward sensitivity did not moderate the examined relations.",The Long View: Taking a Longitudinal Look at the Relationship Between Media Use and Behavioral Outcomes,Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-0396,2017,Paper Session,Exploring the Long-Term Effects of Academic-Media Multitasking on Adolescents’ Academic Performance,3,"Adolescents frequently use media and communication devices during academic activities. This so-called academic-media multitasking has raised concerns regarding its possible negative impact on adolescents’ academic performance. Although experimental studies found support for the short-term effects of academic-media multitasking on academic performance, evidence for the long-term effects is lacking. Therefore, we examined the long-term effects of academic-media multitasking on adolescents’ documented overall course grade average, and the possible underlying mechanism of academic attention problems. We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study among 1,215 adolescents (11–15 years, 52% boys). Although we found that academic-media multitasking and overall course grade average were negatively associated, the findings showed no support for a long-term direct nor indirect effect of academic-media multitasking on overall course grade average. This study suggests that concerns regarding the negative long-term impact of academic-media multitasking on adolescents’ academic performance need to be qualified.",The Long View: Taking a Longitudinal Look at the Relationship Between Media Use and Behavioral Outcomes,Children Adolescents and the Media

Scholars and health professionals alike have expressed concern about the role of screen media in the rise in ADHD diagnosis. However, the extent to which screen media use and ADHD are linked remains a point of debate. Using the Differential Susceptibility to Media effects Model (Valkenburg & Peter, 2013) as a theoretical lens, we systematically review the existing literature, identify potential shortcomings in this literature, and provide directions for future research. The available evidence suggests a statistically small relationship between media and ADHD-related behaviors. Evidence also suggests that individual child differences, such as gender and trait aggression, may moderate this relationship. There is a clear need for future research that investigates causality, underlying mechanisms, and differential susceptibility to the effects of screen media use on ADHD-related behaviors.",The Long View: Taking a Longitudinal Look at the Relationship Between Media Use and Behavioral Outcomes,Children Adolescents and the Media

To investigate study hypotheses, we employed a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) using structural equation modeling with panel data from 890 children. Results provided evidence in support of a media selection process rather than media effects process whereby increased ADHD-related behaviors predicted an increase in violent media use in subsequent years. Results indicated that this longitudinal relationship was accounted for by within-child fluctuations over time, rather than stable between-child differences. The findings highlight the importance of investigating transactional relationships as well as distinguishing between-person and within-person relationships.",The Long View: Taking a Longitudinal Look at the Relationship Between Media Use and Behavioral Outcomes,Children Adolescents and the Media

The influence of cognitive elaboration on affect and the possible confounding influences from stakeholder characteristics such as trust in organizational communication and dispositional scepticism were also examined. Results from two online experiments with 98 and 111 respondents each revealed that for both types of messages, individuals’ level of issue involvement directly led to positive affect, which, in turn, led to positive attitude and behavioral intention toward the organization. However, the level of thought given to only episodically-framed messages mediated the relationship between issue involvement and positive affect. Individuals’ perceived trustworthiness of and skepticism toward organizational communication moderated the relationship between affect and their attitude toward the organization but not their behavioral intention, and only when exposed to episodically-framed messages.",Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility,Organizational Communication

Analyzing the Chinese public’s response to and interpretation of Google’s break-up with China in 2010, this paper summarizes the public opinion with the three categories of attention, emotion, and reason, and then further explicates the category of reason with three subcategories of economic, political, and moral reasoning. Findings of this research reveal that the public imagination of corporate responsibilities is still confined by national boundaries and the boundaries between the public and private sectors. As a result, although high hope is invested in transnational corporations to spearhead global human right efforts, especially in countries where such rights are infringed by the government, lingering of these boundaries in the public imagination makes such expectation difficult to fulfill.",Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility,Organizational Communication

Specifically, we examine the influence of one important yet undertheorized institutional factor, ownership structure (i.e., whether a firm is a state-owned enterprise, private enterprise, or multinational enterprise), on firms’ CSR practices in China. We focus on how the institutional differences among the three types of ownership structures are manifested in firms’ social issue portfolios and interorganizational partnerships. Data from 212 firms operating in China suggests that ownership structures significantly influence firms’ social issue portfolios and interorganizational partnerships. Implications for the study of CSR, institutional theory, and interorganizational partnerships are drawn from the findings.",Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility,Organizational Communication
2017-0402,2017,Paper Session,Modelling a Process Approach to Operationalizing Stakeholder Engagement: A CSR Perspective,2,"This paper proposes a process model of operationalizing stakeholder engagement in the context of CSR. Data from nine companies about the engagement activities they undertake as part of their CSR operations are used to extend and refine an existing process model of stakeholder engagement. The revised model includes a three-step process of operationalization: identifying and selecting participants, reaching them and securing their interest, and implementing engagement tactics. The engagement leads to legitimation of the organization involved, the process of engagement itself, and the decisions reached as an outcome of that engagement. From a practitioner perspective, this paper provides insights into factors that both facilitate and impede the conduct of stakeholder engagement, thus providing a platform for improving the experience for those involved. Theoretically, the paper makes a contribution to the ongoing attempts to develop a model of stakeholder engagement that adequately encompasses its complexity and challenges.",Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility,Organizational Communication

Analyzing self-report data of 104 parent-child dyads, we investigated the associations between parents’ and children’s communication competence and the role of family communication patterns in parental socialization of communication competence. Specifically, we considered two aspects of competence: effectiveness and appropriateness. Results show that parent self-reported FtF communication appropriateness was directly associated with child self-reported FtF and TMC appropriateness. Children’s perceptions of conversation orientation were positively associated with their self-reported FtF and TMC effectiveness. Finally, parents’ perceptions of conformity orientation were positively linked to children’s self-reported FtF communication appropriateness. These findings highlight that parental influences may manifest through different mechanisms for children’s communication effectiveness and appropriateness. Further, our results indicate that parents play a role in children’s development of communication skills not only in FtF interactions, but also in TMC.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Participants included 241 young adult children who completed online surveys. Results indicate that parents’ negative disclosures to their children mediated the associations between both dimensions of coparental communication and both relational outcomes. Indirect effects of supportive and antagonistic coparental communication through mothers’ negative disclosures emerged for children’s closeness with mothers, but not satisfaction. Indirect effects of both forms of coparental communication through mothers’ negative disclosures also emerged for children’s closeness and satisfaction with fathers. Ultimately, the results underscore the importance of disclosure as an explanatory mechanism for the associations between coparental communication patterns and relational quality in parent-child relationships.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

The current study expands the existing research to patterns of nonverbal parental communication. This study presents a social and situational contexts approach to explain various nonverbal parental communication styles. Parent–child interactions (n = 240) in structured joint-game sequences were filmed in families’ homes and analyzed using a mixed multivariant design. Confirmatory factor analysis produced a conceptualization of patterns of nonverbal parental communication: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. Multifaceted analyses revealed significant effects of a wide range of social and situational contexts. The findings delineated the contexts that activated diverse nonverbal parental communication styles. The proposed theoretical and methodological framework contributes to the research of parent–child interactions and establishes a social and situational approach for patterns of nonverbal parental communication.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

This paper first explores why gamification inspired such vitriol. It finds the incursion of non-game corporations and entities into the field was a threat to the scholars and designers who fought so ardently to legitimize the space and promote a more playful or ludic 21st century. The paper then delves deeper into the literature of play to redefine what occurs when a player engages with a gamified app, such as the social media application Foursquare. In conclusion, it rescripts their activity as “punctuated play” in which the competition, conflict, glory and other aspects of traditional play pierce a particular moment, leaving unexpected and lasting emotional effects.",Best Paper Awards Game Studies Division,Game Studies

The comprehensive social/functional measure of this player-avatar interaction (PAX), however, features some dimensions with limited reliability and is available only in English (despite evidence of potential cultural variations in player-avatar relations). The present study aimed to a) enhance and refine the PAX metric, and b) to translate and validate a common metric that bridges English, German, and traditional Chinese formats. Through exploratory factor analysis of data from MMO players in each of these language-based populations (each n = 281), an improved 18-item common Player Avatar Interaction (cPAX) scale is presented and shown to be reliable within and across populations; construct validity tests show expected associations between scale dimensions and both player-avatar relationship types and senses of human-like relatedness.",Best Paper Awards Game Studies Division,Game Studies

2017-0411,2017,Paper Session,Networked Narratives: Indigenous and White Feminist Writers' Online Networks and Narratives,1,"In an Australian context, online feminist writers have begun to garner mainstream attention for western feminist issues. Writers such as Clementine Ford and Van Badham have become popular online feminist figures that challenge postfeminist narratives in a Western context. However, Indigenous feminist writers and their concerns that revolve around Indigenous women’s issues specifically continue to remain in the shadows. Indigenous feminist writers such as Celeste Liddle and Nakkiah Lui have comparatively similar social media presences as their white counterparts, with very active Facebook and Twitter profiles, however they have substantially fewer followers. This paper examines the online Twitter profiles of Indigenous feminist writers Celeste Liddle and Nakkiah Lui and compares them to the profiles of white feminist writers Clementine Ford and Van Badham. Through this comparison, I uncover how Indigenous feminist writers are challenging postfeminist frameworks as well as how they encounter and engage with the more dominant white feminist narratives.","Hashtagging, Branding, Missing Voices: Social and New Media's Continued Ambiguity as Contested Spaces",Feminist Scholarship

Engaging in feminist content creation in a digital environment thus requires the negotiation of individual self-branding and promotional activities alongside the advancement of collective feminist politics. In this study, interviews with 11 online feminist cultural producers reveal that they reconcile the individualistic undertakings required to succeed in the digital economy and their collective feminist values in three ways. Firstly, they incorporate “authentic feminism” as part of their self-branding endeavors; secondly, they re-define feminism to more closely match the values of post-feminism; and thirdly, they advance peripheral collective goals in their creative communities. It is through these strategies that feminist values are negotiated and reworked, enabling producers to succeed as feminists in a digital economy that is more closely aligned with post-feminism.","Hashtagging, Branding, Missing Voices: Social and New Media's Continued Ambiguity as Contested Spaces",Feminist Scholarship

What functions do zines perform in the current media landscape, where digital reigns supreme? In this paper, I explore this question specifically in relation to U.S. feminists, whose energetic adoption of the internet has pushed feminist ideas into popular culture and yet, who continue to produce zines and host zine festivals across the country. While feminist zines have been the subject of much writing, little research has considered the relevance of zines for feminists in the digital age, nor have researchers grappled with the complex relationship between digital and print activist media. Drawing on interviews with zinesters, I argue that feminist zines and online feminism should not be seen as materially polarized outlets, but as practices with distinct yet symbiotic advantages working in tandem within a broader repertoire of feminist media tactics.","Hashtagging, Branding, Missing Voices: Social and New Media's Continued Ambiguity as Contested Spaces",Feminist Scholarship

Cognitive dissonance theory was used to derive predictions about how VRI would moderate the relationship between the extent to which a message is counter-attitudinal and various indicators of biased processing. 285 students were exposed to one of two messages about a potentially involving topic and the hypothesized outcomes were recorded with an online survey. The data were largely consistent with VRI as an indicator of an attitude being related to the self-concept as well as VRI moderating biased processing outcomes including perceiving bias in the source, disliking the source, and the belief that the source’s supporters have been misled.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

Mass media play a huge role in shaping our attitudes towards these individuals. The current study tests the assumption that ‘targeted’ media messages (i.e., portrayals of exemplars that match relevant audience characteristics) are more effective in reducing stigmatizing attitudes than unmatched messages. A 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 full-factorial experiment was conducted, in which 498 respondents were presented a print magazine cover that was manipulated with regard to sex congruency (exemplar’s sex congruent vs. non-congruent with recipients’ sex), occupational context (matched vs. unmatched), hierarchy (same vs. superior status), and type of disability (depression vs. paraplegia). Findings indicate only partial support fort our hypotheses. Destigmatizing effects emerged particularly as interactions of recipient-exemplar sex congruency and same hierarchical status. Further results and implications for non-stigmatizing journalism and strategic anti-stigma communication will be discussed.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

This study conducted a 2 2 2 between-subjects experiment to investigate the interplay between context-induced and ad-induced affect on the effects of a comparative versus a non-comparative advertisement. The results showed that there were significant three-way interaction effects on participants’ ad and brand attitudes. In the condition of positive context-induced affect, participants preferred the comparative ad to the non-comparative ad when ad-induced affect was positive, but expressed similar responses to both types of ads when ad-induced affect was negative. In the condition of negative context-induced affect, participants expressed more favorable responses to the ad that elicited positive affect.

Data from this study supported the hypothesis that (1) personal norms that are more, rather than less, accessible (available in memory) are associated with greater intent to practice pro-environmental and prosocial behaviors among those generally pre­disposed to enact them, and (2) accessibility of personal norms perceptions predicts intentions beyond the influence of the perceptions alone. Preliminary findings indicate reasonable construct validity for the personal norm accessibility measure and suggest that those who seek to increase these behaviors might reasonably pursue methods of enhancing the accessibility of related personal norms among individuals who possess them.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

We compare Black and White adolescents because prior research has suggested that Black and White adolescents often show different magnitudes of media effects. As social media use about television increased, so did the relationship between television exposure and attitude toward alcohol and aggression for both Black and White adolescents.

The study demonstrates a significant interaction between the two variables on the construction of corporate image. The length of CSR involvement is also found to influence people’s attribution of crisis responsibility in a crisis. By comparing corporate image and CSR skepticism before and after a crisis, the study further articulates the destructive power of crises.

Results suggested millennials differentiated among three categories of CSR, consisting of legal-ethical, economic, and philanthropic. Most significantly, moral identity influenced CSR support - implying a high consensus of millennials on the morality of CSR support. CSR awareness - which was found to be low - predicted CSR support, yet attribution of motive did not moderate this relationship.",CSR: Interventions in Research and Practice (High-Density),Public Relations

To fill the research gap, this paper aims to understand how consumer’s perception about corporate social responsibility can determine their information-processing modes and subsequently affect their purchase intentions. Drawing upon the CSR research as well as studies about information processing, this study tests whether different levels of consumers’ agreement on CSR differ in the information processing modes. Further, this paper explores the moderation effect of consumers’ attribution of company’s motives in engaging CSR in relation to CSR agreement on purchase intention. Finally, study proposes an integrated model to understand the relations among consumers’ agreement on CSR, information processing, purchase intention, and CSR attribution. The theoretical implications and practical contribution to public relations were discussed in detail.",CSR: Interventions in Research and Practice (High-Density),Public Relations

This experimental study seeks to determine if there are differences in the effects of issue advocacy messaging across corporate and non-profit entities and whether culture impacts these effects. In addition, this study examines whether there is a difference in public perceptions when the issue is perceived as related vs. unrelated to the organization’s core mission, and it considers the extent of disclosure about corporate activism activities on the communication behavior of publics. This extended abstract summarizes the rationale for this research in progress, and presents the findings of a pilot study of the experimental design, which was modified before being administered to a consumer sample of U.S. and Swiss citizens (N=1,600).",CSR: Interventions in Research and Practice (High-Density),Public Relations

Based on congruence and signaling theory, this study expects that a decreased-usage CSR message from a non-company source will generate better public responses than from a company source. Furthermore, a decreased-usage CSR message with a salient, positive social cue will generate better public responses than the CSR message without such cue. The interaction effect between two factors will be also examined.

Examining the Effects of Choice-of-Cause in Cause-Related Marketing,2,"As a form of CSR, cause-related marketing (CRM) has been considered effective in generating reputational, relational, and financial returns for companies. Recently, a new form of CRM has become popular: choice-of-cause programs in which companies empower consumers to determine which social causes to support. As companies start to invest in such programs, two questions arise: Can this new practice outperform traditional CRM in generating favorable consumer responses? If so, what may strengthen or limit the advantages of this new practice? Responding to these concerns, this study aims at testing the effectiveness of the choice-of-cause program. It also intends to identify the boundary condition (i.e., corporate reputation) that determines when such programs are beneficial and when they become counterproductive. As CRM falls into the larger class of CSR, this study adds to current CSR scholarship in public relations.

My analyses identified three frames—upholding standards, improving workers’ lives and leading revolution. By using these frames, giant corporations are able to delimit their responsibility regarding labor malpractice, especially on the issue of under-compensation. It is also evident that the frames are constructed from a corporate perspective, with little (if any) genuine voice from workers in the global South.

Relying on a representative sample of non-Muslim Dutch surveyed just over a week after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris (N = 409), we find that direct contact through friendship reduces intergroup threat, with attack-related attitudes predicted by friendships strongest. This implies that friendship guards against strong negative reactions towards Muslims after terrorist attacks. With regard to contextual contact we find a consistent but insignificant pattern of friendship moderating the contextual contact effect on anti-Muslim attitudes.

That conceptualization is one that does not fit the experiences of all citizens within the United States. In order to provide a measure of patriotism that may be more culturally sensitive and pragmatically inclusive, this paper uses symbolic interactionism as a theoretical launching point. Three studies were conducted to extract items that would contribute to a culturally sensitive and pragmatically inclusive measure of patriotism. Study one, (n= 30), is a qualitative investigation of African American colloquy; study two (n=199) an EFA is used to assess the factor structure of items created in response to study one. In study three, (n=380), a CFA is conducted to assess goodness-of-fit of a unidimensional relational patriotism scale.

Theoretically, the social psychological perspective on opinion leadership is refined and the goals-plans-action model (Dillard, 1990) is applied to opinion leadership in everyday political conversations. Survey and observational data on conversations of 78 dyads of friends and acquaintances reveal that opinion leadership comes along with the goal to influence, with argument-based opinion giving, and with effects on conversation partner’s opinions. Moreover, results indicate that opinion leadership in political conversations structurally resembles a strategic influence process guided by the goal to influence. By generating concrete findings on communicative influence, this study closes an important academic void of opinion leadership research and provides relevant insights into the political negotiation process.","Discussion, Deliberation, and Everyday Conversation",Political Communication

Many applaud the potential of the Internet to serve to expand the public sphere; others are more cautious about the extent to which the Internet may foster deliberative democracy. We attempt to provide a third alternative view to the democratic potential of digital political communication by 1) focusing on everyday political talks in nonpolitical online discussion forums, and 2) expanding our research beyond a singular deliberative model to attend to multiple forms of online political expressions. Drawing on discussions about six globally prominent political issues in two transnational cricket forums, we examined the modes of online political discourse. Our findings suggest that deliberative discussion coexists with liberal individualist and communitarian forms of communication in online sports forums. We discuss the implications of our findings for the future of mediated political discussion research.","Discussion, Deliberation, and Everyday Conversation",Political Communication

This article investigates media publicity sequenced with a deliberatively-designed mini-public meant to create a program on basic norms of human rights in Brazil – PNDH-3. When ratified by presidential decree and divulged by the media, PNDH-3 received vigorous criticism by powerful national elites and was subsequently reformulated. This study explores processes of public justification for implementing and reviewing the binding-norms of this program; and taps into contradictory effects of the publicity of media-based communication for the purpose of deliberation. Based on DQI (Deliberative Quality Index), our analysis examined 793 statements about the PNDH-3 debate in three major national newspapers and three television news programs between December 2008 and May 2010. Our findings reveal (a) publicity trade-offs during different stages of the deliberative process; (b) distinct types of public scrutiny in news media on issue-specific topics; and (c) mechanisms that undermine the legitimacy of mini-public deliberation, including hindrances for incorporating citizens’ deliberative decisions into a network of governance.","Discussion, Deliberation, and Everyday Conversation",Political Communication

An Empirical Analysis of Online Deliberation on Different News Platforms,3,"Ever since the internet has provided easy access to online debates, advocates of deliberative democracy have hoped for an improved public sphere. This paper investigates which particular platform features promote deliberative debate online. We assume that moderation, asynchronous discussion, a well-defined topic, and the availability of information enhance the level of deliberative quality of user comments. A comparison between different types of news platforms that differ in terms of design (a news forum, news websites, and Facebook news sites) shows that deliberation (rationality, reciprocity, respect, and constructiveness) differs significantly between platforms. The news forum yields the most rational and respectful debate. While user comments on news websites are only slightly less deliberative, Facebook comments perform poorly in terms of deliberative quality. However, comments left on news websites and on Facebook show particularly high levels of reciprocity among users.","Discussion, Deliberation, and Everyday Conversation",Political Communication

The social process through which such reasonable arguments are exchanged also matters. In this study, we examined one key factor in the social process of deliberation, namely, procedural fairness. We hypothesized that procedural fairness not only directly relates to deliberation outcomes (i.e., learning, enjoyment, and legitimacy), but also interacts with other process-related factors to make such influence. Another important factor, disagreement, which has played mixed roles in deliberation, was used to test its interaction with procedural fairness. A field study utilizing survey data showed that procedural fairness directly related to all deliberation outcomes; it also counteracted the dysfunctional social influence of disagreement. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed at the end of the paper.","Discussion, Deliberation, and Everyday Conversation",Political Communication

With regard to media coverage, automated content analysis methods were employed to analyze sentiment, emotionality, and to identify corporate topics related to the companies. A positive effect of the amount of coverage on the volatility of stock prices was detected for Shell and Philips. Granger causality tests also showed a positive effect of emotionality on the volatility of share prices for the same companies. In addition, corporate topics were found to positively Granger cause stock price volatility, particularly for Philips.

2017-0445,2017,Paper Session,Volkswagen’s Postcrisis Reputation Among the German Public,2,"This study investigates the mechanism through which the VW emissions scandal affected the perceptions among different stakeholder groups distinctively. We extended the situational crisis communication theory through identifying the moderation effects of personal relevance and person-company fit in the relationship between crisis responsibility and crisis outcomes. A sample of 721 German respondents was analyzed through structural equation modeling in AMOS. The results suggest that both emotions – anger and sympathy – among the German public mediate the impact of perceived crisis responsibility on post-crisis reputation. However, the negative impact of crisis responsibility on sympathy is stronger among the customers than the non-customers, while no cross-group difference is observed with respect to anger. In addition, personal relevance strengthens the positive relationship between crisis responsibility and anger, and this moderation effect is stronger among customers than non-customers. Next to this, person-company fit weakens the impact of crisis responsibility on anger, as well as on sympathy. The results suggest that more attention needs to be drawn on the personal perspective in crisis communication, while different response strategies should be developed with respect to distinct stakeholder groups for protecting corporate reputation in the crisis context.",Institutions and Corporate Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-0446,2017,Paper Session,Completely Different or Versions of the Same? A Comparison of Mainstream Media (MSM) and Immigration-Critical Alternative Media (ICAM) in Sweden,1,"In Sweden, as in many other european countries, alternative media with immigration-critical profiles have managed to establish themselves as new players in the media landscape in a way that challenges mainstream media (MSM) because their message is that MSM, seen as an integrated part of the political system, conceal or distort information that does not fit the “politically correct” agenda and/or that media discourse is constrained due to taboos upheld by journalists, especially in relation to anything related to immigration. Research on these immigration-critical alternative media (ICAM) is scarce and this paper presents results of a comparative quantitative content analysis, where articles from the most important ICAM is compared to articles from MSM. Through this comparison it is possible to characterize ICAM through the key points where they differ from MSM. The results suggest that they have a much narrower scope of topics (mainly politics, social issues, crime, war and conflicts) compared to MSM. They are also characterized by a much more negative tonality and critical perspective. Furthermore, the relationship between ICAM and MSM is studied through an analysis of how often ICAM refers and links to content in MSM. Over sixty precent of the ICAM articles contained references to MSM, suggesting a relationship of dependence, rather than just one of opposition. The results are discussed in relation to notions of filter bubbles, echo-chambers and cyberbalkanization.","Framing ""Others"": Media's Streotype Constructions",Mass Communication

Results showed that role models representing congruity increased participants’ career possible self. However, interest in a research career was negatively influenced by exposure to role models representing congruity. Further, a stronger pre-exposure family possible self led to a more negative effect of role congruity portrayals on research career interest. Hence, exposure to career role models can backfire attempts to increase women’s participation in STEM fields.","Framing ""Others"": Media's Streotype Constructions",Mass Communication

This experimental study searched for ways to increase the benefits of integrated brands and focused on the subjective feeling of spatial and social presence in movies. In order to verify that increased levels of presence lead to more positive brand evaluations, a 2x2 between subject design was implemented. Altogether, 120 university students watched four different versions of the movie ‘The Martian’ in an authentic cinema laboratory. While the manipulation of the perceived presence through spatial (2D/3D movie) and social cues (low/high level of direct addressment) was not entirely successful, significant positive connections between the level of presence and the evaluation of integrated brands could be found.

A sample of 12- to 18-year-old adolescents (NTime1 = 1,840) filled out a paper-and-pencil survey twice within a six month-interval. Findings revealed that Facebook relationship maintenance behaviors and adolescents’ closeness to friends were reciprocally related over time: Facebook relationship maintenance behaviors positively predicted adolescents’ closeness to friends and, at the same time, closeness to friends positively predicted adolescents’ Facebook relationship maintenance behaviors. In addition, receiving positive Facebook reactions fully mediated these reciprocal relationships. The discussion focuses on the understanding of these findings, directions for future research, and key limitations.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks II,Information Systems
2017-0460,2017,Paper Session,Are You Being Served?: Intervening With Power via Interactive Voice Response and Competing Modalities of Mediated Support Channels,4,"In summer 2015, we conducted an exploratory study of how people in the United States use and respond to robot-like systems in order to achieve their needs through customer service interfaces. We conducted three focus groups sessions along with 50 in-depth interviews. We found that users believe interactive voice response technology deters them from pursuing further contact. Yet, for the most part, people were unwilling to give up on the goals that motivated their initial contact. Consequently, they had to innovate ways to communicate with robots that essentially serve as gatekeepers to their desired ends. These results have implications for communication theory and system design, especially since these systems will be increasingly presented to consumers as social media affordances evolve.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks II,Information Systems
2017-0461,2017,Paper Session,Rejection Sensitivity Widens the Affect Gap Between Strong and Weak Ties,5,"The elevated positive affect that comes from interacting with strong ties, as opposed to weak ties – i.e., the affect gap – is well-established in past research. What remains less clear is whether personality traits modulate the quality of daily interactions with strong and weak ties in distinctive ways. Here we consider the role of trait rejection sensitivity (RS), which refers to the people who worry the most about potential social rejection. Drawing on data from a two-week experience sampling study, we clarify how rejection sensitivity moderates daily interaction supportiveness and enjoyment. We find that RS individuals not only view weak tie interactions as less satisfying, they also perceive strong tie interactions as more rewarding – thus magnifying the affect gap in a radial pattern. Further, we find that this spectral interaction between RS and tie strength occurs more strongly for mediated (vs. face-to-face) interactions. Together, these findings demonstrate the interlocked relationships between personality traits, partner closeness, and communication mode in shaping the quality of everyday interactions.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks II,Information Systems
2017-0462,2017,Paper Session,Talking About Talk: Collaboration and Coordination in Online Communities,3,"Social computing systems and online communities develop varying strategies for managing collaborative processes such as consensus building, task delegation, and conflict management. Although these factors impact both the ways in which communities produce content and the content they produce, little prior work has undertaken a large comparative analysis of these phenomena across the boundaries created by Wikipedia's language editions. In this research, we describe and model the collaborative processes of Wikipedia editors across the 24 largest language editions of the encyclopedias. Our results indicate that language edition predicts a difference in edits as high as 60\% against baseline articles in English. These findings illustrate that editor communities in different language editions of Wikipedia utilize talk pages differently. Our work informs future studies that investigate the impact of culture on collaboration dynamics and ties these differences to patterns in content production.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks II,Information Systems

Building on literature that explores the functionality of online spaces for support and the potential for social comparison that these spaces present, a content analysis of 984 posts and 1730 associated comments selected from a 6-month span of Facebook mom groups, online parenting forums, and popular mommy blogs identified the frequency and type of support (instrumental, informational, emotional) and comparative content (judgmental, validating, neutral) shared on these sites. Given that emotions are often connected to parenting experiences, this content analysis also examined dominant expressed emotions. Coding revealed that emotions were communicated in more than half of posts and more than a third of comments, with joy being the most prevalent emotion in both, but, overall, posts on all three platforms were more negatively than positively valenced.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks II,Information Systems

Specifically, we focused on injunctive norms, defined as the extent to which this type of self-expression is deemed appropriate or inappropriate. To gain a nuanced understanding of the normative patterns, the perceived appropriateness of expressing six discrete emotions (i.e., sadness, anger, disappointment, worry, joy and pride) were investigated on four popular social media platforms. Drawing from a sample of 1201 participants between the ages of 15 and 25 years, we found that positive expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than negative expressions across all platforms. Overall, both positive and negative expressions were considered most appropriate for WhatsApp, and some differences were found between Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Additionally, some sex differences were found, while age did not appear to be a factor.",Social Media and Emotions,Communication and Technology

Overall, likelihood of social sharing on Facebook was higher for positive emotions than negative emotions. There were differences among discrete emotions, with the lowest likelihood of sharing for self-relevant emotions. Overall, more supportive than unsupportive responses to social sharing were expected. More supportive and less unsupportive responses were expected for positive emotion than for negative emotion. Likelihood of sharing positive emotion was associated with greater expectation of supportive responses (e.g., celebrating, sharing in good feelings), and was also higher among those who reported greater offline belongingness. Surprisingly, the likelihood of sharing negative emotions was associated with expecting more unsupportive responses from others.

Users, however, often use these new public forums to talk about their anger and lack of faith in politics. Consequently, the online management of negative voter expressions becomes increasingly important. The current study explores and identifies negative user expressions and how political parties react to them. Therefore, this paper analyses the Facebook pages of seven political parties during the 2013 Austrian national election campaign. Overall, almost half of the 2584 analyzed voter comments on parties‘ Facebook pages contain a negative expression. Half of them contain a statement on a party/politician’s qualification for the job or personal characteristics. Most often voters address the party as organization in their negative comments on Facebook.",Social Media and Emotions,Communication and Technology
2017-0467,2017,Paper Session,Initial Specification and Empirical Test of Media Enjoyment Theory,3,"Building upon online communication attitude research (Ledbetter, 2009), this manuscript explains why people use certain media in their social relationships by offering an initial formulation and test of media enjoyment theory (MET). We investigated whether medium enjoyment mediated the effect of social influence and communication competence on media use. We proposed that perceived miscommunication would moderate the mediating effect of medium enjoyment. Results were consistent with MET across voice telephone, email, text messaging, and Facebook. The results indicate an indirect effect of social influence and communication competence on media use through the mediator of medium enjoyment. The pattern of mediation was strongest when participants held low levels of perceived miscommunication. These results suggest that people are most likely to use media when they perceive high levels of enjoyment from a medium and low levels of perceived miscommunication. Theoretical implications highlight how MET can be developed in multimodal and dyadic contexts.",Social Media and Emotions,Communication and Technology

Based on a survey, filled in by 210 non-users, this article compares the motivations of resisters (people who never started Facebook) and rejecters (people who quit Facebook). Factor analysis shows that these motivations can be grouped into five specific categories. In order of importance these are: (1) Disinterest, (2) Privacy issues, (3) Time management issues, (4) Social pressure, and (5) Platform specific issues. Analysis shows that resisters are more extreme in their opinions and feel more concerned than rejecters in all of the categories.",Social Media Resistance and Silence,Communication and Technology
2017-0469,2017,Paper Session,The Inevitable Decline: Explicating the (Non)Sharing Decisions on Facebook,2,"Although the number of Facebook users is steadily increasing, there has been a significant decrease in sharing activities. This “increase-decline paradox” reflects a growing pain of many online communities where the once active users would eventually become less involved after a period of time, despite many attempts to promote sharing. To resolve this paradox, we propose a multidimensional theoretical model that tests possible effects of platform features, cognitive factors and social comparison on sharing. Using three 2 x 2 experiments (N = 647), we note while platform features such as content type and privacy settings contribute to explaining (non-)sharing decisions, the decline is somewhat inevitable due to a chain of cognitive reactions. This is because increasing Facebook use possibly cultivates ambient awareness, which may lead to higher level of presumed influence of sharing that would eventually result in self-censorship. Counterintuitively, this suggests that Facebook environment features have contradictory influence on sharing. Our study also finds very strong third-person effects, which alludes to the perceived undesirability of sharing as a behavior as well as the misperceptions toward others’ decision-making, which together discourage sharing.",Social Media Resistance and Silence,Communication and Technology

Although previous scholarship has examined differences in between face-to-face and computer-mediated communication, research studies have rarely tested how perceived affordances of the channel influence whether individuals express opinions or self-censor. In this study (N = 399), we examine several propositions of SoS within the context of discussing police discrimination on Facebook. To extend the theory’s relevance to social networking sites, we examined how users’ perceptions of network association, social presence, anonymity, and persistence related to opinion expression. Findings indicate support for some of the theory’s original tenets as well as the role of multiple perceived affordances in determining whether people will express an opinion to their online social network.

Moreover, the participants’ contextual fear of isolation, perceived online anonymity, and opinion congruity with other commenters significantly predict their willingness to post their own views. Yet, neither their dispositional fear of isolation nor the influences of the reported poll result and their reference groups emerged as predictors.

However, only a few studies have explored the effects of the environment of watching on these processes. The current study explores the role of the physical environment and more precisely, the effect of the match in temperature between the environment of the film and that of the room in which the viewer is located. Using an experiment in which both of these variables were manipulated, we found that, as hypothesized, a match between the environments enhances transportation, identification and engagement with the narrative through the mediation of a perceived match in temperatures. Transportation, in turn, leads to enjoyment. However, when transportation is controlled, it is actually the mismatch in temperatures that leads to more enjoyment of the film. These findings are discussed using theories of transportation and identification as well as the notion of escapism.",Emotion in Entertainment Media,Mass Communication

In light of somber entertainment’s capacity to promote slower and more reflective responses, the present study draws from emotional expression research to compare the delayed health effects of hedonistic and somber film genres. A four-condition between-subjects online experiment (N = 127) was conducted to test the moderation of perceived stress and emotional repression on health in a four week interval after engaging a tragic drama or comedy. Results show that compared to a control group, tragic drama engagement (but not comedy) helps to curb physical health symptoms from rising with increasing stress.

In such cases, a conflict arises over scientific knowledge and related policies, in which scientists become more or less involved. Research on partisans in conflicts has shown that the more the members of conflicting parties are convinced of their position the more they perceive media coverage as hostile. Such perceptions can evoke presumptions of detrimental media effects on others and motivate partisans to engage in corrective communication. Such relationships were tested in a survey of 131 (42 %) German professors of climate science. Virtually all climate scientists confirm human-induced climate change. The more strictly they reject doubt about it the more they perceive that the media downplays climate change and the more they presume the media increases politicians’ doubt about it. This presumption, in turn, enhances their acceptance of overstatements of scientific knowledge in public.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication

Yet, social media have altered the way that information reaches people. This study makes the case that opinion leaders still exist, but that they no longer need to rely on information provided by the media, if they have access to first-hand information. We take the most recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) as case study. Attendees of the conference had direct information on what was happening and they were able to share this information live with their followers via social media. We used geo-located tweets to identify Twitter users who attended the COP21 summit and located these users in a data set consisting of tweets that were collected based on the main conference hashtag, representing the wider debate. Our results based on network analysis and Twitter user data show that participants are more central actors compared to the average user in the network and they are more likely to have brokering positions. They show a higher involvement in the debate and get more attention by others. We used automated content analysis to divide the COP21 participants into different actor types and ran the analysis by actor group.

Based on survey data collected from a U.S. consumer panel (N = 567), the present investigation found that the U.S. public’s support for climate change policies was predicted by their attitudes toward climate change actions and policies, collective efficacy, and their communitarian worldview. Attitudes, in turn, were predicted by the utilitarian motivation (i.e., perceived effectiveness), moral motivations, and collective efficacy. Further analysis showed that future orientation and belief certainty that climate change is happening positively predicted the utilitarian and moral motivations, and that future orientation and communitarian worldviews were positively associated with collective efficacy.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication

Results indicate that partisanship explains much of differences in addressing the topic as Democrats are more likely to tweet about climate change. However, within parties different rationales emerged. Democrats were more closely followed a representation model, tweeting more in districts in which public concern about climate change is high. Republicans were more likely to tweet when their districts had salient weather events or large future risks due to climate change, though necessarily in support of climate adaptation or mitigation.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication

A web-based survey experiment of television and print journalists in the top 150 media markets in the United States (N=631) varied whether a news story was about an issue owned by the Republicans (tax relief) or the Democrats (health care) and whether the partisan senator of the party that owned the issue engaged in “cheap talk” or “costly talk.” Journalists believed that the costly talk stories were more newsworthy than those containing cheap talk only. However, journalists were more likely to perceive a hostile media when a member of their preferred political party was reported to have engaged in costly talk—especially when costly talk came from a partisan source whose party owned the issue.","Examining (and Explaining) News Framing, Coverage, and Content",Political Communication

If individuals encounter incompatible narratives projected by different states, how can their acceptance of one narrative over another be explained? This paper suggests that support for the strategic narrative of a foreign government is more likely when there is social and communicative linkage at the individual level, i.e. when an individual maintains personal and cultural connections to the foreign state through regular travel, media consumption, religious attendance and conversations with friends or relatives. The role of linkage is demonstrated in Ukraine, where a ‘pro-Russian, anti-Western’ narrative projected from Moscow has been competing against a ‘pro-Western, anti-Russian’ narrative projected from Kyiv.","Examining (and Explaining) News Framing, Coverage, and Content",Political Communication

More specifically, we examine the extent that journalists take statistical uncertainties into account when covering opinion polls and when providing explanations for changes across opinion polls. We go beyond previous studies by investigating what antecedents help explain variation in poll coverage quality. The results show that journalists make inaccurate interpretations when commenting on differences in polls and provide explanations for changes that are inside of the margin of error in about half of the cases. Furthermore we demonstrate that poll coverage quality varies between different types of media organization and differs between election campaigns and off-election periods.","Examining (and Explaining) News Framing, Coverage, and Content",Political Communication

We adapted both to measure generalized trust in news media and conducted a survey to (a) evaluate the dimensional structures of both adapted scales and to (b) analyze their predictive validity by testing their explanative power on the use of alternative media. Both adapted scales yield well-fitting models but exhibit problems with discriminant validity. The adapted Kohring and Matthes scale successfully predicts the use of partisan media and can therefore be recommended for further research on generalized trust in news media.",Advancing Research on Trust in the News,Journalism Studies

Our results show that, in general, integrating UGC has a negative impact on recipients’ perceived trustworthiness of the news article, both for political and human interest news. Verification of UGC partly shows a positive impact on trustworthiness, but only for political news articles. Visual integration, moreover, has no substantial impact on trustworthiness in either news topic.

This study uses published original and aggregated news articles as stimuli in an online experiment to test readers’ perceptions of news aggregation. It also tests perceptions of headlines written in traditional and clickbait styles.

The case selected is the robbery of a jeweller’s in a town in the Netherlands. The wife of the jeweller was said to have shot two of the robbers. Although this fact was not officially confirmed, people used particular discursive strategies to present the act of the jeweller’s wife as the truth, which influenced the way the media reported on this case. Four dominant discursive patterns were detected, that is: normalizing the act, evaluating the act, upgrading the act and anticipating on the consequences of the act. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how critical tweets, displaying a concern for nuancing the overall tendency of the tweets, were designed in a way that downplayed their overt critical character. Implications of the analysis for crisis communication professionals are discussed.","Rumours, Shaming, Language-Mixing, and Racism Online",Language & Social Interaction

2017-0491,2017,Paper Session,Discourses of Racism in a Listserv Discussion Among Neighbors,1,"This paper analyzes neighbors’ online forum interactions to examine how differing ways of addressing racism result in miscommunication and disagreement among neighbors. Miscommunication among neighbors stems from the use of two differing discourses to discuss racism: folk theory of racism and critical theory of racism (Hill, 2008). Analysis in this paper illustrates that central to the way participants enact each of these discourses are the identities that participants invoke in their interactions. Talk reflecting folk theory, for example, tends to use person referencing practices that address each person as an individual and positions all individuals as equal. Talk reflecting critical theory, on the other hand, tends to reference different groups of people and emphasize inequality among different social groups in the neighborhood. When these discourses come into contact, neighbors who employ folk theory often interpret discussion of inequality among groups (e.g. White people are privileged and minorities are often excluded) as personal insults (e.g. I am White, and I am not privileged). Therefore, despite the well-intentioned efforts of these neighbors to address issues of racism, the discussions seem to exacerbate already existing tensions between White (folk theory) and non-White (critical theory) neighbors and hinder any actions neighbors would want to take to remedy issues of racism in their community.","Rumours, Shaming, Language-Mixing, and Racism Online",Language & Social Interaction

Despite the gravitas towards a “psychological connection” fans have to a team and sports, sports communication research has not thoroughly investigated the relationship between individual personality and sport media consumption. To examine this, a nationally distributed survey yielding 715 participants was used to better understand how personality traits defined by the HEXACO Personality Inventory predict time spent consuming sports media. Multiple regression was used to test the hypotheses, revealing increased expressiveness, social boldness, sociability, forgiveness, flexibility, and inquisitiveness, and decreased fearfulness, anxiety, and aesthetic appreciation were significant predictors for sports media consumption. This study identifies relationships between these elemental personality traits, providing a granular understanding of how personality impacts sports media consumption.

This offers scholars with the opportunity to examine users’ strategic self-representation online. Against the backdrop of social identity theory, this study investigated if soccer fans create strategic self-representations online. Personality traits are known to be inherent to identity management; accordingly, this study also examines the relationship between the Big Five traits and strategic self-representation. An automated linguistic analysis tool was applied to the Facebook posts of 271 English Premier League soccer fans, in order to examine their strategic self- presentations in identity management.

2017-0495,2017,Paper Session,Apolitical Escapism or Covert Ideological Vehicle? The Relationship Between Sports Fandom and Political Attitudes,2,"This paper examines the relationship between sports fandom and political attitudes. While some have argued that sports and politics do not or should not mix, we seek to understand patterns of ideological allegiance and as related to fan identity. Drawing upon a nationally representative survey, we find that American fan identity is positively associated with the belief that economic success is determined by individual rather than structural factors as well as support for the U.S. military; we also find that conservatives are more likely to resist the perceived politicization of sports. These findings suggest that, as a form of supposedly apolitical pop culture, sports could be an overlooked incubator for conservative ideologies.",Fan Behaviors and Sports Consumption,Sports Communication
2017-0496,2017,Paper Session,"""Please F**king Lose Tonight”: Fan Rhetoric Supporting Low-Standing Teams and Intentional Losing in Online Forums",1,"Using textual analysis (Entman, 1993; McKee, 2003), a pair of Reddit game day threads between the 29th place Arizona Coyotes and the 30th place Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League were analyzed to examine the rhetoric used by fans in online forums (specifically Reddit) to offer traditional support for their team, while also encouraging them to purposefully lose, or tank, for a higher draft odds. Six themes emerged from fan rhetoric: Emphasis on tanking through military tank symbolism; Subversion of conventional fan performance by cheering for the opponent while encouraging their favorite team to lose; Recognition and objectification of the prize; Positioning the games as special events; Loyalty to the organization; And comradery amongst fans. Additionally, fans in the sub-reddit exhibited Basking-In-Reflective-Failure (BIRFing) and Cutting-Off-Reflective-Success (CORSing) fan management behaviors that were more appropriate for the context of a game between two low standing teams.",Fan Behaviors and Sports Consumption,Sports Communication
2017-0497,2017,Paper Session,Countering Reactance in Crisis Communication: Incorporating Positive Emotions via Social Media,2,"Based on the Psychological Reactance Theory (PRT), this study examined the effect of incorporating sympathy via social media on countering reactance in crisis communication. The study employed a 2 (expressing sympathy: Yes vs. No) × 2 (medium: Twitter vs. news release) between-subject experimental design. Two hundred and fifty three (N=253) American consumers recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk participated in this online experiment. Results indicated that using Twitter and expressing sympathy significantly lowered reactance. There was no interaction effect between the two factors, such that their influence on reactance was not contingent upon one another. There was a partial yet significant mediation effect of reactance between medium and two outcomes (perceived crisis responsibility and organizational reputation). There was no mediation effect of reactance between sympathy expressed and two outcomes. The theoretical and managerial implications were discussed, as well as limitations and suggestions for future research.",Crisis Communication Interventions,Public Relations

This study extends situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) by applying it to paracrisis situations as well as by testing a cognitive model in which breach of expectation by different actors leads to different degrees of judgment of responsibility and counterfactual thinking processes (i.e., the person could/would/should have done something else). A deny crisis response (e.g., scapegoating) was effective in reducing blame and negative affective responses and yielded less negative reputation assessment of the message source. The expectation breach led participants to engage in a counterfactual thinking process, which in turn evoked greater indignation and more negative reputation assessment. Indignation and negative reputation were both significant predictors of online word-of-mouth intention. Social vigilantism, individuals’ tendency to propagate their opinions onto others, mediated the relationship between indignation and online discussion intention.",Crisis Communication Interventions,Public Relations

Several new strategies were also proposed. The study controlled for audience prior disposition given that the organizations – the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the New England Patriots football team – were identified as polarizing entities in prior research. Participants responded to two post-crisis image restoration messages for each organization. Messages were broken up into sections and coded by undergraduate research assistants. Results indicated that prosocial and blame-acceptance messages were rated more highly than messages of blame deflection, and significantly predicted higher message rating. Likewise, blame deflecting messages were significant predictors of lower message rating. Transcendence predicted rating in opposite directions contingent upon context; participants accepted it when used by the NRA but not by the Patriots. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance for public relations practitioners managing organizational crises.",Crisis Communication Interventions,Public Relations

ANCOVAs indicate a significant difference in subjects’ intent to comply with crisis preparedness directives in the Zika scenario as they are more likely to comply with protocol issued through an expert (professional) Facebook account than a peer (layperson) Facebook account. The findings add understanding to the complex nature of crisis preparedness decision-making process and provide opportunities for future research examining the effect of social media message source across different crisis scenarios.

Through a content analysis of research articles published in ten journals listed in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), 69 directly relevant articles in the period of 2002-2014 are identified. The study examines current social mediated crisis management (SMCM) research by tracing trends in the theoretical framework and methodological approach, and identifying types of research and crisis communication practice addressed in these articles. Findings showed that, among the total of 69 journal articles, theoretical research has increased dramatically from 2002 to 2014. The quantitative research is relatively more prominent than the qualitative research. Characteristics of social media are advised to be utilized in a two-way interactive response form. Consistent, transparent, and symmetrical crisis communication strategy is suggested to accommodate the “stakeholder”, as current research focus. Finally, a scholarly assessment tool for the SMCM research is provided, and directions for future research are suggested from five dimensions: adding types of organizations, social media, and stakeholders, emphasizing the variable of crisis phases, improving measures of crisis communication effectiveness, extending models or theories in the field, and de-Westernizing the SMCM research in a global context.",Crisis Communication Interventions,Public Relations

The process model of CERC (Reynolds & Seeger, 2005) provides an ideal framework for examination of Zika preparedness at local public health departments. Survey data (n=226) was collected with PIOs at local public health departments across the United States to assess how community size served, control over health agenda, and many other considerations such as resources and federal influences affected satisfaction with Zika preparedness. Results indicate troublesome disparities in preparation among those serving smaller communities as well as significant, positive relationships between local public health agenda control and satisfaction with preparedness, which is troublesome as many states move to a centralized, state agency run structure.",Health Officials and Social Media During Infectious Disease Outbreaks,Health Communication

Yet, organizations such as the CDC who wish to communicate with the public during crises largely depend on the ways in which the mass media cover the crisis and the organizational response to it. The current study examined the topics and themes that dominated the coverage of Zika virus in major American newspapers, using an unsupervised automated content analysis technique - structural topic modeling. The data and findings shown that coverage evolved over the different stages of the pandemic, and point at crucial discrepancies between what is recommended by crisis communication experts and what is communicated in mass media. It also reveals significant differences between news outlets, in ways that may result in different people being exposed to different information, with different effects on crisis responses and preparations.",Health Officials and Social Media During Infectious Disease Outbreaks,Health Communication

Using textual and content analysis, we conducted two studies to explore the implicit rules governing how health organizations engage with the public via Twitter chats during health crises. Our analyses expose the tensions organizations encounter when trying to maintain expertise and participate in dialogic communication. We argue that the perceived engagement potential of social media may put pressure on organizations to frame informational engagement as dialogue, and suggest that creating spaces for regular engagement online when health organizations are not handling outbreaks may help in constructing a stronger foundation for the necessary informational engagement employed during crises.",Health Officials and Social Media During Infectious Disease Outbreaks,Health Communication

This study examined how the public made sense of the risks of measles during the 2015 measles outbreak through an analysis of the semantic networks of Twitter content. Four frames were identified based on word frequencies and co-occurrence: news update, public health, vaccination, and political.

2017-0507,2017,Paper Session,Social Comparison and Information-Seeking: College Students’ Sexual Health Information Management in the Context of User-Created Online Health Information,2,"Social comparison has been worked as a fundamental psychological mechanism influencing people’s information seeking behaviors. Focusing on the user-created online health information about sexual health, the current study highlights the role of social comparison messages in the information management process. The findings of this study support the Theory of motivated information management (TMIM) framework as an effective tool to explain the information management process. More specifically, this study highlights the role of efficacy in that efficacy was not only more likely to predict information seeking, but also to guide the choice of downward comparison messages. While information users prefer to check extreme cases worse than their situation for their reference, the interpretation of social comparison messages was related to information users’ cognitive re-assessments in the following phase. Finally, information users’ evaluation regarding benefits and costs of previous information seeking seemed to determine information management decisions in the subsequent phase.","Health Information Seeking, Sharing, and Uncertainty Management",Health Communication
2017-0508,2017,Paper Session,Personality as a Moderator in the Association between Sharing Alcohol References and Drinking Intentions,2,"Recent research has indicated that sharing alcohol references on social media is related to drinking behavior. The present study contributes to this line of research by examining personality characteristics as a moderator of this association. The results of a cross-sectional survey among a sample of 638 emerging adults indicate that sensation seeking, sensitivity to peer pressure and self-control function as a condition for the relation between sharing alcohol references and drinking intentions. Specifically, the positive association between sharing alcohol references on social media and drinking intention was strongest for those with low levels of sensation seeking and sensitivity to peer pressure, and high levels of self-control, and non-significant for those on the other end of these personality traits. This clearly indicates that the relation between sharing alcohol references and drinking intentions is not uniform for all individuals, and it is crucial to consider individual differences when studying this association.","Health Information Seeking, Sharing, and Uncertainty Management",Health Communication

This study examines factors underlying adolescents’ willingness to share personal T1D information. In an online survey, 134 adolescents reported experiences helping others with T1D, perceived social resources, beliefs about the value of sharing information and helping others, and willingness to share T1D information. Most recent hemoglobin A1C values were obtained from medical records. In multivariate analyses, sharing/helping beliefs and health status were related to greater willingness to share personal health information. Adolescents with worse A1C values had a stronger relationship between sharing/helping beliefs and willingness to share (β= 0.18, p < .05), but a weaker relationship between helping experience and willingness to share (β= -0.22, p = .07). Interventions using social learning and social media components may improve participation, engagement, and outcomes by boosting adolescents’ beliefs about the benefits of sharing information.","Health Information Seeking, Sharing, and Uncertainty Management",Health Communication
2017-0510,2017,Paper Session,Examining Appraisal and Information Behavior in Uncertainty Management: Pathways to Participation in Clinical Research,1,"Participation of volunteers in clinical research is crucial for the discovery of new treatments, but the decision to participate in a clinical study is associated with uncertainty. Uncertainty management theory (UMT; Brashers, 2001) identifies uncertainty appraisal and information behavior as mechanisms of uncertainty management. Extending the propositions of UMT to explain behavioral intention, this study evaluated an explanatory model that assessed the causal pathways to informed decision-making under uncertainty in the context of recruitment for clinical research. Study hypotheses were tested using an online experiment (N = 340). The final explanatory model showed a significant indirect effect of decisional uncertainty on behavioral intention, mediated by uncertainty appraisal and information behavior, F(4, 335)=21.56, R2=.20, p<.01. Although uncertainty had an overall negative effect on participation in clinical research, the path from higher uncertainty to lower behavioral intention is not direct, and uncertainty itself was not found to be a direct predictor of participation or non-participation in clinical research.","Health Information Seeking, Sharing, and Uncertainty Management",Health Communication

However, little is known about the sources of this uncertainty. Using Uncertainty Management Theory (UMT), this investigation relied on 13 in-depth interviews with parents of children with type 1 diabetes to uncover what type of uncertainty parents experienced during the diagnosis of the disease as well as possible management strategies. This study found that parents experienced medical and social forms of uncertainty. Participants managed this uncertainty through various communication strategies. While most participants wanted to reduce the level of uncertainty associated with diagnosis, some would rather maintain uncertainty in order to stay in denial about their child’s illness. In addition to uncovering management strategies, this study recommends that hospital staff offer practical communication-based interventions to help parents manage uncertainty.","Health Information Seeking, Sharing, and Uncertainty Management",Health Communication

2017-0513,2017,Paper Session,The Mixed Blessing in Subsidized Internet Access,1,"This paper will examine current disputes whether national regulatory authorities (“NRAs”) should permit broadband carriers and content providers to provide zero rating subsidizes for access to a limited, “walled garden” of content. The paper identifies both costs and benefits in allowing subsidies and concludes that conditional arrangements can accrue positive spillover effects including more access by impoverished users.

On balance, welfare enhancing benefits appear to exceed costs, including harm to competition and some consumers. The paper suggests that carriers should offer zero rating opportunities on a limited and promotional basis thereby making it more difficult for existing subscribers simply to avoid paying surcharges for exceeding data caps. While NRAs should not micro-manage carriers’ service pricing, establishing qualification rules fits with other universal service initiatives that rely on well calibrated and targeted subsidies to simulate broadband service demand and supply.",Regulating Access to the Communication Backbone of Spectrum and the Internet,Communication Law & Policy
2017-0514,2017,Paper Session,Spectrum Standards Development as Communication Policy Process: Spectrum Coexistence and Civil Society,2,"Local wireless communication has been the setting for co-existence of licensed mobile communications operators and unlicensed Wi-Fi Internet access providers. However, burgeoning demand for access to the Internet on the move has led to competition from the former for the spectrum space occupied by the latter. Efforts to secure co-existence solutions have centred on a raft of technical work in a number of different international standards development organisational contexts. This paper attempts to understand this activity by conceptualising it as a policy process through application of the Multiple Streams (Kingdon 2011) model. Its particular concern is the character and position of civil society involvement in these processes. The paper finds evidence that, despite its strong historic role in standards-making for Wi-Fi, the civil society-like IEEE has played an important, though not central, role in a messy, overlapping self-regulatory landscape that is, ironically, likely to secure acceptable, compromise solutions to co-existence.",Regulating Access to the Communication Backbone of Spectrum and the Internet,Communication Law & Policy
2017-0515,2017,Paper Session,Spectrum management under the theoretical lenses of public space - The role of policy framing in (de)politicisation of the digital switchover process,1,"This article explores the framing of the digital switchover (DSO) of terrestrial broadcasting in the European Union (EU). It argues that the presentation of the European Commission (EC) of the switchover project within the technocratised policy frame of ‘neutrality’ provided low salience and a low-conflict policy process and ultimately a gradual lessening of public communicative spaces (Sarikakis, 2005) in Europe over the course of years. The analysis of selected EC policy documents from the research timeframe (2005–2015) focuses on the question of democratisation of the EU polity, and contributes to debates on the role of the EU as a ‘regulatory state’ (Majone, 1999) and the EC’s actions as ‘policy entrepreneur’ (Harcourt, 2002); and on policy framing in the process of EU politicisation (Daviter, 2007), with a special emphasis on the impact of the subsidiarity principle on core media policy objectives. The European DSO—one of the critical moments of policy change—presents a case of low-salience regulatory policy (Gormley, 1986) with high costs borne by societal actors (Harcourt & Radaelli, 1999), i.e., by the citizens.",Regulating Access to the Communication Backbone of Spectrum and the Internet,Communication Law & Policy

Addressing gaps in existing research, the current laboratory experiment (n =139) examined the role social facets of playing take for the gaming experience multiplayer first-person shooters (FPS) provide. Firstly, three different social settings of playing were compared concerning the amount of enjoyment and well-being they had induced and secondly, a structural model based on self-determination theory was tested that aimed at investigating connections between social facets of playing, game-based satisfaction of the needs for competence and relatedness and positive psychological outcomes of playing. The results indicate that also within the supposedly unsocial FPS social interactions with fellow players and the presence of human co-players are important factors that can positively shape the effects of playing. Structural equation modeling further indicated that communicating with fellow players and team play can help players of FPS to satisfy essential psychological needs which in turn is connected with increases in well-being and enjoyment.",Gaming for the Good: (Pro)Social Aspects of Games,Game Studies

The current study employs two existing persuasive games on the topic of teen dating violence, selected on the basis of their relative focus on narrative or procedural arguments (i.e. mirroring real-world processes through in-game systems), and performed a controlled experiment on effects on attitudes towards abusive relationships. 262 participants were drawn from a mixed sample of university and senior secondary school students who, with a mean age of 19 years, were slightly older than the game’s target audiences. Results indicated that the games do affect some of the attitudes they intend to, but that the effects of the narrative and procedural games were not differentiated. Affective and cognitive identification (with the games’ protagonists and with their procedural rhetoric) differed suitably between games, but predicted attitude change negatively.

The present study wanted to expand the scope of this line of research by considering both inter- and intrapersonal factors. In an experimental study (N = 115) we manipulated the difficulty of a game (easy or hard) and the playing style of a confederate teammate (supportive or unsupportive). We found that neither coplayer supportiveness nor game difficulty had an effect on expectations of a teammates’ prosocial behavior or one’s own prosocial behavior towards the teammate after the game. Increased expectations of prosocial behavior from one’s teammate were related to one’s own prosocial behaviors, independent of our manipulations. Our findings suggest that other types of manipulations might be necessary to further explore the effects of game difficulty and cooperation, and challenge us to also consider alternative measures of prosocial behavior.",Gaming for the Good: (Pro)Social Aspects of Games,Game Studies

The findings support the hypothesis that people who use image-based SNSs are likely to use these mobile SNS apps while walking; furthermore, performing the visual-manual tasks afforded by these SNS apps predicted higher instances of distracted walking consequences. The data also show that SNS Intensity predicted higher instances of mobile SNS app-related distracted walking behavior and smartphone feature-related distracted walking behavior.

As a result, it is effectively used as a different medium by different user groups. The article deepens our understanding of this polymediality by characterizing differences in mobile apps usage among different user groups, including gender, education, occupation, screen size, and price. We monitored the complete app usage of 10,725 smartphone users for one month each (56 million sessions, recording almost 1 million hours). We develop a theoretical framework to classify the over 16,000 apps used into five categories of polymediality. Testing a battery of 33 concrete hypothesis we provide a broad characterization of the mediatic nature of the cellphone by asking who, with which characteristics, uses which kinds of apps in what extensity and intensity? For example, we find that the the mobile phone is used as a traditional human-to-human communication medium by women and the higher educated, while men and the less educated see it rather as an entertainment medium. Rather surprisingly, it is not the young and high occupational grades that use the mobile phone as a human-to-machine computer (including gaming and artificial intelligence tools). Large screen size is related to extensive long sessions, while a small screen size is related to intensive frequent usage. The results provide ample empirical evidence that any aggregated treatment of the mobile phone as a single medium will miss its inherently polymediatic nature.",Top Ranked Papers in Mobile Communication II,Mobile Communication

As a form of visually oriented practice, monthsaries are fraught with vernacular readings, perceptions, and practices. This paper investigates the practice of monthsaries among ‘young couplings’, which I define as the experiences of young people’s partnering practices in their teenage years and/or their initial experience of early partnering regardless of the age of first coupling, in which young couples do not yet have any formal status, are unable to experience domestic living together, and have limited opportunities to be alone and intimate. In the absence of any scholarly precedence and adopting a Grounded Theory approach, this paper is an exploratory study that approaches monthsaries through 1) vernacular meanings of monthsaries through internet folk knowledge, drawing on user-generated, crowd-sourced word banks such as the Merriam-Webster online dictionary and Urban Dictionary; 2) local perceptions of practices of monthsaries among Singaporean couples, based on an early forum thread in which internet users in Singapore contextualize local readings of monthsaries; and 3) visual displays of monthsaries generated by three young prolific microcelebrity couples in Singapore, grounded in dating scripts curated and archived on their couple hashtags on Instagram.",Social Media: Identity (and) Politics,Popular Communication
2017-0528,2017,Paper Session,Knowing About Girls: What We Can Learn From Social Media,2,"This paper is about the problem of knowledge posed by ‘girls’. Apart from Girls Studies, girls are relatively scattered or absent in formal knowledge systems. But girls are all over the internet and social media, as producers, users and as representations in discourse. How might formal disciplines – scientific and cultural – integrate with social media to answer the questions: what are girls, where did they come from, and how do we know? The paper works through some of the issues at stake in order to set up a distinctive and hopefully useful approach for answering them. It is organised into two parts: ‘Girls in the wild’ and ‘Girls in the world’. It concludes that girls are a culture-made group, evolving – not without struggle – into a self-organising, self-conscious, global class.",Social Media: Identity (and) Politics,Popular Communication
2017-0529,2017,Paper Session,"""I Make the Decisions Here"": Political Facebook Unfriending in the Personal Public Sphere",2,"This article explores the meaning of political unfriending, and in doing so proposes the concept of the personal public sphere. An analysis of in-depth interviews conducted with Jewish Israeli Facebook users who unfriended during the Israel-Gaza conflict of 2014 shows unfriending to be a new form of boundary management for the self in an age of networked sociality. Moreover, it sheds light on people’s deeply-rooted perception of the ‘networkedness’ of society as a fundamental organizing principle for the self and the collective. Thus, we conceptualize unfriending as exercising sovereignty over one’s personal public sphere while also acknowledging that everyone else has their own personal public sphere too. Moreover, the concept of the personal public sphere accounts for a crucial feature of politically motivated unfriending, namely, the dissonance between the justifications of and reasons for unfriending offered by the interviewees and the act of unfriending itself.",Social Media: Identity (and) Politics,Popular Communication

This study examined whether elevation elicited by meaningful movie clips will lead to helping behaviors, regardless of whether the person in need is responsible for her/his current situation. We also explored whether a positive mood state induced by exposure to pleasant movie clips leads to similar effects. Preliminary findings related to role of content types, individual differences in prosocial personality, and differing emotional states in the production of helping behaviors are discussed.",Emotion in Understanding Media Effects,Mass Communication

Laughter, Emotional Contagion, and Heuristic Processing During Shared Media Use",2,"When people use humorous media content together with others, their own assessment of the content may depend on the emotional expressions of those around them. Drawing on an experiment with 80 participants watching a movie clip together with a confederate who either did or did not laugh we identified two parallel processes. Confederates’ laughter induced a behavioral response in participants (laughing or smiling) and, through that, a corresponding appraisal of the media content: the content is rated as funnier. This effect matches emotional contagion processes and is especially pronounced in introverts. Additionally, participants low in conscientiousness directly elevated their funniness ratings (more than their own emotional expression would suggest) when confederates laughed while those high in conscientiousness even lowered their rating of the media content in presence of laughing confederates. We interpret this direct effect as an indicator of heuristic processing, linking confederates’ laughter and participants’ ratings beyond automatic contagion.",Emotion in Understanding Media Effects,Mass Communication

The present study advances our knowledge of empathy and communication by investigating the “edges” around empathy and how different dimensions of empathy are related. Specifically, we ask what role physical or experiential knowledge plays in the ability to experience empathy for a character, and how do different dimensions of empathy develop during video viewing.
Using ten video clips as stimuli, we find evidence that the three dimensions of empathy behave differently and have different antecedents. There is also an interactive effect of gender and gender match with characters. Notably, personal experience impacts perspective taking; gender has an effect on empathic concern, and variables related to emotional displays are most important in predicting emotional contagion. Results are discussed in terms of advancing knowledge about the role of empathy in narrative processing.",Emotion in Understanding Media Effects,Mass Communication

The present study manipulated the number of obstacles story characters had to surmount to reach their goals. As the number of obstacles increased, empathic identification, story pointedness and narrative impact increased significantly. Empathic identification and pointedness both mediated the relationship between story obstacles and narrative impact. Results are interpreted within a dual-process view of narrative processing employing story appraisal theory and empathic identification, respectively, as exemplars of rational and intuitive approaches to understanding narrative impact.",Narrative Processing I,Information Systems

Unlike most media effects research, we did not only found assimilation effects (changes in self-perception that are in line with a protagonist’s traits); rather we also found contrast effects (changes in self-perception that are in contrast to a protagonist’s traits). In the first study (N=111) implicit and explicit self-reported conscientiousness were assessed after reading a story about either a conscientious or neglectful student. Lower transported participants, who also were more critical towards the story, showed contrast effects, whereas high transported and less critical participants assimilated the protagonist’s traits. In a second study (N=110) we manipulated transportation, but we could not identify an effect of transportation on the self.

In Study 2, age and city of residence, traits that were central to the story, were varied, but again similarity had no effects. Given previous research these were surprising findings.

The manner in which attention is defined and operationalized within the context of immersion-related studies is inconsistent in the literature, and can leave attention under- or unexamined. This review examines the attentional variables of the orienting response, transportation, engagement, involvement, immersion, and absorption for their use and measurement in the literature. The findings suggest a lack of consistency in conceptualization and a need for a standardized, multi-dimensional self-report measure of attentional processes, potentially supplemented with psychophysiological approaches.",Narrative Processing I,Information Systems
2017-0539,2017,Paper Session,Escape and Expansion: Attachment Style and Motivation to Engage and Interact With the Story World,2,"Childhood attachment experiences are believed to influence one’s ability to cope with the universal challenges of the human condition. Extant research suggests that the story world may offer a means to cope with these challenges both through escaping conscious focus on such challenges, as well as expanding the self through the vicarious pursuit of intrinsic needs. Therefore, it is likely that different attachment styles will influence how stories are used by audience members. A cross-sectional survey (N = 1039) showed that higher attachment anxiety was positively associated with transportability, parasocial relationships, and boundary expansion. Attachment avoidance negatively predicted transportability and positively predicted boundary expansion. Moreover, a significant interaction between both dimensions was also found. Implications for conceptualizing media use as both a form of escape and of expansion of a (sometimes unsatisfactory) self are discussed.",Narrative Processing I,Information Systems
2017-0540,2017,Paper Session,Lift Me Up by Looking Down: Boosted by Stories,2,"Stories are a powerful means to produce profound changes in recipients’ self. The influence of stories is often attributed to the involvement that recipients experience when they are transported into the story world. Moreover, recipients simulate the events of a narrative as thought they were a particular character in the story world by adopting the character’s mindset (experience taking). Changes in the recipients’ self are usually in line with the attributed features in the plotline and the protagonists’ characteristics. The primary aim of our study is to develop a better understanding of narrative influence on recipients’ self-perception, motivation and even behavior by experimentally varying transportation and experience taking. In contrast to previous studies on narrative effects, we do not only expect assimilation effects (recipients change in line with a story), rather we also try to reveal contrast effects (recipients change, that are reverse to a story and its character by comparing themselves downwards).",Narrative Processing I,Information Systems

The Dark Triad (Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy) and Eudaimonic Narratives",3,"Recent research has emphasized the psychological importance of meaningful or eudaimonic stories dealing with purpose in life, the human condition, and human virtue. We propose that responses to such eudaimonic narratives vary with stable individual differences of the recipient and focus on the dark triad of personality. Matched eudaimonic or non-eudaimonic videos were presented via random assignment. The more individuals lack empathy and organize their world around self-promotion, irrespective of others and social norms – reflected in the so-called dark triad of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy – the more they perceived the eudaimonic stories (vs. control) to be inauthentic and corny. This effect translated to a more negative overall evaluation of the eudaimonic videos (moderated mediation). Self-reported feelings of being touched, moved, and inspired (meaningful affect) were largely unaffected by the dark triad, suggesting that these personality factors do not disable emotional responses, but incorporate defenses against them.",Narrative Processing I,Information Systems
2017-0542,2017,Paper Session,Differential Relationships Between Adolescents’ Television Diets and Their Hypergender Orientations,1,"This paper describes a short-term longitudinal study among 1,007 adolescents (13-17 years old), investigating reciprocal relationships between adolescents’ television diets and their endorsement of hypergender orientations (i.e., hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity). The findings show that different television programs were related to hypergendered orientations in different ways. The most notable finding was the relevance of reality TV docu-soaps for adolescents’ hypergender orientations; Exposure to this type of content predicted a greater endorsement of hypergender orientations among both boys and girls, and it was more often selected by hypergendered boys. Another interesting finding was that more frequent exposure to romantic comedy movies predicted an increased endorsement of hyperfeminine gender roles among girls, but more frequent exposure to situational comedies was associated with lower levels of girls’ hyperfemininity. These findings could be used in media literacy interventions targeting the influence of television exposure on adolescents’ stereotypical gender role notions.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

However, to our knowledge, few meta-analyses have collectively examined the impact of sexual media on attitudes and behavior. Accordingly, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect of exposure to sexual media on attitudes (permissive attitudes, peer norms, and rape myths) and sexual behaviors (general sexual behavior, age of sexual initiation, and risky sexual behavior). Results from 63 studies, involving 380 effect sizes, revealed that exposure to sexual media had a small, but significant effect on both sexual attitudes and behavior. Effects were stronger for adolescents than emerging adults. Additionally, effects were stronger for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies than for experimental ones. Implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-0544,2017,Paper Session,Risk Exposure From Mainstream and Black-Oriented Movies: Differential Associations With White and Black Adolescents’ Behavior,6,"Adolescent exposure to risky behaviors in media is a well-established predictor of such behaviors. However, this is not the case for all adolescents. Black adolescents watch two-and-a-half times more media than White adolescents, yet appear to be less influenced by media risk portrayals. The present study uses survey data from 1,990 Black and White adolescents to investigate whether exposure to sex, alcohol and violent content in mainstream and Black-oriented movies is related to corresponding adolescent behavior among White and Black youth. Results suggest that Black adolescents are mostly unaffected by exposure to risk portrayals in mainstream films, but risk exposure in Black-oriented films is related to behavior in all three domains. White adolescents exhibit exposure-behavior relationships for both film types. Post hoc analysis for sex content suggests that R-rated films drive the effects for sex. Future research that focuses on Black audiences should consider the importance of Black-oriented media.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

The current cross-sectional study among 640 adolescents (Mage = 16.267, SD = 1.601) aimed to take a more nuanced look at the effects of Facebook use by examining the influence of talking about appearance-related topics with friends on Facebook in addition to total amount of Facebook use. The findings showed that appearance conversations on Facebook, but not total amount of Facebook use, was directly related to self-sexualizing behaviors. In addition, the belief that complying with the prevailing appearance ideals is rewarded (with, for example, popularity, increased self-esteem, and romantic success) and self-objectification proved to be valid explanatory mechanisms for the examined relations. Results further showed that both boys and girls were affected by appearance-focused Facebook use, although girls scored higher on the key variables, and the model fit better among the girls.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

A short-term longitudinal survey among 1,852 social network site users (953 adolescents and 899 young adults) showed that (exposure to) sexy self-presentations in social media do not predict changes in self-perceptions. Instead, self-perceptions predicted (exposure to) sexy self-presentation in social media, depending on one’s age and gender: lower sexual satisfaction predicted more engagement in sexy self-presentation for adolescent girls, higher self-esteem and sexual satisfaction predicted more exposure to sexy self-presentations of others for young adult men and women, respectively. These findings suggest that self-perceptions that were considered consequences of social media use, may in fact constitute antecedents of such use, in particular of sexy self-presentations.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Although consequences related to women’s sexual functioning and sexual agency are proposed, efforts to test these connections have been infrequent and inconsistent. We therefore used structural equation modeling to test connections between exposure to three media genres (women’s magazines, reality TV, and situation comedies), self-sexualization, and four dimensions of sexual agency among 754 undergraduate women. Findings confirmed our expectations. More frequent consumption of women’s magazines, lifestyle reality TV programs, and situation comedies each predicted greater self-sexualization, which in turn predicted greater use of alcohol to feel sexy, less condom use self-efficacy, and more negative sexual affect. Implications for objectification theories and for measures of women’s media use and sexual functioning are discussed.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Therefore, the purpose of this study was three-fold: (1) identify characteristics of PSRRs (prevalence, age of onset, and duration); (2) examine predictors of PSRRs in adolescence (sexual orientation, loneliness, and parental marital status); and (3) investigate the interplay of PSRRs with adolescents’ sexual development (sexual fantasies and initial dating experiences). Study 1 included retrospective data of young adults 18+ years (N = 241); Study 2 included concurrent data from a national sample of teenagers 13-17 years (N = 147). Results indicate PSRRs are highly pervasive, intense, and long-lasting among both males and females; but are not predicted by any of the psychological variables measured. Their onset corresponds with early sexualization (first sexual fantasy), and terminate with the development of a first meaningful real-life romantic relationship.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Results of a hierarchical multiple regression conducted on data from a national online panel survey of middle adolescents (N = 340) reveals that social media use, romantic motivations, social belongingness motivations and greater social comparison tendencies predicted online aggression victimization (R2 = .38). Information motivations and entertainment motivations negatively predict online aggression perpetration, but romantic motivations, social comparison, and social media use were positive predictors of online aggression perpetration (R2 = .34). Further examination of interactions and indirect effects reveal that romantic motivations for social media use are an important predictor of involvement in online aggression among adolescents.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

We report on a survey that was conducted in Flanders, Belgium among 657 adolescents, who indicated that they were in a romantic relationship. Analyses revealed that engagement in sexting within a romantic relationship was significantly linked with higher perceptions of passion within the relationship, but not with emotional intimacy and commitment. There was also a positive association between perceptions of verbal conflict and adolescents’ engagement in sexting. The results suggest sexting could function as a digital way to express and sustain feelings in their romantic relationship, for young people who have a need for sexual and physical proximity. The significant associations with higher levels of perceived verbal aggression contribute to evidence that adolescent sexting is linked with violence within romantic relationships.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media

We investigate to which the perceived social norms about cyber dating abuse, witnessing controlling behavior among parents, and the endorsement of gender stereotypes are linked with adolescents’ engagement in digital controlling behaviors. The study draws on data from 466 secondary school students (71.0% girls, n = 331) between 16 and 22 years old in Flanders, Belgium who were in a romantic relationship. The linear regression analysis indicates that being female, being older, the perceived social norms of peers, the endorsement of gender stereotypes, and having observed intrusive controlling behaviors by the father are significantly positively related to adolescents’ perpetration of digital controlling behaviors. The findings have implications for practice and underscore the need for prevention efforts to address and lower the influence of these perceived social norm.","Growing Up With Media: Gender, Sexuality, and Romance During the Teen & Young Adult Years (HHD Session)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-0553,2017,Paper Session,Investigating the Persuasive Effects of a Persuasive Video Game About the Refugee Crisis,2,"Recent years have seen a tremendous rise in the development and distribution of persuasive video games: video games that are used to influence players’ attitudes and/or behavior. It has been argued that such video games are more effective than traditional persuasive media because they are more immersive, and because they provide opportunities for experiential learning. Two studies (NStudy 1 = 134; NStudy 2 = 94) tested the effects of a persuasive game about the refugee crisis on willingness to help. Immersion was investigated as a potential mediator. The results showed that the persuasive game did not result in significantly stronger willingness to help, relative to a no-treatment control condition. Moreover, a video (Study 1) and a printed text (Study 1 and 2) resulted in more immersion than the video game. Thus, the results did not yield evidence for the effectiveness of persuasive video games. Also, they call into question the assumption that persuasive video games are necessarily more immersive than traditional persuasive media.

In particular, the experiment examines the independent effect of evidence type and its joined effects with need for affect on donating beliefs. It also explores how the number of user-generated cues attached to the original messages influences beliefs, given that such cues will integrate into health promotion messages in campaigns involving SNSs. The findings show that statistical evidence results in a significantly higher level of negative cognitive beliefs than dose narrative and combined evidence. In addition, when narratives are presented, individual’s need for affect is positively associated with the level of negative cognitive beliefs. Yet such association does not exist when two other types of evidence are presented.

However, when information provided by news media is incomplete, biased, and untrustworthy, how will social media interact with news media to construct public discourse? With a focus on the issue of violent resistance in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China, this study identified and compared the frames employed by news and online discussion forum and further expanded the research horizon to explore the frame interactions in these two media platforms. Adopting an automatic content analysis approach, this study identified four news media frames and four public frames in online discussion forum. Frames in news and online discussion forum differed in terms of thematic structure and weight of frames. News media frames were found to well represent government interests and the political ideology of the state. Public frames in online discussion forum were more deliberate, as evidenced by the concentration on the responsibility frame that attributes the violent resistance issue to the failure of the government’s ethnic policy, the long-term conflict between ethnicities, and the intervention of foreign political and religious forces. By employing Granger causality analysis, this study further found that news and online discussion forum influence each other in placing the issue in their respective agenda to build and strengthen their existing frames instead of presenting a dominating relationship. This study contributes to framing theory by demonstrating the potential of social media in building political discourses of political issues and enforcing the separation of official and nonofficial discourse spaces in China under severe censorship.","The Role of News in Risk, Crisis, and Disaster",Mass Communication

A biased reflection of reality, shown by the news media, can have severe consequences for public perception, especially when negative events are overrepresented or when severity is exaggerated. So far, media literature has paid little attention to whether disproportionate media attention has increased over time for negative events and what would be a theoretical explanation for a rising trend. Mediatization theory might provide a profound argumentation for an overtime increase. In order to explore if media indeed increasingly portray the world more filled with menace than accurate, this research relies on content analysis to explore media attention for aviation accidents.

Results show that media system bias is strongly related to right-wing, however, not to left-wing extremism. Furthermore, there are not only differences between single outlets but also between media genres. Particularly tabloids are exempt from right-wing accusations of liberal bias. Finally, we find evidence of the hostile media phenomenon irrespective of actual media exposure.",Advancements in Political Journalism Research,Political Communication
2017-0562,2017,Paper Session,Unravelling a Cognitive Map: How Politicians’ Views of Journalists and the News Media Affect Their Satisfaction with Democracy,1,"The study developed and tested a cognitive model designed to analyze correlations among media- and democracy-related cognitions of N = 422 European politicians. The key assumptions were, first, that politicians’ perceptions of journalists’ roles—whether the role is one of political advocate or neutral informant—were consequential in (i) the way politicians perceive the media’s influence in the political process, and (ii) the media’s democratic performance. Second, it was hypothesized that politicians’ attitudes toward the media’s democratic performance was important in determining how satisfied they are with the functioning of democracy. Altogether, eight hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. The analysis revealed a strong influence of journalistic role perceptions on media-related attitudes as well as a strong effect of these attitudes on politicians’ satisfaction with democracy. An important finding is that negative evaluations concerning the media’s democratic performance can undermine politicians’ support for the political system.",Advancements in Political Journalism Research,Political Communication
2017-0563,2017,Paper Session,An Empirical Examination of the Global Emergence of Fact-checking,1,"Since 2003 and the emergence of FactCheck.org in the United States, fact-checking has expanded both domestically and internationally. As of February, 2016, the Duke Reporter’s Lab identified nearly 100 active initiatives around the world. Building off of previous exploratory work by Amazeen (2016), this research utilizes the framework of critical juncture theory to examine why fact-checking is spreading globally at this point in time. Seen as a professional reform movement in the journalistic community (Graves, 2016b), historical research on reform movements suggest several possible factors influencing the emergence of fact-checking such as a decline in journalism, easy access to technology for the masses, and socio-political strife (McChesney, 2007; Pickard, 2015; Stole, 2006). The present study offers empirical support that a country’s degree of democratic governance and public accessibility to the internet are significantly associated with the emergence of fact-checkers and demonstrates similarities between the emergence of fact-checking and previous consumer reform movements.",Advancements in Political Journalism Research,Political Communication
2017-0564,2017,Paper Session,"Expanding Perceived Influences Research to Insecure Democracies: How Violence, Public insecurity, Economic Inequality, and Uneven Democratic Performance Shape Journalists’ Work Environments",8,"Democracies with sharp violence and public insecurity have proliferated in recent decades, with many also featuring extreme economic inequality. These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this with journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic quality tend to have higher levels of journalist assassinations and that democratic performance, violence, insecurity and economic inequality significantly shape how much importance journalists attribute to various influences in their work environment. Factors shaping how journalists’ perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. Case studies address why these conditions sometimes lead to assassinations and other anti-press violence.",Advancements in Political Journalism Research,Political Communication

This study analyzes journalists' sourcing and verification practice of UGC on Twitter during the Brussels attacks in March 2016. In a quantitative content analysis, we identified 1) the journalists and organizations sourcing during the attacks, 2) classified the different forms of sourcing and verification requests, and 3) analyzed the sourced UGC. Results show that sourcing on Twitter has become a global phenomenon. Especially during the first hours of the attack journalists rely on UGC shared on Twitter.

The attacks in Turkey and Nigeria were perpetrated against mostly Muslim victims, while the France and Belgium attacks were carried out against mostly non-Muslims. Results suggest meaningful differences between the way the Post framed the attacks against Western European targets, on the one hand, and attacks against Muslim-majority communities, on the other hand. In covering attacks on France and Belgium, the Post used “Terrorism” frames to structure coverage, while consistently humanizing victims, and drawing links between various European societies and the Western world more generally. Attacks against Turkey and Nigeria were covered less prominently and were primarily framed as internal conflicts.",Journalistic Norms in the Face of Terror and Extreme Violence,Journalism Studies

We argue that news coverage that explicitly links Islam to terrorism or terrorists of the Islamic State (IS) may trigger fears in non-Muslim individuals. In contrast, news differentiation (i.e., explicitly distinguishing between Muslims and Muslim terrorists) may dampen particular fear reactions in citizens. To test the specific effects of news differentiation, a controlled laboratory experiment was conducted. Results showed that undifferentiated (compared with differentiated) news about IS terrorism increased participants’ fear of terrorism and eventually resulted in hostile perceptions toward Muslims in general. However, fear of terrorism only enhanced hostile attitudes toward Muslims for individuals with negative and moderate prior experiences with Muslims. For those with very positive experiences, no such relationship was found. Implications of these findings for journalism practice and intergroup relations in multicultural societies are discussed.",Journalistic Norms in the Face of Terror and Extreme Violence,Journalism Studies

The study also considers how individual characteristics, journalistic routines, and organizational attributes influence these attitudes. Participants generally agreed that coverage has become routine. Journalists were largely supportive of coverage of perpetrators, but were hesitant to agree that coverage contributes to “copycat” shootings. Regarding attitude influences, a participant’s age was generally the strongest predictor. A journalist’s role perception, meanwhile, was the most powerful determinant of attitudes toward victim/survivor coverage. Findings also indicate differences in attitude according to job title and coverage beat. Taken as a whole, findings indicate that traditional libertarian ideas about mass shooting coverage are still prevalent; however, journalists also want to see more comprehensive reporting, including coverage of solutions and community resilience.",Journalistic Norms in the Face of Terror and Extreme Violence,Journalism Studies

Specifically, we forward an emotion regulation model in which reappraisal and suppression are predicted to mediate the relation between FCPs and PC message evaluations. Results (N = 361) suggest that conversation orientation positively predicted reappraisal and negatively predicted suppression; conformity orientation positively predicted suppression only. Reappraisal positively and suppression negatively predicted the extent to which people discriminated among PC message evaluations. Reappraisal also mediated the relation between conversation orientations and PC message evaluations. These results have implications for how capable people are to evaluate and ultimately profit from beneficial support when coping with negative emotions.",Interpersonal Communication in the Family,Interpersonal Communication

This two-study project aims to: (1) identify undergraduate students’ concerns during their first year of college, and (2) extend family communication patterns theory by examining how family support and resilience influence the relationship between FCP and college adjustment concerns. Study one identified six types of student concerns based on responses from 269 first-year undergraduates. Data from 2,252 students entering their first-year of college tested mediation models in study two. Results revealed that conversation orientation was related to higher family support whereas conformity orientation was related to lower student resilience.

Five hundred and seventy-two college students and their parents (n = 994) reflected on the child’s risky behaviors over the past month. The results suggest that while having parents who are more conformity oriented might reduce the propensity for alcohol, drug use, and self-harm for some emerging adults, it increases drug use and self-harm behaviors when emerging adults experience an identity gap with their mother. This model only held true in lower conversation orientation environments where there was little openness and free expression of ideas. When families were lower in conversation orientation, conformity orientation also predicted identity gaps with mothers and the mothers, in turn, were more inaccurate in their estimation of how much their child used drugs and engaged in self-harming behaviors.",Interpersonal Communication in the Family,Interpersonal Communication

In depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 sibling dyads who had moved away from one another within the past twelve months. During the interviews, sibling pairs were encouraged to engage in a conversation with one another about their relationship and talk about their experiences of transition in storied form. Results revealed two overarching discursive struggles that were central to how participants constructed meaning of sibling relationships: (a) siblingship as a voluntary bond vs. siblingship as an obligatory commitment and (b) siblings as a unit vs. siblings as separate individuals.

The four identities discovered and defined through reading the article are: identity as child, identity as alpha, identity as Muslim, and identity as immigrant. These unique, and sometimes contradictory, identities exist to create a more comprehensive understanding of an individual based on personal history and interviews with colleagues and friends.","Men in Sports, Advertising and Media: Analyzing the Construction and Contestations of Masculinity",Feminist Scholarship

Examining the literary celebrity of author Chetan Bhagat and his paratextual articulations expressed in Indian English-language media, this paper deconstructs their role in masking how upper-caste masculinity operates as the normative script in mainstream media narratives. Critically engaging with Bhagat’s utterances on television, print news and social media, I argue that Bhagat’s valorization of entrepreneurship renders caste hegemonies invisible while consolidating neoliberal narratives of ascent. I also demonstrate how Bhagat’s language in his paratexts are complicit in constructing a mythology of the middle class whose composition is predominantly upper-caste. I then establish how Bhagat’s paratexts articulate a Brahminical upper-caste male subjectivity through the use of English, a historically upper-caste masculine language, thus complicating both caste and gender in the mainstream media.","Men in Sports, Advertising and Media: Analyzing the Construction and Contestations of Masculinity",Feminist Scholarship
2017-0578,2017,Paper Session,All in Good Fun? The Hazing Rituals of Professional Sports Teams,1,"As sports move away from physical hazing, veteran players have adapted the practice of emasculating the rookie players by having them dress up in skimpy feminine outfits. The use of femininity as a means to ridicule and haze rookies continues the traditional of using feminine actions to ridicule male athletes. This trend extends beyond hazing to the rhetoric of sports using male language to indicate strength and feminine language to demonstrate weakness. With modern hazing, this rhetoric is reinforced and even more troubling it receives positive media attention through posts on websites, team Twitter accounts, and the official league Twitter with captions that reinforce that the hazing is simply a fun rite of passage.
This paper will examine how this seemingly innocuous hazing practice perpetuates the rape culture by reinforcing that the image of hyper-masculinity is the most valued asset for professional athletes. With the increase of rape culture in politics and sports, the research shows that the problem starts on the playground and in youth sports. The media coverage of these hazing events compared to serious rape and abuse charges by athletes must be examined. By using textual analysis, this presentation will demonstrate how the acceptance and enjoyment by the media of these forms of rookie hazing influence gendered language among youth athletes on the playground and the acceptance of rape and abuse teammates, teams, media, and society.","Men in Sports, Advertising and Media: Analyzing the Construction and Contestations of Masculinity",Feminist Scholarship

Additionally, there have also been numerous scholarly articles written on Dove’s “Real Beauty” campaign, evaluating its effectiveness and feminist stance, but to date, there is a lack of scholarship on Dove’s Men + Care campaign. Using feminist rhetorical criticism and theory about hegemonic masculinity, this paper looks at a sample of 50 print/web ads from the campaign to determine the extent to which traditional masculinity is challenged. Despite some promising elements in the ads, the rhetorical criticism reveals that they reflect only a quasi-progressive masculinity, providing some defiance of traditional, hegemonic masculinity, but ultimately remaining safely situated in conventional ideas about gender as a means of limiting threats to both men and patriarchy.","Men in Sports, Advertising and Media: Analyzing the Construction and Contestations of Masculinity",Feminist Scholarship

2017-0581,2017,Paper Session,Watching Crime Drama and Embodying Cultural Capital in the Postnetwork Era,1,"This article uses qualitative audience research to explore the ways in which American viewers have responded to television’s increasing cultural status. Based on in-depth interviews with thirty-one middle-class respondents, the findings indicate that significance of this television cultural legitimation varies with, but is not determined by, social location. Viewers with higher levels of educational attainment and occupational status frequently invoke the discourses of legitimation that connect television to legitimated cultural forms, celebrate textual features like narrative complexity, and appreciate the moral ambiguity of anti-heroic drama. Viewers with less education and lower occupational status frequently conceptualize television as a bad cultural object, evaluate drama through subjective frameworks, and do not find anti-heroic characters to be a source of conflicted moral allegiance. These findings support the growing body of literature arguing that the performance of distinction is increasingly identified with particular embodied practices rather than legitimated cultural objects.","Reading Race, Gender, Class, and Identity",Popular Communication

Building on Barthes, we advance a critique of white consciousness by exploring the embeddedness of racializing logics in, first of all, Mad Men’s representations of (white) motherhood through Betty’s character, and second, public discussions of the show through different media outlets. By examining the conditions that allow for the (dis)connection between white women and ideals of motherhood, we hope to shed light on how different ideologies interact when it comes to the (im)possibilities of reinforcing or challenging the motherhood myth. The interaction between post-feminism and whiteness, we argue, is especially important to explore, since it carries potentially limiting implications for our collective imagination about what anti-racist and feminist struggles entail.","Reading Race, Gender, Class, and Identity",Popular Communication

Research shows that many providers do not routinely communicate strong HPV vaccine recommendations to parents of adolescents, nor feel confident about influencing HPV vaccine-hesitant parents' views. The following paper presents a case study analysis of an intervention aimed at improving provider communication with HPV vaccine-hesitant parents. Healthcare providers and staff at 8 pediatric and family medicine clinics received training in motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. Process evaluation in the form of serial surveys distributed throughout the intervention, as well as outcome evaluation in the form of focus groups with participating providers and staff were used to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes included time spent discussing the HPV vaccine, participants’ self-efficacy, and participants’ general perceptions of the effectiveness of the MI techniques. Overall, findings indicate that the intervention improved providers’ communication with HPV vaccine-hesitant parents and that use of MI led to greater vaccine acceptance among HPV vaccine-hesitant parents.

Purposive sampling was used to recruit PPCPs who regularly counsel adolescents in preventive care interactions. One-on-one, in-depth interviews were conducted with PPCPs across the United States. Common barriers to e-cigarette clinical discussion included a lack of knowledge and awareness about e-cigarettes, being unfamiliar with adolescent e-cigarette behavior and terminology, feeling uncomfortable or unprepared, utilizing outdated screening tools, and a lack of time in clinical interactions. Provider reported ways to address these issues included focusing on relationship building, emphasizing confidentiality, and normalizing behaviors. Several of these barriers could also be directly addressed through brief provider intervention training such as providing key facts and risks about e-cigarettes, and training on effectively and quickly conducting the psychosocial interview.",Innovative Research on Health Provider-Patient Communication,Health Communication

In a survey of young adult patients after a recent medical visit, we found that those who perceived they were equal in power to their physician were more likely to be truthful. Those who perceived they were low in power were less truthful, but more likely comply with physician instructions. Patients perceiving themselves as more powerful than their physician were both less truthful and less compliant. Satisfaction was unrelated to patient power perception.

A randomized experiment (N = 306) was conducted with 2 (framing: episodic vs thematic) x 2 (onset controllability: controllable vs. uncontrollable) factorial design. The results indicated policy support was higher for those who read a thematic framed news article than for those who read an article with an episodic frame. Also, higher policy support was observed for those who read an article depicting the causes of postpartum depression as uncontrollable than for those who read an article explaining the causes as controllable. The effects of media frames and onset controllability were mediated by attributions of individual and societal responsibility. Furthermore, the effects of media frames on policy support was attenuated by the controllability of depression causes, with positive emotions toward postpartum depression patients being a moderated mediator.

Participants (N = 387) read one of six messages following a 3 (social comparison frame: geographic vs. racial vs. no-comparison) x 2 (age frame: child vs. adult) between-subjects design. Compared to adult frames about obesity inequalities, childhood frames evoked more sympathy, which in turn positively predicted support for obesity-prevention policies.

A web-based experiment exposed general population participants likely to purchase groceries for themselves or their families (N=225) to images of six diverse food items using one of three different shelf-level nutrition labeling systems (i.e., NuVal, NutritionIQ, control/none). Results suggest the mere presence of any shelf-level nutrition labeling system is associated with higher perceptions of nutritional value and purchase intention. Additionally, participant self-efficacy and response efficacy related to these labeling systems are moderately high. Thus, it is essential to ensure shelf-level nutrition labeling systems are effectively communicating nutrition information to consumers, as their influence could be substantive.","Health-Related Policy Making, Policy Support, and Policy Impact",Health Communication

Undergraduate student smokers (n = 479) on a college campus with a tobacco-free policy were randomly selected to report their tobacco-free compliance behaviors and respond to TPB items. A path analysis found all constructs of the TPB model to be significantly related to tobacco-free policy compliance behaviors. Results from this study fill gaps in the mostly a-theoretical literature regarding our understanding of tobacco-free policy compliance behaviors as well as extend our knowledge of the TPB. Implications for this study provide recommendations for universities, health organizations, and government agencies currently attempting to enforce compliance with a tobacco-free policy.","Health-Related Policy Making, Policy Support, and Policy Impact",Health Communication
2017-0597,2017,Paper Session,Let There be Blamor - #hokkolorob,1,"In the month of September 2014, India came alive to the chants of “hokkolorob” coming from the eastern part of the country. The chants were however more virtual than physical, as students of Jadavpur University, Kolkata, were making sure the entire world heard about their student protests as they sought justice against on-campus sexual assault and unprecedented violence on students by the university administration. Taking to the platform of Twitter, the students used #hokkolorob, literally meaning ‘let there be clamor’ to generate public opinion and support for the movement that demanded changes in the university environment and administration. Applying a critical-cultural theoretical lens and analyzing social media through Jurgen Habermas’s ideation of public sphere, this research study looks into how Twitter can effectively be a mediated public sphere. This paper adds to the literature on how social media has been playing an ever increasing role in the space of social justice, activism and movements across the world and addresses the questions whether social media can go beyond just information dissemination and networking, but also generate strong public opinions and social changes.",Contemporary Digital Media Dynamics: Platform Imperialism Versus Networked Counterpublics?,Global Communication and Social Change
2017-0598,2017,Paper Session,Networked Counterpublics and Discursive Contestation in the Agonistic Public Sphere: Political Jamming a Police Force Facebook Page,1,"Drawing from agonistic public sphere perspectives, this study examines the jamming of the Hong Kong Police Force Facebook page by users since its establishment in October 2015. Ten posts accounting for 48711 comments among 11918 users were analyzed using corpus-based qualitative discourse analysis, supplemented with examination of linkages to networked counterpublics and structure of user participation over time. Findings showed that the initial page posts were heavily jammed with negative sentiment towards the police and calls for justice relating to alleged police brutality during the Umbrella Movement. However, sentiment turned positive over time as the structure of user engagement changed. The study highlights the opportunities and constraints of Facebook’s technological architecture for activists and networked counterpublics to challenge dominant discourses in situ. However, the effectiveness of counterdiscourses and potential to broker links to counterpublics is tempered by the transience of user comments and the decentralized structure of Facebook pages.",Contemporary Digital Media Dynamics: Platform Imperialism Versus Networked Counterpublics?,Global Communication and Social Change

It documents the major characteristics of the growth of digital platforms; then, it analyzes the nature of the development of local digital platforms in order to determine whether local-made digital platforms have controlled their own market. Then, it investigates the ways in which U.S.-based digital platforms have dominated and/or influenced the local market, constructing a new form of imperialism, which is platform imperialism, referring to an asymmetrical relationship of interdependence in platform technologies and political culture between the West, primarily the U.S., and many developing countries, including two great powers—both nation-states and transnational corporations. Finally, the present study examines not only hardware architecture, but also a corporate sphere and cultural values embedded in digital platforms in order to articulate whether a locally-focused digital platform study is able to provide a convincing proof of the emergence of platform imperialism theory.",Contemporary Digital Media Dynamics: Platform Imperialism Versus Networked Counterpublics?,Global Communication and Social Change
2017-0601,2017,Paper Session,Where is the Citizen in Communicative Capitalism? Communicative Citizenship in the Era of Commoditised Communication,1,"This article discusses how citizen participation in politics through communicative action can be analysed departing from a critical appreciation of the concept of communicative capitalism and its limitations. The term communicative capitalism has been used to define the system that structures political communicative interaction in the Internet. In communicative capitalism participation in on-line debates only contributes to the flow of messages that generates values to service providers, without any power to make an impact on politics. Despite its contribution to a critical analysis of on-line political participation, communicative capitalism has a mediacentric character and an ethnocentric bias. These limitations make it less useful as an analytical tool to assess the possibilities for citizenship action in the context of commoditised communication. To move beyond the limitations of communicative capitalism, the notion of communicative citizenship is proposed as a tool to understand the relation between communication, participation, and democracy.",Contemporary Digital Media Dynamics: Platform Imperialism Versus Networked Counterpublics?,Global Communication and Social Change

A Multimethod Analysis of the Memes and Selfies in the Feminist Protest Hashtag #distractinglysexy and its Resonance in Mainstream News Media,3,"Hashtag feminism has become a popular tactic for online protest against gender inequality. For example, using the Twitter hashtag #distractinglysexy, female scientists posted pictures about themselves in the lab or field to contest misogynist remarks by Nobel laureate Tim Hunt. We examined the resulting humorous and memetic social media discourse with a particular focus on visual forms of self-representation by female researchers. Automated and manual content analyses of the multimodal messages posted on Twitter were combined with a qualitative discourse analysis of the German and British news media coverage. The humorous memes and vernacular image types that were used for “self-mediation” triggered substantial media attention. However, while in the UK news media discourse the hashtag initiated a wider debate on sexism and discrimination in academia, in the German context the hashtag protest was portrayed as either “something funny on the web” or even as a harmful firestorm.",The Politics of Vision,Visual Communication Studies
2017-0603,2017,Paper Session,Murder Maps: Data Visualizations and the Fight Against Police Brutality,1,"This presentation draws on visual rhetoric, political theory, and critical data studies to investigate the genre of murder maps--an emergent form of data activism that works to counter the lack of governmental accountability for police brutality in the United States. As Stefania Milan (2014) and Helen Kennedy (2016) have argued, data activism is typically re-active and/or pro-active. While re-active data activism uses data-driven strategies taken to resist threats to civil rights, pro-active data activism takes advantage of big data to advocate for social change. In this article, I thus study the reactive and proactive functions of murder maps in order to elucidate how they document police brutality and divulge the demographic realities of police-related homicides. Such rhetorical analysis, I argue, is especially useful for disclosing how murder maps attempt to generate, in Jacques Rancière’s terms, a politics of emancipation through a redistribution of knowledge and truth.",The Politics of Vision,Visual Communication Studies
2017-0604,2017,Paper Session,The Projectilic Image: Islamic State's Global Networked Affect,1,"Islamic State (IS) uses conventional, guerilla and image warfare. To understand this image-warfare, this paper defines IS as a war machine that operates through spectacle, explores the central role of digital images in this war spectacle, and identifies a key modality of this new kind of warfare: global networked affect (GNA). IS’s image-warfare presents an auspicious opportunity to grasp the growing role of digital images in emergent configurations of global conflict. To this end, this paper focuses on the infamous February 2015 video featuring the spectacular burning of a Jordanian air force pilot captured by IS. It uses the method of “iconology” (Mitchell, 2011) within a case-study approach. It elaborates a theory of global networked affect (GNA) at the nexus of military conflict and image-warfare, merging both in the figure of the war machine. It analyzes IS’s doctrine of image-warfare explained in two IS books, arguing that IS’s GNA is projectilic, mimicking fast, lethal, penetrative objects; and necropolitical, deploying an aesthetic of morbidity. The paper suggests that an approach combining phenomenology, new materialism and affect theory, integrated into the figure of the war machine, is well suited to understanding what I call the “projectilic image” in the digital age.",The Politics of Vision,Visual Communication Studies
2017-0605,2017,Paper Session,Tracing 'Borderscapes' in Three Recent Documentaries on Central American Migration,1,"Through the analysis of cinematic representations of space, place and identity in three documentaries dealing with cross-border Central American migration: Which Way Home (Rebecca Cammisa, 2009), De Nadie (Tin Dirdamal, 2005) and Who is Dayani Cristal? (Marc Silver and Gael García Bernal, 2013), we aim to indicate the para-topicality of certain transitional spaces portrayed in cinema and whether or not they contribute to the migration narrative. A ‘paratopia’ does not refer to the absence of place, but rather to a difficult negotiation between place and non-place, a parasitic localisation that feeds off the impossibility of ever stabilising (Maingueneau 2004, own translation). We check the hypothesis that the representations of ‘borderscapes’ are an event in themselves that validate their own utterance as they interfere in the story world, rather than merely being contextual in the development of the narrative. To validate this hypothesis, we will analyse in depth the three documentaries mentioned above.",The Politics of Vision,Visual Communication Studies

The investigation is focused on the comments posted by fans and community managers after the broadcast of the programs’ finales. Due to the wide range of themes present in the sample (8,103 posts) we focus on those messages that reflected internet users’ interpretations of historical and social issues broached by the programs. Results suggest that period programs invite a larger number of comments related to social issues. Moreover, support for TV fiction’s fidelity to historical events is observed to be contingent upon the happiness-factor of those events; tragedy seems to be unpopular with viewers wanting to disconnect from their problems. Likewise, viewers enjoyed programs critical of current social issues (e.g. the omnipresent political corruption).",The Politics of Vision,Visual Communication Studies
2017-0607,2017,Paper Session,A Dynamic View of Intercultural Learning in a Village School in Sri Lanka,2,"This research studies intercultural learning practice of an English program taught by international volunteers in a village school in rural Sri Lanka. By emphasizing the context where these intercultural learning practices take place, this research discusses the intercultural dynamics and process in learning English as a second language setting. Based on the data analysis of 25 in-depth interviews, we first identify barriers of intercultural learning at the levels of language, culture and institution; Second, we find that intercultural dynamics functions as a mechanism to overcome barriers through both emotional and cognitive encounters. In addition, we find that intercultural dynamics created a space for critical learning about ethnicity that sustains learning practice. This learning space extends to online intercultural dialogue that involves students, families and residents of the village. A transitional understanding of space and culture going beyond the traditional notions of the nation-state concept needs to be further developed.","Cultural Adaptation, Identity, and Integration",Intercultural Communication

First, this study explored the extent to which argumentativeness changed during the adaptation process among immigrants to France from 2006 to 2015. Results revealed a curvilinear relationship between argumentativeness level change and time. For immigrants, argumentativeness increased from 2006 to 2009, then decreased slightly from 2009 to 2012 before decreasing after 2012 to almost the same levels as 2006. The second purpose was to answer Croucher and Kramer’s call to examine the cultural fusion process. The study investigated the influence of intercultural contact on communication traits by exploring the extent to which members of the dominant cultural group in France adapt their argumentativeness over time. Results revealed argumentativeness levels among members of the dominant culture did not change from 2006 to 2015. These findings expand our understanding of adaptation/fusion processes and of argumentativeness.","Cultural Adaptation, Identity, and Integration",Intercultural Communication

encounters. Portions of Kim’s contextual theory of interethnic communication were used as the theoretical framework for a two-stage model of identity (in)security. The first stage of the model measured self-assessments of personal self-esteem and ego-strength. The second stage measured how internal states influenced the evaluation of and communication with culturally dissimilar others. Results indicate ego-strength positively predicted personal self-esteem, which had an inverse relationship with intergroup anxiety and the derogation of culturally dissimilar others. Similarly, intergroup anxiety negatively predicted the derogation of culturally dissimilar others, and positively predicted perceptions of symbolic and realistic threat. The implications of our study are discussed, along with limitations and directions for further research.","Cultural Adaptation, Identity, and Integration",Intercultural Communication

Our inquiry is theoretically guided by communication infrastructure theory. We tested a hypothetical model that contain links among integrated connected to community storytelling network (ICSN), internal collective efficacy, external collective efficacy, community participation, and integrative adaptation in the context of the Korean Chinese community in Seoul. We found that the hypothetical model fits well to the data. ICSN is significantly and positively related to internal collective efficacy, community participation, and integrative adaptation. Internal collective efficacy is positively associated with community participation, external collective efficacy, and integrative adaptation. Each of community participation and external collective efficacy has positive association with integrative adaptation.","Cultural Adaptation, Identity, and Integration",Intercultural Communication

Previous research has found that young Latino/a brokers report adhering to two identity goals: (a) “act Latino/a” and (b) “act U.S. American”. Using survey data from 274 Latino/a 6th-8th grade students, this study examined how these two identity goals and young brokers’ acculturation are associated with parent-child negative conflict management and parent-child relational closeness. “Acting U.S American” while brokering was associated with negatively managing parent-child conflict. However, “acting Latino/a” while exhibiting low levels of either ethnic identifications was associated with higher parent-child relational closeness. Results can help improve the parent-child relationship for Latino/a, immigrant junior high school students.","Cultural Adaptation, Identity, and Integration",Intercultural Communication

Some communities require participants to create accounts and login before contributing whereas others do not. Do these user accounts catalyze cooperation or inhibit greater participation? Prior literature makes divergent predictions, but lacks observational evidence capable of identifying causal effects. We report the results of an empirical test using exhaustive longitudinal data from 136 natural experiments in a population of wiki communities where would-be contributors were suddenly required to create and login with a user account in order to participate. We estimate the impact of the change and find that requiring user accounts dramatically reduces the number of low quality contributions, deters higher quality participation, and leads to a small increase in the number of contributors creating new accounts. We conclude that user accounts are costly barriers to entry that introduce tradeoffs for public goods production.",Semantics and Structure of Online Communication,Computational Methods

Forum moderators can provide valuable support when participants are struggling, but considerable labor is required to review newly posted content. This paper investigates whether advances in natural language processing and machine learning may facilitate automatically identifying concerning messages in real-time, allowing for more timely and efficient engagement by forum moderators.
Methods: For training data, messages from a recovery forum were labeled for whether or not authors mentioned recovery problems. Binary classifiers for recovery problems leveraged supervised machine learning, contrasting several natural language processing approaches: 1) a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model 2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program and 3) a hybrid approach combining BoW and LIWC.
Results: A Boosted Decision Tree classifier, utilizing features from both BoW and LIWC, achieved 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in an additional recovery forum.

Rather than focusing on the possible negative effects of the media or the negative influence of interpersonal relationships, the present study examined what was presumed to be a positive influence in the development of children’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors specific to health. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of a health literacy/health intervention program longitudinally on children’s nutritional knowledge, attitudes toward healthy eating and exercise, food preferences and eating behavior from a perspective of SEM. Using a sample of elementary school children in grades 2 and 3 and then grades 3 and 4, a field experiment was conducted using a new media technology to record children’s food intake at home and at school. Results from the study suggest the health literacy/health intervention program was successful as positive increases in cognition, attitudes, and behavior were observed. From a perspective of Social Ecological Model, the findings suggest that children’s eating behaviors need to be considered at the intersection of children’s health literacy/attitudes, community efforts, and media environment.

Specifically, we try to identifying cardiovascular and skin conductance patterns of transportation states during narrative processing. These real-time indicators of transportation will be used to predict outcomes of narrative enjoyment and comprehension.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems
2017-0631,2017,Paper Session,Measuring Actor-Observer Perspective Taking in Narrative Processing,2,"An important difference in the way audience members engage and understand story characters is whether they take an actor’s or observer’s perspective. This paper conceptualizes and operationalizes elements of perspective taking in the context of a media story, proposing and testing the reliability and validity of a multi-dimensional measurement of actor-observer perspective taking (AOPT). Using stories in two different contexts, an exploratory factor analysis identified six dimensions of actor-observer perspective taking—egocentric projection, intentionality judgment, understanding from a character’s perspective, internal attribution, external attribution, and capability explanation. A replication of earlier results that used different measures showed the effect of character morality on perspective taking and supported construct validity. An analysis differentiating AOPT measures from transportation supports discriminant validity. The importance of perspective taking in the psychology of narrative is discussed.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems
2017-0632,2017,Paper Session,Extending Conceptualization and Measurement of Narrative Engagement After the Fact: Parasocial Relationship and Imaginative Retrospective Involvement,3,"Engagement with narratives and identification with narrative characters is usually conceptualized as occurring during the narrative experience itself. However, much involvement with narrative characters may occur retrospectively and imaginatively. The present study, using a cross-sectional survey quota-sampled to represent U.S. demographic norms, provides conceptualization and measurement of parasocial relationships (PSR) that is clearly retrospective and conceptually distinct from parasocial interaction (PSI). Moreover, we distinguish PSR from another concept introduced and operationalized here, retrospective imaginative involvement, and provide evidence for validity of these measures. We compare them to the related concepts of transportability and boundary expansion, and assess fit using measurement models and confirmatory factor analysis, refining measurement on half the data set and confirming fit on the other half. We demonstrate predictive validity with respect to a measure of self-reported effects of narratives on beliefs and behavior, controlling for these various related measures, and also validate short versions of these measures for greater ease of research use.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems
2017-0633,2017,Paper Session,Journalistic Storytelling and Narrative Persuasion: The Impact of Different Exemplar Types on Message-Consistent Attitudes,3,"Exemplars are key elements in journalism practice. They are applied to reduce the issue’s complexity to enhance audience comprehension. At the same time, narrative persuasion research found that exemplars can foster deep engagement with the story and alter existing attitudes and behaviors. Scholarly literature distinguishes exemplars that vary in the representation of the inner state of the protagonist. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of these different types of exemplars on the audience. To fill that gap in research, two field experiments have been conducted on two different topics. Results confirm exemplars as origin of persuasive effects in narrative communication. However, in contrast to our expectations, the added presentation of subjective emotions and thoughts of a protagonist does not result in greater engagement with the story. Rather, the mere presence of the exemplar seems to make the difference. The underlying psychological mechanisms are discussed.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems

We will conduct an experiment on Facebook (N = 300) using a 2 (message structure: narrative-first versus information-first) x 2 (context: native advertising versus advertisement by a health organization) between-subjects design. We expect that a health narrative in an implicit, native advertisement format will receive more attention and appreciation, compared to an explicit advertising format. We also expect that a narrative-first format will increase involvement, systematic message processing, information-seeking intent and behavior, and that these effects will be positively moderated by the incorporation of the narrative in a native advertising format.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems

However, little is known about the effects on recipients with regards to the perception of politicians and news stories. To test the influence of information verbalized by politicians compared to journalist voice-over we conducted an online-experiment. Participants were assigned to one of three conditions of the same news story: sound bite (politician talking), image bite (journalist voice-over) or a sound and image bite (mixed version). Further, we asked participants about their evaluation of the politician as well as of the news story. We also tested the effect of the three conditions on the recall of verbal and visual information. Our results show, that verbal information are best remembered in the sound bite condition and that news stories containing longer direct speech by politicians are evaluated more interesting and more professional. The implications of these results are discussed.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems

The present study investigates how formal attributes, such as shot scale, shot length and camera perspective, affect audience members’ narrative engagement, as well as how gender moderates this effect. Fourteen film scenes depicting violence were annotated for shot scale, shot length and camera perspective, and presented in a between-subject design experiment (N = 126). Participants were randomly assigned to one film scene and were asked to fill in questionnaires on their narrative experiences. Data was submitted to a multivariate linear regression analysis. Results show that shorter and closer shots increase narrative engagement; however the effect of shot length is moderated by camera perspective. Internal camera perspective decreased narrative engagement; although this effect was more characteristic to males. The findings elucidate complex interaction effects of formal properties of visual narratives on audiences’ narrative engagement.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems

Online discussions, promotional materials, and reviews are potential sources of premature revelations about story plotlines. Recent experimental evidence suggests that spoilers have modest and inconsistent effects on enjoyment and other audience responses. In this study, we investigate the implications of spoilers for horror films, a genre reliant on suspenseful thrills. Participants were exposed to multiple scenes from horror films, and spoilers were manipulated at different stages of the narrative for both minor plot points and major plot points. Results indicate no main effects of spoilers for enjoyment, transportation, suspense, processing fluency, or reactance. However, need for affect and horror fandom each moderated a positive effect of minor spoilers on enjoyment. Those who value the thrills of horror films may receive enjoyment from the anticipation produced by spoilers about smaller plot points such as frightful moments or minor twists.",Narrative Processing II,Information Systems
2017-0638,2017,Paper Session,Does Consistency Matter? Perception and Persuasiveness of Value Appeals in Populist Communication,1,"Values are important elements of political communication. Political actors use them to legitimize their positions, and voters base their choices on values they consider important. Although research has shown that political actors benefit from appealing to values that resonate with their audience’s value preferences, it remains still an open question to what extent this can be exploited. How do individuals react to value appeals that are inconsistent with the communicator’s value reputation? This paper examines this question in the context of right-wing populist parties, who are strongly associated with conservative values. In two experiments, the effects of consistent (conservative) and inconsistent (self-transcendence) value appeals on perception (study 1) and persuasion (study 2) are investigated. It is expected that consistent values will be perceived stronger than inconsistent values, but that both kind of appeals can be persuasive when they match with the audience’s value orientation. The results confirm these expectations and show that especially individuals with lower formal education can be persuaded to support right-wing populist claims when these are promoted with inconsistent value appeals that match the audience’s value preferences.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Messages,Political Communication
2017-0639,2017,Paper Session,Echoes of Populism: The Stickiness of Populist Messages,2,"Despite a plethora of studies investigating the rise of populist parties and candidates, there remains discussion as to the precise nature of populism. More specifically, extant research implicitly assumes that a specific aspect of populist rhetoric – i.e., popular/elite antagonism – explains the increase in populist party support, yet rarely empirically assert this. Yet, existing research has not examined which aspects of the populist rhetoric ‘stick’
more amongst the public, and are most likely to explain the electoral effects of populist messages. This paper presents evidence from three large-scale online survey experiments(nStudy1 = 973, nStudy2 = 1425, nStudy3 = 1572) investigating whether populist messages affect
the accessibility of blame attributions, populist parties, and issue information amongst the public.

Building upon the differential susceptibility model of media effects, that the anti-establishment message of populist parties is especially effective among people that score low on the personality trait Agreeableness. We find evidence for this argument in a study conducted in the United States. Persons low on Agreeableness are more likely to support Donald Trump but not other politicians. Moreover, in a conjoint-experiment we show that the anti-establishment message leads to more support for a politician but only among the low agreeable participants. Thus, explanations of the success of populism should take the interaction between populist communication and personality traits into account.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Messages,Political Communication
2017-0641,2017,Paper Session,The Polarizing Impact of News Coverage on Populist Attitudes in the Public: Evidence From a Panel Study in Four European Democracies,6,"Many democratic countries have recently experienced a rise in populist political communication. The present study explores how populist messages spread through the news media affect populist attitudes. We investigate this relationship with a panel study in four European metropolitan regions (Berlin, Paris, London, Zurich). The study combines a content analysis of news coverage on two policy areas (n = 7,119 stories) with a two-wave panel survey (n = 2,338) through an individual matching procedure. Results indicate that the dose of unopposed populist statements received through the media has a conditional effect on populist attitudes that depends on prior populist convictions. Such an effect can be found in three of the four regional subsamples, with London as the only exception. While the observable interaction varies between subsamples, the general picture is that a higher dose of populist media messages tends to enhance both strong prior agreement and disagreement with populism.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Messages,Political Communication

This study investigates in how far followers of the populist ideology on the citizen level agree to these perceptions. In the attempt to identify the populist citizen, research so far has looked at sociodemographic factors, political leanings, psychological states as well as preferences for specific media messages in their relation to populist attitudes. Following the idea of a populist worldview (e.g., Hawkins, 2010) this paper adds to these prior studies by tracing the populist citizen’s perceptions of the mainstream media and public opinion. Survey data revealed that populist attitudes are related to incongruent mainstream media perceptions as well as to congruent public opinion perceptions. Implications of these specific populist perceptual patterns for democratic societies will be discussed.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Messages,Political Communication

We conducted three surveys to develop and validate a measure of Self-Efficacy in HRI. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factorial (factors perceived self-efficacy and loss of control) solution with good reliability (study 1, n = 201). Confirmatory factor analysis did not confirm the two-factorial structure and revealed a better model fit for a one-factorial solution for a German (study 2, n = 450) and an English version (study 3, n = 209) of the scale with good indices for convergent and divergent validity. The final questionnaire with 18 items was used in an experimental study (study 4, n = 60). We found that interacting with a robot increased self-efficacy and that individual changes in self-efficacy predict more positive evaluations. This demonstrates that self-efficacy can be positively influenced by experience and that individual self-efficacy is a strong explanatory variable for evaluation effects.",Interacting with Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology

This has raised questions about how people respond to robots and what factors lead to their acceptance. This study tested the effects of robot characteristics on psychological responses to and acceptance of the robot. The controllability and the vocal expressions of the robot were manipulated in an experiment on human-robot interaction (N = 92). Having high control over the robot during the interaction led to higher perceived task performance and higher perceived ease of use compared to having low control. However, having low control over the robot during the interaction resulted in higher mind attribution. Furthermore, interacting with a robot with the capability of vocal expression led to higher perceived animacy, mind attribution, and perceived human likeness compared to interacting with a robot without this capability. Finally, perceived ease of use and perceived human likeness increased robot acceptance.",Interacting with Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology

Previous studies have found that one’s self avatar and others’ avatars may prime behaviors consistent with characteristics of the avatars. We argue that in addition to assessing one’s own avatar and others avatar, in social interactions, people assess avatars in relation to other avatars. Similarity reduces uncertainty which promotes disclosure and identification. We conducted a 2 (self avatar: old vs. young) x 2 (partner’s avatar: old vs. young) experiment with 95 older-adult participants aged 60 and above. The findings showed that the participants’ avatar or their interaction partner’s avatar’s age did not prime age-related behavior. However, there was an interaction effect, participants disclosed more information when their avatar’s age matched their partner’s avatar’s age. They also identified with their interaction partners more when the avatars’ had similar age appearances.",Interacting with Robots and Agents,Communication and Technology

In a two-wave online survey (N = 603), poll results were manipulated, and attitudes toward the issue, building cable cars in national parks in South Korea, were measured before and after poll results exposure. Perceived amount of attitude change by poll results was also measured. When the majority opinion in the poll was incongruent with the respondents’ pre-existing attitude, respondents underestimated the amount attitude change of self and overestimated the amount of attitude change of others. Perceived amount of attitude change on others was found to be greater than that on self.

Although researchers have previously explored polls and poll usage among the citizenry, there exists little research on poll aggregation sites. The current study focused on three primary categories of independent variables: demographics, political interest and activity, and trait-level characteristics. A series of regression analyses indicated that although usage of poll aggregation sites and value perceptions associated with poll aggregation sites are somewhat strongly related, these variables are, themselves, associated with a different constellation of independent variables. Second, as it specifically pertains to use of aggregate polling sites, political interest/activity factors emerged as the strongest predictors of engagement. Third, the current data provided scant evidence to support the notion that individual-level psychological traits are meaningfully associated with either use of or value in aggregate poll sites.",The Perception of Public Opinion,Mass Communication

We tested the mediation effect of perceived social support, influencing the sense of power/control and in turn affecting their willingness to share opinions on their personal Social Networking Sites. We found that people are more willing to speak out on social media when their perceived social support enhances perceived sense of power/control through their opinion congruency with others’ online comments.

This study examined the possibility that the effects of trait fear of isolation on opinion expression online would appear different across discourse situations. Individuals’ speaking-out intention and behavior were unobtrusively measured using realistic-looking online discussion forums. The findings indicated that the contribution of fear of isolation to opinion expression varied depending on the revelation of identity and the votes climate on the forum. In particular, contrary to general expectations, people with high fear of isolation had greater intention to write a comment and actually did so when they were on an identified online forum.

2017-0650,2017,Paper Session,Exploring Correlates of Fitspirational Social Media Use: The Role of Social Media in Body Image and Excessive Exercise Among Young Women,3,"Recent content analyses of social media revealed a new type of content: fitspiration. Although fitspiration messages are said to inspire women towards an empowered body image, concerns about exposure to these messages have been raised, without accompanying empirical data. Using data from 359 women (18 - 28 years), we investigated how four types of fitspirational social media messages were related to body image. Additionally, we examined the role of individual difference variables (IDVs) in this relationship. Findings indicated that IDVs differentially predict exposure to types of fitspirational content, and differentially moderate the relationship between exposure and body image. Thus, although overall fitspirational social media use is negatively related to body image, this is not the case for all women. Overall, this study emphasizes that the relationship between fitspirational social media use and body image involves a complex interaction of social media user characteristics and the exact content that they consume.","Body Image, Idealized Image, and Media",Mass Communication
2017-0651,2017,Paper Session,Exposure to Idealized Media Images and Preventive Effects of Awareness Intervention Material for Young Men,2,"Research on the effects of idealized media images has consistently shown that exposure to such images is linked to negative outcomes, such as body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and even tendencies for disordered eating: Adolescents use idealized media images as a beauty standard to compare themselves against, ignoring that these images are often digitally modified and thus not realistic portrayals of beauty. Consequently, several studies have shown positive effects of debunking the artificial nature of beauty images through awareness intervention material, but only for young women. In the present study, we examined whether beneficial effects of awareness material could also be observed for young men. In line with existing research, we found that watching an awareness intervention video on the artificial nature of beauty advertisements had positive effects on young males’ self-esteem. In addition, analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by perceived attainability of idealized beauty images.","Body Image, Idealized Image, and Media",Mass Communication

The current study examined the relationship between female university students’ photo-based activities on Instagram, appearance-related comparisons, and two outcome variables: drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. Photo-based activities on Instagram were positively associated with drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction through appearance-related comparisons. These findings suggest that individuals who are constantly engaging in comparisons on Instagram might be at risk for increased body image concerns. Another purpose of this study was to determine whether individual differences in competitiveness for mates influenced individual tendencies to engage in appearance-related comparisons on Instagram. Results showed a significant positive relationship between intrasexual competitiveness for mates and appearance-related comparisons on Instagram. We recommend future researchers use experimental designs to further clarify the role of intrasexual competition.","Body Image, Idealized Image, and Media",Mass Communication

The current paper focuses on pregnant and postpartum women; these women are rarely examined in a media research context but are particularly vulnerable to body image concerns. Accordingly, the current study consisted of an experiment that examined the influence of the media on body image in pregnant and postpartum women. The study involved 192 pregnant or postpartum women who read a magazine containing glamorized media portrayals of pregnant/postpartum women or a control magazine. Pregnant women reported lower body image after only five minutes of exposure to the magazine with pregnant/postpartum women compared to the control group. There was no immediate effect on postpartum women.

2017-0656,2017,Paper Session,Motivated Tweeting and Motivated Processing: Influencing Debate Viewership Through Twitter Instruction,2,"Researchers have noted that individual processing of political media messages occurs through various filters of partisanship, interest, cynicism, and exogenous factors such as media frames. This phenomenon of motivated processing is, as of yet, understudied in the context of presidential debates. As major campaign events, presidential debates have been linked to significant increases in participant political knowledge, PIE, and changes in candidate evaluation. Individual information processing undetected by the extant literature on debates may influence these outcomes. As such, the present study proposes the capacity to manipulate processing of a political debate, as evidenced through engagement with social media. Researchers asked participants to tweet while watching presidential primary debates following three different sets instructions, approximating partisan motivated processing, accuracy motivated processing, and a control group who were simply asked to tweet their thoughts about the debate. The content of the tweets are presented, alongside survey data to determine if manipulating prompts to process the debate in a particular way had an impact on tweet frequency and content.",New Research From the 2016 American Elections,Political Communication

find that post-debate coverage has strong effects on performance evaluations, with subjects’ perceptions
moving in the direction of the partisan slant of the channel they were assigned to watch on.
Though these effects evolve over time, with subjects coming to express beliefs in line with the media
consensus, they do not disappear altogether. Moderate partisans were still affected by the postdebate

Yet, there has been relatively little systematic examination of the growth of comparative journalism studies or in-depth analysis of the power relations within the field in relation to, for example, trends in authorship or dominant methodologies and paradigms. This paper reports the results of a systematic analysis of comparative studies of journalism published between 2000 and 2015, a key growth period for the field. By examining in detail a population of 300 articles published in five key journals, we demonstrate that comparative journalism studies is a dynamic field that has developed considerable structure over time, and outline some key patterns, such as a continuing focus on Western authorship, the study of Western countries, quantitative methods of analysis and on political aspects of journalism.",Comparative Journalism Research: Where Do We Stand?,Journalism Studies

However, few studies examine cross-nationally the extent to which such similarities and commonalities hold true in the performance of journalistic roles in news content. This paper reports descriptive findings from a cross-national content analysis conducted in 19 countries (N=34,514). Our results show that the performance of roles varies significantly across countries. Nevertheless, we found little empirical evidence supporting previous studies, which, for example, claim that the disseminator role tends to dominate in the Liberal Model, whereas interventionism is common in Mediterranean or partisan journalistic cultures. Indeed, our results go in the opposite direction. Furthermore, we found countries not generally associated with the watchdog role performing it at a higher level than countries traditionally associated with this role, offering empirical evidence to support the existence of hybrid journalistic cultures.",Comparative Journalism Research: Where Do We Stand?,Journalism Studies

Critics laud Tagaq’s sound but struggle to describe her voice, typically characterizing it as animalistic or otherwise non-human. We would not be wrong to interpret these characterizations for their colonial provenance, as reiterations of the racist association of racialization with animality. We would be similarly justified interpreting Tagaq’s favorable reception as an instance of “eating the other,” whereby even those who desire her art’s decolonial dimensions are beholden to its false reconciliation in the market. However, her popular reception also points to a fantastical anticipation of a social world relieved of classification. Non-human characterizations of Tagaq’s voice cannot be fully explained as racist euphemism or innocent empirical description; they are also evidence of a wish for a world that current forces of production cannot realize.",Listen In: The Voices of Women in Music Production and Consumption,Feminist Scholarship

Whereas the marketing for earlier models of portable televisions during the 1960s relied on new-frontierist rhetoric to align the technology with women’s liberation, adverts for the Watchman often construct the device as masculine. Adverts implied that the Watchman could act as a sort of technological phallus and overcome the limitations of a less than masculine body. In doing so, the Watchman could make its users cyborg-like masters of public space. Further, by stressing “control” as a unique element of user experience, marketing for the Watchman offered men the opportunity to reestablish their masculinity and reclaim social power by re-asserting consumer control over a medium (television) that has historically been constructed as feminine.",Listen In: The Voices of Women in Music Production and Consumption,Feminist Scholarship
2017-0666,2017,Paper Session,The Communicative-Organizational Affordances of Mobile Social Media in Knowledge Workers' Unionization Efforts,1,"Building on research about the role of mobile social media in social struggles, this study analyzes the ways in which knowledge workers use these technologies during labor unionizations. It considers the communicative-organizational affordances of mobile devices and social media sites, mainly multimodality, persistence and visibility. It asks: how do knowledge workers utilize mobile social media during the sensitive stage of initial unionization? Based on Network Ethnography, materials are collected from unionization Facebook pages and key informants. This methodology allows following timelines, as well as analyzing texts and interactions, within their contexts. Initial findings reveal that unionizing knowledge workers utilize mobile social media for recruiting supporters and members, organizing protests and resisting managements' counter-unionization actions; and- they acknowledge the possibilities and constrains of the multimodality, persistence and visibility affordances of mobile social media. This research sheds light on the emergence of mobile social media in organizational communication, particularly during organizational resistance.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

This project concerns discovering the handling of internal and external communication, along with the interactions between different actors involved: executives, employers, suppliers, and journalists. The study is based upon in-depth interviews with key managers, and focus groups among workers and journalists. Chief executives and communication managers debated questions of organizational communication in a corporation hard hit by a bankruptcy. As preliminary results we will highlight the extremely passive communication (sit-out strategy, lack of clarity and mixed messages) during the acute onset of the crisis and the low level of proactive communication in the course of the crisis.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication
2017-0668,2017,Paper Session,“He Doesn’t Like Me and He is Angry”: Effectiveness of the Core Concerns Framework in Managing Conflicts Between Inter-and Intracultural Manager-Employee Dyads,4,"This experimental study examined the effectiveness of Fisher and Shapiro’s (2005) core concerns framework (CCF) in dealing with emotionally-loaded conflict between managers and employees who came from the same and different cultures (American versus American and American versus Chinese). Based on the face negotiation theory, it also investigated if employees’ self-construal and perception of managers’ conflict management competency moderated the success of manager use of the CCF. Finally, it explored what in the CCF led to satisfactory negotiation in both cultures. Thirty-four simulated conflict negotiations using the CCF were video-coded and statistically analyzed. Findings revealed CCF is an effective strategy in mitigating intra- and intercultural, emotionally-loaded conflict negotiations between managers and employees. Theoretically, results partially support and may extend the face negotiation theory. Practically, they encourage continued investment in the CCF training for organizational members in an increasingly diverse workforce.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Moreover, social problems such as climate change, which is a critical issue for MNCs, cannot only have proximal solutions. The present study has adopted the concepts of psychological distance and level of construal in order to help provide strategic suggestions for MNCs about this duality pressure. A 2 (spatially near vs. distant) x 2 (hypothetically near vs. distant) x 2 (feasibility vs. desirability) quasi-experiment was conducted with 300 adults. The result showed that desirability messages have a stronger persuasive power on psychologically distant CSR campaigns, whereas feasibility messages have a stronger persuasive power on psychologically near campaigns. The result has also provided some evidence for the interaction effect between two distance dimensions.

The paper takes its point of departure in the significant changes in the management of higher education institutions, which have entailed an ongoing transformation from an academic driven university towards the managerial university.
Through a longitudinal study with access to the ongoing implementation process of quality and relevance as the leading managerial values and to a large pool of communication practices applying these values, the paper examines the constitutive process whereby the meanings of quality and relevance become temporarily fixed. Drawing on the conceptual framework of constitutive communication of organizing and Laclau’s (1990, 1993) conceptualization of hegemonic intervention, the paper examines quality and relevance as hegemonic communicative practices with constitutive and performative effects and with a particular interest in equivocal and dynamic meaning fixation.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

It expands the focus from populations to the organizational community. Interpopulational networks are conceptualized as additional resources each organization possesses to move beyond the limited resources available within their own environmental spaces. With data collected from AngelList, this study examines the funding patterns for two industries (tech startups and media startups) in the Greater Los Angeles Area and Silicon Valley.

During these times abroad, members experience forced cohabitation between different cultures. This forced integration could potentially affect a service member’s interactions and attitudes towards their conflict management with the other cultures (Greene, Buckman, Dandeker, & Greenberg, 2010). Using Hofstede’s (2001) cultural dimensions and Giles (1973) Accommodation Theory as frameworks, the current study asks, for previously deployed U.S. Military personnel who have experienced forced cohabitation, controlling for times deployed, age, gender, experience/rank, and branch of service, what is the relationship between cultural identities and attitudes, and behaviors toward the military and other cultures?

Contemporary issues related to climate change bring professionals to now consider an architectural construction as a green building, the construction sector being an important producer of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and this worldwide. This research endorses an interdisciplinary approach to architecture, based on collaborative practices, promoting the development of sustainable and green practices in the construction sector. From this premise, we consider the architectural “project” as a place and an object of communication enabling collaboration between specialists from various disciplines. To test this conceptual proposition, we based our arguments on the case study of a student competition, a competition on wood construction addressed to architecture and engineering graduates. The research results reflect the relevance of our assumptions and especially the role of action in the dissolution of disciplinary boundaries.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication
2017-0677,2017,Paper Session,Older Workers’ Stereotypes and Communication Research: A Review,2,"Across Europe, older workers continue to face barriers to employment, training, and, promotion due to negative stereotypes. This study reviews the literature on the link between on the one hand corporate and mass media's portrayals and organizational communication, and on the other older workers' stereotypes. The results show that empirical work in this domain is still scarce. The available evidence suggests that salient stereotypes in the media environment are inherently linked to, and potentially perpetuated by, communication within organizations with negative consequences for interactional and behavioral outcomes. By disconfirming negative stereotypical information, mass media may contribute to a more positive rebranding of older workers. Based on our analysis we propose a research agenda, focusing on (a) how stereotypes in media content evolve over time, (b) how group membership and media use interact to reinforce or counter-salient stereotypes, and (c) how barriers to intergenerational communication in organizations can be overcome.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Knowledge brokers seem to enhance organizational interaction and facilitate knowledge creation in virtual environments. They connect communities of practice and create new knowledge. To explore deeper the communications and the role of knowledge brokers this study was conducted by mixed-methods. The extensive data set, which contains 33100 message threads was first analyzed by quantitative methods. The potential knowledge brokers were identified and selected from the mass.

Their reliance on modern communication technology has attracted a great deal of attention. Many note, that IS’ propagandistic Hollywood-styled videos, excessive usage of social media and heavily altered images show how well the organization is embedded in the technological media terrain.
This paper seeks to analyze IS’ communicative strategies. Namely, it focuses on the fact that IS often mimics contemporary media formats using different remediation strategies for their propagandistic messages which can be characterized as the repositioning of existing content into a different contextual framework.
The research relies on qualitative content analysis examining IS’ remediation practices. The contribution, thereby, analyzes IS’ English-language monthly Dabiq magazine.

This study builds on boundary management literature and to argue that boundary management preferences affect the work related use of public social media over time. Additionally, based on research on communication technology use in the workplace we link work related social media use to increased engagement over time. In doing so, we link boundary management preferences to engagement through work related social media use. The results support the hypothesized causal structure showing a significant positive mediation effect of boundary preferences at T1 on engagement at T3, through social media use at T2.

ESM platforms are multidimensional web based tools that allow versatile forms of communication in organizations. They are considered to promote interactivity and sharing, thus raising the question of employees’ self-disclosure behavior. Through self-disclosure, individual shares information about self and manages the boundaries around private information. Self-disclosure has recently gained attention in the context of personal social media platforms, but has not yet been profoundly studied in the ESM setting. Our study focuses on both the goals, concerns, and characteristics employees have regarding their own self-disclosure, as well as the attitudes towards self-disclosure of other employees in ESM. We integrate two theoretical frameworks, the theory of communication privacy management (Petronio, 2002) and technology affordances (Treem & Leonardi, 2012).",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

Although many authors acknowledge the socially constructed nature of emotions, emotions and affects still seem to be viewed primarily as individual psychological states. We take a relational perspective focused on the micro-level of emotional discourse and ask how emotions are expressed, discussed, and evoked and what kinds of discursive work they do. The data consists of interviews and documentary material from a strategic change process in a large European media corporation. Drawing from discursive psychology for our analysis, we shed light on specific ways in which emotions function as discursive resources used to legitimate the strategic change and engage organizational members in the process.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

However, relatively few studies have explored its role in intercultural situations. This is surprising given how organisations are becoming increasingly diverse and operating in various countries. This paper addresses this gap in the literature. It reports on an exploratory project that sought to determine how perceptions of organisational gossip vary between members of different cultural groups and to establish the challenges of undertaking such a study. Using a sensemaking, interpretative approach, we showed three gossip scenarios to 8 Chinese, 8 German and 8 Dutch first year students, and, conducting semi structured interviews, asked them how they perceived the gossiper, the object of gossip and the listener. Certain patterns emerged, such as, for example,the Dutch and Chinese students perceived the object of gossip differently when s/he was the boss and had different expectations as to how a boss should behave.

2017-0685,2017,Paper Session,"Power, Gender, and Standpoint: Managing Power Though Distancing, Shifting, and Obscuring",1,"Women are growing in numbers in leadership positions in businesses, governments and academia, yet remain a marginalized population. This research will use feminist standpoint to focus on examining how women in leadership roles navigate the power afforded to them by positions. A feminist standpoint methodology was used to collect 32 interviews on the perceptions about gender and power among the male and female administrators (deans, department chairs, directors, etc.,) and faculty on six college campuses.
Being in a leadership positions does not remove all the barriers for women. Organizational logic favors masculine approaches to work and organizing. Jobs are evaluated based on masculine notions of work; thus, women cannot be deemed successful when evaluated by a standard that emphasizes hegemonic masculinity (Acker, 1990). This paper examines the space where power granted by leadership positions and marginalization of being a woman intersect. Leadership roles are powerful, and it is worth examining how women navigate the power that comes with the leadership position in the organizational hierarchy. Previous research on women in leadership roles has looked at what differences exist between female faculty and staff (Wahl & Vocate, 1993). Additionally, Denker (2009) has considered what it means to “do gender” in the academy and concluded that a more equitable performance of gender roles is necessary to benefit men and women in the academy.
The purpose of this study it to examine how women in leadership positions navigate power. Previous research has called for men’s voices to be included in developing a deeper understanding of intersections of leadership and power, and specifically how men experience power paradoxes. (Pfafman & Bochantin, 2012). Men and women perceive and enact power differently: “even when men and women occupy the same formal position, men are both given and take greater power than their female counterparts” (Dougherty, 1999, p. 437). In this research the themes of denial of power and a complex relationship with power within the leadership role emerged, which lead to a focus on the gendered power paradox. Women in leadership roles employ various strategies to manage and conceal the power they have in leadership roles. Men see the tension women negotiate and are free to not engage with it.
This paper will review the literature on gendered power paradox, discuss feminist standpoint theory framework and read the data gathered with FST.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication
2017-0686,2017,Paper Session,Between Online and Offline Agenda Building: The Influence of Organizational Texts on News Content,1,"Scholars in organizational communication have conceptualized the media as platforms where non-organizational members (e.g., journalists and external stakeholders) have the capacity to author organizational texts, and thereby co-constitute organizations as particular entities with specific identities, in the public sphere. Recent research in journalism and news media indicates that online news outlets may be far more dependent on texts supplied by organizations than offline media. Against this background, the present study investigates to what extent press releases, as a specific type of organizational text, influences media content in terms of organizational salience; issues attributed to the organization; tone attributed to the organization; and how this differs for online and offline news. Modeling the contingency of, so-called, ‘agenda-building effects’ in a statistical time-series design will allow for making strong causal claims about how news content is influenced by organizational texts.",Organizational Communication Research Escalator - Extended Session (Part 1),Organizational Communication

By analyzing organizational communication differences between more and less successful cases of post/bureaucratic hybridization, I identify challenges to and possibilities for the intentional cultivation of organized dissonance (Ashcraft, 2000, 2006).

Existing theories have focused on relatively well-defined short-term contexts in which experts from diverse domains develop common ground and integrate diverse knowledge for innovative outcomes. Approaches to resolving knowledge barriers identified in those studies may not be sustainable in long-term collaboration contexts. Based on a field study of long-range urban planning processes in two major metropolitan regions, this paper presents communicative strategies used by multiple stakeholder groups—strategic criticism—to collaborate with planners while maintaining their distinct perspectives. Primary data includes 61 in-depth interviews, documents used for knowledge sharing, and field notes.

Using survey data from 580 college students, we found that social media activities (i.e., consuming and posting/discussing news/information about an organization) influence individuals’ relational satisfaction, which in turn affects their behavioral intention. The findings suggest that to foster students’ supportive behavioral intention, universities need to cultivate good relationships with their students by providing information that students can use to share and interact with others.

Informed by the situational theory of problem solving, this exploratory work investigates students’ relational and personal dynamics at the base of the spread of the crisis spillover effects. Reporting on the insights collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews with the students, this study found that students felt alarmed because of their university’s institutional similarities with the affected organization. In addition, the concerns that their university could also be in a similar problematic situation as the crisis-stricken university resulted in a legitimacy loss for some of the university strategies. Findings also showed that the magnitude of the crisis spillover varied depending on factors such as participants’ memories of similar prior events and trust towards their university. The spillover effect was also mediated by multiple intermediaries that provided information marked by different levels of quality.

A 2 (news coverage medium: video vs. print) × 2 (crisis response medium: video vs. print) experiment was conducted whereby participants (N = 217) watched or read a news report of a university athletics scandal and then watched or read a crisis response by a university spokesperson. Results indicated that a print response elicited greater perceived organizational reputation after following video coverage compared to print coverage. No significant differences were found between video coverage and print coverage when followed by a video response. Similar indirect effects were found on potential supportive behavior and positive word-of-mouth intent toward the university as mediated by reputation.

To enrich scholarship in this understudied area, this case study examined the use of social media in a New Zealand university. Based on interviews, content analysis and document review, this study explored the reported tension between the interactive participatory culture of social media and the promotional use for marketing and one-way information transmission. Given the young, social media savvy nature of universities’ key public – students – this analysis argues that social media should play a pivotal role in facilitating community building and engagement in universities to combat “marketing imperialism”, but that an open, participatory approach must be used, rather than seeing social media as space for all but appealing content production.",Higher Education Interventions: Reputation and Social Media Presence of Universities,Public Relations

With the advances of Internet technologies, such practices have become more available but not well researched. Using netnography and content analysis, this paper examines a civic crowdfunding campaign that ran independently by two amateur activists to raise U$1.5 million to buy a private beach and gift it back to the public in New Zealand. It makes noteworthy contributions to PR practice and scholarship at two levels. At the practical level, it identifies the success factors for running a community-based campaign using civic crowdfunding to mobilize financial and non-financial resources that is unmatched by organizations. At the theoretical level, it points towards a different type of PR that expands beyond the organizational-centered practice and discusses how organizations can use it to align with their goals for a fully functioning society.",Global Interventions: Public Relations Around the World,Public Relations

No research attempt has investigated the Kuwaiti practice of PR and have provided any description of it. Using excellence theory, this study applied four principles that pertain to management to the Kuwaiti practice of PR. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 PR practitioners from corporate, governmental and non-profit organizations. Generally, the Kuwaiti practice of PR displayed low levels of applicability of the excellence principles. Corporate organizations were more likely to show excellent practices of PR than the governmental and non-profit organizations. Practitioners were less involved in strategic management, were not included in the dominant coalition, did not employ the two-way symmetrical model and were less interested in joining professional associations and training workshops. Involvement in strategic management was found to be the main reason for the low levels of excellent practice as it contributed to the remaining principles.",Global Interventions: Public Relations Around the World,Public Relations

Based on in-depth interviews with 100 participants selected through stratified sampling, it asks: How do Singaporeans make sense of health information seeking in the realm of their everyday lived experiences? The study contributes to the literature on the roles familial ties play in information gathering and sharing in a collective context. More importantly, these familial ties provide perspective on the ways in which culture spatio-temporally constitutes health information seeking. Health information seeking is informed by familial role expectations in a collectivist context where filial piety and “respect for the elderly” are guiding anchors for behavior. Moreover, harmony and community well-being define societal roles and responsibilities of caregiving, directed broadly at communal care. These collective-oriented contexts therefore inform health information seeking.",Predicting and Understanding Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Evidence for these arguments were collected through survey administered among Filipino female domestic workers in Hong Kong. Results were consistent with social resources argument, that is, religiousness encourages health information seeking by broadening social ties. Interestingly for psychological resource argument, there was negative direct effect of religiousness on health information seeking. However, an indirect effect of religiousness on health information seeking through efficacy was found, suggesting a suppression effect. Overall, religiousness was found to be health protective by affording individuals with social and psychological resources critical for engaging in positive health behaviors.

2017-0713,2017,Paper Session,Faces and Charts: User and Advertiser Visualisations of Social Media Audiences,1,"Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to critically examine and contrast the representations and visualisations of the social media audience that platform providers make available to users on the one hand and advertisers on the other hand. While audiences and audience creation are critically important to media businesses and to the study of media, the visual representation of the audience within this institutional context has rarely been discussed, perhaps because it is considered to be embedded in other institutional contexts, for example in the practice of media planning. Today, however, visualisations of audiences are not limited to professional contexts. The rise of user-generated content within digital media has created a new set of producers who are also audiences and these producer/audiences also have visualisations available to them which potentially serve different functions than those targeted to institutional viewers. Further, the visualisations available today are not just static pictures, but generally have interactive qualities such as the ability to zoom, rotate, select and filter, change perspective, colour, and so on – in other words, they are visual tools for both users within traditional industrial settings and modern audience/producers. In short, as Turow & Draper suggest, the time is now ripe to investigate: “Comparisons of how non-industry user-creators construct themselves, their audiences and their contributions with the ways a firm’s executives construct themselves, their audiences and their contributions can illuminate the extent and nature of tensions coursing through new production-of-culture fields,” (Turow & Draper 2014, p. 654).

Theoretical framework/assumptions.
Audiences and audience measurement are central for the media industry. Scholars argue that audiences are socially constructed and institutionally-supported conceptualisations, rather than any particular set of people (Ang 1991, Ettema & Whitney 1994, Napoli 2012). Certainly, studies of media producers from television entertainment to journalists to blog writers have shown that it has been this “imagined audience” to which producers respond (Gitlin 1994, Brake 2012, Marwick 2011). Ang goes further and argues that measuring the audience is “a prime instance for the objectifying, othering, and controlling kind of knowledge,” (Ang 1991); and on digital media, the study of audience measurement (and indeed, of audience surveillance) is central (cf Turow 2012).
However, much of the discussion of audience-making has often boiled down to the metrics and measurement techniques, and the visual representation of the audience within this institutional context is rarely discussed. Even in recent treatments such as Napoli’s (2010), which discusses the profound transformation of metrics within digital media, important concepts such as “customer engagement,” “sentiment” or “behaviour” are left formless and shapeless, even while these concepts develop in practice as interactive visualisations. The aesthetics and form of these visualisations have practical, commercial, and political implications.
The research questions for the paper are as follows:
• What types of visualisations of people (audiences) do social media platforms make available to their advertisers? To their users?
• What are the observable visual and interactive conventions within these visualisations?
• What are the implications of these different visual and interactive conventions?

Research Methods.
The paper examines the “audience creation” and “audience insight” interfaces of major social media tools including Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Google (including Google+ and YouTube), Twitter and LinkedIn, and the corresponding audience information available from those platforms to their members (generally called something like “friends” or “my network” or “followers” or “connections”). Kennedy et al. (2016), in their recent study of the graphical conventions in information visualisation, identify elements that contribute to the authority of data visualisations, and which derive from historical and cultural traditions.
Following Kennedy, et al. (2016) the data are analysed using a social semiotic framework which combines historical and semiotic analysis. The analysis is not limited to visual conventions, but draws from human-computer interaction literature to develop the method for interactive conventions as well.

Contribution of the paper to media industries studies.
As platform media, particularly social media, continues to expand, the position of audiences is changing to incorporate a large amount of audience-creators who develop content for a small number of peers; meanwhile advertising on these platforms also may address extremely targeted audiences, and increasing amounts of data are collected and stored to be repurposed for audiencemaking. Visualisations are an increasingly prevalent and potent form through which platform media companies can interact with user-creator-advertisers. This paper adds to the literature of audience-making studies by looking at the visual and interactive modes of audience-making.

Globally, more time spent online is increasingly devoted to social networking websites. As communication technologies represent new horizons for commercial profitability, the expansion of online social media usage actually serves to widen the economic gap between network owners and users. In an ever-expanding digital environment, particularly one characterized by its numerous, socially-integrative technologies, it becomes necessary to understand the enduring nature of economic inequalities as it relates to the technological culture. For that reason, this paper takes a Marxist approach to reveal how social media use exacerbates the problems of exploitation, alienation, and monopolization that are inherent to capitalist, economic systems.",The Business of Sharing Personal Communication: Industrial Practices of Social Media,Media Industry Studies

This paper addresses a gap in the literature regarding ethnic media’s capacity—as vital community institutions—to serve information needs of these communities in the digital age. Specifically, we investigate the determinants of social media adoption by 100 ethnic media producers in New York. Despite considerable research on social media use by mainstream media, we know little about adoption trends among ethnic media. Our study is guided by the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. Relying on survey data and employing structural equation modeling, we extend this theory by considering the roles of communication about technology in the workplace, producers’ attitudes towards technology, and inter-organizational competition in social media adoption. We conclude with recommendation for the incorporation of social media into ethnic media producers’ professional practices.",The Business of Sharing Personal Communication: Industrial Practices of Social Media,Media Industry Studies

This article examines how freelancers’ career strategies, work practices, and attitudes vary depending on their institutional context. I focus on the case of online journalism in the United States and France, two countries with radically different journalistic traditions and systems of public support for freelancers. Drawing on interview data, I document counter-intuitive findings: in spite of the structural and cultural differences between the two national contexts, freelancers organize their careers in highly similar ways in New York and Paris. They engage in constant trade-offs between four concerns when making choices about their careers: passion, economic survival, exposure, and networking. Yet important differences emerge in the attitudes and repertoires used by U.S. and French freelancers to describe their lives in the market. Specifically, French freelancers are more reluctant than their American counterparts to describe themselves as rational maximizers in a competitive marketplace. The paper concludes by discussing the relevance of these findings for the study of non-standard employment in journalism and the analysis of comparative media systems.",Journalists' Labor in the New Media Environment: Conditions and Challenges,Journalism Studies

Who voices opinions in what genres? What conflicts and contexts are evoked? Who is pictured as “other”, and how are relationships to “others” imagined: ending in consensus, conflictual co-existence, or as if co-existence is impossible with alleged enemies? Theoretically we detail agonistic democracy, and deliberative and antagonistic approaches. Quantitatively we map genres, debaters, etc. Qualitatively we analyze: polarizations, key concepts, reference-points, linguistic registers. Conclusions: editorials, particularly Danish, often display one-sided stereotypical polarizing antagonistic world-views, and tendencies to abandoning previous multicultural approaches are detected in Swedish articles, while (particularly Swedish) cultural opinion articles evoke conflictual co-existence, drawing on multiple cultural/political/philosophical contexts, thereby underlining cultural journalisms’ crucial role for agonistic democracy in a globalizing world.","Global News Media Processes: Deliberation, Participation and Marketization",Global Communication and Social Change

While more academic attention has been paid to social media use, mobile APP use surely deserves a thorough examination on its role in mobilizing political participation. This study aims to fill the void by examining the relationships between mobile APP use for different purposes, online political expression and political participation among Chinese youth. An online survey of a stratified sample of 2,188 college students from fifteen universities in seven cities from three regional areas was conducted. The results yielded support to the hypotheses that mobile APP use for news positively predicts online and offline political participation, while mobile APP use for entertainment casts a reverse influence on online and offline political participation. Moreover, the effect of mobile APP use is mediated through online political expression. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.","Global News Media Processes: Deliberation, Participation and Marketization",Global Communication and Social Change

This study relies on a Bourdieusian perspective and sets out to understand the relationship between class and preferences and practices related to news. In drawing upon focus group interviews with young people in Brazil and Sweden the study shows that socialization into the world of news in the family and in school give shape to class-distinctive news orientations. The world of news is a site where social groups draw moral and cultural boundaries towards each other. Since different social groups monopolize altogether different news practices and preferences they work to legitimate social differences. As such, the findings challenges the common notions of the global digital citizen, and that news media provide spaces for the practice of civility and citizenship.","Global News Media Processes: Deliberation, Participation and Marketization",Global Communication and Social Change
2017-0724,2017,Paper Session,“Stir-Frying” Internet Finance: Financialization and the Institutional Role of Business News in China,1,"This paper studies the institutional role of Chinese business news in the deepening financialization in China. It analyzes the 300 most viewed articles on Sina Finance to examine how the mainstream business news choose topics, themes, and styles in reporting “Internet finance”, a business category initiated by the Chinese state to energize the finance sector and offset the economic slowdown. A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses shows that the major Chinese media outlets aggressively promoted the technological advantages of Internet finance and its profit potential over the risks, uncertainties and regulatory constraints inherent in it. Drawing upon institutional theory in media studies, this paper argues that the mainstream business news in this context functions as a political, economic, and cultural-cognitive institution supporting the informatization and marketization of the finance sector in China. Such an institutional role is both a corollary and propeller of the increasingly financialized economy in China and its ramifications in various non-financial domains.","Global News Media Processes: Deliberation, Participation and Marketization",Global Communication and Social Change

Data from 93 older American couples and 95 older German couples were collected and analyzed. Americans reported higher morale, less negative affectivity, and higher reports of general health outcomes compared to Germans. There were no significant differences in Americans’ and Germans’ reports of collaboration and marital satisfaction. Dyadic analyses were conducted using Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Models and Structural Equation Modeling. The emotional state (i.e., morale and negative affectivity) of wives (for both Americans and Germans) played an integral role in perceptions of collaboration and marital satisfaction in their husbands. Specifically, morale played a larger role for American couples and negative affectivity for German couples. Perceived collaboration helped explain the relationships between emotional state, health outcomes, and marital satisfaction for both American and German couples. These findings emphasize the importance of boosting morale and collaboration in older romantic relationships.",Interpersonal Communication in Health Contexts,Interpersonal Communication

However, factors demonstrated in the ecological model were bounded in the context of medical care between physicians and patients. Social factors, such as patients’ relationships and supportive communication with others outside the context of health care remain relatively unexplored. Recognizing this gap, this research integrated social support literature into the research on patient participation in health care, and proposed a model which describes a process through which social support can enhance patients’ health care participation. The data analyzed in this study were a part of two larger clinical trials in which 661 women with breast cancer were recruited from three cancer institutions in the United States. The results from structural equation modeling analysis provided strong evidence for the hypotheses predicting that perceived social support was positively associated with health information competence and emotional management competence, which in turn fully mediated the association between social support and patient participation in health care.

Many studies across several different disciplines have investigated connections among various communication behaviors (e.g., disclosure and support), coping strategies (e.g., humor and denial), and psychological adjustment (e.g., depression and anxiety). However, there has not yet been a systematic review of this body of work until now. The comprehensive, integrative review presented in this manuscript provides a description of the studies in this domain, and offers a summary of how communication and coping tend to be (a) conceptually and operationally defined and (b) theoretically linked in terms of causality.

Experts on MUS suggest beneficial health effects of positive communication but it remains unclear what it entails; empirical evidence supporting a relationship between communication and medical outcomes is scarce and poorly operationalised. The current study aims to systematically disentangle GP message content from form during MUS and MES (medically explained symptoms) consultations. Coders identified and categorised content and formulations of GPs’ expressions (N = 2590, 21% double-coded) of 82 consultations (18 GPs). Anxiety was measured with an abbreviated State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).

2017-0729,2017,Paper Session,"""I'm Scared of the Disappointment"": Young Adult Smokers' Relational Identity Gaps as Sites of Intervention",2,"This study uncovered identity gaps arising in young adult smokers' relationships, the strategies they enact to manage those gaps, and contexts in which their relational identity aligns. Communication theory of identity (Hecht, 1993) explains the process of enacting and shaping identities through communication. Identities consist of four interpenetrating layers: enacted, personal, relational, and communal. When there is a discrepancy between layers an identity gap occurs. Identity gaps present opportunities for targeted interventions that amplify dissonance as a motivational tactic. I conducted focus groups and interviews focusing on the daily experiences of 20 young adult smokers. Relational identity gaps included a personal-relational gap, enacted-relational gap, and personal-enacted-relational gap. Strategies to manage identity gaps in relationships included lying about smoking, hiding the behavior of smoking, and gauging others' reactions prior to disclosing. Friendships were a relationship in which layers of identity often aligned. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are offered.",Interpersonal Communication in Health Contexts,Interpersonal Communication
2017-0730,2017,Paper Session,A Touch of the Virtual: A Path Analysis of the Effects of Immersive Features on the Formation Process of Spatial Presence Experiences,1,"RESEARCH PAPER------This study examines the effects of two immersive features, quality of visual immersion and controller naturalness, on the formation process of spatial presence experiences. The concept of spatial presence is conceptualized as a two-step process, including the construction of a mental model of the mediated environment and the emergence of spatial presence. To test the proposed model, this study used a 2 (visual immersion: two-dimensional display vs. virtual reality head-mounted display) x 2 (controller naturalness: traditional gamepad vs. naturally mapped controller) between-subjects design. In total, 103 participants were randomly assigned to play a racing game in one of the four conditions. The results showed that both immersive features (visual immersion and controller naturalness) were positive predictors in the formation process of spatial presence experiences. Furthermore, perceived controller naturalness had an influence on the construction of the mental representation of the mediated environment (spatial situational model). The quality of perceived visual immersion had an impact on participants’ sense of being in the mediated environment (self-location) and their possibility to act (possible action). The findings are discussed in light of both theoretical contributions of the formation process of spatial presence experiences and practical implications for future game design.",My Other Self: Presence and Identity in Games,Game Studies
2017-0731,2017,Paper Session,"Controls and Enjoyment in Video Games: Moving Forward, Without Motion?",5,"In recent years, studies have investigated how different technological factors and game play settings influence the experiences that people have with video games. This study utilized a 2 x 2 between-subjects design in order to investigate how variations in video game control mechanisms (traditional/advanced) and difficulty (easy/hard) influence psychological responses to playing such as natural mapping, flow, interactivity, presence, and enjoyment. Results indicated that although the advanced, motion-based wheel controller was rated as more naturally mapped than the traditional controller, it did not have uniformly positive effects on the game playing experience as often reported in previous research. In some instances, the traditional controller was actually rated more favorably than the advanced controller. Furthermore, the effects of game difficulty and the combined effect of the manipulations on many of the dependent variables of interest ran counter to what was expected. The somewhat unexpected findings are discussed and contextualized in light of previous research on this topic.",My Other Self: Presence and Identity in Games,Game Studies

Findings have been mixed, depending on controller type and associated actions within games. In this study we look at hypothesized outcomes, from the perspective of conceptual models and mental models, in performance and frustration while playing a driving simulation using two controllers that are based on different conceptual models and have been available for differing amounts of time. Recognizing that conceptual models exogenous as a part of the device design and mental models operate endogenously to access design features, it was found that on the basis of conceptual models there was no substantial difference in frustration while performance was better with the older, less-natural, standard-controller. Findings supported the importance of mental models that have developed over time through gaming experience. Performance and frustration have relationships in this data demonstrating the role and development of mental models. Conceptual models need to be understood in terms of mental models in the study of the effects of video game play and it is suggested that frustration may have a stronger connection to expectation than other technological factors in game play.

Also, the current study expands the concept of‘interactivity’beyond the manipulation of virtual items, space, or avatars. Drawing from Green & Jenkins’s (2014) theoretical model, this study empirically tested using video game narrative, the Walking Dead. The findings of this study demonstrated empirical support for Green & Jenkins (2014) conceptual model of interactive narrative and transportation.

2017-0735,2017,Paper Session,Attempts at Online Dialogue Between Extreme Right and Left: Meeting in de Middle?,2,"Debates online have often been feared. Early research showed dangerous adoption by extremist groups as early adopters of the internet (Hamm, 1993)⁠. These groups have remained active and extremist content seems prolific (Gerstenfeld, Grant, & Chiang, 2003)⁠ . The internet may serve these groups because it supports 'echo-chambers', the ability to avoid dissimilar opinions and find attitude-consistent information and social contact. This mechanism has been explicitly linked to extremist networks (Neumann, 2013; Ramakrishna, 2016; Saddiq, 2010; Sunstein, 2007)⁠ But it also presupposes that people in these groups actively seek filtered content and avoid cross-cutting discussions. As O'hara and Stevens (2015) argue: research supports that if people filter information then they will harden their attitudes, whereas others show most political exposure is on non-political oriented groups (Wojcieszak & Mutz, 2009)⁠. Extremist groups on Facebook, such as the anti-immigration and pro-immigration groups, are likely to become echo-chambers due to the self-selective nature of their membership. But what if these groups try to reach out to their opposites?
Our central concern is about which users engage and shape intergroup communication in the Finnish immigration online debate? To answer this question, we look at the structural embedding of users and content to see which users and what content cross political boundaries.",Intergroup Processes in Mass Media and Mediated Contexts,Intergroup Communication

And if so, which are the variables that make this possible? Carr, Varney and Blesse (2016) have recently suggested that intergroup contact within social media is understudied making it difficult to determine whether it can result to groups forming connections, thus reducing intergroup stereotypes, or to groups getting isolated, thus enhancing intergroup prejudice and stereotypes. It is then necessary to examine variables related to the specific communication context that affects the relationship between contact and attitudes. The present study focuses on the mediated communication German and Greek participants had on a relative hashtag (#) in Twitter concerning the economic crisis. The findings suggest that social media provide an arena where intergroup mediated contact can substantially affect attitudes.

2017-0740,2017,Paper Session,Ethical Considerations towards Online Audiovisual Sexual Risks within European Parliamentary Debates,1,"Introduction. Internet policy towards online audiovisual risks for children, especially pornography, has been determined by the defense of freedom of expression, enshrined in the first amendment of the American Constitution (Castells, 2001). Nevertheless, European media systems have been influenced by a variety of historical and cultural backgrounds, paying attention towards ethical concerns related to risky audiovisual contents (Frau-Meigs, 2011). Aims. The piece ofresearch aims to retrieve ethical considerations within the social representations of audiovisual sexual risks. The hypothesis is that polemical representations of audiovisual sexual risks are related to ethical concerns, by making reference to different ideological and cultural groups in Europe (van Dijk, 1998). Methods. By analyzing the European parliamentary debates on Internet policy concerning children protection, the research first retrieves references to ethical considerations within the speeches, then analyzes them through the Alceste method (Iramuteq), and finally carries on a content analysis (AtlasTi). Results. Debates on audiovisual policy and regulation focus on finding a balance between public service and market-oriented media system. Amongst audiovisual risks, child pornography evokes more ethical reflections. The principle of freedom of expression is either opposed to the possibility of media censorship or the need of children protection. Polemical representations are due to different historical and cultural backgrounds, regulatory and policy frameworks.

The case of the licensing saga of Hong Kong TV was chosen to illustrate how ridiculous the situation was when an innovative operator was barred from market entry simply for not patriotic enough. No matter how strong the public outcry, the government simply ignored it.

This new paradigm drives market-oriented television sector from the realm of economic development into the political arena which emphasizes on political correctness and national interest. The development of Hong Kong broadcasting landscape could no longer rely on the Western public choice rationale. The regulatory regime of Hong Kong broadcasting sector has silently harmonized with other Asian counterparts where political forces and government bureaucracies become priorities and public interests has to give way to national interests.",Policy Intervention Attempts: Studies in Failure and Potential,Communication Law & Policy

Freedom of speech is essential for the functioning of Western democracies. However, the freedom in Western democracies entails also the risk of negative influences from outside, especially from authoritarian states, which have the interest to export their rigid regime on freedom of speech to other countries and attempt to influence public discourse about autocratic leaders or countries. In principle, several levels of possible interventions of authoritarian states in Western democracies can be identified as our examples show. Against this background the discussion concerns of whether the existence of a criminal provision for insulting foreign states is a legitimate restriction of freedom of speech or whether it simply is a tool unnecessarily given to foreign states to influence public discourse in a Western democracy.",Policy Intervention Attempts: Studies in Failure and Potential,Communication Law & Policy

It was a striking—if brief—intervention. In Tennessee v.

This submission examines the FCC’s failed intervention in municipal broadband. It considers three related areas of inquiry: (1) It considers the significance of the FCC’s preemption order; (2) It examines the importance and impact of the Court’s ruling to the FCC’s larger ongoing broadband efforts; and (3) It suggests potential legal and technical interventions that, in the wake the Court’s ruling, might salvage the original intent of the FCC’s intervention in municipal broadband markets.",Policy Intervention Attempts: Studies in Failure and Potential,Communication Law & Policy

An Archaeological Intervention Into the History of Romanian Television,1,"Starting from the premise that material artifacts contain ‘tensions, contradictions and exclusions’ (Buchli & Gavin, 2001) that remain invisible to the ‘written cultures’ (de Certeau, 1984) of institutionalized histories, this paper approaches the building of Romanian television (TVR) as a material artifact that gives insights into ‘hidden’ histories of Romanian television during the Cold War. It aims to study negotiations of power that TVR carried out with the communist regime and the West, which fell outside the realm of institutionalized histories. The paper illustrates how the Romanian Television Centre - modeled after BBC’s Television Centre – aspired to Western standards of performance and negotiated ‘undesired’ relations with the West, while accommodating through its design the regime’s visions of television. The paper draws upon ‘unarchived’ written documents, the architectural plan and photographs of the building, interviews with TVR employees and documents from the BBC Written Archives and the Romanian Securitate Archives.","The Voices, Sounds, and Ideologies of Broadcast Cultures",Communication History

The principle was a staple of telegraph regulation and a direct attack on the Marconi Company’s non-intercommunication policy, but it would not have been accepted without an agreement from Britain. Why would British policymakers agree to such a provision? To what extent, if any, did the non-intercommunication policy serve British security objectives? What role, if any, did the spectrum play in these early discussions and how did arguments about the spectrum link up to the Marconi Company’s hopes for a world monopoly? Without understanding the development of British policy for the 1903 conference, we are unable to follow the intermixing of regulatory objectives familiar from telegraph regulation and new ones tailored to spectrum allocation that would characterize the 1906 convention. The mixture of regulatory objectives, in turn, would be central to explaining why Britain eventually gave way to its geopolitical rivals in radio policy instead of attempting to enhance its hegemony over the submarine cable with a similar hegemony over radio.","The Voices, Sounds, and Ideologies of Broadcast Cultures",Communication History
2017-0747,2017,Paper Session,Producing Milton Friedman’s Free to Choose: How Libertarian Ideology and Corporate Money Became Broadcasting “Balance”,1,"In February 1980, PBS stations across the Unites States broadcast “Free to Choose,” a ten-part television series featuring economist Milton Friedman. The series helped to cement Friedman’s status as the most influential economist of the postwar twentieth century. This article recounts and analyzes series producer Robert Chitester’s role in creating, funding and promoting the series. It argues that Chitester’s success was the result of media and economic imaginaries that exploited zones of ambiguity in both broadcast policy and PBS’s internal rules. The tension between advocacy and education was endemic to corporate-funded “economic education” efforts in the mid/late twentieth century. Yet, as this article shows, Chitester’s media and economic imaginaries helped him draw an equivalency between advocacy and education. These imaginaries informed the rhetorics and strategies Chitester and his sponsors employed to navigate regulatory gray areas without running afoul of PBS, the FCC, or the U.S. Department of Revenue.","The Voices, Sounds, and Ideologies of Broadcast Cultures",Communication History

We hypothesize that this occurred because of the new communication technology – wireless telegraphy – that impacted on apparently unrelated fields: the notion of national borders and freedom of the air; time signals; meteorology and seismology; and aviation.
The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it aims to reconstruct how “the air” was reevaluated at the beginning of the 20th century as well as how wireless and other fields related to it and, secondly, two apparently unrelated traditions in communication and media studies (mediatization and transnational approach) will be combined, expanding and engaging both approaches to understand how the air changed its status at an international level due to communicative and non-communicative reasons.","The Voices, Sounds, and Ideologies of Broadcast Cultures",Communication History

What communication historians have missed, however, is the substantive contributions of daily French-language services launched from the United States by private broadcasters in 1937 that continued under the U.S. government in 1942, and resulting bond that developed between French listeners and U.S. broadcasters over the course of the Occupation when such international listening was against the law. The communication was bi-directional, as news and letters smuggled out of France during the Occupation found their way onto U.S. radio, which informed and stirred defiant sentiments among listeners trapped inside France. Using freshly discovered sources and repurposing others, this paper offers original research and a theoretical argument to expand our understanding of how occupied France listened to American radio during World War II and how this practice emboldened French resistance to the Occupation.","The Voices, Sounds, and Ideologies of Broadcast Cultures",Communication History

Two experiments had participants selectively self-present themselves as either a loyal brand advocate or not, and receive feedback from either an automated program (Study 1) or another user via a chat forum (Study 2). Findings reveal smaller effects of selective self-presentation, moderate effects of feedback, and large interaction effects between them so that one’s self-presentation can ameliorate or enhance—but not override—the effects of feedback to one’s self-presentation. Findings extend identity shift research beyond extraversion/introversion to include brand attitudes and buyer behaviors, and account for the various valences of feedback related to one’s self-presentation.",Identity and Visibility Online,Communication and Technology

It has not been clarified yet, however, how exactly MD influences the enjoyment process (i.e., as trait or state variable) One reason for that might be the lack of a media-related MD scale. Thus, we conducted several studies: First, we developed and validated a scale to measure media-related MD as both trait and state variable. Subsequently, we applied the scales to two different morally complex narratives. For the presentation we will discuss MD and its relevance for the entertainment process of morally complex narratives. We will also dwell on the challenges of constructing a trait and state MD scale and on possible further research in terms of scale refinement and experimental designs.",Emotion and Media Engagement,Mass Communication

A restorative narrative should contain an authentic account of human suffering on an individual or communal level, and an emphasis on strength, progression, and/or recovery following or in the midst of hardship. Restorative narratives may counteract the harmful effects of traditional problem-focused news by (a) reducing the need for emotion regulation in the face of negative news, (b) evoking a state of moral elevation, and (c) affecting readers through emotional flow and transportation. Results of a study comparing a restorative, non-restorative, and no-ending version of a story suggested that viewing a news report in the form of a restorative narrative elicited more positive emotions and less negative emotions, higher moral elevation, and an increased likelihood to volunteer for disaster relief organizations as compared to more traditional problem-focused news reports.",Emotion and Media Engagement,Mass Communication

Research has established that individuals’ anger responses to identity-threatening information can affect their subsequent news selections; however, the effect of anger expression on subsequent information seeking behavior has not been investigated.
Based on Lazarus’ (1991) cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, this study examined the influence of anger stimulated by perceived news bias on news selections, as well as the role of anger expression, including both anger-in and anger-out expression. An experiment with a 2 (Novel v. Familiar issues) X 2 (Threatening vs. Non-threatening/control story) design explored moderating effects of anger expression on news selections.

In line with the concept of emotional flow, structural equation modeling revealed an interaction effect of sadness and happiness assessed at different points of measurement, such that the effect of sadness on reflectiveness and behavioral intentions was smaller, and was compensated by a stronger effect of happiness in the emotional flow condition combining a sad message with an uplifting end.",Emotion and Media Engagement,Mass Communication

Smoking prevalence is generally low in the country, although increasing notably among young people. Smoking has long been limited to urbanites and is considered as an “imported habit” in most regions of the country. Unlike in other African countries, the influence of foreign (Western) movies might be low due mainly to linguistic reasons. However, to the extent viewership to these locally produced movies using the local language increases, people are likely to be introduced to smoking that is often portrayed as a socially acceptable behavior with no negative health consequences.",Health Media Content and Effects (High-Density),Health Communication

Utilizing a between-subjects experiment with manipulating factors of two types of plastic surgery advertisement, the research found that college students were influenced by perception of their peers’ attitude towards plastic surgery rather than directly influenced by exposure to advertisement. This finding shows that presumed influence is a universe phenomenon, not only occurring in idealized body images portrayed in fashion magazines, young adults’ smoking behavior, health campaign strategies, but also existing in advertisement effect. It is also interesting to see that, although in different contexts, presumed influence is contingent on several factors, including perceivers’ self-body satisfaction and perceivers’ ethnicity.",Health Media Content and Effects (High-Density),Health Communication

The Role of Media Consumption in Parents’ Decision on Children’s Vaccination",1,"This study investigates the impact of both conservative and liberal media consumption on parents’ decision on child’s vaccination. Data for this study was collected from the Multimedia Audience Research Systems (MARS) data sets. The final sample size for the study was 3,526 who are parents. Interestingly, consumption of liberal media, which are consisted by ABC, CBS, CNN, and MSNBC are significantly associated with benefit perception of child’s vaccination. On the other hand, conservative media consumption, which are consisted by FOX, FOX News, and FOX Sports are not associated with vaccination perception. This study shows that the consumption of media that can be defined as conservative and liberal media should be considered as an important variable to explain parents’ perception on child’s vaccination. These findings provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of child’s vaccination decision, suggesting policy making for contributing to the higher vaccination.",Health Media Content and Effects (High-Density),Health Communication

Social comparison theory shows women are more likely to evaluate their body positively when they feel similar to a model, but we know little about comparison effects from plus-size models.The experiment surveyed 213 female students at a Southeastern university. Participants were randomly assigned to watch a 10-minute online New York Fashion Show with either thin or plus-size models. Participants’ mood and body dissatisfaction were measured pre- and post-viewing along with comparison tendency and demographics (post only). Results showed more negative mood and body dissatisfaction from thin model viewing and positive mood and less dissatisfaction from plus-size models. The implication is that mood can be positively affected in the short term by viewing plus-size models while negatively impacted by viewing thin models",Health Media Content and Effects (High-Density),Health Communication

Specifically, the appetitive motivational activation leads to improvement in peripheral detail encoding (memory broadening) while the aversive motivation activation impairs peripheral detail encoding leading to memory narrowing. To date, these results have only been tested within single visual events. In this study memory for advertisements shown around the edge of the computer screen during positive and negative movie clips which varied in their arousal level was tested. Consistent with the theoretical expectations arousing positive movies aided encoding of the ads at high levels of complexity (demonstrating memory broadening effect) but negative movies hurt encoding of those (demonstrating memory narrowing effect).",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

The Motivation Activation Measure (MAM) was employed to test how reactivity in appetitive system activation (ASA) and defensive system activation (DSA) scores are related to media preferences. Results indicate individuals with higher ASA reactivity scores self-reported greater preference to consume media perceived to be more novel, arousing, competitive, and unpredictable—and less preference to consume media perceived as tame and predictable. Individuals high DSA reactivity scores reported opposite preference patterns. These findings are consistent with, and serve as a replication of Potter, Lee, & Rubenking (2011). However, it goes beyond replication by adding information regarding digital and social media use preferences.

The circumstances in which one will have to find food alter the perceived amount of energy expenditure for finding food. This study examined how dark environmental contexts, which afford difficulty in food foraging, influenced the processing of food advertisements that presented greater and lesser energy potential. Thirty-eight young adults viewed food ads that varied in energy density level in either light or dark circumstances. Dynamic psychophysiological responses (OO, SCL) were obtained. In general, results support an optimal foraging perspective: individuals exhibited greater motivational intensity and preference when exposed to ads for more energy dense foods, but this preference dissipated when circumstances were dark.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

This study tests the regulatory focus and fit theory against short messages and food choice behavior in a lab setting. With deeper understanding of the effect that matched and mis-matched messages can have on short-term choice behavior related to food, more effective interventions can be created to help steer behavioral maintenance for people in their daily lives.

The results showed that when users are motivated to read the news, the regulatory fit headline increased time spent on the article, information elaboration, and likelihood to seek additional information. However, when users have low motivations, regulatory non-fit evoked uncertainty and increased time spent in the article, elaboration, and information-seeking intentions.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

We also measured individual differences in appetitive versus defensive motivations to switch. Those people high on both motivations (Coactives) had the most switches per session. Risk Takers had the shortest content segment lengths, while Risk Avoiders and Inactives were lower on the number of switches and anticipated arousal. Different patterns of content selection, in addition to switching behavior, were also observed for the different motivation activation groups.

This study (N=233) employs the Heuristic-Systematic Model and Cognitive Mediation Model to understand how layered source cues are processed by news readers, especially when these cues are in conflict. A 2x2x2 factorial experiment tested the effects of reading a news story (high or low involvement) posted on Facebook by a friend (close or distant) from a news media organization (trusted or untrusted) on perceptions of credibility and learning outcomes. Results indicate that while trusted media sources affect credibility perceptions directly, the type of friend who posted the story has an effect moderated by media source and involvement.

This integrative approach is illustrated by a study on the routines and practices of news consumption within and around social networking services. We will demonstrate how the mapping exercise can complement other qualitative methods to explore the structure, meaning and processes of cross-media user practices and discuss the scope and limits for visualizing and analysing the interrelatedness between social networking services and traditional mass media.

Academic literature and journalism about the push to war tend to treat two justifications as the pillars of the administration’s case: Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program and links to terrorism groups. Based on a content analysis of all the speeches and statements by the President and key officials in the year before and after the 2003 invasion, this study suggests these justifications were not as commonly raised compared with other justifications, such as internationalism, human rights and freedom, presenting something of a puzzle. By revealing the range of justifications given by the administration, we can also see how the frames shifted over the two-year timeline covering the war’s build-up, invasion, and initial year of occupation, and assess differences in framing between Bush administration officials.",Anayzing Rhetoric: From George Bush to the Muslim Brotherhood,Political Communication

Among other findings, analysis shows that the Egyptian MB’s worldview, as manifest in Ikhwanweb, features four key elements: (a) distrust towards the Egyptian regime and certain Western powers; (b) the need to be valued by Western powers; (c) caution in its cyber communication; and (d) tension/flux resulting from the Egyptian MB’s endeavor to transition into an organization that has contextualized democratic ideals in an Islamic idiom.",Anayzing Rhetoric: From George Bush to the Muslim Brotherhood,Political Communication
2017-0785,2017,Paper Session,Journalist-Source Relations and the Deliberative System: A Network Performance Approach to Investigating Journalism’s Contribution to Facilitating Public Deliberation in a Globalized World,4,"Journalist – source relationships and interactions are interpreted in this study as crucial mechanisms for linking different arenas in a deliberative system. In transnational deliberation on global issues such as climate change journalists bridge, through their source networks, government, civil society, expert and other discourses as well as different national arenas with diverging interests. To unravel these source networks, 106 semi-standardized interviews with journalists as well as PR professionals from government delegations and NGOs were conducted on-site the United Nations climate change conferences in Cancun, Mexico (2010), Doha, Qatar (2012) and Warsaw, Poland (2013), and an online survey was administered during the conference in Paris, France (2015). The analysis shows that most journalists maintain close relationships with their home country delegation. However, journalists experienced in climate conference coverage also maintain more direct and informal relations to delegations from other countries and to NGOs while less experienced journalists exhibit loose and more formally mediated relationship to these actors. Moreover, journalists focusing on commentary rather than on event-related reporting have the most variegated and informal networks, thus opening the deliberative system to diverse perspectives and unknown voices more than others. Government delegations vary strongly in their tendency to approach journalists and proactively manage their global image. Environmental NGOs interact with journalists primarily to attract media attention in order to indirectly influence decision makers in national delegations. Overall, the paper demonstrates how consequential the density and form of source networks are for journalism’s contribution to facilitating public deliberation in a globalized world.",How to Enter the Dance: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Source Relations,Journalism Studies

Findings show that when the source is male, it is he who takes the lead; when the source is female, it is the reporter. In an attempt to explain the roots of this phenomenon, two theoretical explanations are examined – the endogenic explanation, which attributes the weakness of women as sources to the patriarchal values that exist within the field of journalism. The second is the exogenic explanation, according to which the exclusion of women as sources stems from their limited presence in centers of power outside journalism. The findings support the exogenic explanation, and reveal how under a supposedly gender-blind cloak of ""the journalistic value of the source"" a clear gender structure has nevertheless developed.",How to Enter the Dance: New Perspectives Upon Journalist-Source Relations,Journalism Studies

A content analysis of two newspapers, The New York Times and An-Nahar, examined how prevalently newspapers cited Twitter and Facebook as a source and found that only a small number of newspaper articles relied on social media for information. The Times stories were more likely to be thematic and use Twitter or Facebook as only one of many sources, suggesting U.S. legacy media reference social media to add a new dimension and provide context to stories. In contrast, the Lebanese paper relied more heavily on social media and produced more episodic coverage.

Some studies have examined the impact of visual cues (e.g., facial expressions), while one study has examined the impact of vocal cues (voice pitch). Findings from social psychology indicate that visual cues may be more dominant than vocal cues in affecting the perception of a speaker. Two studies therefore explored the relative importance of visual and vocal cues of spokespersons in crisis communication. Each study examined the effects of deceptive visual cues, while one study focused on their interaction with speech disturbances and another on their interaction with voice pitch. The results show that the impact of visual cues dominates the effects of vocal cues. In study one, visual cues affected consumers’ attitudes towards the organization and study two illustrates that visual cues also affect purchase intentions. In both studies, the impact of vocal cues depended on visual cues.",Interventions and Connections: Organizational Communication and Public Relations,Public Relations

During a 4-week web-based intervention, 113 college students self-tracked their FVC either individually or in online groups characterized by a 2 (demographic similarity: demographically similar vs. demographically diverse) × 2 (social modeling: incremental-change vs. ideal-change) experimental design. Each online group consisted of one focal participant and three confederates as group members whose demographics and FVC were manipulated to create the four treatment groups. The results showed that individuals who self-tracked in an online group consumed more fruits and vegetables than individuals who self-tracked alone. Within the online-group conditions, neither demographic similarity nor social modeling had a significant main effect on FVC. However, performance discrepancy between the focal participant and other group members had a significant effect on the focal participant’s FVC, controlling for the baseline FVC and other variables. A mediation test further revealed that a participant’s low performance discrepancy from other group members would lead to downward contrast, which in turn, increased the participant’s FVC over time. Implications to design effective online groups for promoting FVC were discussed.","Digital Technology for Health: Self-Tracking, Social Media, and Virtual Games",Health Communication

Recreational Athletes’ Running Motivations as Predictors of Their Use of Online Fitness Community Features,2,"Fitness wearables and apps provide users with quantified information about their physical activity patterns. Usually, users access the information on Online Fitness Communities (OFCs) such as Runkeeper, that provide feedback on the user’s performance, and offer additional social networking and gamification features. This study addressed to what extent the different features present in OFCs answer to users’ motivations to physically exercise, by examining (1) whether there are differences in motivations for running between OFC users and non-users, and (2) whether the use of particular features (e.g., self-regulatory features) is driven by particular running motivations (e.g., weight loss). To that end, a survey study was conducted among 717 runners, of which 57% used an OFC to support running activities. Results show that OFC users are more achievement- and competition-oriented than non-OFC users, and are more in search of recognition for their achievements. As expected, different running motivations predicted the use of different features. These findings are valuable to developers, health practitioners, and individual athletes, as they give insight into how OFCs can be optimally designed and implemented to support users in sustaining their motivation for running.","Digital Technology for Health: Self-Tracking, Social Media, and Virtual Games",Health Communication
2017-0797,2017,Paper Session,Body Dissatisfaction and Neuroticism as Determinants of Calorie-Tracking App Use Amongst Young Adults,2,"The purpose of the current study is to investigate the influence of body dissatisfaction and neuroticism as potential predictors of calorie-tracking app usage amongst young adults, utilizing objectification theory as guiding framework. Participants (N = 491) completed an online survey asking about their body dissatisfaction, neuroticism, and use of apps that track calories. Analyses revealed that female sex and body dissatisfaction—but not neuroticism—were direct predictors of calorie-tracking app usage. Analyses also provided support for a causal sequence wherein neuroticism and body dissatisfaction mediate, in serial, the relationship between female sex and calorie-tracking app usage. These results help further our theoretical understanding of calorie-tracking app usage as well as suggest that more research is needed regarding the influence of new media technology on health risks stemming from psychological consequences of self-objectification.","Digital Technology for Health: Self-Tracking, Social Media, and Virtual Games",Health Communication
2017-0798,2017,Paper Session,The Influence of Health-Related Psychographic Factors and Social Media Activity on Exercise Maintenance and Well-Being,2,"Habitual exercising is an important precursor to positive well-being. There is, thus, a strong interest in identifying key factors that can best motivate individuals to sustain regular exercise regimen. Social media use may act as an external motivator by allowing users to inquire and communicate about exercise. In this study, we examine the influence of psychographic factors such as health consciousness, health-oriented beliefs, intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation such as social media activity, on exercise maintenance and consequently well-being. 543 participants were recruited from a university in the Northeast U.S. who completed quantitative assessments. Employing structural equation modeling, we found that the strongest predictor of exercise maintenance was intrinsic motivation. Social media activity had a positive effect on exercise maintenance but surprisingly negative effects on psychological and physical well-being. This study provides suggestions for the design and implementation of exercise-promoting interventions by identifying underlying factors that can influence exercise maintenance.","Digital Technology for Health: Self-Tracking, Social Media, and Virtual Games",Health Communication
2017-0799,2017,Paper Session,The Best Way to Predict the Future is to Create It,5,"Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at increased risk for HIV. With interventions insufficiently efficacious, researchers are exploring theoretical mediators (e.g., does change in self-efficacy actually change behavior?). Neuroscience approaches suggest additional mediators such as enhancing YMSM’s consideration of future consequences (CFC). A virtual game intervention, SOLVE (Socially Optimized Learning in Virtual Environments), explored the possibility that change in self-efficacy and CFC would mediate sexually risky behavior change. Data analyzed were from 579 HIV-negative, self-identified MSMs, aged from 18 to 24, who had condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in the past 90 days, randomly assigned to SOLVE or the wait-listed control, who returned at 6-months. Using regression, we found CFC and self-efficacy mediated the link between condition and reduction in risky sex over 6 months. Within the game condition, the involvement to risk reduction link was similarly mediated by self-efficacy and CFC. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Digital Technology for Health: Self-Tracking, Social Media, and Virtual Games",Health Communication

Evidence From 22 Societies,4,"As digital technologies disrupt the news industry around the globe, are normative expectations of “good journalism” still important? This study posits that people’s ideas about of how well journalists meet normative expectations of press performance influences their news consumption. In turn, news provides a resource for civic participation, and promotes pro-social values of charity, volunteering, and group problem solving. Though previous research suggests this so-called “virtuous circle” operates in countries with a history of press freedom, what are the consequences of attitudes toward press performance in other contexts? Drawing on survey data from 22 countries, the study sheds light on these empirical quandaries. Overall, public evaluations of press performance predict news use. News consumption is also tightly associated with civic participation. Citizens’ evaluation of journalists also arises as a positive moderator on these relationships. This study builds on international comparative work related to how public attitudes toward the media influence democratic outcomes.",Engaging the Public?

Central to this study is understanding how an audience makes use of domestication strategies in viewing and reacting to mediated distant suffering. Earlier text–based research has found several ways of domesticating distant suffering that can invite an audience to care (Author, 2015). Building further on this media–centered study, ten focus groups reveal a two–flow model of domestication, consisting of first–level domestication on the production side by journalists, and second–level domestication where the audience themselves uses strategies of domestication to make sense of distant suffering.",Engaging the Public?

Changes to the hippocampus that result in enhanced second language learning can also occur in reward processing during video gameplay. In this study we try the changes seen in language learning, which facilitate declarative memory, by exposing some participants to video games with rewards and others to video games without rewards. We also vary spatial navigation conditions to determine its effects on memory, and record participants’ weekly gaming habits to indicate long-term effects of games. Participants played in one of four gaming conditions (rewards-present or –absent, and spatial navigation-present or –absent) for 40 minutes, and then took part in a series of memory tasks. Data analysis reveals that game conditions have significant effects. Those in rewards-present conditions demonstrate better declarative memory performance than those in rewards-absent conditions.

This study compares how people from Hong Kong and Shanghai perceive Beijing. While these cities differ in their geographical locations, traditions, and political systems, they are similar in their urban functions, such as their industries, manufactures, and major economic sectors. These similarities together formed similar cultures in these two cities. In addition, because of analogous news coverage, people in these two cities perceive Beijing from the same perspective and feel depressed when they are in Beijing. They ignore the modern side of Beijing and have similar criteria for a global city. Since we need to contrast “ourselves” against “others,” the identity as citizens in a specific city also includes shared perceptions of other cities.

As the continuing narrative of legal interactions between the nations of the United States and China on issues of intellectual property demonstrate, cultural norms have a strong impact on the implementation and, ultimately, enforcement of ordinances related to intellectual property.
Ultimately, this paper argues that copyright, a statutory privilege and dimension of legal norms, is secondary to the moral imperatives defined by cultural and social norms as the primary incentive and motivating factor in the creation of original works. This is shown through a methodology which includes textual analysis of the existing literature and a synthesis of techniques for intercultural conflict resolution.",Culture in the Political Contexts,Intercultural Communication

I then consider the possibilities of a cultural materialist approach in CICS that more firmly integrates these structured and (re)structuring aspects of cultural practices. To illustrate, I discuss current space struggles in the socio-political Spanish context.

2017-0818,2017,Paper Session,Defensive Semiotic Strategies in Government: A Multimodal Study of Blame Avoidance,1,"In this paper, I argue that when officeholders try to avoid blame, they often engage in defensive performances which can be analysed in terms of how they exploit various multimodal semiotic resources to ward off (potential) criticism: the setting, appearance, and manner chosen for a particular interaction with an audience; and both verbal and non-verbal ways of arguing, legitimising, framing, and representing social actors and actions. I apply these analytic categories to interpret the data gathered during fieldwork at a major training event of British government communicators.
By combining insights from multimodal discourse analysis, discourse-historical studies of organisational behaviour, and recent research into blame avoidance in public administration, I demonstrate how certain semiotic strategies used by officeholders have an effect of backgrounding the ideas about any possible norm violations, such as lying and spin doctoring, that government communicators may have been associated with in the eyes of critical audiences.","Political Discourse: Praising, Blaming, Responding, and Categorizing",Language & Social Interaction

Although responses to high-profile situations such as these are common, very rarely have Presidents’ statements in these scenarios been longitudinally analyzed. Applying the Rhetoric of Social Intervention, the present study seeks to identify any potential thematic evolution of rhetoric within President Obama’s responses to these high-profile gun violence incidents. The analysis of these speeches used a mixed methods approach that employed constant comparative analysis and quantitative lexical analysis, and indicated an evolution from themes of honoring victims, religion, and collective mourning, to themes of recognizing the assailants and their means, legislation, and personal frustration. This research paves the way for future research to further utilize the rhetoric of social intervention when identifying attempts at societal change within Presidential rhetoric.","Political Discourse: Praising, Blaming, Responding, and Categorizing",Language & Social Interaction

It investigates how Chinese online speakers make sense of their “shitizen” identity, how they ascribe certain “code of conduct” to shitizens (especially when it comes to online political participation), and how they talk about their relationship with the ruling state and government officials as members of the “shitizen” category. The analysis shows that online speakers openly claimed their membership within the category, as a strategic discursive practice to comment on this agonizing Chinese political environment in which they reside. More interestingly, speakers actively engaged in online political contestation (Yang, 2014) pertaining to the formation of this new identity group within the Chinese society and their ability to create social-political change under the current political conditions.","Political Discourse: Praising, Blaming, Responding, and Categorizing",Language & Social Interaction

At stake was not just the ability to repair or modify consumer vehicles, but beneath that, whether the material property rights of consumers would triumph over the intellectual property rights of corporations. Through an analysis of the public comments submitted during the proposal process, I reveal a discourse that is as much about cars as it is about the American idea of the foundation and benefits of property rights. I find that, for consumers, property rights are rooted in a liberal individualism that prioritizes private ownership, while corporations saw property rights as granted by the state for the benefit of the community.

2017-0825,2017,Paper Session,From Temporal to Social Rhythms: Day-to-Day Media Platform Usage and its Meaning for Society,2,"The usage of traditional media platforms (television and radio) follows clear temporal patterns whereas digital media platforms (computer and smartphone) are used largely independent of time. (Clock) time is a fundamental concept of societies structuring everyday life through its covariation with socially shared routines. The disintegration of media usage and time may therefore point to a ‘reconstruction of time’ and hereby social structures. The paper explains differences between media platforms’ time boundedness by routinization. Its main thesis is that the covariation of time with location, obligation, and social surroundings leads to shared social behaviors. Results from a quantitative diary study support the thesis that the differences in time boundedness between media platforms can be traced back to routinization: Television and radio usage are time bound, because they are embedded in day-to-day routines. In contrast, computers and smartphones are used largely independent of time, because they intersect with many day-to-day routines.",Understanding Audience: Toward A General Theory,Mass Communication

For that reason, we are interested in analyzing how audiences and experts interpret television discourses on intercultural communication. Based on a previous analysis of 157 TV news, we have conducted 4 focus groups among audiences and a Delphi method with experts. The following conclusions were reached. First, focus group data illustrated that audiences interpretation is highly polarized since media discourses are accepted or rejected, leaving little room for the negotiation of messages. Second, using a Delphi method, experts in interculturality believe that television constructs intercultural interaction from a stance of lack of equality in diversity, resulting in an impossible encounter marked by violence or the “carnivalesque”.

The BYAF differs from other compliance gaining techniques requiring sequential requests, namely the foot-in-the-door (FITD) and the door-in-the-face (DITF) techniques (Freedman & Fraser, 1966). Instead of using a sequence of requests to encourage compliance, the BYAF technique linguistically includes a reminder that the receiver of the request is free to refuse the request, argued to work by mitigating psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966). To encourage greater compliance, the present study experimentally examined the inclusion of a positive face component (i.e., “but, I would really appreciate it), to the traditional BYAF request. Results indicate the combined request encourage the greatest level of compliance, compared to a direct request, or requests that incorporated only the BYAF, or positive face components.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

In an experiment, viewers (N = 89) were randomly assigned to watch the episode either with or without an epilogue. Exposure to the epilogue increased recognition of the subtext but not awareness or processing effort. It also increased counterarguing against the subtext, but only among viewers less involved with the episode’s story. The epilogue decreased social distance for people with bipolar disorder, and decreased their belief that bipolar disorder is not treatable. These findings speak to the utility of epilogues as a tool to both reinforce intended entertainment-education messages and to combat misinformation.

2017-0833,2017,Paper Session,The Effect of Exposure to Unhealthy Food Commercials on Activation of the Hedonic Eating Goal,4,"Background: This study investigated whether exposure to palatable, unhealthy food TV commercials can activate the hedonic eating goal among unsuccessful restrained eaters (i.e., chronic dieters with little perceived self-regulatory success; PSRS), and inhibit this goal among successful restrained eaters.
Methods: The experiment used a 2(commercial condition: food/non-food) x 2(eating restraint: restrained/unrestrained) x 2(PSRS: low/high) between-subjects design. Participants’ (N = 111) accessibility of the hedonic eating goal was measured in a Lexical Decision Task.
Results: Contrary to the expectations, viewing food commercials (vs. non-food commercials) resulted in activation of the hedonic eating goal among successful unrestrained eaters, but in inhibition among unsuccessful unrestrained eaters and restrained eaters. Surprisingly, this was also found for the accessibility of neutral (office-related) words.
Discussion: To further unravel how food commercials may lead to unhealthy food intake we should investigate what processes cause change in accessibility of both the hedonic eating goal and neutral concepts.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems
2017-0834,2017,Paper Session,How the Design Characteristics of Online Consumer Platforms Influence Language Abstraction and Valence of Reviews,3,"Online consumer reviews provide relevant information about products and services for consumers. In today’s networked age, competition is becoming higher over review platforms. Platforms can easily change different design characteristics to get more reviewers and to get reviews higher in information quality. This study explored the relation between review platforms’ design characteristics and the reviewers’ construal level. A psycholinguistic coding scheme was used to assess which social and physical design characteristics impact the language abstraction in online reviews. To this end, we content analyzed reviews of services and products posted on eight different review platforms (n = 400). This resulted in a number of key design characteristics (e.g., reviewer identification, reviewer status, order of instructions and length instructions) that led to an increase in used language abstraction. The findings and their broader theoretical, methodological and practical implications are discussed. Review platforms could capitalize on our findings by changing design choices.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

The current study explores the mechanisms by which such effects could occur in fictional film. Using manipulated film scenes, we conducted a between subject experiment (N=136) exploring how character depiction (shot-scale and facial expression) affects film viewers’ ToM ability as well as their ToM-tendency. Results showed that close-up shots with a sad expression increased ToM-tendency (compared to neutral expression or long shots). However, this effect did not transfer to other characters in the film. There was also no observable effect of character depiction on viewers’ general ToM-ability. Together the findings suggest that formal and content features of character depiction can elicit ToM responses by directing attention towards character mental states rather than improving viewers’ ability to use ToM.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

Digital Media’s Effects on Understanding of Citizenship and Political Participation",2,"Is there a connection between increased use of digital media and changing patterns of political participation? This study tests how use of online media for different purposes (social interaction, creative expression, online news use, social media news use) is related to three types of political participation. It examines whether mobilizing effects are partly indirect due to different understandings of citizenship (dutiful, optional, individual, collective) that may be fostered by digital media use. The study is based on a survey of a sample of the Danish population (n=1322), including data from two online survey waves and a smartphone-based media diary that documents respondents’ social media use. Results indicate support for a new pathway to participation, but the relationship depends on whether citizens are socialized in a digital media environment.",Understanding the Influence of Social Media and Messaging on Engagement and Participation,Political Communication

We explore the use of MIMS for talking about politics with unique survey data on samples representative of internet users in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. First, we show that robust percentages of our respondents who use MIMS employ them for posting political messages and discussing politics. Secondly, we demonstrate that political talk on MIMS is positively associated with users’ tendency to censor themselves politically on social networking sites (SNS) and, to a lesser extent, with ideological extremism. Thirdly, we find that the association between self-censorship on SNS and the likelihood of publishing political contents on MIMS is stronger for individuals living in former East Germany where, due to historical reasons, large segments of the population are reluctant to talk about politics in public. Our findings suggest that MIMS make a distinctive contribution to contemporary repertoires of political talk, with important implications for the quality and inclusiveness of interpersonal political discussion.",Understanding the Influence of Social Media and Messaging on Engagement and Participation,Political Communication
2017-0839,2017,Paper Session,Understanding the mobilizing role of social media news use for political participation: How different social media technologies affect online political conversation,2,"This study examines distinctive relationships between five types of social media use for news (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp) and political participation. It is theorized that the relationship between social media news use and political participation will be positively mediated by online political conversation. In addition, we argue that this communication mediated process will vary between social media depending on the affordances distinct social media technologies enable for online political conversation. Our analyses of national survey data show that, except for Instagram news use, social media news use is not directly related to political participation. In addition, our results indicate positive indirect relationships between Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram news use and political participation, mediated via online political conversation. Taken together, this study provides empirical evidence of the pivotal role played by online political talk in politically mobilizing social media news users.",Understanding the Influence of Social Media and Messaging on Engagement and Participation,Political Communication
2017-0840,2017,Paper Session,Commitment in the Cloud? Social Media Participation in the Sunflower Movement,2,"Social media participants in digitally enabled protests have long been criticized for their lack of commitment. Many bypassed this issue and argued that social media participation is a functional or central aspect of protests. Nevertheless, commitment can be critical in explaining continued participation over time, which is often necessary to achieve fundamental social change. We empirically test the lack of commitment claim in the case of the 2014 Sunflower Movement in Taiwan. Using survey data from a sample of 801 participants, we find a group of highly active social media participants – what we described as the “cloud activists” -- who operated exclusively online during the movement. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the commitment of the “cloud activists”, in terms of both identification and sense of efficacy, is at least in par with, if not always necessarily higher than, most offline participants. Furthermore, contrasting previous findings on the positive relationship between social media use and offline participation, we find the offline mobilizing effect of social media is conditioned by the level of social media activity – social media does not mobilize “cloud activists” offline. We suggest that the identifying “cloud activists” may help us achieve a better understanding of protest leadership and peer production process by the crowd, as well as how digitally enabled protests persist and transform over time.",Understanding the Influence of Social Media and Messaging on Engagement and Participation,Political Communication

Studies could show that news exposure on social media can affect citizens’ political participation due to the personalized, targeted, & inadvertent exposure. However, previous research did not strongly focus on how the characteristics of a citizens’ social media network might alter this relationship. We tests how political information exposure via three different media channels affects political participation among Danish citizens and examine possible moderation effects of users network size, network diversity and the newly introduced parameter of perceived network activity. To this end, a two-wave online survey (n=858) among the Danish population was conducted, applying a smartphone-based media diary study. We find strong direct effects of social media exposure on participation but results indeed indicate that such effects are dependent on citizens’ network consistency.",Understanding the Influence of Social Media and Messaging on Engagement and Participation,Political Communication

2017-0843,2017,Paper Session,Does Interactivity Makes Users Autonomous? Role of Perceived Interactivity and Self-Determination in mHealth Applications,2,"“There is an app for that!” is a common refrain today. Thousands of smartphone apps geared toward tracking and monitoring everyday health behaviors are released everyday. Even as developers flood the consumer market with “mHealth” apps, there is growing “consumer fatigue” and lack of sustained use that question the efficacy of these tools. Based on an online survey (N = 524) of health app users, we examined whether perceived interactivity of these mHealth apps contributes to more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward them. Based on self-determination theory, the study’s findings show that perceived interactivity not only has a direct effect, but greater autonomous control also mediates the effect of perceived interactivity on attitudes and behavioral intentions toward mHealth apps. Perceived interactivity also significantly predicted perceived ease of use and usefulness of health apps. Theoretical implications, along with practical suggestions for the design and evaluation of mHealth apps are discussed.",Mobile and Online Health Interventions,Communication and Technology

An online experiment with 92 smokers tested the effect of the number of interactive features on the website ranging from zero to three. An inverted U-shaped quadratic trend was found in perceived interactivity, which indirectly influenced the change score of participants’ behavioral intention to quit after browsing. Only one or two interactive features, not three, led to significant increase in the change score compared with the control condition, by increasing vividness of the stimulus website and decreasing psychological reactance when the level of tobacco addiction was controlled. However, for smokers who are highly addicted, the website with three interactive features decreased their psychological reactance and led to more change in behavioral intention to quit compared with other less interactive conditions.",Mobile and Online Health Interventions,Communication and Technology

Therefore, health websites should take into account age-related limitations, such as by providing the opportunity to adjust the modality (i.e. ‘mode’) of information presentation based on visual and auditory capabilities of older adults. This study aims to investigate whether a mode-tailored website, allowing users to self-tailor the mode of information presentation, positively influences younger and older adults’ satisfaction with health websites. A 5 (condition: tailored vs. text, text with illustrations, text with video, combination) × 2 (age: younger [25–45] vs. older [≥65] adults) experimental study (N = 563) showed that mode tailoring positively influenced satisfaction with the attractiveness and comprehensibility of the website, relative to non-tailored conditions.

Specifically, the authors argue that what adds to the appeal of Snapchat is a focus on Social Presence. The authors make the further argument that Theory of Mind, a construct used in developmental psychology, plays a key role in degree of Social Presence generated by a medium as well as in the intensity in which a social medium plays a role in users’ daily life. A sample of 314 Snapchat users, aged from 18 to 29, showed significant links between measures of various precursors and components of Theory of Mind with dimensions of Social Presence, Snapchat Intensity, and frequency of Snapchat usage patterns. Further, the results of a mediation analysis suggest that increasing elements of Social Presence underlies the relationship between mechanisms of Theory of Mind and the intensity of a social media (Snapchat) in users’ daily life",Social Presence and Technology,Communication and Technology

Yet, little is known why and how different styles of celebrity’s self-disclosing tweets influence their fans’ perceptions. Using a 2 (Topic of self-disclosure: Professional vs. Personal) × 2 (Sentimental expression of self-disclosure: Descriptive vs. Emotional), between-subject online experiment, the effects of celebrity’s self-disclosing tweets were tested. Overall findings indicate that personal (compared to professional) and emotional (compared to descriptive) self-disclosing tweets lead to positive reactions from others. Further, the theoretical notion of social presence is found to play as a mediator between celebrity’s self-disclosure styles and people’s perceptions toward the celebrity.

2017-0849,2017,Paper Session,A Trinity of Communication Modes: The Convergence of CMC and HCI on Cues and Social Presence,1,"Scholars have spent decades theorizing the relations between humans and computers. Some of the early visions of computing systems have progressed and come to life in dramatic and unforeseen ways. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) and human-computer interaction (HCI) are two major fields that examine the role of computers in communication. In this study, we reviewed the similarities and differences between CMC and HCI in conceptualizing cues and social presence. By proposing a typology of cues (i.e., cues as social signals, cues as message elements, cues as social categories, cues as affordances, and cues as perceptual bandwidth), we attempt to anatomize the current research status quo of the human-computer relationship. We propose that a growing area, which derives from CMC and HCI and centers on users’ interaction with computer agents, is blurring the differences between CMC and HCI and is potentially leading a paradigm shift. We suggest that future research on this growing area should envision the potentiality of the elements in CMC and HCI.",Social Presence and Technology,Communication and Technology

But are audiences' thoughts about violent portrayals actually confined to aggressive fantasies? This study examines more complex thought processes that involve reflection and meaning-making about violence as a fact of social reality. Using an item pool derived from qualitative research, we conducted two studies in the US (N = 431) and Germany (N = 412) to develop and validate a multidimensional self-report scale that taps different types of violence-related thoughts. Factor analytical findings and validation analyses provide evidence and measurement for five dimensions of reflective thoughts about violent media content, including 1) the true story behind it, 2) lessons that can be learnt from it, 3) own and close others’ experiences with violence, 4) human cruelty and suffering from violence, and 5) moral complexities of violence.","Media Violence, Agression, and Suspense",Mass Communication

The audience can be expected to have formed their own beliefs about suspense in general based on their own viewing or reading experiences and genre knowledge. While these cognitions about suspense have been theorized to influence the specific viewing or reading experience, their empirical investigation has largely been neglected, however. Two studies were conducted to answer this question. Study 1 explored audience members’ media beliefs about suspense using in depth interviews. Study 2 developed a scale of media beliefs about suspense based on the results of study 1 and investigated their influence on audience members’ suspense experience. Our results provide valuable evidence that audience members’ media beliefs about suspense are a reasonable influence on their suspense experience.","Media Violence, Agression, and Suspense",Mass Communication

We showed 609 parents a sequence of four violent film clips. Parents viewed clips either featuring unjustified violence or justified violence. After each clip, we asked parents two outcomes that previously demonstrated desensitization: the age at which it would be appropriate to allow a child to view the film and how likely they would be to allow their own child to view the film. Contrary to expectations, age appropriateness and likelihood to allow increased after repeated exposure to violent clips. As expected, parents were more lax towards justified violence than unjustified violence. As expected, there was an interaction between repeated exposure and justification; age appropriateness increased and likelihood to allow decreased with repeated exposure in the unjustified condition but were stable in the justified condition.","Media Violence, Agression, and Suspense",Mass Communication

2017-0855,2017,Paper Session,Online Disclosure as a Masspersonal Phenomenon: Current Models and a Social Influence Perspective,1,"This paper conceptualizes online disclosure as a masspersonal phenomenon that entails the interpersonal communication process of self-disclosure and its occurrence in a mass communication space. A social influence model of online disclosure is introduced. Conventional models of self-disclosure fail to account for new disclosure practices online, as the sharing of personal information now takes place semi-publicly and publicly. Scholars attempt to close this gap by examining social reward goals that people want to attain through disclosure, individual characteristics, and the imagined audience. Less is known about online disclosure from a social influence perspective. This perspective examines online disclosure by examining both the interpersonal act of self-disclosure on mass media platforms, such as social networking sites (SNSs), that is contingent on an individual’s prior behavior, the affordances of SNSs, and the social influence of network members on the masspersonal phenomenon.

Nevertheless, stigma is not identified as a dimension of stressors in the framework of the optimal matching model. Consequently, the association between stigma and online social support exchange is unknown.
To study the role of stigma in the search for online support, this study examined the prevalence of support messages and the motivations of searching for online social support in two online support groups: one for Israeli women who are voluntarily childless and another for Israeli women with fertility issues.
Results indicate that fertility group members searched for informational and emotional support, while voluntarily childless forum members searched for esteem and network support.

Interview results suggest that celebrity physicians are frustrated by the distrust from their patients who have a low level of health literacy, biased conventional media depictions of the medical profession, and their conflicts with the government. They attempt to use social media to address these concerns. The findings indicate that celebrity physicians are both professionally and politically motivated to play an active role in cyberspace. The phenomenon further exemplifies the sociological origins of media use in a non-democratic country such as China. At the theoretical level, this study suggests that categorizing users’ motivations into isolated realms could have ignored the complexity of social media activities.

The multiplicity of today’s media marketplace poses challenges for brand marketers when communicating with their target audiences. “Branded content,” with its focus on understanding the audience, creating something that consumers seek out, and designing engagement opportunities, seems to offer a viable option. Despite the growth of branded content practices, there has been limited research addressing the phenomenon. This study attempts to contribute to the discussion by identifying various constructs that offer explanatory power for the use of branded content from an audience perspective.

A theoretical framework involving the central constructs of brand actions, customer engagement behaviors (CEBs), and product consumption (viewing) is proposed. Brand actions include traditional paid advertising and social media prompts. CEBs include volume, valence and media richness of user-generated content about the show on social media. TV consumption comprises of live and time-shifted viewing. A simultaneous system of equations approach is adopted to analyze big set-top-box data from a US Cable TV provider, Kantar Media advertising data, and Twitter data. The study finds that: paid advertising has a positive effect on time-shifted viewing, but a negative effect on live viewing; tweets from the TV show have a negative effect on time-shifted viewing, but a positive effect on life viewing; and negative sentiment from viewers reduces time-shifted viewing, but increases live viewing.","Native Advertising, Branded Content, and Audience Engagement",Media Industry Studies

social transmission. We investigate the main effect of content characteristics (emotionally-
charged vs. neutral) on sharing behaviors (like, comment, and share) in social media. In
particular, the mediating role of psychological arousal was examined in the relationship
between message characteristics and sharing behaviors. The results showed that participants
exposed to emotionally-charged messages had more psychological arousal, compared with
participants exposed to neutral messages, with a higher intention of message sharing as well.
Importantly, psychological arousal fully mediated message characteristics and sharing
activities. The significant mediating role of psychological arousal points to people’s tendency

While increasing brand awareness, NA had negative effects on perceived quality of both brands and media credibility. Therefore, finding a balance between the media outlet’s qualitative standards and the advertising company’s interests constitutes a crucial challenge for the successful implementation of NA.","Native Advertising, Branded Content, and Audience Engagement",Media Industry Studies

Among all, the combined use of traditional TV and smartphones is the most popular cross-platform media consumption. Few studies have addressed the underlying motivations of such a phenomenon. To focus more on the questions of why and how instead of studies on what in combined TV-smartphone media consumption, the paper puts forward a model to address the gratifications derived from TV-smartphone consumption.
The paper identified four kinds of gratifications in TV-smartphone multitasking: emotional, social, habitual, and participatory/relevance gratification. The paper also found the positive impact of the fear of missing out, social media use, cognitive control, and TV-smartphone usage on four kinds of gratification. But the impact of demographic traits is very limited, indicating the prevalence of TV-smartphone multitasking which is independent of personal traits.","Native Advertising, Branded Content, and Audience Engagement",Media Industry Studies

We test this assumption in a Facebook environment and, based on deliberative theory, extend it to the analysis of how news factors and illustration factors predict the inclusiveness of discussions as well as the occurrence of civil interactivity, constructive comments (e.g., comments including additional knowledge and arguments), and detrimental comments (e.g., comments including topic drifts or incivility). A content analysis of 619 news articles and 11,218 related user comments on nine nation-wide Facebook news sites reveals that the news factors controversy, contravention, and obtrusiveness in particular account for specific discussion qualities.

As new rules and policies emerge, journalists engage in a public campaign to change how commenting and journalism are perceived. This study seeks to understand how journalists attempt to frame commenting and its role alongside journalism. Boundary work was used to consider how journalists use public statements about commenting to establish appropriate roles for both the journalist and the commenter. But these statements also represent philosophies about strategies, policies, and practices related to commenting. Journalists take three philosophical approaches to online comments based on whether they willingly welcome commenters; see the commenter as a threat, but recognize their role; or take action to keep the audience at a distance.

2017-0868,2017,Paper Session,Unsettling Home: Discomfort as an Intervention for Reimagining Belonging and Solidarity,1,"Feminist scholars Biddy Martin and Chandra Mohanty have argued that contesting the unity of the discourse of ‘home’ is the foundation for building non-identity based community. Suturing cultural studies scholarship on the Indian diaspora with Martin and Mohanty’s work on the political im/possibilities related to the unity of home, family and nation, this paper proposes that diaspora be understood as a space where disruptions in constructions of home are magnified, making it a generative site to study alliance-building practices that are not attached to similarity, i.e. a common home, nation, or belonging. To illustrate the politics enabled by inhabiting diasporic homes as places of discomfort, the paper undertakes an ethnographic analysis of the diaspora organization Association for India’s Development (AID). The analysis points to the ways in which AID engages home in volunteer discourses about development, suggesting that a rigorous questioning of diasporic homes work allows for restructuring traditional alliances.","Advancing Feminist Theories: Interventions, Integrations, and Intersections",Feminist Scholarship
2017-0869,2017,Paper Session,Working Toward a Feminist Theory of Trauma and Digital Media,1,"Those with access to digital technologies and infrastructure often participate in social, self-curation on social media websites. Many users engage with these sites in order to intervene in problematic life events and remake their identities after an individual or cultural vicissitude. This research explores how trauma, in shattering or altering life-making schema that allow individuals and collectivities to construct meaning in their daily lives, changes the way users engage in digital environments. This paper bridges feminist post-structuralism and feminist disability studies with trauma studies and media studies, respectively, in order to create a new theory for exploring how traumatic events function online. The affordances of digital technologies create possibilities for users to make meaning and create world-making schema in the playful, online environment that allows for bricolage and mimetic expression.","Advancing Feminist Theories: Interventions, Integrations, and Intersections",Feminist Scholarship
2017-0870,2017,Paper Session,"""We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves"" as a Feminist STS Intervention",1,"Karen Joy Fowler’s 2013 novel We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves explores the intimate violence of state and corporate research practices involving animals. With its immanent adaptation into an HBO miniseries starring Natalie Portman, the story is one that is bound to receive additional attention, yet its work as a feminist intervention that comments on dominant modes of knowledge production may not translate well to screen. Through narrative structure and voice, character, and plot elements, the novel critiques western, patriarchal science and privileges instead the situated, contingent, and value-laden character of knowledge production. It also critiques the political economy of science, including the role of the state and the complicity of the liberal subject. The novel insists that scientific practices of knowledge production are cultural practices, and that cultural practices—enacted by a novel such as this—produce knowledge that is critical to understanding science.","Advancing Feminist Theories: Interventions, Integrations, and Intersections",Feminist Scholarship

2017-0872,2017,Paper Session,Intersectionality and Feminist Praxis: An Integrative Analysis of Diversity and Discourse in Women’s Leadership,1,"Although feminisms have been steadfast in their work for the advancement and equality of women, early feminists,  however, have been criticized for treating one form of oppression as more fundamental or more central than another, thus excluding women of color, international women, women of lower socioeconomic standing, less educated women, and others.   

This essay offers a transformative model of women’s leadership through the lens of intersectionality by drawing on the diverse perspectives of women leaders to extend leadership and communication theoretical frameworks. I argue that intersectionality as a conceptual framework can strengthen and enhance analyses of leadership, and I also discuss how difference can serve as assets to women and organizations at large - to help us to re-imagine women’s leadership as more inclusive and complex.","Advancing Feminist Theories: Interventions, Integrations, and Intersections",Feminist Scholarship

The essay begins with an overview of two important theories—polymediation and social information processing—that help to contextualize the space for online relating as well as some of the basic processes involved when people interact online. This theoretical foundation is followed by a review of how gender and sexuality are embodied online, especially as it ties into online identity. That leads into a discussion of three contexts of social media: social networking sites, texting, and online dating. Overall, the essay provides a summary of theorizing about relating online; offers an overview of research about love, intimacy, and social media; and suggests ideas for future research.","Advancing Feminist Theories: Interventions, Integrations, and Intersections",Feminist Scholarship
2017-0874,2017,Paper Session,Little Words and Big Goals: Semantic Indicators of Leadership in Multiteam Systems,3,"Many important large-scale organizational or societal challenges require multiple groups or teams from different disciplines, organizations, and/or geographic locations to collaborate, often via computer-mediated communication (CMC) platforms, toward the accomplishment of shared superordinate goals. In these complex “multiteam system” contexts, leadership is often more of an informal social process that emerges through social interactions rather than a formalized command-and-control structure (e.g., management). However, fundamental questions remain regarding the specific interactions and the mechanisms by which informal leaders emerge. In this study, we analyze the digital traces among participants in a multiteam system laboratory task in order to identify word choices that indicate leader emergence during computer-mediated multiteam collaboration. We find that in addition to use of plural language, language referencing the superordinate (multiteam) goal predicts leader emergence.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

However, a complete account of how communication can play a role in ethical leadership is seemingly missing in the literature. Applying the four flows model (McPhee & Zaug, 2000) as a theoretical underpinning, we propose an integrative framework to elucidate the flows of communication embedded in the process of ethical leadership. We contend that the proposed four communication flows essentially serve as a conduit that allows different levels of ethical leaders to operationalize their attentions to the multilevel flows of messages in conveying the ethical principles. These efforts should result in ethical climate within organizations and an internal as well as an external ethical reputation of organizations. This theoretical paper complements the previous literature of business ethics, ethical leadership, and organizational communication.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

Results, based on a sample of 155 leader–member dyads within 25 work groups in a Malaysian organization, supported the hypotheses advanced in this study. Specifically, by using multilevel polynomial regression analyses, the results showed that leader-member conversation quality (LMCQ) mediated the relationship between LMX agreement and commitment and OCB. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that group leader’s and group member’s rating of LMX strengthened the leader-member conversation quality and the positive relationship of LMX agreement on group member’s commitment and OCB is contingent to direct and indirect effect of LMCQ.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

Given such negative consequences, this study explored five coping strategies: neglect, acquiescence, voice, exit, and retribution (NAVER). This research examined the extent to which relational concerns such as leader-member exchanges (LMXs) and cultural variations (USA and Singapore) affect use of the 5 coping strategies after controlling for actual exposure to workplace bullying, gender and age. Findings indicated that the quality of LMX significantly influence the strategic use of acquiescence, exit, and retribution. No significant cultural variation in coping strategies was detected. LMX quality and actual experience of workplace bullying were the strongest determinants for the use of all coping strategies but exit.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication
2017-0878,2017,Paper Session,Between the “Employee” and “Manager” Worlds: Tensions in the Process of Downsizing,1,"This study examines the discursive production of tensions during an organizational downsizing process through the study of employees’ and managers’ accounts. Drawing on data gathered at a Canadian governmental agency, this paper empirically illustrates the existence of multiple tensions that are part of members’ responses to this change process. To help us investigate these accounts, we propose to mobilize Cooren’s (2010, 2013) ventriloquial approach, which provides a compelling framework for the analysis of organizational members’ responses as they deal with preoccupations arising from the implementation of new work processes. By tracking voices, figures, and tensions, this analysis allows us to shed light on preoccupations that are constitutive of the change process. The analysis revealed three main tensions during the change process: supportiveness vs. equity, effectiveness vs. authority, and accountability vs. collegiality. It suggests that it is important to consider these tensions in addressing issues of change and employees’ concerns during this kind of process. The current literature does not explain how employees voice their concerns or how these preoccupations interact with one another to create multiple tensions. Our findings suggest that employees’ preoccupations and concerns provide a global picture of their experiences during the process of organizational change and a better understanding of the tensions that are also part of the change process. This research presents a tension-centered perspective of change that challenges traditional approaches to change and suggests ways of avoiding tension in the change process.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

The present study uses an organizational justice perspective to examine how managers’ handling of deviant behavior impacts other employees’ perceptions. Full-time employees from multiple organizations (N = 84) completed an online survey exploring how perceived frequency of managers addressing deviant behavior related to assessments of organizational justice, job satisfaction, managerial satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Results demonstrated employees who perceived their managers addressing deviant behavior less frequently reported lower levels of procedural, interpersonal and informational justice in the organization, as well as lower levels of managerial satisfaction, job satisfaction, and affective and normative organizational commitment. However, no significant relationships were found between managers’ handling of deviant behavior and continuance commitment or turnover intentions. Results reveal practical implications for managers and organization regarding addressing deviant behavior.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

From a set of qualitatively identified communication barriers, individual- and contextual-level barriers proved to negatively impact older workers’ job performance, and in turn impede the likelihood that an individual older worker gets promoted. The findings suggest that accommodative communication is needed to breakthrough the negative spiral of age stereotypes in a workplace context, and demonstrate the usefulness of extending the concept of accommodation from recipients’ psychosocial needs to goal-oriented conversational needs in the workplace.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

Members in MNOs also face cultural differences in accounts provided by other members, yet inappropriate accounts could damage the account-giver’s career. This study examines account-giving in the eyes of the manager in MNO contexts. Open-ended survey data were collected online from 23 Japanese and 20 American managers in the United States. The results of thematic analysis discover that American managers view the out-of-control account as most appropriate, whereas Japanese managers expect an apology in an untoward situation. More importantly, this study gives insights to the apology account indicating that Japanese expectation is not a simple apology, but these managers expect self-reflection with the apology so that the subordinate will not make the same error in the future. Other findings and practical implications for MNO members as well as researchers are also discussed.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

As members attempt to craft organizational roles that are consistent with their identities, they share knowledge, skills, and stories from their past work experience. By doing so, employees are able to expand their formal and informal roles, position themselves as experts, and bond with their coworkers. These findings show that employees actively work to craft favorable positions in the workplace rather than only adjusting to their formal job description. Moreover, this study contributes to organizational socialization research by highlighting employees’ agency to take part in their own socialization.","B.E.S.T.: Leadership, Managers, and Employees",Organizational Communication

However, the effectiveness of using bloggers is still being researched. This study aims to find out how best to utilize bloggers as an advertising tool, based on three factors – blogger credibility, advertising intent, and product involvement. A 2x2x2 experiment was carried to test their interaction effects on advertising effectiveness. The results indicate that, for high credibility bloggers, advertorials are more effective for advertising intent that was implicit, rather than explicit. This applied to both high and low involvement products. However, for low-credibility bloggers writing about low-involvement products, advertising effectiveness was only effective for advertising intent that was explicit. Advertising effectiveness did not differ significantly for explicit and implicit advertising intent when it came to low-credibility bloggers who wrote about high-involvement products. Based on these results, some implications for further research and practice are given.","Media Transparency and Corporate News: Interventions, Connections, Disruptions",Public Relations

Corporate newsrooms can be seen as the implementation of this approach on an organizational level. However, the implementation of corporate newsrooms does not come without challenges, and is thus often met with some resistance.
This article explores to what extent corporate newsrooms have been implemented in large companies and administrations in Switzerland. Based on the answers of 77 organizations, it will be shown how corporate newsrooms have already become a surprisingly widespread phenomenon in corporate and government communications. The results also show that regardless of the actual existence of a corporate newsroom, typical elements of a newsroom structure are found in all kinds of organizations. This leads to the conclusion that the corporate newsrooms concept is more than just a fad, and that the principles associated with corporate newsrooms are relevant for all organizations.","Media Transparency and Corporate News: Interventions, Connections, Disruptions",Public Relations

Confidence in major corporations as entities of this economic and technological development is therefore important. In our mediatized world, information about those corporations is mainly transmitted through media. In this research the relationship between news consumption and confidence in major corporations is investigated, in the context of different value patterns around the world. Using representative data from the World Values Survey Wave 6 in 59 countries (N = 85, 981) this relationship will be explored and modelled. Preliminary results show a weak, but significant, negative correlation between confidence in major corporations and emancipative values. News consumption is shown to have a weak, but significant, positive correlation with confidence in corporations.","Media Transparency and Corporate News: Interventions, Connections, Disruptions",Public Relations

Strategies that suggest practices for media relations often discern between corporations, public organizations, and NGOs. The media attention for those organizations is however often studied in isolation, focusing on a single group of organizations. The aim of this study is therefore to analyze and compare media coverage for corporations, public organizations, and NGOs. A quantitative content analysis of the media coverage of 61 Dutch organizations was conducted. The comparison focused on three aspects: Prominence, content, and evaluation. Our analysis showed that public organizations and corporations were most similar whereas corporations and NGOs differed most strongly in the way they were positioned in the media.","Media Transparency and Corporate News: Interventions, Connections, Disruptions",Public Relations

The present study aims to advance previous work by accounting for individual-level media exposure while investigating the causal effects of organizational visibility, tone, and issue-associations in company news on corporate reputation. To this end, we conduct an automated content analysis of a large number of news articles (both online and print), and combine this with data from a three-wave panel survey on the opinions of people regarding twelve Dutch media-prominent corporations. Our preliminary results challenge extant knowledge-claims about news effects on reputation, because they indicate that increased media visibility of a corporation tends to negatively impact that corporation’s reputation.

Given that sports fans participate in “oppositional fandoms,” or fandoms that are temporarily defined by their position in opposition to another fandom, their relationship to social justice activism is flexible and contingent. We particularly find that the environment in which the fandom takes place plays an important role in shaping how fans can be solicited for political engagement. Ultimately we argue that despite the bad reputation of many sports fandoms, sport cultures can in fact provide a potentially transformative context for shifting the national discourse on social justice issues.","Fans, Fandom, and Fantagonism: From Football to Fluttershy",Popular Communication
2017-0889,2017,Paper Session,If Adults Watch it “Its Gotta Be Good”: Traditional Taste Hierarchies in the Brony Fandom,2,"Perceptions of television programs and their audiences have deep roots in taste culture and the ideologies that underpin it. As Legitimating Television (Levine and Newman, 2012) argues, scholarly and industry discourses have legitimized television in ways that uphold traditional hierarchies, often based in masculinized perceptions of value and quality. This paper analyzes the problematics of how, mostly male, adults discuss issues of quality and taste in relation to their fandom of the television program My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, a merchandise-based animated series targeting young girls. As the unexpected audience of a text in a stigmatized genre, our respondents’audience and fan discourses served as an important site for exploring the negotiation of legitimization, taste, and quality. Drawing upon 237 adult male and female fans’ responses to a qualitative questionnaire, this paper documents respondents’ celebration and defense of their unusual taste via traditional value markers, maintaining well-established audience hierarchies.","Fans, Fandom, and Fantagonism: From Football to Fluttershy",Popular Communication
2017-0890,2017,Paper Session,Playing All Sides: Media Franchising and the Management of Fantagonism,1,"By framing factionalized conflicts between media fans and media institutions in relation to activist calls for — and against — media change, we can grasp how contemporary industries manage and incorporate those competing pressures into new strategies and corporate practices. Such “fantagonism” currently intersects with a politics of cultural loss in which some fans perceive threats to their consumer sovereignty and privilege from the potential improvement of service to other consumers. Yet against this “zero sum geek” premise, the franchising logics of media industries work to multiply cultural products across different spin-offs and parallel market appeals to reach different kinds of consumers at once. Considering the 2016 industry reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise, this paper argues that hostile consumer perceptions of a zero sum market nevertheless allow media industries to identify market opportunities, incorporate competing consumer demands into new product offerings, and play all sides of the struggles between different fandoms.","Fans, Fandom, and Fantagonism: From Football to Fluttershy",Popular Communication

The research aims to better understand the role of fandom in later life, in particular how the participants in this study negotiate their perceptions of their subjective age in relation to being a fan in this part of their life course (Harrington et al. 2011). This study combines theory on cultural gerontology with fan studies and mediatization theory in order to understand the processes that guide fans’ negotiations of subjective age as well as the role of fan practices and the affordances of social media in these processes. I argue that fandom, as a manifestation of a mediatized culture, augments the relevance of subjective age and informs the way in which participants in middle and later life perceive and negotiate their subjective age.","Fans, Fandom, and Fantagonism: From Football to Fluttershy",Popular Communication

2017-0893,2017,Paper Session,Direct and Indirect Effects of Communication Interventions: Gender Constructs and Modern Contraceptive Use,3,"Background: This study sought to explore whether communication programs had direct and indirect effects on contraceptive use.

Data: Endline survey data collected to evaluate communication programs designed to influence contraceptive use in India (N=9,624), Malawi (N=2,205), and Nigeria (N=6,539) were analyzed.

Results: Multivariate analysis found positive associations between the campaigns and FP use as well as the campaigns and gender constructs in India and Nigeria, but not in Malawi. Analysis also found that gender empowerment mediated the relationship between message exposure and contraceptive use in Nigeria.

Conclusions: Analyses of three family planning communication programs explored the interplay among intervention exposure, gender equity and contraceptive use. While exposure was associated with contraceptive use, it was not strongly associated with inclusive gender equitable views. Findings suggest that family planning interventions are not inherently gender transformative, pointing to the need for communication programs that purposively address both contraceptive use and gender equity.","Formative, Process, and Outcome Evaluation Research for Health Communication Campaigns",Health Communication

The current study examines predictors of college students’ intentions to engage in sexual assault intervention through the theoretical lens of the reasoned action approach. An online survey with college students (N = 186) was conducted at a large Midwestern university exposed to the It’s On Us campaign. Results indicated that experiential attitudes, instrumental attitudes, descriptive norms, autonomy, and capacity were each positively associated with intentions to intervene to stop a sexual assault. Against expectations, injunctive norms were unrelated to sexual assault intervening intentions. In addition to these main effects, an experiential attitude by autonomy interaction was also observed as were antecedents of campaign exposure.

The study utilized a three-wave repeated cross-sectional design and an annual phone survey conducted with a representative sample of adults (N = 906 in 2013, N = 907 in 2014, and N = 906 in 2015) which assessed exposure to the campaign, drug disposal behaviors, possible mediators of campaign effects (risk appraisal, personal agency, normative influence, and interpersonal talk), and potential confounders. Logistic regression and causal mediation analysis were employed to estimate confounder-adjusted direct and mediated effects of the campaign. Results showed that the campaign reached a sizable portion (50-60%) of state adults and that campaign exposure was associated with increased likelihood of having conversations with others about this topic. About 55% of all adults in the state reported taking at least one of the actions recommended by the campaign, and campaign exposure was associated with increased likelihood of disposing of prescription drugs at a collection day event (adjusted OR = 4) and of talking to a child about the risks associated with prescription drug abuse (adjusted OR = 2). The causal mediation analysis demonstrated that the campaign influenced audiences by reinforcing their efficacy to safely dispose of prescription drugs, but also potentially by stimulating conversations among community members about this topic.","Formative, Process, and Outcome Evaluation Research for Health Communication Campaigns",Health Communication

Sun safety behaviors were assessed one week later. Results confirm that, consistent with the hypocrisy paradigm, those who posted the video reported increased sun safety behavior over the next week. Further, emotional intensity was a significant predictor of message sharing. This study not only extends the hypocrisy paradigm to media contexts but also suggests that a viable strategy for encouraging behavioral enactment for those who hold desired attitudes is to encourage them to publicly endorse the behavior to others.",Content and Effects of Health-Related Messages on Social Media,Health Communication

2017-0902,2017,Paper Session,"The Left, the Right, and the Powerful - A Cross-Country Evaluation of Bias in Television Election News Coverage",3,"With every new election cycle, the question of fair and balanced news reporting receives new attention by politicians, journalists and scholars once again. Since the media are the most important institution in informing the electorate on candidates and their political programs, impartial coverage on the election is an essential part of a healthy democracy. Nevertheless, claims about biased news reporting are not limited to one singular country, but brought forward in almost all modern Western democracies. In this paper, we take a comparative approach and explore whether there is transnational evidence for a liberal media bias and incumbency advantage. We conducted a content analysis of election campaign coverage on the main TV news programs in five countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States) between 2007 and 2010. A separate analysis of (1) sound and image bite news and (2) metacoverage found no clear pattern for either liberal bias or an incumbency advantage. However, when combining the two analyses, our results hint towards a more favorable treatment of left incumbent candidates across most of the dimensions under study. This finding directs attention to a hitherto unexplored variant of advocative election news coverage in the form of liberal incumbency bias.",Rethinking Notions of Balance and Bias in the News,Journalism Studies
2017-0903,2017,Paper Session,Immigration News and Real World Developments,2,"While prior studies examining immigration news coverage have typically documented a dominant focus on negativity and threats, only limited empirical research is available which studies the accuracy of patterns in immigration news coverage. The present study aims to fill this void in the literature. First, this study offers a large-scale and longitudinal content analysis (N = 4,400,143) of immigration newspaper coverage (1999-2016) in two representative Western European cases, Flanders and the Netherlands. Both the salience of immigration as a news topic as well as its linkage with crime, terrorism, and socioeconomic issues is explored. Second, the current study extends previous insights by systematically comparing dynamics in news coverage of immigration to real-world events and developments. This permits conclusions with regard to the accuracy of news coverage. As such this study’s primary objective is to shed more light on the question whether news media are reflecting reality or, to some extent, offer a distorted picture of reality by constructing a biased view about immigration.",Rethinking Notions of Balance and Bias in the News,Journalism Studies
2017-0904,2017,Paper Session,Journalists’ Balancing Act: Self-Correcting for the Protest Paradigm During the Demonstrations in Brazil,1,"This paper uses a media sociology approach to untangle how multiple influences shaped news coverage of the 2013 and 2015 protests in Brazil. Through a quantitatively-driven mixed methodology combining survey, content analysis and interviews, this project provides a holistic view of how elite mainstream journalists went about covering the demonstrations. Findings suggest that the more journalists supported demonstrations, the less favorably they portrayed protestors. This holds true even when controlling for their outlet’s editorial line, as measured by journalists’ own perception of their employers. Through in-depth interviews, journalists described continually self-assessing and correcting for bias, citing professional norms as the basis for coverage of protests that were contrary to their personal opinions. This pattern particularly benefited the right-leaning movements viewed negatively by most journalists in the sample. Findings defy the logic behind the protest paradigm, which is rooted on a notion of a press ideological resistance to protestors.",Rethinking Notions of Balance and Bias in the News,Journalism Studies
2017-0905,2017,Paper Session,Consumerism and Country-of-Origin Bias: Newspaper Coverage of Product Defects and Recalls,2,"Global commerce products are designed, patented, assembled, and sold in different. Consumers are aware of the international journey of the goods they buy, and often use a product’s country of origin as a heuristic to judge the desirability of goods. When products are defective or recalled, media coverage tends to reflect biases about both foreign and locally produced goods, based on the overall reputation of a given country. Reputational stakes may be especially high China and the United States, since both nations extensively buy each other’s products. It is important to understand how each country is positioned in consumers’ minds via news coverage, as it both reflects and shapes public opinion. This study compared news coverage of 15 years’ worth of product defects and recalls in China Daily and The Washington Post, asking to what extent newspaper coverage reflects nationalistic biases and efforts to define news for domestic audiences.",Rethinking Notions of Balance and Bias in the News,Journalism Studies

We carried out a content analysis of the UK’s main evening bulletins over the campaign, examining the issues and sources shaping coverage, as well as all the statistical claims made by campaign actors and how journalists interpreted them. Overall, we ask: how far did broadcasters resort to balancing competing perspectives or interrogating the claims of campaign actors?
While all bulletins supplied a remarkable degree of balance in reporting the central issues and actors of the campaign, we found impartiality was interpreted by balancing opposing sides of the campaign. Journalists appeared reluctant to challenge the sometimes dubious claims of campaign actors, and instead featured many statistical tit-for-tat exchanges. We argue a more evidence-driven approach to impartiality is needed, where journalists independently seek ‘the truth’ and have the editorial freedom to challenge claims.",Rethinking Notions of Balance and Bias in the News,Journalism Studies

Nine Taiwanese and nine Chinese students studying at one Taiwanese university were recruited for this study. The Chinese students were in Taiwan for at least two years. The participants were friends with the other party for at least 8 months. This study was divided into three stages. In the first stage, participants were required to provide factors that facilitated their friendship with the other party. Fifty ideas were collected. In the second stage, participants were asked to clarify those factors and then categorize those factors. Fourteen categories were identified in this stage. The participants, then, voted on factors that affected their friendship formation, development, and maintenance with other party. Fifteen factors were voted the highest among those factors. Those 15 factors were imported into interpretive structure modeling (ISM) software for the next stage. In the third stage, 18 one-on-one interviews were conducted, and 18 ISM diagrams were generated. ISM provided a method to identify the influential relationship among those factors. According to the results, the friendship formation model was proposed. Five stages were identified in this model: exploring, matching, engaging, deepening and bonding.","Intercultural Relationships: Friends, Teacher-Student, Family, and Marriage",Intercultural Communication

The hypothesized model was estimated using PROCESS (Hays, 2013) in two participant groups depending on the reported level of similarity with the student (i.e., high and low). Findings in this study in general demonstrated how communicative behaviors were associated with POV and friendship judgments, which subsequently predicted positive intergroup attitudes. In addition, findings revealed that friendship formation processes were not identical in the high and low similarity participant groups, indicating the importance of perceived similarity in intergroup contact research in cross-national contexts. Results were discussed in light of intergroup contact, predicted outcome value, acculturation, and friendship building.","Intercultural Relationships: Friends, Teacher-Student, Family, and Marriage",Intercultural Communication

Findings of the study showed that international students’ directness of communication style was positively associated with their psychological wellbeing; this association is mediated not only by the frequency of intercultural communication with members of the host society, but also the number of friends they make in the host society. The study not only provides empirical evidence for the importance of intercultural communication training in facilitating cultural adaptation, but also theoretical insights into the process by which such effects take place.","Intercultural Relationships: Friends, Teacher-Student, Family, and Marriage",Intercultural Communication

Applying the dimensions PEN-3 Cultural Model, a literature review of adolescent pregnancy in Jamaica was conducted in order to categorize the emergent cultural factors that predict the phenomenon. The following cultural factors emerged: perceived parental control and quality of parental interaction, lack of a father figure in the home, high levels of self-efficacy, knowledge of child rearing skills and resilience, age-discordant relationships, early sexual initiation and the link to sexual abuse, relaxed social norms regarding early pregnancy, heavily gendered expectations, and media and popular culture. These results contribute to the development of a comprehensive, theory driven and culturally appropriate intervention, based on the identified entry point(s) for Jamaica.","Intercultural Relationships: Friends, Teacher-Student, Family, and Marriage",Intercultural Communication

In Indonesia, the violence and anti-Chinese policies of the Suharto period motivated an initial outflow of migrants. Then by the 1990s, in Taiwan it was believed good to “marry-in” a foreign spouse. More recently, as the flow of migrants has slowed, and marriages have either ended or become established, narratives have emerged to explain why some marriages are “good” and others “bad.” This study unpacks these narratives, showing that while Indonesians focus on such matters as fate and the actions of the Taiwanese man, Taiwanese tell tales of women who persevered, or others who ran away.","Intercultural Relationships: Friends, Teacher-Student, Family, and Marriage",Intercultural Communication

Drawing upon intergroup and discourse dependence theorizing, this study explores: (1) how adoptive parents position their child’s unique ethnic identity within the family identity, (2) how adoptive parents experience race after adopting transracially, and (3) how adoptive parents navigate ethnic differences through talk. Results from qualitative interviews reveal that adoptive parents position and discuss their child’s ethnic identity in light of their family identity by emphasizing similarity, embracing diversity, or blending ethnic identities. Findings also suggest adoptive parents often undergo a transformation, whereby there has been some change in self after adopting their child. However, this anticipated or enacted change often produces ambivalence. Lastly, adoptive parents utilize six strategies to negotiate ethnic differences: narrating, naming, ritualizing, discussing, normalizing, and praising. Findings advance transracial adoptive family research, discourse-dependency theorizing, and intergroup theorizing.",Interpersonal Communication in Nontraditional Contexts,Interpersonal Communication

Despite extensive research into the economic ramifications, motivations, and adaptation of migrants, little attention is given to how these individuals access and receive social support. This study investigates the strategies, particularly those enabled by communication technology, that migrant women use to access support. In-depth interviews (N = 35) with migrant women living in the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, CA and Seattle, WA were conducted. Analysis of these interviews found that migrant women engage with a spectrum of strategies and services, which are contextually bound. We discuss when these strategies are successful and when they break down. Moments of breakdown not only underscore the contextual nature of support, but also highlight a need for examination of social support as layered, as well as further research on migration and social support.",Interpersonal Communication in Nontraditional Contexts,Interpersonal Communication

However, little is known about the supportive messages agents intend to provide their female clients. The optimal matching model of social support is used to frame this study, which investigates the precursors to probation and parole agents’ intent to send different types of social support messages to the women they supervise. Results indicated that supervising agents intended to provide informational support in the form suggestions or advice, esteem support in the form of compliments, and emotional support in the form of encouragement.

Meanwhile, researchers have continued to be interested in the potential effects of media on public opinion. Through the lens of cultivation theory, this paper seeks to examine the potential media role in creating anti-immigrant and anti-EU attitudes in Europe. Using data from 20 different European countries, a serial mediation model and multi-level analysis are conducted to examine media influence and the perception of a mean world on anti-immigrant and anti-EU attitudes. Findings show an indirect effect from television on anti-EU attitudes mediated via anti-immigrant feelings and mean world.

The present investigation experimentally tests the potential effects of exposure to content that intersects immigration and crime on White viewers’ judgments of an undocumented immigrant suspected of a crime. Applying assumptions from social identity theory, the role of attitudes toward immigration (as a mediator) and ingroup identity (as a moderator) in this context were also tested. Results indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening criminal immigration coverage outgroup bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing for undocumented immigrants. Further, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and ingroup identification partially mediate and moderate this relationship, respectively.

2017-0921,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Privacy Mechanisms on Self-Disclosure and Success in Web Search,2,"Web search can be considered a cognitive process that is partially externalized to the search engine. More private modes of browsing should then enhance the psychological privacy of this process (Burgoon, 1989). Searchers confronted with tasks touching sensitive issues should be less inhibited in their search when in the “in private” mode and achieve better search results.
We tested these hypotheses in a 2x2 experiment. Students (N=107) searched the Web for issues relevant to either their personal lives or society at large. They were invited to either open the browser in a “private browsing”-mode or log into their facebook accounts before searching. Self-disclosure through search was coded quantitatively on the basis of screencam recordings. Findings partially confirm the disinhibiting effect of the privacy mode and its positive effect on search success, but also reveal a contrary effect mediated by situational privacy self-efficacy.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 3,Communication and Technology

An online survey (quota system) among German users (n = 250, 123 female) and non-users (n = 252, 134 female) of wearable technologies was conducted. The results suggest that even though privacy concerns are formed as a result of reception of mass medi-ated and interpersonal communication, privacy concerns are not related to adoption inten-tion or frequency of use.

We argue that especially in the search engine context, additional recipient-perceived factors—namely, perceived credibility and perceived ease of use—and the search engine ranking may influence selection decisions to an equal or even higher degree, as users want to fulfil their informational needs with credible (i.e., presumably correct) or convenient (i.e., easy to find) information. To address this research interest, we developed an online experiment containing a search task with a Google-like stimulus and a questionnaire measuring individual search result perceptions.

2017-0930,2017,Paper Session,Association Between Social Network Structure and Brain Connectivity During Social Exclusion,8,"Social ties are crucial for humans and their disruption has a strong negative impact: When friends exclude us from communication or interaction, this markedly affects our thoughts and feelings. However, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use fMRI data from 80 adolescents to investigate how exclusion modulates connectivity within brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others. Furthermore, using social network analysis of friendship networks, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to exclusion might shape social network structures, as indexed by the density of facebook friendship networks. We find that computer-mediated exclusion prompts increased connectivity within regions of the mentalizing system. Furthermore, participants who show greater changes in connectivity when socially excluded had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight how brain systems respond to virtual exclusion, and how such brain dynamics may shape social networks.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories I",Information Systems

We used neuroimaging and natural language classifiers to test how valence of online recommendations can propagate, leading to opinion change. Recommendations higher in negativity were more influential in engaging processes in the brain associated with taking the perspective of others (i.e., ‘mentalizing’), but not within limbic regions implicated in processing lower level affect. Further, increased neural activity in both amygdala and mentalizing systems were significant predictors of opinion change in the recipient. Broadly, these results highlight the importance of both lower level brain systems as well as higher level cognitive systems in opinion change. These results further provide new insight into how negative information spreads and the underlying psychological and neurocognitive processes involved.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories I",Information Systems
2017-0932,2017,Paper Session,Extended Cognition in Communication,1,"Advances in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics are once again bringing forward the question of intelligence. However, while many view intelligence and cognition as inherently human, they often list factors such as scale, speed, and autonomy. Likewise in terms of cognition, factors such as encoding, storage, and retrieval have long been a sort of gold standard, with dual-systems models describing the processing of that information. This paper takes an approach based on empirical data, applied research projects, and some philosophy, that the relationship humans have with information needs to be conceptualized in a dynamic or extended manner. While controversial, it a dynamic approach to information puts right and center the study of communication, and may aid in explaining some of the more difficult “black box” mysteries that have been difficult to replicate in practice based on traditional cognition models.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories I",Information Systems
2017-0933,2017,Paper Session,Reconceptualizing Cultivation: Implications for Testing Relationships Between Fiction Exposure And Self-Reported Alcohol Use Evaluations,1,"The present paper responds to calls for conceptual clarification in the media effects domain by providing a definition for attitudinal cultivation effects. Our definition contains five core characteristics: the (1) linear effects of (2) repeated media exposure on (3) the evaluation as given by memory associations (4) strengthened by and (5) valenced in line with those media messages. We reason that, when accepting this definition, the cultivation hypothesis predicts effects of repeated media use on evaluations to primarily occur at the level of ‘gut evaluations’ given by automatically activated memory associations. Corroborating this logic for the effects of alcohol use portrayals in television fiction, we find the relationship between fiction exposure and self-reported alcohol use evaluations to be (1) moderated by speed of expressing those evaluations, and (2) mediated by responses to self-reports tapping into gut feelings. The implications of these findings for future media effects studies are discussed.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories I",Information Systems

However, it was found that the original definition of digital divide (the gap on access) and the second level of digital divide are not enough to explain digital inequality. More focus should be put on digital inclusion, especially on the outcomes that resulted from using the Internet (the third-level digital divide). Starting from here, this study examines factors affecting how Internet users take use of the Internet and develops a theory of digital inclusion, with a focus on the outcomes of Internet use. We focus on using the Internet for civic participation, online banking, and online learning, because these three are critical for a person to be fully included in the digital society. A survey was conducted by applying social cognitive theory for Internet adoption. The results showed that enactive learning and education are the keys for shortening the third-level digital divides.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories I",Information Systems

Children’s expression of the four emotions varied as a function of parental approval of the child’s expression, and of children’s appreciation of TV characters showing these emotions. Media influences on the children’s expressiveness were smaller than parental influences for happiness, sadness, and fear, but larger for anger. A multilevel model including country level individualism-collectivism further suggests that these influence patterns are largely consistent across cultures except that the expression of happiness was more likely in more individualistic countries. These findings suggest that parental and media influences on children’s emotional development appear to be less contingent on culture-specific emotion expressiveness than is often suggested by the literature.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0937,2017,Paper Session,Parents’ Active Engagement Mediates the Impact of Background TV on Toddlers’ Play,3,"Background TV (BTV) negatively affects the quantity and quality of toddlers’ toy play and parent-child interactions. The purpose of the current study was to consider these two outcomes simultaneously using an ecological-systems approach by examining the extent to which parent engagement mediates the impact of BTV on children’s play. Toddlers (12-36 mos, N = 51) played in a comfortably furnished observation lab. Parents were instructed to act as they normally would during leisure time. For one half-hour, an adult-directed television program played in the background; for the other half-hour, the television was off. Findings reveal an indirect negative effect of BTV on the proportion of time that children played with toys, which was completely mediated by parents’ active engagement in toy play with their children. These findings further emphasize the importance of considering the social context in which media exposure occurs.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0938,2017,Paper Session,Exploring Descriptive Norms of Parent-Child Communication About Pornography Among Parents of Middle-Schoolers,1,"Exposure to pornography is becoming a reality for many adolescents. Open, frequent, and direct communication about pornography between parents and children is needed, yet few investigations have explored this area. In aims of providing groundwork for future parent-child pornography communication explorations, I used Rimal and Real’s (2005) theory of normative social behavior (TNSB) to conduct 33 in-depth interviews with parents of at least one middle-school-aged child. Interviews focused on descriptive norms related to societal beliefs about pornography, pornography’s impact on adolescents, and the courses of actions that most parents undertake when adolescents are exposed to pornography. Articulated perceptions suggest that most parents view adolescent exposure to pornography as negative although exposure to pornography is becoming more normative for adolescents. Obstacles such as parental fear, discomfort, and a lack in sexual and technological communication openness/knowledge were conveyed. Recommendations related to strengthening parental education about pornography and the importance of overall positive parent-child relationships are offered.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0939,2017,Paper Session,Coming Attractions: Parental Mediation Responses to Sexuality and Gender Identity Film Trailer Content Targeting Adolescents,2,"Parents vigilantly mediate their children’s exposure to advertising messages, but research in this area has largely focused on advertisements that are passively received. The present study examines parents’ responses to film trailers, advertisements that are actively sought out by youth. Given the research that asserts that children seek out media for socialization and identity exploration and confirmation as they emerge into adolescence, this study specifically sought to identify parents’ mediation intentions in response to film trailers that promote themes of sexual and gender development and are aimed at adolescents. Respondents participated in a survey experiment where they viewed a trailer that featured either a gender-normative or transgender coming-of-age story and responded to cognitive, emotional, and attitudinal measures. Results identified both parent and child factors that influence parents’ mediation intentions and support for censorship. Practical implications in both parenting and marketing are further discussed.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0940,2017,Paper Session,"The Relation Between Parental Control, Mediation Strategies and Children’s Exposure to Televised Embedded Sexual Content",2,"The dramatic increase in embedded sexual content on television greatly enhances the probability of exposure and negative consequences for children and adolescents. Parents’ perceived level of control regarding television viewing and potential exposure to embedded sexual content may substantially impact the use of parental mediation behaviors. To explore this relationship, the authors administered an online survey to parents (N = 121, 80.9% female). The results demonstrated parental control is positively associated with both active and restrictive parental mediation. In addition, active mediation serves as a mediator between parental control and increased exposure to embedded sexual content. Conversely, restrictive mediation serves as a mediator between parental control and reduced exposure to embedded sexual content. The statistical analysis failed to review a statistically significant relationship between coviewing and parental control or parental mediation. The results of the study suggest parent’s perceptions regarding their ability to control children’s level of exposure to embedded sexual content is indicative of their decision to employ parental mediation strategies. Such actions may impact future levels of exposure and subsequent consequences.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0941,2017,Paper Session,The Role of Self-Efficacy in Parental Mediation of Children's Smartphone Use,1,"This study examines how different types of self-efficacy—media competency, perceived parenting abilities, and perceived control over parental mediation practices—influence the extent to which parents mediate their children’s use of smartphones. A survey conducted with parents of young smartphone users aged 10-17 reveals that parents who feel confident about their own smartphone skills, view themselves as good parents, and believe that they have control over their parental mediation practices are more likely to engage in parental mediation of children’s smartphone use. The findings also indicate that when parents are less confident about their smartphone skills, those with higher parenting competencies are more likely to engage in discussion-based active mediation than are those with lower parenting competencies.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0942,2017,Paper Session,The Role of Storytelling Agents in Suicidal Ideation: South Korean Adolescents’ Experience,3,"The present study is focused on the role of daily communication practices both online and offline in suicidal ideation in South Korean adolescents. From communication infrastructure, social support, and negative interactions perspectives, what storytelling agents were related to either increased or decreased suicidal ideation was examined. Data were collected from 300 high school students from a national respondent panel. The results show that local media and personal communication (e.g., texting, phone calls) are positive predictors of increased suicidal ideation, whereas family communication decreases it. Negative face-to-face interactions moderated the relationship between personal communication and increased suicide preparation. This study suggests that increased family communication with adolescents can reduce suicidal ideation. Local media campaigns about suicide prevention and appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) use for supportive communication may decrease suicidal ideation among South Korean adolescents.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0943,2017,Paper Session,Parental Versus Peer Mediation in Relationship to Adolescent Girls’ Motives for Adventure-Fantasy Media Use,2,"Productions in the adventure-fantasy media (AFM) genre like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones have proven to be of significant interest to adolescents worldwide, both in print and in electronic screen forms. An online survey among 912 Dutch adolescent women aged 21 to 25 years explored (a) the interest these women had in AFM during their high school and college years, (b) their motives for using AFM, and (c) how peers, siblings and parents mediated their AFM use. Results showed that Dutch adolescent girls were interested in two types of AFM: (1) productions around the protagonist’s personal growth and conflicts (PCM) and (2) the protagonist’s social conflicts (SCM). Diversion was a highly important motive and predicted PCM and SCM use. Adolescent girls‘ need for Social bonding, Style, and Inspiration only related to PCM use. Finally, AFM use was mediated in three styles: (1) affirmative active, (2) dissenting active, and (3) restrictive. Parents employed all styles, but in an absolute sense peers not only superseded parents on active affirmative, but also on dissenting mediation, and even showed low ratings of restrictive mediation. In a relative sense, affirmative peer mediation was more strongly related to all motives for using AFM, in particular Social bonding.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0944,2017,Paper Session,Who Has Greater Influence on Teenagers’ Internet Addiction and Risky Online Activities? Parents or Peers?,4,"There are different schools of thoughts on the influence of peers on teenagers, whether peers compete with or complement the influence of parents. This paper explores these dynamics in teenagers’ Internet addiction and risky online activities using a stratified random survey of 2,000 Malaysian school children between 13 and 15 years. After controlling for age and gender, Partial Least Square Equation analysis found that peer-attachment is significant for teenagers’ risky online activities but not parent-attachment. For teenagers’ addiction to the internet, peer-attachment competes with parent-attachment; parent-attachment reduces the addiction, while peer-attachment increases it. Overall, the results reveal that to counteract the negative influence of peers, parents need to play an active role in mediating children online activities.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0945,2017,Paper Session,Looking Through Rose-Colored Glasses: How Constructive News and Peer-Discussion Influence Children’s Reactions to News,4,"Although watching news is important for children, it may also harm their well-being. This study, therefore, examined whether applying insights from positive psychology to news production can reduce negative emotional responses to news and also encourages prosocial intentions. Moreover, the moderating role of peer-discussion is explored. 336 children (9-13 years old) participated in an experiment in which they were exposed to either constructive (solution-based news including positive emotions) or non-constructive negative news. Findings showed that constructive news reduced negative emotions and led to a smaller decrease in positive emotions. Moreover, discussing the news with peers led to enhanced emotional responses among children who watched the non-constructive newscast, and to more prosocial intentions among children who watched constructive news. These findings indicate that both constructive reporting of news and peer-discussion can function as tools to make negative news less harmful for children and to increase their prosocial intentions.","Powerful Parents, Powerful Peers?

2017-0946,2017,Paper Session,Lost at the Digital Frontier: Opportunities and Challenges of Mining Twitter for Communication Practices,4,"Twitter research has become a burgeoning site for a range of communication practices. However, barriers exist that challenge data collection and mining for the non-technological savvy researcher. Moreover, research practices of online research have become isolated from discussions of modes of interpretations. This paper reports on the socio-technical challenges and opportunities of conducting social media research to examine social phenomena on Twitter. We present a comprehensive intervention to conduct non-reductionistic Twitter research by combining existing technological approaches of Twitter research with a mainstay of communication practice - content analysis. This paper demonstrates that analyzing Twitter takes a certain degree of software sophistication and coordination to observe individual-level opinions but can be very manageable. This approach demonstrates the need to consider sampling strategies and the ethics of reporting Twitter research. Implications for designing social-media-based empirical research are discussed to critique current practices and to offer productive future avenues of research.","Twitter, Big Data, and the Web",Communication and Technology
2017-0947,2017,Paper Session,Obamacare and Political Polarization on Twitter: An Application of Machine Learning and Social Network Analysis,9,"This study investigates political polarization in the Twitter conversation about the Affordable Care Act. Using the Twitter Gardenhose API, we collected over 300,000 tweets over three different periods in 2012 when ""Obamacare"" received national news coverage. This sample ranged from the day the Supreme Court announced it would hear the Obamacare case through the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Using supervised machine learning methods, we classified Twitter users' political orientation based on text features used in their tweets and profile descriptions. In addition to political orientation, we distinguished members of the public from members of the elite based on Twitter’s verified status and follower count. We assessed retweet networks, which revealed highly polarized clusters of liberals and conservatives. However, levels of polarization were not uniform across time or across Twitter users. In the earlier time periods, conversations between the groups demonstrate substantial cross-cutting, but these cross-cutting links disappeared and the network became more polarized near election day, showing signs of party-sorting. Furthermore, the elites and the public interacted differently within the network. Our findings suggest the role of the grassroots conservative movement on Twitter for promoting anti-Obamacare agenda and also highlight the role of mainstream media and journalists in bridging the divide between the two ideological groups. The implications of machine learning and social network analysis to political communication research are discussed.","Twitter, Big Data, and the Web",Communication and Technology
2017-0948,2017,Paper Session,Television Debate Response Network on Twitter: Exploring #Equalpay,1,"This study examines the Twitter response network for the Democratic Primary Debate on February 11, 2016 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee using the hashtag “equalpay”. This hashtag was used to discuss gender pay equity, which has been a standpoint of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. The results indicated the majority of Twitter users engaged with the debate using a mobile phone and Twitter.com. The measures of betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and PageRank were used to examine influential actors. This study provides an important insight into the involvement of women’s rights organizations, political candidates, and citizens using hashtags for political engagement. The network structure shows nearly half of the actors were not connected to the giant component, showing a disconnect from the influencers. Understanding the relationships between actors in the network helps understand the framework of collective action in a hashtag network.","Twitter, Big Data, and the Web",Communication and Technology

We develop (1) measures gauging distinct aspects of attention and (2) a rationale differentiating website formats along two dimensions: the mode of content generation and the curatorial spectrum ranging from e-retailers, content producers, and portals to social networks and search engines. We analyze attention to the world’s 850 most popular sites at three time points from a global Internet usage panel and determine their website formats using human coding. Our findings reveal that, for attention building, Internet’s home brew curatorial formats take precedence over traditional media’s mechanisms. Furthermore, websites driven by user-generated content bridge disparate clusters comprised of websites commonly used together.","Twitter, Big Data, and the Web",Communication and Technology
2017-0950,2017,Paper Session,Linking Development (Maendeleo) and Mobile Telephony in Marakwet Kenya,1,"The debate about the link between adoption of mobile telephony and broad based development is without a doubt both novel and curious. On one hand mobile telephony is taunted to facilitate broad based development (Waverman et al., 2007) while on the other hand impeding development. For instance, when monies intended for matters development are misappropriated, such that money meant to purchase farm produce is diverted to pay for talk time or buy local brew instead (Komen, 2014). In other words it is at best counterproductive. The adoption is backed up by impressive mobile phone penetration rates in developing world however, not much empirical research exists to show the link between these penetration rates and claim for development. With the help of assemblage theory as conceptualised by DeLanda (2006), this research observed that there was no direct correlation between mobile phone adoption and development even though there was evidence of the good that mobile phone had brought. It also noted that the term development, locally dubbed ‘Maendeleo’ was a hybrid of the two kinds of development hence necessitating a new kind. The research advocates for development as a social assemblage.

A large panel dataset of 500 mobile applications over eight weeks were collected from the Chinese iOS app market. Regression analysis was conducted and the results showed there is a positive and significant effect of the number of accumulated users on the subsequent increment of users for an application, which confirmed the bandwagon effect in user selection of mobile applications.

Responding to such limitation, the present study investigated longitudinal causality associations among loneliness, problematic use of smartphone, face-to-face interaction, smartphone-mediated communication and need for social assurance with cross-lagged panel models. The results suggest that loneliness leads to problematic use of smartphone, which reduces face-to-face interaction while increasing need for social assurance. However, need for social assurance fueled by excessive smartphone use is usually not gratified, and eventually leads to greater loneliness.",Mobile Adoption and Use,Communication and Technology

Meanwhile, the importance of covering human rights related issues has also increased in recent years, which often includes events that span across many borders. This study looks at how the social system influences the gatekeeping process of six traditional and three emerging transnational news organizations. A content analysis and in-depth interviews were conducted to measure power distance and individualism vs. collectivism. Results indicate both national cultural and journalistic norms influence the gatekeeping process. Overall, emerging news sources had lower power distance and higher collectivism. Whereas, Xinhua and Al Jazeera were not as collectivist as expected and all traditional sources were high in power distance. Positive sentiment was also higher for traditional sources, but Xinhua was the most positive of all coverage.",What's Deciding News: Journalistic Practices,Mass Communication

The model identifies five distinct knowledge brokering functions through which news media regulate the flow of policy-relevant knowledge to and from policy actors as well as the specific activities that enable news media to perform each function. It is suggested that by performing these functions, news media facilitate or impede the capacity, motivation, and opportunities of policy actors to engage with policy-relevant information and knowledge. As a consequence, they are also able to dynamically influence the focus, emphasis, and trajectory of the policy discourse around issues which ultimately determines the scope, nature, and pace of policy change.",What's Deciding News: Journalistic Practices,Mass Communication

The research is more broadly framed within mediatization theory and aims to explore the relationship of increased media logic in journalistic practices (Kammer 2013; Kunelius 2014) with specific digital mediascapes. Journalism is known to be culturally specific in historical terms (Chalaby 1996), and cross-country studies show differences in journalistic milieus in different political regimes (Hanitzch 2011). Journalistic practices are here seen as influenced by the structural framework of the media system defined as digital mediascapes (AUTHORS 2015). 2012-2015 Worlds of Journalism Study data are used for influences on journalism.

Due to its unusually broad audience and unusual configuration of characters, this film offers a valuable opportunity to investigate how familiarity with characters, viewer-character similarity in relation to gender, and character morality relate to these dimensions of audience response. Viewers reported stronger PSR and identification with the more familiar, “older” characters from the original trilogy, although the association with identification was limited to older participants. Star Wars fanship was associated with identification and PSR of old and new characters. Familiarity with the original films was associated with PSR and with identification with the older characters.

Two of the most ubiquitous relationships through which we experience the world -- and, therefore, create and alter our perceptions about it – are those that are interpersonal and mediated. Thus, it is critical that researchers examine how these two diverse relationship forms could be influencing how the other is experienced. Here, we develop a model of mediated balance for the purpose of accomplishing these aims. We assess support for this model within the framework of two separate mediated relationship manifestations: fandom and parasocial. Though these relationship types may be linked, their usage has often suffered from a lack of conceptual and empirical distinction. Subsequent to an administration of a computer survey, our analyses revealed evidence supporting our model expectations. Additionally, our findings demonstrate an empirical distinction between the parasocial relationship and fandom concepts.

The present study proposes affective polarization as mediator to explain the relationship between partisan media use and increased political misperception. Using a three-wave panel survey data collected in the United States, this study tests an indirect effect of partisan media use on political misperception, mediated by affective polarization. Results indicate that those who use partisan media more frequently tend to favor their in-party candidate more relative to the out-party candidate, and that, at least among Republicans, the increased gap between in- and out-party candidate favorabilities affect the subsequent acceptance of false claims about the out-party candidates.",Media Influences on Political Polarization,Political Communication

News media and journalists tend to focus on political conflicts between major parties. Does this news reporting behavior encourage the psychological processes of polarization? By linking framing theory with social identity and self-categorization, this study explores how news frames affect political polarization through party identification processes. The results of an experimental study showed that political conflict news frame can accentuate party identity salience and that such salience is a key factor in explaining partisans’ political polarization over an issue. Political conflict news frame plays an important role as a contextual/situational factor that momentarily increases people’s political identity salience, resulting in perceptual and attitudinal political polarization.

We examine the pattern of co-following among Twitter users following members of the 18th Korean National Assembly at three time points. We collected a complete list of all followers for each legislator and constructed their co-following network. We also supplemented our following data with survey data. This allowed us to match the same Twitter user’s following behavior with their individual level attributes. Our aggregate level analysis showed that the severity of polarization in Twitter following of National Assembly members lessened from Time 1 to Time 3. We also discovered that, even when tracking only the ‘original’ followers, cross-party following has increased over time.

We match individual-level data from a representative 4-wave panel survey with content data on the amount of coverage about the EU in numerous news outlets. We show that strongly opinionated citizens exposed to news about the EU polarize following mere exposure, and that the affective and identity-related dimensions of EU attitudes polarize more than the more specific dimensions. Moreover, polarization emerges among strong EU supporters and opponents alike. These results extend the polarization literature to naturalistic settings and suggest that polarizing effects of the media may be greater than previously acknowledged.",Media Influences on Political Polarization,Political Communication

While this practice has begun to be studied, past research presents multicommunicating as a choice that people make when they use technology at work. This study leveraged field observations and interviews to investigate the multicommunicating practices of front-line workers in a medical clinic, called Medical Admitting Clerks (MACs). We found that multicommunicating is a normalized part of MACs’ job and is broadly imposed upon them without training. Several factors complicated MACs’ multicommunicating practices, such as job duties, work demands, communication technologies, and workspaces. MACs generally perceived multicommunicating as a stressful routine, which could improve productivity yet also led to concerns of incivility during MAC-patient interactions. To cope with the negative impact of multicommunicating, MACs deliberately utilized multiple strategies, including adaptation, reframing, and teamwork.

2017-0969,2017,Paper Session,The Relationship Between Workplace Flexibility and Engagement Through Helping: The Buffering Effect of Technology Use,2,"Due to communication technologies, many employees are offered flexibility in workplace and time. Working from different timeslots and from different locations could lead to fewer encounters between employees, negatively influencing helping behavior. However, using communication technologies for work could enhance contact between employees and increase their helping behavior. Since helping behavior is found to be beneficial for both the recipients of help and the helpers themselves, it is assumed this will eventually influence employee engagement. Using a two-wave panel study, we examined the indirect relationship between flexible work designs (FWDs) and engagement, through helping behavior. Then, we studied whether the use of communication technologies can buffer the expected negative associations between spatial and temporal flexibility and helping behavior. The results show that spatial flexibility is detrimental for helping behavior, which reduces engagement.

Utilizing narrative persuasion and P.O. fit theory, through an online experiment, results indicate that narrative and story-like job ads produce higher levels of fit and intent to apply compared to traditional ads. The findings of this study elaborate on a reconceptualization of cybervetting during the recruitment process as companies are targeted by job seekers. Implications for P.O. fit and narrative persuasion, cybervetting development, and directions for future research are also discussed.",Communication at Work,Organizational Communication
2017-0971,2017,Paper Session,Trust in Cancer Health Information Seeking,5,"Our paper extends channel complementarity theory, which has focused on evidence of complementarity and patterns of channel use, by elucidating the notion of trust complementarity. We applied and extended channel complementarity theory, incorporating trust, a core construct in health-focused decision-making to better understand cancer information seeking, based on two studies from nationally representative surveys in Singapore. Trust is found to be differential, relational, and ecological, with implications for individuals’ access to and reliance on doctors, family/friends, newspapers/magazines, radio, TV, and the Internet. We identified two types of trust ecologies shaped by dual-channel and polymorphic complementarity patterns that suggest information seekers are trapped within specific trust ecologies, preventing them from navigating a broader range of communication channels.",Communication Across the Cancer Continuum,Health Communication
2017-0972,2017,Paper Session,"BRCA Mutation Carriers’ Understanding, Adjustment, and Response to Cancer Risk",7,"Risks for breast and ovarian cancer are increased for women who inherit a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Although risk estimates are communicated to women during genetic counseling, mutation carriers’ understanding of and responses to cancer risks is not clear. Data from this qualitative study (N=20) show that carriers had an accurate understanding of their cancer risk and could recall estimates provided by their genetic counselor, even several years following counseling. Still, for some women, the feeling of risk was higher than the number provided in genetic counseling. Risk perceptions were shaped by mutation carrier status, family history and family experiences. Whereas family history provided a quantitative indictor of cancer susceptibility, family experiences provided a qualitative indicator of cancer severity that formed perceptions of risk. Risk perceptions also appear to motivate women to make decisions regarding risk-reduction surgery and influence decisions to engage in surveillance and prevention behaviors.",Communication Across the Cancer Continuum,Health Communication
2017-0973,2017,Paper Session,Identifying Communication Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Adherence Among Appalachian Kentuckians,6,"Utilizing data from 40 in-depth interviews, this article identifies both barriers and facilitators to colorectal screening guideline adherence among Appalachian Kentucky adults recruited through a community-based research network. Key findings identify (a) varying levels of knowledge about screening guidelines, (b) reticence to engage in screening processes, and (c) nuanced communication with healthcare providers and family members regarding screening adherence. What participants knew about the screening process was often derived from personal stories or recalled stories from family members about their screening experiences. Reticence to engage in screening processes reflected reports of cumbersome preparation, privacy issues, embarrassment, medical mistrust, fear of receiving a cancer diagnosis, and lack of symptoms. Participants cited many ways to enhance patient-centered communication, and the findings from this study have implications for health communication message design and communication strategies for healthcare practices in Appalachian Kentucky clinics.

2017-0974,2017,Paper Session,Preventing Adverse Information Effects: Self-Affirmation Improved Cognitive Performance and Diminished Problem Reporting for Cancer Patients,4,"Information about chemotherapy-related cognitive decline can increase cognitive problem reporting (CPR) and decrease cognitive performance in cancer patients. The current study tested whether a self-affirmation intervention reduced these adverse information effects (AIE).
90 gastrointestinal cancer patients with and without chemotherapy experience were randomized across three experimental conditions. One group (n = 29) received the introduction that ‘some patients treated with chemotherapy experience memory and concentration problems’. The second group (n = 31) received the same information, but first completed a self-affirmation exercise. The no-information control group received a neutral introduction (n = 30). Main dependent variables were CPR and verbal memory performance. Stigma consciousness was included as a moderator.
Being informed about chemotherapy-related cognitive problems increased CPR and decreased delayed recall and recognition for gastrointestinal cancer patients. Self-affirmation reduced these AIE. Stigma consciousness was no risk factor.
Findings suggest that self-affirmation may be effective in reducing AIE in patient populations.",Communication Across the Cancer Continuum,Health Communication
2017-0975,2017,Paper Session,The Role of Health Literacy and Numeracy in Health Behavior: Considerations for Message Design for Cancer Survivors,2,"With more survivors living five years or longer past their initial diagnosis, the reduction of comorbidities and increase in quality among cancer survivors has become a key public health issue (Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). Within the field of communication, cancer survivors remain under studied despite communication disparities that exist within this population. Cancer survivors may be more likely to experience issues with health literacy, and this could influence treatment compliance and lifestyle behaviors during survivorship (Reyna, Nelson, Han, Dieckmann, 2009). Theoretical linkages between health literacy and health outcomes remain relatively unclear despite numerous studies in multiple health domains that suggest that health literacy affects health behavior (Berkman, et al., 2011). The purpose of this study was to test the self-care pathway of the Pasche-Orlow & Wolf model of health literacy which suggests that health literacy predicts self-care behaviors, which in turn influence health outcomes (2007). Cancer survivors (N = 211) were surveyed using an online platform. Results suggested that indicators of SES predicted numeracy, but not health literacy. Additionally, measures of numeracy acted as a better predictor of self-care behavior than did a general measure of health literacy. Finally, physical activity had an indirect effect mediating the relationship between numeracy and quality of life. Findings suggest that the numeracy component of health literacy should be considered when designing messages for cancer survivors.",Communication Across the Cancer Continuum,Health Communication

Yet, despite reasons to predict social norms might function differently in non-Western contexts, few studies have tested the theory outside of the U.S. The current study tests the predictions of the theory of normative social behavior in a Korean sample and examines the role of behavioral privacy, a variable thought activate face concerns, as a moderator of the norm-behavior relationship. The study findings show that the descriptive norm-behavior relationship is moderated by perceived privacy and outcome expectations but that the nature of the interaction is opposite to that commonly found in the U.S. samples; implications for normative theory are discussed.",Testing Theories of Health Behavior Prediction in Novel Contexts,Health Communication

The current study presents data from a larger project to develop an intervention to promote safer sex when hooking up. Using the integrated model of behavioral prediction (IMBP) as a theoretical foundation, we first conducted elicitation research with focus groups of undergraduate students (N = 33) to identify salient attitudinal, normative, and perceived control beliefs that informed questionnaire development. We then analyzed questionnaire data from a different undergraduate student sample (N = 268) to explore the direct and indirect determinants that drive hookup behaviors. We compared proposed models that tested separate paths from determinants to intention and behavior and theoretical models that treated intention as a mediator of the determinant-behavior relationship. Results indicate that both in the proposed and theoretical models, direct and indirect attitudes were the strongest predictors of intentions and behavior. In addition, in the proposed model using direct measures of determinants, perceived norms and perceived difficulty predicted behavior, and in the theoretical model using direct measures of determinants, intention predicted behavior. Positive attitude beliefs were consistently and significantly correlated with both intention and behavior, while only select normative and control beliefs were so correlated. Finally, although the data fit both the proposed and theoretical models, the proposed models provided a more accurate fit. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our results, and we offer directions for future research.",Testing Theories of Health Behavior Prediction in Novel Contexts,Health Communication

Media exposure is often used as an important predictor to understand young people’s sexual health related outcomes, yet there is not enough knowledge about how media influences young people’s intentions to consent/refuse unwanted sex. The current study uses integrative model of behavioral prediction to explore the determinants of college students’ intentions to refuse unwanted sex. Particularly, the present study separates passive media exposure and active information seeking as two types of media exposure. Survey data were collected from 310 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. Findings suggested that media exposure, rape myth acceptance, perceived norms, and self-efficacy are all associated with college students’ intentions to negotiate sexual consent. It also points out the importance of testing the effects of media exposure through its influence on mediators such as rape myth acceptance, perceived norms, and self-efficacy.",Testing Theories of Health Behavior Prediction in Novel Contexts,Health Communication

Consumers age 25-44 who live in the United States and who eat meat approximately once a day were eligible to participate in the study. One hundred fifty-three consumers were recruited from a national survey pool to complete two surveys. The Time 1 survey measured attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions to eat less meat over the next week. Seven days later, the Time 2 survey measured the extent to which consumers reduced their meat consumption. The results indicated that consumers had somewhat positive attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions toward eating less meat. They were somewhat likely to engage in the actual behavior of eating less meat over the timeframe in question. Although the data fit both the TRA and TPB, the TPB had a better model fit and greater predictive power. These findings can be used to guide the development of messages for health campaigns that seek to encourage consumers to eat less meat, thereby reducing the incidence of health problems such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity.",Testing Theories of Health Behavior Prediction in Novel Contexts,Health Communication

For adolescents and young adults, however, self-management is a daunting task and many struggle to control their disease. This two-phase study uses a mixed-method approach, intended as formative research, to develop effective management messages targeting adolescents and young adults who have Type 1 diabetes. The first phase consisted of three small focus groups (N=11) with questions guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Findings included a preference for attitude- and norms-based messages presented with exemplars. For the second phase, a 2 message style (exemplar/directive) X 3 TPB-based appeal (attitude, norms, PBC) between-subjects factorial design experiment with a control condition was conducted with Type 1 diabetics between the ages of 12-22 (N=142).

Briefly put, the concept is meant to refer to the materialization of transmediality into a landscape of media platforms and augmented places, and routes between these. We apply the notion of transmediascape to an actual case of cultural production within the music domain, a marketing campaign by boyband One Direction, with the specific intent to make manifest the ways in which consumers are invited into these landscapes as co-producers, or, as is our outlook here, as free labor. In doing so, we are ultimately able to enter into a critical discussion about the power dynamics that play out between different agents involved in the making of transmediascapes.",Labor in Media Industries,Media Industry Studies

In the past decade, “bug bounty” programs—programs that pay security researchers for newly discovered software bugs—have become commonplace. This paper focuses on the participants in these programs. The paper argues that security researchers are becoming increasingly important to the production of secure software tools and web-services, while remaining in an economically and legally precarious position. The paper highlights the contribution that a poorly understood labor force contributes to the production and refinement of software and web-services (both of which are, themselves, platforms for creativity); it identifies the ways in which the integration of security researchers into the software development lifecycle mirrors (and in some cases departs from) other larger transformations of labor; and it considers the implications (and limitations) of considering the work of security researchers as a key element or contribution to creative expression.",Labor in Media Industries,Media Industry Studies

To be more specific, how internet users are seemingly voluntarily but fundamentally compulsorily involved and articulated into the production process, which individualizes the exploitation of informational capitalism; how affect has become a force of self-valorization that can reward the labour itself by embodying feeling in the form of and for the purpose of expressing and sharing feeling; how relation has become an unintentional intentionality that emerges from a bidirectional process of production. The inquiry into these concrete questions focuses on the complex dynamics of the transforming process through which internet users become immaterial and affective labour, rather than taking the concept for granted as a consequence and necessary fait accompli.",Labor in Media Industries,Media Industry Studies

Our findings advance the first two phases of Ramirez et al.’s (2002) conceptual model of social information seeking in CMC and new media. The study utilized a nationally representative sample of 316 participants who indicated that they had previous experience with online dating. Results indicated that personal qualities are generally associated with increased use of ISS and reliance on gut reaction. Perceptions of honesty and perceived homophily between the profile creator and the profile viewer were associated with use of ISS, but not associated with people’s reliance on their gut reaction. Additionally, the sex of the profile viewer and the perceived physical attraction of the person in the profile interact with the other predictor variables outlined herein to produce effects on ISS and on people’s use of their gut feelings.",Interpersonal Message Framing and Interperatation,Interpersonal Communication
2017-0986,2017,Paper Session,We Are How We Post: Implications of Disclosure Publicness and Directedness in Social Perceptions on SNS,2,"SNS users often define their communication context by manipulating a message’s publicness and directedness, leaving behavioral traces for observers to interpret. This study investigated how publicness and directedness of a Facebook post influence the way observes make attributions and perceptions of self-disclosure in terms of message intimacy level and message sender’s social attraction. 242 participants took this online experiment. Results show as the publicness of a post increased, observers made more dispositional attribution about the sender’s impression management intention and manipulative characteristic, self-disclosure was perceived as less intimate, and discloser was perceived as less likable under such dispositional attribution. High message directedness led to more interpersonal attribution, which further enhanced perceived message intimacy and discloser’s social attraction. Disclosure valence moderated influences of publicness and directedness. Specifically, negative self-disclosure on SNS was more associated with social norm violation and was not appreciated to be made public if not directing at anyone.",Interpersonal Message Framing and Interperatation,Interpersonal Communication

This study contributes to such research by exploring the combined influence of motivational factors (i.e., empathy) and cognitive factors (i.e., cognitive complexity, mindfulness) on how people process and evaluate support messages varying in person centeredness. Participants (N = 331) completed a survey and structural equation modeling analyses revealed that both cognitive complexity and empathy predicted the extent to which people differentiated between more and less person-centered messages.

The research questions guiding the study were (1) What are the underlying reasons for IDG team members PI experiences?, and (2) how do IDG members communicatively manage problematic integration? In-depth focus group interviews with four IDGs and two certified nurse assistant teams revealed three major underlying reasons for IDGs PI experiences: patient’s/family’s lack of understanding of the hospice process; cultural and personal beliefs of IDG members; and the interaction between family and patient. The IDGs negotiated problematic integration by educating, building trust and confidence, avoiding sugar coating, using personal examples, employing persuasive language, and not taking sides. Problematic integration theory helps understand the cognitive work that IDG members need to do in order to effectively support and care for hospice patients.",Interpersonal Message Framing and Interperatation,Interpersonal Communication

Interestingly, there are a few online support groups designed for (self-identified) game addicts where they can share social support to overcome their problems associated with compulsive gaming. Assuming compulsive online gaming and online social support are two interrelated aspects of internet uses, the study examines the relationship between offline relational conflicts and online social support of compulsive gamers. By using an online survey of 107 compulsive gamers, the current study found controlling behavior of the partners of compulsive gamers significantly influence relational conflict, which in turn influences gamers to participate in online support groups for game addicts. Compulsive gaming was not directly associated with the support group participation, but online game addict identity mediated between compulsive gaming and the participation in the online support group. By connecting individual’s offline relational dissatisfaction and one’s online support group use, this study offers new insights into the complex nature of compulsive gaming, interpersonal communication, online group dynamics, and social support.",Online Social Support,Communication and Technology

Thus, the voice of Chinese unwed single mothers remains unheard in public discourse in China. Isolated socially offline, many turn to parenting forums as a source for social support. This study examined the role of online social support in the social and well-being of unwed single mothers in China. In particular, the largest online parenting forum that catered to unwed single mother was examined. After filtering out causal talks and other unrelated conversations, 578 initial unwed motherhood related post was narrowed to a total of 76 threads (which included 4892 messages). Findings reveal that all three types of social support: information, emotion, and tangible support were present and exchanged among the members of the discussion board.

While users prefer search results and product options provided by these algorithms because they help them navigate the avalanches of information available online, there is also evidence in research to suggest that these sites lead users to narrow their information- and content-seeking behavior. The authors propose that existing theory is inadequate in describing this phenomenon; and that a derivative theory based on Festinger’s (1957) selective exposure theory may be worth consideration. Therefore, this paper proposes and explicates an extension to Festinger’s framework along with its implications for future research: a second-level selective exposure conceptualization that could account for prior selections and exposures in digital spaces that both enhance and limit future options and choices.",Issues in Selective Exposure Research,Mass Communication

Brands are important in this regard because they simplify decision-making. In the present study, we investigated whether attitudes toward news media brands predict news choice. Importantly, we conceptualized attitudes on two different levels: Whereas explicit attitudes are defined as overtly-expressed, more or less deliberate evaluations, implicit attitudes are defined as automatically activated, gut-level evaluations. The supplementary use of implicit attitudes is consistent with current theorizing highlighting that deeply held and sometimes even unconscious evaluations influence media choice. Using a web-based study, we found that implicit and explicit attitudes toward TV brands predicted choice. Each attitude construct predicted variance beyond that predicted by the other. We discuss implications by emphasizing the role of automatic, gut-level decision-making in current high-choice media environments.",Issues in Selective Exposure Research,Mass Communication

Specifically, our model predicts selective exposure to high and low efficacy messages about the transition, and in turn, how message exposure influences self-efficacy. Participants browsed a university blog that contained alumni posts about transition success or failure in the life domains of career, finances, romance, and friendships. Results indicate that selective exposure to high efficacy messages was predicted by self-efficacy and outcome assessments with an indirect effect of uncertainty through outcome assessments.

However as the physician reviews featured on these websites are user-generated, the information quality is incalculable for prospective patients. In order to minimize this uncertainty, many PRWs ask their users to rate the perceived helpfulness of the reviews. The present study investigates which characteristics of a review's content and form predict its helpfulness. A content analysis of a random sample of 894 reviews of dentists, orthopedics and gynecologists in the Berlin area featured on the largest German PRW (jameda) was conducted. It was found that both the number of helpfulness-votes given and the resulting helpfulness-rating of a review are higher, if the review warns the reader about improper treatment.

One thousand one hundred and ten (1,110) female college students, sampled from ten randomly selected colleges of a pool of 147 Taiwanese colleges, completed the study questionnaire. Paired t-tests showed that the third-person effects were robust. Regression analysis also revealed that news attention and elaboration markedly and positively predicted information-seeking intentions regarding aesthetic surgery; the perceived third-person effects were significantly and negatively associated with information-seeking intentions concerning aesthetic surgery.",Health and Medical Information Seeking and Processing (High-Density),Health Communication
2017-1005,2017,Paper Session,Addressing Problems of Likert Scale Self-Report Measurements: The Potential of Conjoint Analysis for Communication Research,1,"Surveys on media choices oftentimes rely on Likert-type scales. Yet, they prevent researchers from identifying the relative importance of different stimuli features for the choice decision. It is shown that conjoint analysis provides a variety of advantages emerging from trade-off questions. However, past communication research has mostly neglected conjoint analysis and is primarily reliant on Likert-type scale measurements. This study addresses some problems pertaining to Likert scale measurements and demonstrates when conjoint analysis may address some of these problems. The differences between measurements are illustrated in a Uses-and-Gratifications-study with 530 participants, assessing the convergent validity on Likert scale measurements using traditional conjoint and choice-based conjoint analysis. Results show that subjects prefer rather “cognitive needs” by the Likert scale measurement, against “tension release needs” by both conjoint analyses. The different outcome is independent from linguistic variation and from the dual-process models of information processing. Implications for communication research are discussed.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories II",Information Systems

The present study examines the cross-national measurement validity of these theoretical constructs by testing the factorial structure of the German version of the Appreciation, Fun, and Suspense scales developed by Oliver and Bartsch (2010) and by examining the measurement invariance of the scales across US-American (N = 262) and German (N = 274) samples by reanalyzing two published data sets. Findings support the theoretically assumed three-factorial model of the German scale and partial scalar invariance across samples.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories II",Information Systems
2017-1007,2017,Paper Session,Measurement of Social Reward Processing of Boys With Autism Spectrum Disorder,4,"Many of the deficits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represent, at their core, impairments in basic social processes. Research has yet to identify the underlying neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms that fully account for these impairments. One compelling yet understudied idea regarding the pathogenesis of autism is that deficits in social reward processing underlie many of the core symptoms of ASD. According to social reward processing theory, reduced social motivation results in less time orienting to faces and other social and media stimuli in infancy and throughout early childhood. However, this theory has not been empirically tested, due in part to a lack of appropriate measures. This experiment utilized psychophysiological measures such as facial electromyography, skin conductance, and heart rate to assess social reward processing in adolescent boys with ASD compared to typically developing boys. The results will provide direct information about the underlying mechanisms of social deficits in ASD.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories II",Information Systems
2017-1008,2017,Paper Session,"Tolerance of Perceived Unrealness: Conceptualization, Measurement, Persuasive Effect - An Update",1,"Tolerance of perceived unrealness is increasingly seen as an important mechanism in the processing of narratives when it comes to explaining enjoyment and the persuasive outcomes of the reception of stories. However, current research focusses only on either the perception of unrealness (i.e., salience of violations of realism) or tolerance of such violations. Therefore, this study explicates how salience and tolerance can be integrated conceptually to reflect suspension of disbelief (SOD) as tolerance of perceived unrealness, it proposes a new way of measuring SOD, and it explores SOD’s role in narrative persuasion. The results show that salience and tolerance are related linearly negative, and that there is a curvilinear relationship between the integrated measure of SOD and the story-consistency of beliefs after the reception of stories that imply certain beliefs. Thus, the study contributes to theorizing about SOD, and it complements existing knowledge on narrative persuasion.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories II",Information Systems

A coding scheme was developed to identify qualitative differences in essay responses and explore the effects of death-relevant communication on traditional TMT dependent variables. The coding scheme was tested to determine if different language choices concerning death can be used to predict nonconscious distal psychological defenses that may lead to increased cultural worldview bolstering. A coding scheme was validated and support was found indicating the nature of the language used to express existential anxiety predicts responses to a word-stem completion task designed to measure nonconscious death awareness as an indicator of MS.

2017-1010,2017,Paper Session,A Modified Secondary Task Reaction Time Paradigm for Research on Breaks in Presence,5,"Beaks in presence are considered a promising approach to investigate events where users are pulled out of their virtual experiences. In this paper, we argue that this methodology may also provide insights into the cognitive processes behind the presence experience. To this end, we combined breaks in presence with a modified version of the secondary task reaction times paradigm and psychophysiological measures to tap into the attentional processes behind presence experiences. 69 participants played a modified video game, during which they had to react to sounds that were either part of the story or unrelated (breaks in presence) as a secondary task. We measured their reaction times to both sound types, skin conductance responses and heart rate variability. Participants reacted equally fast to virtual and BIP-eliciting stimuli. Both types of stimuli elicit orienting responses with our virtual stimulus leading to stronger responses and habitualization. Avenues for future research are discussed.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories II",Information Systems
2017-1011,2017,Paper Session,How Danmaku Influences Emotional Responses: Exploring the Effects of Coviewing and Copresence,2,"With the development of mass communication technology, audiences have become more active and engaged. A novel online commentary system, danmaku, enables users to generates content-synchronous comments overlaid on a video at any time point. These unique features of danmaku distinguish it from YouTube comments and Social TV. Such distinctive characteristics also give danmaku vast research potential. The co-viewing experience induced by danmaku is independent of both time and distance. This study is designed to determine whether danmaku generates a sense of copresence, and how copresence will influence viewers’ emotional responses to horror films and comedy. Physical copresence has been proved to reduce the fear response to horror and to increase the enjoyment of comedy. Whether virtual copresence has the same effect remains to be determined, and making such a determination is the goal of this study.","New Measures, New Methods, and New Theories II",Information Systems

This finding was shown on several social contexts, such as politics, donations, and imprisonment sentences. The purpose of this research is to investigate how physical attractiveness of a political candidate interacts with the valence (negative vs. positive) of the message he delivers and examine how these factors affect his evaluation, vote intention, and trustworthiness of the information he delivers. In particular, we are interested in investigating the conditions under which negative political advertising and physical attractiveness might be beneficial or detrimental to political candidates and the image they portray to voters.",Information Effects in Political Campaigns: Lessons From the US,Political Communication

We use information utility and the rational voter perspective to explain people’s level of attention to campaign information. First, we examine whether people’s engagement with campaign information increases closer to Election Day. Second, we examine whether engagement with campaign information varies around important events that occur during an election such as presidential debates. Finally, we examine whether engagement with campaign information varies by states. Specifically, we test whether people pay closer attention to campaign information in more competitive (i.e., battleground) states compared to less competitive states.",Information Effects in Political Campaigns: Lessons From the US,Political Communication
2017-1015,2017,Paper Session,Online and Offline Communication and Political Knowledge and Participation in Presidential Campaigns: Effects of Geospatial Context,1,"Political campaigns employ segmenting and targeting strategies to reach voters, which result in a differential distribution of campaign resources across the whole nation. This study investigates how the resulting differences in information availability influence an individual’s political learning and behaviors in relation to geospatial locality. Data for this study come from separate studies conducted during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The results show that newspaper use has a greater impact on political knowledge and political participation in localities with more political advertising or more candidate appearances than in localities where these are less frequent. The impact of offline political discussion does not follow the same pattern. Also, Internet media work in both directions—i.e., by (1) extending unequal information availability in the offline world and thereby reinforcing the effect of geographical targeting and (2) diminishing unequal information availability in the offline world and thereby mitigating the effect of geographical targeting.",Information Effects in Political Campaigns: Lessons From the US,Political Communication

Using an eight-wave nationally representative panel survey tracking non-Hispanic whites from the summer of 2008 through the winter of 2013, we find evidence of a similar beneficial effect due to the 2012 presidential campaign. Consistent with our exemplar-based theory of mediated intergroup contact, levels of white racial prejudice declined significantly between the two panel waves bracketing the 2012 campaign; those with the most exposure to Obama through political television exhibited the largest reductions in prejudice; and the effects held among conservatives and viewers of conservative television. Overall, our results suggest a net positive effect of Obama’s two campaigns, highlighting the real-world potential of mediated contact.",Information Effects in Political Campaigns: Lessons From the US,Political Communication
2017-1017,2017,Paper Session,Their Views Are So Unacceptable: The Impact of Partisan News Exposure on Rejection of Oppositional Perspectives,1,"This study uses panel data from the 2008 presidential campaigns to examine whether exposure to partisan news influenced viewers to be more disapproving of their opponents’ viewpoints over time. Using fixed effects analyses, I find that partisans increasingly rejected the other side’s viewpoints over the course of campaign, and exposure to partisan news had a significant impact on partisans’ assessments of the oppositional perspectives. Watching likeminded news resulted in greater perceptions that the opponents’ issue positions are unacceptable, while consuming crosscutting news tended to suppress such oppositional attitudes. I also examined the political consequences of increased rejection: Individuals rejecting the other side’s viewpoints were more likely to reduce their trust in the electoral system when their preferred party did not win the election. This study discusses the impact of partisan news exposure on polarizing the electorate in terms of perceptions of the opposing party as well as political trust.",Information Effects in Political Campaigns: Lessons From the US,Political Communication

Building on previous work utilizing signaling theory in organizations, through content and thematic analyses, results indicate that specific, vivid, and narrative-like job advertisements were associated with high levels of job attractiveness on LinkedIn. Furthermore, qualitative analyses reveal that effective job ad content highlights a personalized workplace, explains job responsibilities in detail, and encourages applicant engagement with the organization. These findings demonstrate how signals emerging from job ads influence applicant’s perception of attraction to an organization. Implications for recruitment practices, signaling theory development, and future research are also discussed.","Social Media, Markets, and Work",Communication and Technology

This exploratory study seeks to fill a gap in the literature by examining connectivity from an affordance perspective; that is, as a tool that can be used in varied ways. In particular, this study qualitatively explores how mobile technology enables connectivity to be used as an impression management tool among white-collar knowledge workers. Findings revealed three main themes: the structuration of expectations for connectivity, connectivity shapes impressions of employees, and critical work-related moments increase pressure to be connected. Practical considerations and directions for future research are also addressed.","Social Media, Markets, and Work",Communication and Technology

In particular, we investigate how public employees reconcile job-related and private uses of social media in the workplace. To answer this question, in-depth interviews were conducted both with employees and employers. Our key findings reveal that social media are increasingly playing a central role in how public institutions function, and they are used to coordinate various activities (e.g., meetings and sharing information). Although social media are often feared for their potential to distract employees from work, in our study private uses of social media were seen as compatible with work in most institutions. Even where shortcomings were noted, they were too minimal to constitute a real threat to public institutions’ productivity.","Social Media, Markets, and Work",Communication and Technology
2017-1021,2017,Paper Session,“I Would Like to Have a Little Salary”: Economic Outcomes of Peer Market Participation,1,"What economic benefits do users of online peer market platforms obtain from participation? This paper provides an empirical response to this question through multimodal analysis of a diverse group of independent artists, creative entrepreneurs who sell their handmade goods using e-commerce platforms. Drawing on theoretical notions of aspirational and relational labor, it shows that entrepreneurs exert effort making their products and spend time promoting them as they attempt to engage and sustain an audience of customers. Triangulated questionnaire, observational, and interview data reveal, however, that most artists not only experience little financial success but also express ambivalence and frustration. At the same time, they rationalize their participation by asserting that they derive satisfaction from creating their art and selling what little they do.","Social Media, Markets, and Work",Communication and Technology
2017-1022,2017,Paper Session,Startup Founders and Their LinkedIn Connections: Are Well-Connected Entrepreneurs More Successful?,2,"For the past 40 years, entrepreneurs and researchers have assumed that entrepreneur networks are important and beneficial for startup ventures. Research has shown that startup ventures benefit from entrepreneur networks in various ways ranging from establishing credibility in the market, accessing competitive information and opportunities, to accessing skilled people and establishing competitive collaborations. This study takes this notion further by testing whether these benefits actually translate into tangible financial outcomes for a startup. For this purpose, the study integrates two extensive databases that have not been studied together in previous research: Crunchbase.com, which provides extensive information on the financial success of startup companies, and LinkedIn, which provides extensive social network information of founders. The analysis revealed that several variables in LinkedIn profiles were positively correlated with the amount of funds raised by startup companies establishing a link between social networks and entrepreneurial success.","Social Media, Markets, and Work",Communication and Technology
2017-1023,2017,Paper Session,"Noise-Making, Occupy Wall Street, and the Politics of Amplification",1,"This essay examines the sonic politics around three noisemaking technologies deployed during Occupy Wall Street—the People’s Microphone, the sound cannon, and the noise complaint—as a way to theorize the ultimate disaggregation and delegitimization of the organization. This work uses the history and discourse around these technologies to map the distinction between appropriate sound—noise and “not-noise”—onto a dialectical protester/state frame. Sound holds a multi-directional possibility both as radical tool and dissent overrider; noise-making is a technology that can coproduce different effects depending on which side of a conflict wields it. Additionally, I suggest the need for a more multitudinous sonic social contract model, where every listener plays a role in defining the contours of the urban soundscape and “noise-making” is thus redefined as a process of sonic boundary-making by which certain sounds and sounders legitimate and otherwise are implicated in a society of sonic control.",Social Movements and Technology,Communication and Technology
2017-1024,2017,Paper Session,The Role of Social Movement Organizations in Twitter: Evidence From the Chilean Student Movement,6,"Social media have been praised for enabling people to start new movements without formal organizational structures. Nonetheless, social movement organizations (SMO) continue to play a key role in enabling collective action and maintaining the movement’s existence in digital environments. Based on Twitter data related to the Chilean Student Movement, this article demonstrates that organizations continue being central actors in their networks, and over time their messages were more consistent than those of their leaders. By using a mixed-methods approach, incorporating network analysis, sentiment analysis, and content analysis, we identify differences on how their information flow, network position, and attitudes evolve over a three-year span (2011-2013). The study analyzes a corpus of over 629,555 tweets, collected from students’ trending hashtags, tweets from accounts of student leaders and student organizations involved with this cause. The findings reveal the crucial role of student organizations, where they adapted individual identities to unite and galvanize of people under a common cause.",Social Movements and Technology,Communication and Technology
2017-1025,2017,Paper Session,A Social Networks Approach to Online Social Movement: Social Mediators and Mediated Messages in #FreeAJStaff Twitter Network,2,"The movement to free Al Jazeera journalists (#FreeAJStaff) from Egypt prisons utilized Twitter over almost two years between 2014 and 2015. This study applied a social networks approach to study patterns of information flow, social mediators, and emerging communities, formed by the #FreeAJStaff social movement on Twitter. Twitter data of 22 months were collected, resulting in social networks created by 71,326 users and 149,650 social ties. Social network analysis identified the interconnected sub-communities: clusters. In each clusters, users relied on a few actors – Social Mediators – to bridge out to users in other clusters. These social mediators were found to be primarily core movement actors (e.g., Al Jazeera) or elites (e.g., politicians), rather than grassroots actors. Core actors exhibited more reciprocal relationship with other users than elites while elite actors were more successful in exchanging messages. Furthermore, this study identified the mechanism used to create a spillover effect between social movements.",Social Movements and Technology,Communication and Technology

To advance the field, this study outlines a communication-centered framework that views communication as a key mechanism in distributing political opportunities, maneuvering mobilizing structures, shaping cultural framing, articulating contested meanings, and facilitating relational dynamics among these interrelated factors. By centralizing and sensitizing communication dynamics, the framework suggests an explicit focus on communication – including different degrees of communication and metacommunication – to dissect (technologically mediated) collective actions in different spatiotemporal contexts.",Social Movements and Technology,Communication and Technology

However, with the advent of social media, public understanding of terrorism often exceeds editorial and geographic boundaries. This study seeks to understand public audience perception of global terrorism by analyzing social media frames based on Construal Level Theory. An analysis of tweets during the Boston Marathon Bombing and the Brussels Airport Attack finds that media and audience frames show a great deal of similarities but do not always converge in on Twitter. Similarities are discerned in terms of the potential for social categorization and stereotyping of certain populations. However, psychological distance can invoke different terrorism framing between the media and the public.",Social Sharing and Virality,Mass Communication
2017-1029,2017,Paper Session,When News Frames Go Viral: A Mixed-Methods Study of Framing Effects on Social Media Sharing,3,"Are there framing effects on social media users’ behavior? We hypothesize that generic frames in journalistic content influence what news people share on Facebook and Twitter. Using a mixed-methods design, a quantitative content analysis of a representative sample of 3,500 articles published in six Chilean outlets was combined with a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with digital journalists. After controlling for issue, newsworthiness, informational utility, valence, and a host of other confounds, results show that—in both platforms—a morality frame increases news sharing, whereas a conflict frame decreases it. Emphasizing economic consequences also decreases shares, but only on Facebook. Contrary to expectations, the human interest angle has no discernible effects. The interviews provide additional insights on the nature of framing effects on news sharing. Taken together, the findings highlight the need for adopting a theoretically-driven, mixed-methods approach to studying the behavioral consequences of framing in a social media environment.",Social Sharing and Virality,Mass Communication
2017-1030,2017,Paper Session,YouTube for Good: A Content Analysis of Viral and Nonviral Inspiring YouTube Videos,11,"Over the past two decades, a spate of popular press and academic writings have warned of how our current reliance on media technology might be facilitating negative consequences for users. However, not all media technologies are negative; some content available through technology can inspire empathy, human virtue, character building, an “others orientation,” and prosociality. For instance, self-transcendent emotions that promote an “others orientation” can be triggered when we encounter specific stimuli like vastness, encouragement, or portrayals of others experiencing self-transcendent emotions. In this study, we conducted the first systematic analysis of inspiring media content, as represented in a sample of 100 videos posted on YouTube.com in order to explore the portrayals of self-transcendent emotions and elicitors to which technology users may be exposed. Results suggest that inspirational videos are predominantly filled with depictions associated with hope and the appreciation of beauty and human excellence.

2017-1031,2017,Paper Session,From Distribution Channels to Active Intermediaries: How Technology Firms Shape Political Communication,2,"This paper offers an analysis of the role that technology companies, specifically Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter, play in shaping political communication. We develop a co-evolutionary model of how the technology, political, and media fields are adapting to one another through the course of their work around electoral politics and governance. Through interviews with representatives of these firms and digital and social media directors of 2016 presidential primary campaigns, as well as field observations at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, we find that technology firms are motivated to work in the political space because it facilitates their long-term work at relationship building in the service of lobbying efforts. We also find that Facebook and Google, in particular, are not simply passive distribution channels for political content, but active intermediaries that shape political communication. This includes Google’s account representatives serving as quasi-digital consultants to campaigns, shaping both digital strategy and execution.","Digital Campaigns, Social Media, and Elections: New Platforms, New Research",Political Communication
2017-1032,2017,Paper Session,A Typology of Political Participation Online: How Citizens Used Twitter to Mobilize During the 2015 British General Elections,2,"This study investigates how, and to what extent, citizens use Twitter as a platform for political mobilization in an electoral context. Conceptualizing political participation as a process, we develop a typology of political participation designed to isolate mobilizing calls for action from the rest of the political discussion online. Based on Twitter data collected one week prior to the 2015 British general election, we then identify the top 100 most retweeted accounts using the hashtag #GE2015, classify them by actor type, and perform a content analysis of their Twitter posts according to our typology.
Our results show that that citizens – not political parties – are the primary initiators and sharers of political calls for action leading up to the election. However, this finding is largely due to an uneven distribution of citizen-driven mobilizing activity. A small number of highly active users, typically supporters of nationalist parties, are by far the most active users in our dataset. We also identify four primary strategies used by citizens to enact mobilization through Twitter: in-text calls for action, hashtag commands, sharing mobilizing content, and frequent postings, with hashtag commands being the most predominantly used.","Digital Campaigns, Social Media, and Elections: New Platforms, New Research",Political Communication

Brigade was launched in April 2016 to provide an alternative space to Facebook and Twitter for Millennials to debate, discuss, and organize around 2016 topics and issues. Since its introduction, three-million Millennials created accounts and participated in the platform. Due to Brigade’s newness, this project lends insight into how political engagement manifests within a digital space as it popularizes and matures against the backdrop of a national election. This study addresses the following questions: How do Millennials engage the 2016 election in a new social media platform? How do Millennials view their own political agency, particularly as it is mediated by Brigade users, mass media, and older generations? Finally, how do the structure, affordances, and design of Brigade encourage or facilitate political engagement in the 2016 election?","Digital Campaigns, Social Media, and Elections: New Platforms, New Research",Political Communication
2017-1034,2017,Paper Session,Skiing All the Way to the Polls: Exploring the Popularity of Personalized Posts on Norwegian Political Instagram Accounts,1,"While studies have gauged the degree to which political actors focus on their personal sides rather than on their more official sides in their communication, few research efforts have been geared towards assessing to what extent personalized content could be considered successful in gaining traction among online followers. The current study compares the ways in which the content offered by Norwegian parties and party leaders is received by those who follow their updates on Instagram – a social media image sharing service. Results indicate that party leaders are more successful than parties in gaining attention on the studied service, and that they offer personalized content to higher degrees than the parties they represent. While personalized content might lead to increased political engagement among Instagram users, the fact that personalization ‘works’ in terms of gaining attention might also skew political PR and marketing towards excessive use of such themes.","Digital Campaigns, Social Media, and Elections: New Platforms, New Research",Political Communication

Following discussion of the evolution and status of data campaigning across Field Operations and Communications, this paper argues that data-driven campaigning is a more limited practice that many popular accounts of contemporary campaign strategy acknowledge, and that beyond presidential campaigns and the most competitive of senate runs, staffers limit data-driven strategy to field operations and advertising. Far from a simple story of merely needing data skills, this article uncovers the other variables that prevent the uptake of data-driven analytics in types of campaigns and particular aspects of campaign strategy.","Digital Campaigns, Social Media, and Elections: New Platforms, New Research",Political Communication

But are they? And if so, what kind of solution do they offer? Drawing on interviews, analyses of boards of directors, and industry data, this article argues foundation-supported media are deeply incorporated into the U.S. highly commercialized system of news production and circulation, in which most of the public is provided a steady menu of infotainment and sponsored content, while a small sector of in-depth (limited) critical news remains largely within the provinces of high cultural capital elites.

2017-1038,2017,Paper Session,Selling Credibility： Chinese Newspapers in the Digital Age,3,"Facing the challenge of new media technology and the general crisis of media economy, the traditional press is experiencing a hard time. In particular, credibility, by which news media claims legitimacy and authority in the society, suffers. Through a comprehensive study of six Chinese press groups and over 90 in-depth interviews with journalists and media managers, this paper reports the findings of how credibility is used as a marketing tool for the media organizations to survive the current economic crisis. It is found that the media organizations tend to exploit the market potential of media credibility in three main ways: the reconfiguration of the organizational structure, the development of public relations activities as a new income source, and redefinition of journalists’ role. By these means, media begin to negotiate a new relationship with society, and the traditional norms of journalism are subject to challenge and change.",Sustainable Business Models for News Organizations: Economic Challenges in Journalism,Journalism Studies

This research grows from calls into the state of local journalism. The goal is to develop an analytical approach that can be largely scaled and feasibly implemented. The approach presented in this paper thus develops indicators that tap into the robustness of local journalism infrastructure at the market level, specifically utilizing the 210 Designated Market Areas (DMAs) in the United States, which enables the exploration of individual communities and their relationship to the robustness of local news media. The results point to the relationship between fundamental economic and demographic characteristics of local media markets and the robustness of the local news media infrastructure within those markets.",Sustainable Business Models for News Organizations: Economic Challenges in Journalism,Journalism Studies

2017-1041,2017,Paper Session,Filling the Void: Nonprofit News and Factors Affecting Government Conflict Coverage,3,"The public needs to be aware of conflict in order to effectively participate in a democracy. The demise of local news has threatened the normative role of journalism in this process. With traditional news organizations struggling, non-profit sites have set out to fill the void. If they can indeed function as substitutes, though, has largely been unexplored. This study examined how frequently stories about local government conflict appeared in the coverage of 10 for profit and non-profit sites, and what factors predicted such coverage. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the direct and indirect effects of organization-level and reporter-level variables. Results indicate non-profit news sites are more likely to cover government conflict, and that this difference is caused by variables inherent to the organizations.",New Perspectives Upon Press-Politics Relations,Journalism Studies
2017-1042,2017,Paper Session,Discursive Wars: How “Regaining Lost Influence” and “Doing New Media” Help Chinese News Media Negotiate Press Freedom with the Party...With Mobile News App The Paper As A Case Study,1,"Amid fleeing audience attention from state-owned traditional media to the varied and vociferous new media, the Chinese government launched a web-native new media publication The Paper in 2014 in Shanghai as a pilot test before deploying its model all over China, to regain lost influence and “occupy the new media battle field”. This paper, via participatory observation and in-depth interviews, finds that, as it operates, The Paper has used two discursive tools in its negotiation with the government for leeway in its reporting, namely “If you want to regain lost influence, then…” and “If you want us to do mobile new media to regain lost influence, then…”. The author suggests, this “influence-based exceptionalism”, strategically used by the Paper, have somewhat extended the Party leashes on The Paper as a sanctioned watchdog.",New Perspectives Upon Press-Politics Relations,Journalism Studies
2017-1043,2017,Paper Session,Social Networking and Political Alignment as Connecting Mechanisms in Interactions of Journalists and Political Actors: A Mixed-Methods Study,2,"Political coverage is the outcome of interactions between journalists and political actors. Especially for political actors, these interactions present an opportunity to increase their influence on the news. Some of the previous studies suggest that the interactions are dominated by political actors, while others conclude that journalists are at least equally influential. We investigated the situation in Austria based on a mixed-methods study with an eye to the mechanisms that define the interactions of journalists and political sources and the power balance between both. The study included a full sample of N = 173 political journalists surveyed with a standardized instrument and open interviews with 10 additional journalists and 10 political actors. Results show that politicians build political alliances, network with specific journalists, and use intimidation to control the interactions. While the first strategy indeed spurs politicians’ sway over the coverage, networking and intimidation do not, but instead, benefit the journalists.",New Perspectives Upon Press-Politics Relations,Journalism Studies
2017-1044,2017,Paper Session,Beyond Time and Space: A Multilevel Approach to Structural Influences on Mediatization in Campaign Coverage,2,Theories of mediatization of political communication stress the importance of macro- and meso-structural conditions of political and media systems for explaining levels of media logic in news coverage. Most studies analyze the passing of time and contrast countries as a proxy to indirectly study the effects of structures. The current comparative multi-level analysis of campaign coverage in Germany and Austria (1949-2009) systematizes and investigates effects of structural influences on media logic directly. It finds that changes and between-country differences in levels of media logic are largely caused by a country’s political and media structures and their change over time. The analysis demonstrates the importance of structures in mediatization processes and specifies which structural influences affect media logic and how.,New Perspectives Upon Press-Politics Relations,Journalism Studies
2017-1045,2017,Paper Session,An Evaluation of Using Multimedia Messaging to Encourage Positive Parent-Child Engagement,2,"Parents are often seeking advice on how to support their children’s healthy development. Text message (SMS) programs have been identified as one successful way of delivering this content, but today’s parents are increasingly using multi-media messages (MMS) as well. This research attempts to understand if and how caretakers with young children utilize the digital information from one of two text-messaging campaigns (Text4Baby and Univision) to inform their parenting practices in supporting children’s positive language development. To do so, we conducted eight focus groups around the country with parents who have used these services to find out about the usability and perceived helpfulness of the video messages. Participants (N = 69) mentioned that they liked the services they were receiving, but differed on the extent to which they would use the information given the way it was received. These focus groups provide rich data for evaluating the programs and videos’ effectiveness.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media

First, two focus groups will be conducted at a Midwestern Middle school in November 2016. Students will discuss types of television programs they most often watch and the reasons why they might watch them. The researcher will employ uses and gratification and Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in order to tease out which uses, gratifications, and needs kids fulfill by watching these respective shows. The researcher will then formulate a questionnaire based on categories of statements solicited from the focus groups participants and have a class at the same middle school rate their level of agreement with certain statements. This research could potentially add a cultural or peer pressure element—in terms of the desire to watch the same shows as one’s peers—to uses and gratifications theory.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1047,2017,Paper Session,Developing a Theoretical Framework for Effective Implementation of Social Network Health Campaigns Among Youth,1,"Health campaigners increasingly use social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, which enable to reach target recipients via their social networks. This is especially relevant among children and adolescents, for whom the social environment (parents, peers, teachers) plays a crucial role in processing of messages and adoption of health behaviors. Research is rising rapidly, but is still limited to sporadic and ad hoc evaluation studies. There is a need for a theoretical framework that systematically maps the interplay between media influences and social influences on behavioral adoption. Therefore, we are developing a framework for campaign implementation via youth’s social networks, bringing together theories of media uses and effects, message diffusion, behavioral change, social influence, and network dynamics. The framework will provide guidance, for researchers and health practitioners, for effective implementation of social media health campaigns among children and adolescents.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Survey Evidence,2,"With the increased availability of streaming services, television viewing time is being transformed from a communal activity to a more personalized individual experience. On Netflix alone, users stream around 2.5 hours of content per day (McAlone, 2016) but the phenomenon of streaming TV online has not been studied for the possible effect it could have on overall academic performance and health amongst college students. Through a nationally representative survey, this study aims to examine how streaming TV affects these factors among first-year university students. It then places the findings in a comparative analysis of broadcast and cable television. Importantly, the study proposed here aims to link two streams of research on both television and internet use through streaming television and thereby fill an enormous gap in the literature that has almost no empirical research to date on streaming TV and academic performance or health among students.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Through the theoretical frameworks of identity theory, feminist theory, including performativity theory, and the dramaturgical approach for self-presentation, this study analyzes how female emerging adults use Facebook to create their gender identity. The study also examines how female emerging adults reinforce or overcome traditional notions of femininity as well as interpret their gender identity construction in their Facebook profiles. The study involves two parts: a qualitative content analysis and in-depth semi-structured interviews. The qualitative content analysis seeks to capture the meaning and significance of the gender presentations provided in the female emerging adults’ Facebook profiles. The in-depth semi-structured interviews will allow the researcher to gain a detailed personal account of female emerging adults’ perceptions of their identity presentations on Facebook.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media

A survey was conducted among 1187 secondary school students (61.3% girls, n = 728) between 16 and 22 years old (M = 17.82 years; SD = 0.02). Adolescents who used substances were more likely to engage in sexting than those who were not. Youth who had sexual contact or were the victim of (cyber)bullying were also more likely to have engaged in sexting. Regarding the relational context of sexting, different associations were found for adolescents engaging in sexting within and outside a romantic relationship with regard to substance use, having engaged in sex, the history of sexual partners, and substance use before having sex.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1053,2017,Paper Session,The Effect of Pervasive Television Viewing on Children’s Sleep and Social Habits,1,"The effects of pervasive television exposure have been argued in studies by American scholars to contribute to sleep disturbance (AAP, 1999), obesity (Harvard School of Public Health, 2014), and imitating risky social behaviour (Garvin, 2008). This research will test for undesirable effects of pervasive television exposure to children aged 10 to 14 years and check whether it leads to negative effects such as sleep disturbances, obesity or hastens commencement of risky social behaviours such as violence, alcohol drinking or hastened initiation of sexual activities. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) proposes that children should not watch more than two hours a day of quality programming which should be informational, educational and non-violent (AAP, 2014). Kenya now airs television 24 hours a day, therefore children can easily be exposed to more hours of pervasive exposure to television that is interrupted only by the necessities of school and school related activities.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1054,2017,Paper Session,The Impact of Educational Television on Children’s Attitudes Towards STEM and Interest in STEM Careers,1,"STEM education is essential to preparing children for an increasingly technological global workforce. High-quality educational television can supplement formal education by sparking interest in new topics. Interest in STEM is especially low for female and minority students, which leads to lower achievement and less participation in these fields later in life. Encouragingly, educational television shows created in recent years are beginning to feature more diverse characters, but the effect of these positive portrayals is unknown. In the current experimental study, diverse participants (N = 150, age 5-6 years) are tested to see if exposure to STEM shows that feature diverse characters increases their interest in STEM learning and attitudes towards STEM careers. Data collection is in progress, but expected results from structural equation modeling will lead to a better understanding of how STEM-focused educational television can influence young children’s interest in STEM, especially for girls and children of color.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1055,2017,Paper Session,To be Banned or Not? A Test of the Social Learning Theory Among Nairobi High-Schoolers,1,"The Social Learning theory, coined by Albert Bandura, suggests that people learn from one another by observation, imitation and modelling (Bandura, 1977). This theory deals with media and how it affects behavior and is best explained in the context of children who are likely to change their behavior based on the models of others (Were, 2015). This paper is a test of the social learning theory among high-schoolers in Nairobi who are exposed to a popular television drama series- Tahidi High. The study tests the theory by finding out behaviour changes in the study population as a result of being exposed to the TV drama.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1056,2017,Paper Session,Youth and Online Participatory Politics in Democratic and Authoritarian Regimes,1,"Emerging studies of youth engaged in participatory politics suggest a necessary rethinking of traditional notions of citizenship, particularly in light of alternative and creative avenues offered online (Cohen & Kahne, 2012; Westheimer & Kahne, 2004). However, most of the research and theorizing on youth and digital civics has revolved around advanced democracies in North America and Western Europe (Allen & Light, 2015; Gardner, 2015; Jenkins, Shresthova, Gamber-Thompson, Kligler-Vilenchik, & Zimmerman, 2016). To build a more diverse account and theory of participatory politics, it is necessary to take a more inclusive, global approach that considers digital youth in societies with different political, economic conditions.

This study considers youth’s online civic expression in two widely varying political settings, an authoritarian regime (Cambodia) and a democratic regime (the U.S.). Using Cambodian and American youth as case studies, I ask how young activists in different political regimes exercise online voice and take action on matters of moral importance to them in their everyday civic lives. Particular attention is paid to online strategies these youth employ to navigate danger and uncertainty in contentious politics and dissent.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 1)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1057,2017,Paper Session,"We Wear the (Emotional) Masks: A Critical Examination of Image Repair, Cam Newton’s Post-Super Bowl Response, and Celebrity Athlete Emotional Displays",2,"If audiences believe an athlete has done something that has violated their expectations, the athlete often is compelled to engage in image repair strategies to address the violation. In the context of celebrity National Football League (NFL) quarterback Cam Newton’s behavior following the Super Bowl 50 loss, people believed he acted unprofessionally, and as such they demanded atonement for the “childish” behavior. Instead of conducting a study that examines proper image repair strategies for Newton in particular and celebrities in general, we seek to understand and challenge what we identify as the ideology of the “good sport.”—thus challenging the seemingly immediate public relations response to engage in image repair. Simply put, in a highly emotional sport such as American football, it is important to examine why Newton’s behavior was deemed inappropriate at all. This study contributes to the literature by critically examining the hegemony of emotions in sport for celebrity athletes. Moreover, this case shows a clear example of a celebrity athlete’s resistance attempt to the hegemony of “proper” emotions in sports public relations. Theoretical and practical implications for emotion in sports, sports media coverage, and image repair are discussed.","(Don't) Be So Emotional: Athletes, Professors, and Other Publics",Public Relations

Despite this uncomfortable fact, little research has seriously considered that public relations is perceived as a “dirty” profession, and how that perception translates into difficulties for public relations academics and professionals. Scholarship has not examined the lived experiences of being a public relations professor and how we reconcile our sense of self and self-respect in an academic and professional environment that is often intentionally hostile, and unintentionally disconfirming to our chosen area of study. Thus, this critical and self-reflexive essay takes up the challenge of dealing with the issues of disconfirmation, cognitive dissonance, and emotional labor that may be experienced by public relations professors in their interactions with colleagues, students, and even family members or friends.","(Don't) Be So Emotional: Athletes, Professors, and Other Publics",Public Relations
2017-1059,2017,Paper Session,Identifiers’ and Disidentifiers’ Reactions to Corporate Misconduct: The Role of Emotions as Mediators,2,"This research explores the different reactions of identified consumers (ICs) and disidentified consumers (DICs) toward corporate misconduct compared to non-identified consumers (NICs). Identification and disidentification as states of self-categorization regarding belongingness to or separation from a company is closely related to a person’s propensity not only to think and behave, but also to feel in a specific way. This research places a particular focus on how the different reactions to a corporate misconduct, VW’s manipulation of vehicle emission tests, are mediated by emotions. Building on social identity theory and more recent approaches in identity theory, our findings support the assumption that emotions play an important role. We show that ICs and DisICs differed significantly from NonICs in their cognitive, emotional and behavioral reactions during the crisis in a way that was consistent with their identification or disidentification with the company.","(Don't) Be So Emotional: Athletes, Professors, and Other Publics",Public Relations

2017-1061,2017,Paper Session,Passionate Publics: An Affective Turn in Counterpublic Theorizing,2,"The purpose of this study is to bring feminist affect theory into counterpublics theorizing through an exploration of two highly affective contexts: sexual assault on college campuses and the anti-vaccination movement. These two contexts offer contrasting contexts for the role that affect is “allowed” to play. In particular, affective responses are more accepted following a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, versus the inclusion of affect in seemingly scientific purviews, such as the effects of vaccination. This study is uniquely situated as it involves a rhetorical analysis of combined data from two completed dissertation projects to further the development of public relations theory. By examining sexual assault and anti-vaccine advocates as counterpublic enclaves, we will explore the role that affect plays in building those enclaves so that counterpublics may then become passionate publics.","(Don't) Be So Emotional: Athletes, Professors, and Other Publics",Public Relations

Qualitative analysis reveals how FLEs in medical clinics engage in frontstage and backstage communication to perform their jobs and facilitate patient care. Data highlight three broad themes in which FLEs’ communication compounds frontstage and backstage practices: performing on multidimensional stages, enacting complementary and competing roles, and incorporating regulatory strategies to accomplish their work.

Health services research tends to examines factors and processes that impact team care, this research could benefit from a more theoretical grounding within the field of organizational communication to improve the success of team care interventions. This paper offers an approach for studying team collaboration from a constitutive communication perspective. Giddens’ (1979) theory of structuration is used to discuss how healthcare organizations are socially structured through communication in often deeply entrenched ways that both support and inhibit collaborative care. Finally, interventions that might benefit from this theory-based research approach are considered.

In times of disaster, high reliability organizations (HROs) are central to immediate processes of recovery: Fire and rescue organizations are first responders during natural or man-made disasters, police are called upon to keep order, and the military may be called upon to help restore infrastructure and build peace. The ability of HROs to accomplish these goals depend on their ability to operate at full capacity. However, HROs themselves may also face crises that require these organizations to be resilient in their own right. This paper advances a grounded theory approach to culture change and resilience to show how one HRO (Fire and Rescue) is striving for organizational resilience in the face of their own internal crisis – in their words, an “epidemic” of cancer. However, efforts to reduce risk are complicated by organizational culture and occupational practices that challenge proposed adaptive changes.

As workplaces continue to implement health initiatives, understanding how employees make sense of the various meanings surrounding wellness at work is increasingly important. Through interviews with 30 participants of a workplace wellness program, this study uncovered the various, contradictory meanings of health at work. In sharing their health narratives, employees drew on both organizational and employee discourses, expressing conflicting meanings in the program’s rationale, workers’ participation, and the results of workplace health initiatives.

2017-1066,2017,Paper Session,Refine the Notion of “Attitude” in Organ Donation Research,1,"This research project begins by examining and refining the notion of attitude as conceptualized and operationalized in studies of organ donation informed by the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Study 1 of this research identifies two major areas of improvement in the conceptualization of attitude from the reasoned action perspective: (a) attitude toward a specific behavior and (b) recognition of affective as well as cognitive dimensions of attitude. Accordingly, a belief-based, multidimensional attitude measure is developed and administered to two distinctive Chinese samples. Its reliability and validity across samples is established through multi-sample CFA. Study 2 continues the examination of attitude while introducing more antecedents of behavior based on the TPB to predict Chinese university students’ donor registration behavior. It reveals that, both cognitive (i.e., positive cognitive attitudes) and affective (i.e., negative affective attitudes) factors are significantly predict organ donation behavior. Subjective norms and distrust are significant predictors as well.","Factors Shaping Relationships Between Attitudes, Intentions and Behavior",Health Communication

However, how self-affirmation improves message acceptance is not fully understood. Integrating construal level theory and reasoned action theory, this research tested two hypotheses: first, self-affirmation affects the abstractness of how people construe behavioral choices, and second, self-affirmation influences the associations between intention and its key determinants. Data were obtained from two studies on sunscreen use and flossing (N = 200 college students, and N = 294 adults). Our findings confirmed that self-affirmation induced abstract, high level construals of behaviors in terms of ends rather than means, and that self-affirmation strengthened the impact of attitude on intention and weakened the impact of perceived control.","Factors Shaping Relationships Between Attitudes, Intentions and Behavior",Health Communication
2017-1068,2017,Paper Session,How Risk Perception and Emotional Ambivalence in Topic Evaluation Influence Attitude and Behavioral Intention Toward Fast Food Consumption,1,"This study explored the influence of cognitive and affective reactions during topic evaluation on young adults' attitude and behavioral decision. The study posited that exposure to the topic ""eating meals from a fast food chain"" will generate both risk threat assessment and emotional ambivalence reactions, which will shape young adults' decision making toward fast food consumption. Data were collected from a sample of 607 college students with a two-wave survey. A causal research model was built based on a recent presentation of the information processing theory. Results with path analysis showed a dynamic interplay between risk threat perception and emotional ambivalence at Time 1, which influenced the attitude and behavioral intention at Time 1 and ultimately at Time 2. These results add to the evidence that risk threat perception was a key driver of the attitude-behavioral intention path in the topic evaluation. Moreover, the findings indicated that emotional ambivalence, which was determined by discrete emotions, had both direct and indirect effects on fast food eating decisions. The implications of these results for health communication are discussed.","Factors Shaping Relationships Between Attitudes, Intentions and Behavior",Health Communication
2017-1069,2017,Paper Session,Protection Motivation and Communication Through Nano-Food Labels: Improving Predictive Capabilities of Attitudes and Purchase Intentions Toward Nano-Foods,3,"The development and use of nanotechnology applications in the food industry (nano-food) have been growing steadily in recent years. While visions for nano-food suggest that the applications will improve product quality and safety, they are also controversial for several reasons, including potential long-term human health risks coupled with difficulty in assessing low-dosage nanoparticle risks, as well as value-based objections. In recent years, there has been significant controversy about nano-foods and debate has led to social scientific inquiry of many factors that seek to explain and predict public attitudes and purchase intentions regarding nano-foods. Such studies have investigated the roles of demographics and sociographics, value predispositions toward science and technology, preferences for natural products, trust in regulatory agencies, science knowledge, and media attention. This large-scale survey-based study granularly assesses the role of each of these factors and improves the predictive models by further evaluating concepts from Protection Motivation Theory in OLS regression models. Findings demonstrate that the incorporation of threat- and coping-appraisals provide the most predictive and explanative models to date with regards to attitudes and purchase intentions of nano-food products.","Factors Shaping Relationships Between Attitudes, Intentions and Behavior",Health Communication

Yet, a majority of eligible individuals do not receive the HPV vaccine, a deficiency that is especially pronounced among males. Prior studies suggest that the anti-vaccination movement may also be stymieing vaccine uptake. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the roles of gender and the term “vaccine” in impacting the antecedents for health decision-making, as described by the theory of planned behavior. Gender significantly impacted all three antecedents of the intent to receive the HPV vaccine (p < 0.0001 in all cases). The terminology used to describe the vaccine did not have a statistically significant effect. These results illustrate the breadth of the gender gap in HPV vaccine adoption suggested by previous studies, which has significant implications for scholars and practitioners alike.","Factors Shaping Relationships Between Attitudes, Intentions and Behavior",Health Communication

Allocators “earned” 7 dollars and divided the money between themselves and recipient and communicated the decision either face-to-face or through text chat. Recipients were unaware the amount the allocator had, and therefore, allocators could deceive. Most allocators used deception. We hypothesized participants who self-identified as good liars would communicate more face-to-face than through text chat when deceiving, and this was supported for deceptive omission, but not lies. Good liars were more likely to have their truths correctly detected than bad liars.","Interpersonally Influencing, Persuading, and Deceiving",Interpersonal Communication

This initial model is consistent with a number of theoretical explanations for the influence of social groups and normative influence on behavior (e.g., social identity theories, theory on social norms, process of identification). The major constructs and assumptions of this initial model are outlined. The exact predictions that are derived and tested specify a monotonic interaction of membership and desired affiliation for conformity to ICNI. Across two studies—a survey and an experiment—preliminary evidence is presented that is consistent with the model. Implications of the observed data, limitations of the studies, and routes for further developing the conceptual model are also discussed.","Interpersonally Influencing, Persuading, and Deceiving",Interpersonal Communication

Participants were assigned the role of allocator or recipient in an ultimatum game. Allocators received money based on their performance on a task and made an offer. Recipients did not have information about allocator’s task performance or amount the allocator received, and therefore, allocators could deceive. Liars provided more plausible details to support their offer by stating the structure of their task; this strategy backfired and led to more detection of lies. Truth-tellers were more likely to disclose advantageous information about their endowment of money in their justifications, and this reduced suspicion in their offers. Deceivers used more wrap-up questions to end the interaction; this did not help reduce partner suspicion. Asking questions in general did not improve detection accuracy.","Interpersonally Influencing, Persuading, and Deceiving",Interpersonal Communication

The advice was either permitted (participant was asked if they wanted advice and said yes), guaranteed (participant just given advice without asking if they wanted it), or imposed (participant said they did not want advice, but advice was given anyways). Overall, participants had more intention to use and higher ratings of permitted advice than guaranteed or, especially, imposed advice. There were no effects of power on solicited or guaranteed advice. However, high power participants had lower intentions than low power participants to use imposed advice, especially when they disclosed a more personal and difficult problem.","Interpersonally Influencing, Persuading, and Deceiving",Interpersonal Communication
2017-1075,2017,Paper Session,"Mindfulness, Conflict Strategy Use, and Relational Satisfaction: A Dyadic Investigation",2,"Mindfulness consists of the capacity to nonjudgmentally attend to present-moment thought and experience. Research suggests that the capacity to be mindful is positively associated with constructive conflict strategy use, and negatively associated with destructive conflict strategy use, when interacting with a romantic partner. Nevertheless conflict interactions are inherently dyadic thus signifying the importance of investigating whether self- capacity for mindfulness is associated with partner’s conflict strategy use. The current study assesses dyadic outcomes pertaining to couples’ trait-mindfulness, conflict strategy use, and relational satisfaction. Actor-partner interdependence models suggest that actor trait-mindfulness positively predicts actors’ use of compromise, while partner mindfulness negatively predicts actors’ use of dominance and reactivity. Results also suggest that partner mindfulness positively predicts actor relational satisfaction. In addition, actor compromise predicts actor relational satisfaction while actor dominance and reactivity negatively predict actor relational satisfaction. Implications and future research are discussed from a dyadic perspective.","Interpersonally Influencing, Persuading, and Deceiving",Interpersonal Communication
2017-1076,2017,Paper Session,"Sex, Lies, and Dating Advice: The Use of Collins’ Controlling Images in Black-Oriented Relationship Advice Media",1,"Starting as books and morphing into television shows and movies, Black oriented relationship advice (BORA) media represent, report on, and advise the sex, dating, and relationship lives of Black women. Prior work exploring BORA media has examined representations of Black men within the genre, highlighting how hegemonic masculinity guides male performances to the detriment of Black relationships. Yet to be done is an examination of the representation of Black women in BORA media. Using critical discourse analysis and Collins’ controlling images of Black women as analytical tools, the current paper examines the representation of Black women in three New York Times best-selling books and the BORA media properties they have spawned. Initial analyses found that BORA media rely on stereotypes of Black women, prescribing rigid gender roles as the solution to Black women’s singleness.","Reflecting, Representing, Resisting: Portrayals of Gender in Film, TV, Advertisement, News Media, and Advice Media",Feminist Scholarship

Using a critical textual analysis to interrogate mainstream newspapers, magazines, and blogs, this study identified three major themes used to discuss the sororities: (a) stereotypes; (b) shaming; and (c) behavior regulation. Using the feminist theories of gender construction, symbolic annihilation, and double binds, this paper argues that these themes worked to further marginalize a very specific group of women throughout the United States.","Reflecting, Representing, Resisting: Portrayals of Gender in Film, TV, Advertisement, News Media, and Advice Media",Feminist Scholarship
2017-1078,2017,Paper Session,"“This Reporter is so Ugly, How Can She Appear on TV?” Negotiating Gender Online and Offline in Taiwanese Media",2,"In Taiwan, 20 professional journalists were interviewed, to understand how they negotiate gender and professional identities online and offline through the lens of Shoemaker and Reese’s media routines. The findings suggest that while Taiwanese women journalists found that gender in some aspects of reporting was an asset but gendered harassment online and incivility are issues they have to contend with. Comments on stories and professional identities online primarily focused on their looks and physical attributes and were openly uncivil. Such incivility affected normal journalistic routines and prevented them from being impartial purveyors of information. Online incivility and cultural norms that except women to be subservient deterred them from promoting stories on personal social media and negatively affected their coverage of controversial issues. Although the study’s primary focus is on Taiwan, the analysis is applicable beyond national boundaries.","Reflecting, Representing, Resisting: Portrayals of Gender in Film, TV, Advertisement, News Media, and Advice Media",Feminist Scholarship
2017-1079,2017,Paper Session,Images That Divide: Faith and Feminism in Television and Film,2,"This paper explores the divide between women of faith and feminism as presented in television and film. The purpose of this paper is to describe the tropes that dominate media portrayals of White Protestant women found in television and film since the 1990’s and to discern the ways that these tropes function to define and reinforce patriarchal structures in society. As a symptom of the cultural cleavage between faith and feminism, this paper identifies five harmful media tropes of religious female figures: The Cult Member, the Goody Two Shoes, the “Fallen” Rebel, the Preacher’s Wife and the Conservative Extremist. These tropes create the impression that religious values are necessarily at odds with the feminist movement; that women of faith are naturally oppressed by their religion; and that leadership, autonomy, and sexual expression are anathema to Christian faith. This artificial division weakens the feminist movement demographically, and diminishes white Protestant women’s capacity to claim their rightful power within their homes and churches. Both of these tendencies serve to reinforce the patriarchal structures in society. A richer, more honest representation of the lived experience of white, Protestant women in American would contribute to the potential for understanding and cooperation between women of faith and feminists.","Reflecting, Representing, Resisting: Portrayals of Gender in Film, TV, Advertisement, News Media, and Advice Media",Feminist Scholarship

Design: To evaluate CT, a pre-/post-test with randomized intervention and matched control sites was used. At both baseline and endline, 600 individuals aged 18-59 were interviewed in the control sites and 600 in the intervention sites.
Results: Multivariate logistic analysis controlling for background characteristics found that CT attendance was significantly and positively associated with improved nutrition-related knowledge (OR: 7.4, p<0.001), communication (OR 2.3, p<0.001), hand washing after cleaning a defecating child (OR: 1.49, p<0.05), feeding children eggs (OR: 1.83, p<0.01), and feeding children meat and/or fish (OR: 2.10, p<0.01).
Conclusions: This is the first study to rely on a pre-post matched intervention- control design to assess CT effects in a low-income setting. These findings support the continued and expanded use of CT as a valuable community-based, public health approach.",Development Communication in the 21st Century,Global Communication and Social Change

2017-1082,2017,Paper Session,Sen’s Capabilities Approach and the Measurement of Communication Outcomes,1,"Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach to development defines development as an increase in freedoms citizens have to choose preferred development options. While Sen’s more recent writings are theoretical and philosophical his work is originally based in social choice theory, which comprises a rich tradition in quantifying and analyzing collective preferences, or choices. The paper argues that such aggregation procedures can be useful in C4D research and project efforts. They can be employed in evaluating the outcomes of processes intended to facilitate participation in decision making, in both small and large-scale change settings. Part I reviews Sen’s capabilities approach at a conceptual level with special attention to the approach’s treatment of communication. Methods of social choice analysis are introduced in Part II, focusing on the way that these methods reflect the capability approach’s conceptual framework.

Communication synchronization is the alignment of global and local communication policies consequent to the interplay between major agents across national borders, including the expert communities and institutions, media, civil societies, and states. As global-local interactions intensify, the pressure to adjust the national communication system will continue to mount until some alignment is made. The state plays an important role in making the local-global connection and in translating the local-global pressures into the application of the transparency principle. A brief examination of how China has handled recent pandemics has led us to conclude that the transparency policy introduced during the SARS crisis has indeed been routinized and institutionalized. The limitations and generalizability of the model are discussed.",Development Communication in the 21st Century,Global Communication and Social Change

In an experimental study, we found that depending on how news described an issue in terms of gender or partisan conflict, the outcome varied from gender polarization via gender self-stereotyping to partisan polarization via party self-stereotyping. Despite concerns that varying focus of news stories threat the internal validity of conflict frames, no confounding effects of motivated reasoning and affective priming were found.",Issues in Framing Research,Mass Communication
2017-1086,2017,Paper Session,Between Accommodating and Activating: Framing Policy Reforms in Response to Workforce Aging Across Europe,2,"In the past decade, European governments have implemented activating policy reforms to maximize older workers’ employability. This study isolates the factors that explain the relative success and failure of competitive frames that are either in favor of or against activating policies in European news coverage, by applying time-series analysis (OLS-PCSE) to monthly-aggregated news coverage in The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, Denmark, and Spain over the timespan 2006 – 2013. The results show that pro-activating and counter-activating frames coincide in competitive framing environments. The pro-activating frame proliferated in times of high employment protection, while the counter-activating frame prevailed in conservative newspapers, gained momentum during the aftermath of the financial crisis and in times governments on the economic left were in power. The findings add to the understanding of the factors that contribute to news representations that promote active aging, which may foster support for policy reforms that sustain older workers’ employability.",Issues in Framing Research,Mass Communication
2017-1087,2017,Paper Session,Dual Framing in a Campaign Against Child Poverty: The Effects of Juxtaposing Frames and Counterframes,3,"A major gap in most experimental research on framing effects is that stimuli often contain only one frame. In this between-subjects post-test only experiment, a representative sample of the Belgian population (N = 1000) rated four versions of a professionally designed campaign on combatting child poverty. In two conditions, only a single deproblematizing counterframe was present. In the two other conditions, the deproblematizing counterframe was combined with a problematizing frame. The results show that all versions were equally strong. One counterframe resulted in remarkable significant effects, even when controlling for ten background variables. The counterframe The alarm clock increased societal attributions of poverty, rendered attitudes towards welfare more favorable and motivated people to actually donate money. Juxtaposition nullified the effects of The alarm clock, but also decreased blaming poverty on bad luck. This supports the assumption that the combination of multiple frames can lead to unique effects.",Issues in Framing Research,Mass Communication

The study investigated the presence and possible predictors of a gender bias in the newscasts of the Austrian public service broadcaster ORF covering all four Austrian parliamentary election campaigns between 2002 and 2013. Regarding frequency and amount of speaking time, the analysis discovered an enduring gender bias in coverage of MP candidates. Results of multivariate analyses of possible predictors relating to both, the media and the political side show, that the bias persists even after controlling for some of the most important criteria of media logic such as prominence, non-political celebrity, parliamentary experience, and age – thus reaffirming findings of other studies. Based on the assumption that candidates' news releases indicate the parties' support for some candidates as frontrunners of the campaign, the findings also reveal that political PR primarily works in favor of male candidates.",International Approaches to Women and Politics,Political Communication

Our goal was to examine whether differences between the coverage of the stories of female and male perpetrators exist, or whether all perpetrators are simply grouped together and depicted as a single common enemy. In other words, does the ethnocentric frame hold consistently or do gender considerations overpower? Findings indicate that there are significant differences in the manner by which male and female perpetrators were covered and framed by the media. Articles regarding female perpetrators included more information about the attackers themselves (and not just the attack as was done for males). This information referred to the perpetrators' personal, familial and mental states. Moreover information was given regarding their motives, which were mostly ideological, but also mental and personal problems driven (more than males). Unlike previous studies, we failed to find an emphasis of the female perpetrator physical appearance. For both male and female perpetrators there was minimal information regarding their look. A possible explanation may come from the dominance of the ethnic framing exemplified by the Israeli media.",International Approaches to Women and Politics,Political Communication

The reality of online discussions among users is, however, characterized by a high degree of incivility. Based on a quantitative content analysis of journalistic articles and corresponding user comments, we seek to analyze the impact of external, content-related, discussion-related, and situational factors on the amount of rationality and incivility in online user comments. Our results indicate that especially the factors important in the immediate situation of commenting are relevant in explaining a rude or reasoning tone of a user comment. Additionally, we analyze the interrelation of the single elements constituting a rational or uncivil tone and show that these styles of commenting in online discussions cannot be regarded in terms of perfect antagonisms.",Incivility and Online Discussions,Communication and Technology
2017-1094,2017,Paper Session,Intergroup Incivility in Online Spaces: Fostering Deliberative Ideals Through Rebuke and Endorsements,3,"The negative effects of aggressive communication threaten democratic ideal. Incivility can be found in all forms of human interaction, but online spaces seem to particularly afford anti-social behaviors. De-individuation research suggests this is because reduced social cues make intergroup identity salient while limiting negative consequences for uncivil behavior. Because of the prevalence of uncivil communication, we test whether rewarding or punishing incivility increases or decreases the effects of negative intergroup encounters. We find enforcement of civility norms increases tolerance, but this effect is only significant if civility norms are enforced among ingroup members. By contrast, rewarding or punishing does not change tolerance levels when among outgroup members. We also link norm enforcement and increased tolerance to greater intention to participate in future discussions. When civil norms are promoted, tolerance increases which promotes intentions to discuss issues in the future. We discuss theoretical applications and the potential to improve online discussion.",Incivility and Online Discussions,Communication and Technology

In these settings, incivility is often flagged as a problematic feature of computer-mediated discussions. In this paper, I argue that uncivil discourse is not necessarily bad for democracy and is strategically used in online political talk. To make this claim, I draw a conceptual difference between incivility and political intolerance, with the former referring to rules of interaction and the latter referring to behaviors that are threatening to democracy. I employ content analysis to examine online discussion triggered by exposure to political news on Facebook, news websites and political blogs.

We find that the volume of synthetic biology keyword tweets set the agenda for synthetic biology for certain newspapers, within certain parameters. This effect was bi-directional, as newspapers also set the agenda for Twitter discourse about synthetic biology.

The relationship between LinkedIn use and the perceived social capital on LinkedIn was also examined. Data were gathered from a sample of 459 Linkedln users in mainland China. The results show that users are usually motivated to use LinkedIn for the purposes of gathering information related to their jobs, seeking the feeling of belongingness, developing and enlarging their professional network, and expanding their career. Career expansion and information learning may lead them to use LinkedIn more intensively. Extraversion was found to be a significant predictor of all four factors of gratification; people who were more agreeable tended to seek the feeling of belongingness and expand their career; conscientiousness was found to be a significant predictor of those seeking belongingness; more neurotic people were found to use LinkedIn for information learning, the feeling of belongingness, and career expansion; openness to experience was negatively related to the gratification of information learning. Furthermore, self-efficacy was found to be positively related to information learning. As expected, LinkedIn use was found to be a good method to increase both the bonding and bridging aspects of social capital.

In this study we investigate whether using social media as a source of news compensates for not using traditional news media in terms of political learning. We also analyze whether learning political news from social media depends on citizens’ preexisting political interest and general political knowledge. Using two panel studies conducted in two different political contexts – an Election setting and a Non-Election setting – the results show positive learning effects from using traditional news media and online news websites, but not from using social media. Taken together, the findings therefore suggest that using social media to follow news about politics and current affairs does not compensate for traditional news media in terms of learning a diverse and broad set of general political news.",Political Effects of Social Media,Mass Communication

This method allows us to ask participants about breaking events as it happens, and to connect knowledge of current events to self-reports of media use during a very short time period. We also compare the effect of self-reported media use via specific news genres on knowledge to measures of volume of attention to each event on television news, in newspaper sources, and via the rate of Facebook shares of related stories.

2017-1105,2017,Paper Session,Influence of Viewing Movies on Intentions to Adhere to Sexual Consent,2,"Young people are frequent consumers of movies (Fetto, 2010), and media scholars have been concerned about the potential effects of viewing sex and violence content in movies on young people’s sexual health, such as their intentions to adhere to partners’ sexual consent decisions. Particularly, X-rated movies, horror movies, and romantic comedy movies contain different themes, which could affect people differently. In addition, previous studies have suggested that individual factors such as perceived realism and rape myth acceptance can mediate the relationship between media consumption and sexual health outcomes (e.g., Hust et al, 2013; Peter & Valkenburg, 2010). Therefore, the present study collected data from 299 college student using online survey to examine the potential effects of viewing X-rated movies, horror movies, and romantic comedy movies on their intentions to adhere to partners’ sexual consent decisions, and whether this relationship is mediated by perceived realism and rape myth acceptance. Findings from the structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested that the perceived realism, rape myth acceptance, viewing romantic comedy movies, and gender were significantly associated with intention to adhere. The negative relationship between viewing X-rated movies and intentions were fully mediated by rape myth acceptance. Implications of those findings on building intervention programs are discussed later.","Media, Romance, Relationship",Mass Communication

The Effect Parasocial Romantic Relationships in Adolescence on Romantic Beliefs and Experiences,2,"Past research has documented an association between exposure to romantically themed media and romantic beliefs. Building on these findings, the current study examines the association between adolescents’ parasocial romantic relationships (PSRRs) with media figures, idealized romantic beliefs, perceptions of a current romantic partner, and relationship satisfaction. A two-study design included concurrent response data from a national sample of adolescents (ages 13-17), and retrospective data from a young adult sample. Across both age groups, PSRRs were related to more idealized romantic beliefs. Additionally, the intensity of PSRRs in adolescence was associated with lower relationship satisfaction and less favorable perceptions of a current romantic partner in young adults. These findings suggest that the highly prevalent media phenomenon of PSRRs might play a role in the romantic development of adolescents and could have implications for relationships later on in life.","Media, Romance, Relationship",Mass Communication
2017-1107,2017,Paper Session,The Bridget Jones Effect: The Relationship Between Romantic Television Viewing and Fear of Being Single Among Emerging Adults,3,"Although studies have suggested that a fear of being single may affect how people deal with romantic relationships (e.g., being more dependent on less satisfying relationships), less is known about what exactly causes such a fear. In this study, television exposure was put forward as one of the candidate predictors. Based on cultivation theory, we hypothesized that individuals’ exposure to romantic television content would be significantly positively related to their fear of being single. Analyses on a cross-sectional sample of 821 emerging adults (18-25 years old) did not show a significant overall relationship between romantic television viewing and fear of being single, but moderation results indicated that this relationship did occur for females who were single themselves. Suggesting that romantic television content might contribute to the fear of being single only for specific members of the genre’s audience, these findings could have general implications for theorizing on cultivation-type media effects.","Media, Romance, Relationship",Mass Communication

The current study examined how exposure to a depiction of relationship infidelity on television influenced viewers’ responses to hypothetical infidelity and other relational transgressions. In a laboratory experiment, young adults were exposed to a media narrative featuring either a romantic relationship, the same relationship but with one partner engaging in sex outside the relationship, or a control narrative before completing measures of reactions to hypothetical relationship transgressions and measures of moral module salience and perceived norms. Results indicated that exposure to infidelity negatively influenced people’s tolerance for relational transgressions.","Media, Romance, Relationship",Mass Communication
2017-1109,2017,Paper Session,Knowing is Not Loving: Media Effects on Knowledge About and Attitudes Toward the EU,4,"Media provide the public with facts and information related to events on the level of the European Union. This information may alter individuals’ perceptions, ultimately resulting in attitude change toward the EU. Knowledge gains may indeed be an important mediator in this process. We present data from a recent study in the context of the 2016 EU Bratislava summit in which the Heads of the Union’s states discussed the outcome of the Brexit vote and the future of the EU. A two-wave panel survey was complemented with a content analysis of newspaper articles related to the summit. Our results show that when attending to news about the Bratislava meeting, citizens attain event-related knowledge which negatively affects both their evaluation of the EU’s performance as well as their feelings of negative affection toward the Union. We discuss our findings in light of the role media play in informing the European citizenry.",Knowledge Gaps and Knowledge Gains,Political Communication
2017-1110,2017,Paper Session,"Learning About Current Affairs: Traditional News, Infotainment, and New Media’s Impact on the Knowledge Gap",2,"Formulated in the “knowledge gap hypothesis,” scholars fear that some citizens become less knowledgeable about political affairs than others as the consequence of chances in the media landscape. Especially now traditional news media’s popularity is waning and new (plat)forms of news have emerged, investigating this phenomenon is important. This study employs a three-wave panel survey (n=3,240) to analyze how exposure to different kinds of media affects knowledge gain. Whereas exposure to hard news, satire, online news and Twitter positively affects knowledge; knowledge does not rise with increased exposure to newspapers, soft news and Facebook. Moderation analysis, though, shows that increased exposure to hard television news only positively affects the knowledge of citizens with little politics interest (i.e., leveling the knowledge gap). Mediation analysis, however, demonstrates that it are especially the politically interested citizens who expose themselves to the media that cause knowledge gain (i.e., amplifying the knowledge gap).",Knowledge Gaps and Knowledge Gains,Political Communication

How Informal Talk Affects Adolescents’ Political Learning From the News Media",2,"With an increasing number of young people turning away from traditional news sources, an important question for democracy is whether alternative sources can help learning about politics. In this study we examine to what extent informal political talk narrows or widens knowledge gaps amongst adolescents by compensating those with low news media use, amplifying news media effects amongst those with high news media use, or confusing those with high news media use. To test these different potentials, we take advantage of a four-wave panel study fielded ahead of the Danish National Election in 2015 among a representative sample of Danish first-time voters (age 17–21). Our results show that informal political talk functions as a compensator by informing those with low news use about current political affairs. Further, our results show that in particular online news media sources are important for informing the young generation of citizens about politics.",Knowledge Gaps and Knowledge Gains,Political Communication

Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory, it empirically tests a theoretical model of crisis attribution and emotional reaction with two antecedents (i.e., individualizing moral and binding moral) on three outcomes (i.e., crisis attribution, emotions, and boycott intention), using more than 4000 samples from four culturally-diverse countries - the US, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The study finds strong correlation between individualizing moral foundation and attribution and emotions, which turned out valid in all four countries. However, the effect of binding moral foundations was multifaceted. In all four countries, it directly inhibits boycott intentions while invoking negative emotions, with the exception of Malaysia which our findings found no influence on crisis attribution.

2017-1115,2017,Paper Session,Why Dialogue Cannot be Made Mandatory,1,"Dialogue is a form of communication that has long been valorized in theory and practice. In recent times, governments have begun to make the conduct of dialogue mandatory through legislation that requires organizations to undertake dialogue as part of the development approvals process. This paper considers what happens when dialogue takes place between organizations and stakeholders because it is mandated. The research concludes that mandatory dialogue (MD) is, in fact, a form of two-way communication differing from normative conceptualizations of dialogue in every characteristic. This leaves academics with two choices: Option 1 is to maintain that dialogue means one very specific form of two-way communication, and insist the label of ‘dialogue’ is applied only to that form. This would require changes to the education and training of practitioners. Alternatively, Option 2 is that we accept that the meaning of dialogue encompasses non-normative forms and develop new models and theories accordingly.",Top Faculty Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

A content analysis of 353 news articles, editorials and columns, and news broadcasts shows reform feminism was the most common ideology described in mainstream news, consistent with past studies. In contrast to past literature, however, the most common frame used across the 50-year period was that feminism was explicitly necessary. When articles did frame feminism negatively, they were most often about third-wave feminism or radical feminism. Though coverage of feminism throughout the entire period was limited, when feminist activism and ideology were covered, it was typically within a positive framework.","Quo Vadis Herstory?

Interpreting Du Châtelet's oeuvre in this way serves to add a neglected and often overlooked link in the history of an embodied feminist epistemology that plays an increasingly larger role in communication and media studies. In particular, I argue that her emphasis on experience as part of the experimental process for natural philosophy serves as an early example of feminist epistemology. Further, understanding her particular emphasis on experience has potential for suggesting new ways of incorporating experiential emphasis in communication and media studies projects.","Quo Vadis Herstory?

While utilizing Goffman’s Gender Advertisements (1979) as an analytical framework, the study focuses on the visual legacy of gender ritualization that is salient in contemporary mass media, proposing five semiotic codes to concretely analyze it. Although Goffman’s gender posing is traditionally associated with female vulnerability and indolence, the study proposes that such qualities are exploited as indicators of luxury within Western visual culture and advertising specifically. It seeks to deconstruct and re-frame the interconnected connotations of luxury and gender display, both expanding Goffman’s framework and providing a unique interpretive resource for critical readers of media texts.","Quo Vadis Herstory?

2017-1119,2017,Paper Session,Discourse Analysis of Modern Motherhood Constructed in Fuyou Magazine in the 1960s,1,"In the 1950s, after World War II, the Kuomintang (KMT) took over Taiwan. To reinforce the differences between the “free” and the “communist worlds,” KMT rebelled against China. The Kuomintang Women’s Working Committee published Fuyou monthly to propagandize women’s policy, encourage women to work, and improve women’s lives. This study examines Fuyou monthly from the perspective of modernity. The study shows that there were two kinds of discourse about motherhood knowledge. One emphasized raising a child with an understanding of medical science and child psychology, and the other stresses how to be a mother under national development. The study suggests that scientific motherhood and motherhood under nationalism have been both constructed as modern and advanced, which indicates that Taiwan's modernization is not really as advanced, revolutionary, and anti-traditional as the West describes, but is mingled with the Oriental traditions that demand mothers to perform chores and stay at home.","Quo Vadis Herstory?

2017-1120,2017,Paper Session,Going to the Cinema and Experiencing Modernity,1,"This paper explores how Koreans experienced modernity by going to the cinema during the 1920s and 1930s during the country’s colonization by Japan. More specifically, first, this paper examines the implications of watching movies in Korea during the 1920s and 1930s. Second, it describes how the Korean context, such colonization and traditional culture, interfered in Korean spectatorship. Third, it explores how female audiences experienced modernity via Hollywood cinema. I mainly review articles that examine movies and culture in the 1920s and 1930s in Korea movies, and conceptualize the intersection between going to the cinema and experiencing modernity. Going to the cinema was promoted as an instrument of enlightenment in Korea. Beginning in the mid-1920s, Korean audiences enjoyed movies for their entertainment, in particular Hollywood movies. Korean audiences experienced watching a movie in combination of live performances based on a movie narrator. In this process, going to the cinema was localized by oral culture, Korean language, and the way by which the screening of the movie played a role in providing a place for the unification and division of Korean audiences. For young, female, Korean audiences, going to the cinema was a modern experience in which females escaped from the dual oppression of the public sphere occupied by the Japanese government and the private sphere controlled by Korean males.","Quo Vadis Herstory?

One aspect of the pedagogy tied to diversity courses is their direct discussion of meritocracy issues. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of diversity course enrollment on both prescriptive and descriptive meritocracy. Results demonstrated that the diversity course engendered a decrease in descriptive meritocracy over the course of the semester relative to both (within-subject) pretest levels and (between-subject) control group participants. In addition, among the eight correlates tested, three were found to be associated with descriptive meritocracy (i.e., socio-economic status, social dominance orientation, and race). Results revealed limited evidence that changes in descriptive meritocracy beliefs were related to changes in interracial dialogue. Overall, the study demonstrated that diversity course enrollment functions to mitigate ideological intolerance, but not to necessarily increase ideological tolerance.",Top Paper Panel,Instructional & Developmental Communication

One hundred and ninety eight undergraduate students were randomly assigned to read one of two versions of a teaching philosophy. One version primed students to view education as a workout experience and the other version primed students to view education as a consumer experience. Results showed that students in the consumer condition were more likely to frame their relationship with the instructor as one similar to a service provider and customer, and thus have higher AE. On the other hand, participants in the workout condition were more likely to view their relationship with the instructor in the academic trainer-trainee frame and consequently reported lower levels of AE.

2017-1126,2017,Paper Session,Using Social Interaction Trace Data to Assess Collaboration Quality and Creative Fluency in Collaborative Design Environments,6,"Engineering design predominantly takes place in collaborative settings situated in particular contexts. Therefore, it is critical to study both micro-level collaborative interaction processes as well as macro-level spatial and material contexts to promote quality design outcomes and environments. However, research examining interaction dynamics in specific contexts has been limited. Studying interaction dynamics has been difficult due to time and reliability challenges of manual collection and analysis procedures. In this study, we use wearable sociometric badges to automatically and unobtrusively collect conversational and speech dynamics data, including turns taken, successful interrupts, and overlaps. Drawing from situative learning theory, our framework develops two analytic lenses to broaden theoretical insights into engineering and design learning: (a) the social and material context, and (b) the role of activities and interactions. Using a 2x2 design, we randomly assigned engineering graduate students to four conditions varying the material context (Paper vs. Tablet sketching tools) and spatial environment (Commons vs. Standard room). Participants worked collaboratively to generate multiple design ideas for a toy design. Results from 2-stage regression models indicate that while spatial and material contexts did not predict outcomes, social interaction dynamics were highly significant in predicting both collaboration quality and creative fluency. This finding provides important insights about processual factors in collaborative design learning, and for understanding the predictive role of conversation dynamics. We discuss the theoretical contributions to situative learning in collaborative design, the methodological contributions of wearable sensor methods, and the practical contributions to designing collaborative design environments.",B.E.S.T.: Networks and Social Media,Organizational Communication

Highlighting the paradoxical influences of communication visibility, afforded by the use of enterprise social media, this study delves into the ways in which workers in diverse groups interact with one another for knowledge sharing and collaboration. Drawing on in-depth interview data (N = 32) and online observation data, the analysis revealed that dispersed workers’ communicative acts served as constitutive forces that shape and were shaped by existing status hierarchies. Increased communication visibility enabled distributed workers to obtain needed knowledge; however, it simultaneously brought into relief knowledge disparities between high-status and low-status workers, thereby sustaining status hierarchies. This study contributes to advancing our understanding of the complex relationships between communication practice, material arrangements, and structural hierarchies that jointly constitute the process of knowing.",B.E.S.T.: Networks and Social Media,Organizational Communication

Results demonstrate the presence of a paradox, as social media for work facilitates autonomy as well as work pressure, both of which in turn relate to well being (exhaustion and engagement). This study adds to our understanding of technological paradoxes by examining the conditionality of these opposing effects. Overall, employees seem more likely to be burdened by the use of social media for work than benefit from it. However, responsiveness moderates the positive effects of social media use for work, though does not moderate the negative effects.",B.E.S.T.: Networks and Social Media,Organizational Communication

Increasingly, material features of SMTs allow their users to use SMTs in conjunction, thereby impacting social and material relations with so far unexplored consequences for organizing processes. For a rich understanding, this study draws on socio-materiality theory and ethnographic methods to investigate the hybrid use of multiple SMTs in two organizations. The contributions of the study are twofold: Firstly, the findings detect socio-material practices of cross-association (‘exporting’ data across platforms) and cross-integration (‘importing’ content across technologies) that are specific to hybrid SMTs use. Such practices make disconnected and mutable interactions from multiple and disparate locales to merge into communicative events (i.e., mashups). Secondly, the findings show that mashups develop ordering and disordering agency as these are used by human and non-human agents (hashtags, trolls, bots and algorithms) in an interconnected manner. This study advances organizational research by providing analytical and methodological insights concerning how SMTs introduce interconnected and hybrid forms of organizing in which multiple actors are tied together.",B.E.S.T.: Networks and Social Media,Organizational Communication

At the same time, research shows that connection to diverse individuals is a necessary, but insufficient condition for realizing these benefits. Beyond connection, individuals must develop some understanding of their alters’ areas of expertise in order to integrate knowledge. While the importance of this “interactional expertise” (IE) has been shown qualitatively, few studies have examined the structural properties of this construct. We present an egocentric network analysis of scientists’ collaboration networks, exploring the prevalence of interdisciplinary ties and IE. Our results demonstrate that although members of this organization strive for cross-disciplinary collaboration, pressures toward homophily and siloed networks constrained connection to diverse alters. Further, lower tendencies to engage in dialogue with diverse alters hindered the development of IE.

A focus on engagement expands interorganizational networks from a weak-strong tie continuum to one of engaged communicative processes. Interorganizational networks are a function of exchange of resources, information flows, and strategic partnerships, yet the relationship (network tie, in network parlance) is most often assessed in terms of its strength. For organizations, ties might be manifested through personal to more institutionalized arrangements. This paper argues that the nature of interorganizational ties is more complex and argues that ties vary in terms of degrees of engagement, with implications for broader systems within which those ties exist.

2017-1144,2017,Paper Session,Seeking the Perfect Persuasive Intervention: The Effects of Vividness and Perspective on Transportation in Health Narratives,1,"Health communication practitioners are faced with growing concerns regarding the effectiveness of health narratives to encourage pro-health behaviors. Health narratives are seen as interventions to assist individuals with health issues, however there is little agreement on how to create effective health narratives that contribute to the health of society. This study attempts to shed new light on how to create effective health narratives by examining how narrative (story) attributes and individual (personal) attributes contribute to the transportation process and overall persuasiveness of narrative health communications. A 2x2x4 experimental design was employed to collect self-report and psychophysiological data was collected. Findings from the study revealed that together vividness and perspective are significant variables that influence transportation and ultimately the persuasiveness of a health narrative. Individuals who were exposed to the figural vividness and third person health narratives experienced a higher degree of transportation than those participants who were exposed to the ground vividness and first person health narratives. Participants who were exposed to the figural vividness and third person manipulations exhibited increased attention as well as arousal.

Study 1 (N = 341) was an exploratory survey of adults living in the U.S. aimed at assessing perceptions of when women reach peak fertility, are no longer fertile, and reach an ideal age for pregnancy. Results revealed that perceptions about fertility were generally consistent with the scientific literature with one exception: participants overestimated the length of a woman’s fertility window. Study 2 (N= 688) was conducted to examine if the results from Study 1 could be replicated among an older sample of adults. Results of Study 2 were nearly identical to the results of Study 1.

Previous literature shows that long-term exposure to air pollution can cause a variety of negative effects on public health, and children are particularly vulnerable to air pollutants. This study used a mixed methods approach to explore how Chinese parents perceive and respond to this problem. First, we analyzed 654 Weibo online posts by parents from several mega-cities to investigate the relationship between parents’ efficacy beliefs and the amount of protective behaviors adopted. Second, twelve semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted to understand parents’ perceptions about the influences of air pollution on their children’s health, their information seeking strategies, and the protective behaviors they practiced. Results showed that most parents perceived air pollution having negative influences on their children’s physical and mental health, and they used different strategies to protect their children. The amount and type of strategies they used were moderated by their reported self-efficacy and response efficacy. The Extended Parallel Process Model served as a theoretical framework of the study.",Public Perceptions and Social Constructions of Health Risks and Disease,Health Communication
2017-1148,2017,Paper Session,“Is It Bullying?” The Construction of School Bullying,1,"Efforts to prevent bullying in schools have grown drastically, yet discussing behaviors that constitute what is and is not deemed as bullying have not kept up to pace. Olweus’ (1993) definition of bullying is the most widely cited and consists of four dimensions: 1) aggression, 2) intent to harm, 3) power imbalance, and 4) repetitive behaviors. Yet, there have been recent discussions about whether these dimensions indeed are characteristic of bullying. This paper explores how students (N = 640), state laws (N = 50), and bullying organizations (N = 10) conceptualize bullying based on the four dimensions. Findings reveal that the only common thread among these definitions is that bullying involves aggression, whereas there are differences in definitions for intent, power, and repetition. These results help shape the concept of bullying, and offer future research about whether and how bullying definitions influence perceptions of bullying normality and seeking help behaviors.",Public Perceptions and Social Constructions of Health Risks and Disease,Health Communication

This paper examines a variety of factors that determine such ratings and compares their impacts on audiences in the world’s top two movie markets, the US and China, using big data gathered from the Internet. Significant predictors of film ratings were found to be the film’s year of release, whether it was adapted from a novel, whether it was based on a true story, its “likes” on Facebook, its production budget, its MPAA ratings, its awards, its “star power”, the presence of Chinese stars, and the interaction of the country of origin with Chinese filming locations, Chinese language, and Chinese stars; however, box office success and sequels were found to be insignificant predictors.

Drawing on ideational approaches to policy analysis, this paper explains how and why the BBC came to conceive of BBC Studios as serving its long-term interests. It considers how BBC strategists engaged with dominant ideas in UK broadcasting policy on the economic value of the creative industries and the benefits of competition and outsourcing for creativity in television production. It shows how changes to the institutional context over the past three decades, predicated on these very ideas, have constrained BBC’s room for manoeuvre. The main arguments put forward – the BBC’s growing reliance on economic arguments to justify its value and the path-dependent effects at work pushing the BBC towards advocating an institutional solution entailing the further hollowing out of its publicly-funded structures – are relevant to wider debates on the future role and institutional form of public service media.",Regulation and Policy in Media Industry Operation,Media Industry Studies

The rural poor in the agrarian sectors of the global South are considered to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts due to the differential global climate change patterns, disproportionate distribution of climate impacting practices, cultural norms that reproduce inequalities, and structurally constituted inequalities in distributions of power that shape access to and control over resources. Situated in the backdrop of India’s agrarian crisis and drawing upon the framework of the culture-centered approach, this paper reports the findings of a grassroots-driven communication intervention co-created in collaboration with poor, lower caste (dalit) women farmers in India. Results of the panel data show that farmers (N=465) exposed to the communication intervention were three times more likely to adopt behaviors consistent with the campaign messages.

It employs a combination of historical and media analysis of the siege to complicate the current sectarian understanding of the Syrian conflict and argue that the construction of walls in previous eras may represent an organizing principle of the material environment of daily life, which in turn acted as a crucial component of the bifurcated and opposing identities cultivated in lived space. The paper revisits the literature on space, place and identity in light of the public reaction to the siege, complicating the view of collective identity and suggesting that the ordering of public space through the construction of walls is inherently a process of othering that may carry consequences for social and political formations in the future.

Ultimately, it provides an empirical lens from which scholars may view social movements as an interaction between place, space, media and society, thereby complicating essentialist explanations of conflict that rely on religious and sectarian binaries. Additionally, this case study presents a useful foundation for the study of the interaction of boundaries, media and society throughout the globe.",Organizing Processes in Global Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change

While this and other such programs frame their interventions as benefitting their recipient countries, I argue that this is only partially the case. Rather, they suggest new ways of conceptualizing local audiovisual industries and media diversity in an era of globalization. In the process, they act as a kind of de facto global cultural policy: “global” as they aim to alter the global audiovisual landscape by integrating regions and countries that do not have strong domestic audiovisual industries into systems based in the global north.

The second part reacts to the finding that while there is much talk about the public and the need to reconnect, little is known about the public’s perception regarding the importance of the idea of “public service” in times of media change. Results of a Swiss representative case study show that people still consider public service highly important in times of the Internet.

Moreover, this study segments video games into two categories: hedonic and utilitarian, and examines the player acceptance of these two types separately. Through a meta-analysis of correlations reported in 52 papers, we found that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived enjoyment are significantly associated with attitude and behavioral intention. The results also demonstrate that perceived enjoyment is the dominant predictor of hedonic game acceptance, while perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are the main determinants of utilitarian game acceptance. Furthermore, we found that respondent type and game platform are significant moderators. Findings of this study provide critical insights into the phenomenon of game acceptance and suggest directions for future research.","Not a Player, Yet?

We position game streaming as a collaborative game play. We first review its history rooted in game play in the public, then define game streaming as the practice of publicly performing (live) or exhibiting (replay) one’s video game play to a digital audience of varying size and presence, with varying levels of interactions between the streamer and spectator and asynchronous levels of entrainment on behalf of the streamer (highly entrained) and spectator (variably entrained) through a streaming platform. A theoretical framework is proposed to situate this definition, borrowing from perspectives in both cultural studies and media psychology. The influence of these three core elements on streamers and audiences’ motivation, information processing, sociality, and performance are discussed as guidelines for future research.","Not a Player, Yet?

Let’s Plays, video content created by communicators who record a session of video game play and add spoken commentary, reach out to large and loyal audiences via online video platforms. The survey reported here explored audience gratifications of watching Let’s Plays and measured the importance of various information, entertainment, social interaction, and personal identity gratifications as well as economic advantages among N = 3530 viewers in Germany. Findings suggest that Let’s Plays are primarily used for entertainment purposes. Cluster analysis revealed, however, that there is substantial heterogeneity in viewers’ primary gratifications. Acquiring information on games and interacting within the community are important gratifications beyond entertainment for some of the six viewer types identified in the data. Moreover, viewers’ video game involvement and their gaming skills explain some of the variance in their primary gratifications. The discussion addresses the hybrid nature of Let’s Plays between games content and non-interactive online entertainment.","Not a Player, Yet? Understanding the Appeal of Video Games",Game Studies
2017-1168,2017,Paper Session,Watching Players: An Exploration of the Drivers of Media Enjoyment Using the Live Video Game Broadcasting Platform Twitch,3,"RESEARCH PAPER. Video game live broadcasting platforms, where users can watch gamers play video games, have reached high popularity within the last years. The most prominent of these portals is Twitch, where users can simultaneously watch the actual video game, the streamer, and additionally interact with the streamer or other viewers by using the chat. This study explored Twitch in regard of its potential to affect media enjoyment due to the high variety of media characteristics and the potential to address basic psychological needs. In an online study, Twitch users (N = 548) were asked about their experiences. Our findings indicate that predominantly social aspects as parasocial relationships and engaging in the chat are drivers of enjoyment. Regarding need satisfaction, the only predictor for enjoyment was the need for autonomy. Findings are discussed regarding Twitch as a multifaceted medium and possible research approaches towards the phenomenon of video game broadcasting.","Not a Player, Yet?

2017-1169,2017,Paper Session,"Gaming-Value and Culture-Value: Understanding Preorder, Sales, and how People Purchase Video Games",2,"STUDENT-LED RESEARCH PAPER
In this paper we explore the motivations behind video game consumers who purchase games in two economically unusual ways. The first is the pre-order, which gives minimal if any additional value to the game being purchased but often comes at a substantially higher price, and the second is the purchasing of large numbers of discounted or on-sale games which players rarely actually get around to playing. The concepts of culture-value and gaming-value are introduced to distinguish between the values assigned to elements external and internal to the physical artefact of the game itself and its use by players. These concepts allow us to unpick the complex web of factors that go into consumer choices. Through investigating the decision-making processes far more complex than simply considering the gaming-value of a potential purchase, we demonstrate how the industry shapes player practices, and how both are underpinned by particular dominant political economic ideologies.","Not a Player, Yet?

A large body of research across diverse disciplines including media psychology has supported many of the MFT’s and MIME’s central hypotheses. Yet, an important prerequisite of this research - the ability to extract latent intuitive moral content represented in media stimuli with a reliable and standardized procedure - has not been systematically studied. In this paper we subject different extraction procedures to rigorous tests, highlight challenges by identifying a range of reliabilities, and provide solutions that maximize the reliability and validity of moral intuition extraction. In five content analytical studies we demonstrate that traditional content analytical approaches lead to moral intuition extraction with rather low reliabilities; variation in coding reliabilities can be predicted by both text features and characteristics of the human coders, and reliability is largely unaffected by the intensity and detail of coder training. We show that a coding task with simplified training and an annotation technique that treats moral foundations as fast, spontaneous intuitions leads to plausible and acceptable inter-rater agreement, and potentially to more valid moral intuition extractions.",Advances in Text Analysis Methods,Computational Methods

This paper uses a critical cultural approach to explore how athletes transform from people with rights and identities to forms of human commodities. Humans’ innate fear the unknown causes them to rely on technology to harness what is outside of their control. During this process, information is privileged as knowledge and people become subjects of such knowledge eventually losing control over their own bodies. Surveillance technologies and governmentalities ensure resistance is silenced and people are normalized into a system that renders their bodies compliant and docile. The privatization of data further perpetuates a capitalist system built on bio-power and exchange value of commodities.

An online experiment examined these questions by testing the effect of reader comments (positive vs. negative), number of “re-tweets” and “likes” (low vs. high), and coverage frequency (infrequent vs. frequent) on message credibility and issue importance. Negative reader comments decreased message credibility and issue importance through the downstream effect of bandwagon perceptions on attention and construct accessibility.",Issues in Agenda-Setting Research,Mass Communication
2017-1182,2017,Paper Session,"Setting the Agenda in Environmental Crisis: Relationships Between Tweets, Google Search Trends, and Newspaper Coverage During the California Drought",4,"Nuanced public responses to droughts and other chronic environmental crises reflect today’s increasingly complex communication ecosystem. At once global and infinitely customizable, this vast array of media and information channels requires existing theory to address the implications of interactions among social media, “traditional” mass media outlets, and information-seeking tools such as search engines. How do these channels intervene in public conversation? What might the agenda-setting perspective have to say? Data collected during peak years of the California drought, 2013-2015, indicate that Twitter is the first place users respond to worsening drought conditions and the only platform directly stimulated by environmental stressors. Google searches link to newspaper coverage and Twitter activity, revealing the centrality of search behaviors in this environmental crisis situation. The findings suggest significant changes to the communication landscape as individual and collective users become increasingly dependent on non-mainstream media channels for information in chronic crisis situations.",Issues in Agenda-Setting Research,Mass Communication
2017-1183,2017,Paper Session,The Impact of Immigration News on Anti-Immigrant Party Support: Unpacking the Issue Ownership Effect Over Time,2,"In this study, we focus on the mechanisms driving the impact of immigration news on anti-immigrant party support. More specifically, we focus on the co-occurrence of the issue of immigration and the issues of crime, terrorism, and the economy in newspaper coverage. Focusing on the Netherlands (2004-2015), in which the Freedom Party led by Geert Wilders is nowadays the biggest party in the polls, we investigate how news coverage affects Freedom Party support. We rely on an extensive dataset based on computer-assisted content analyses, public opinion data and real world indicators. Time series analyses show that the strong impact of immigration news, while controlling for real world immigration figures, runs for the most important part through news in which the issue of immigration is linked to the economy.",Issues in Agenda-Setting Research,Mass Communication

However, these events have not been systematically examined. In this study, we use time series analysis to identify focusing events related to cancer from public SNS messages and mass media broadcasts. This study is a first step in developing a typology of focusing events related to cancer that identifies different types of focusing events and compares the resulting increases in public attention. Such a typology would assist cancer communicators in identifying focusing events as they occur and, as a result, enable them to disseminate cancer prevention and control messages when people are paying attention.

We tested whether a video game designed to teach sexual reciprocity had an impact on African American men. The randomized controlled trial compared a national sample of low SES heterosexual African-American men playing either the intervention or control game at baseline, after 3 days (N = 192), and after 3 months (N = 111). Results showed men in the game condition had greater intentions to please their ongoing partner sexually, and playing more sexual scenarios was associated with increased intentions to ask the preferences of his ongoing sexual partner and please her sexually. The game had no effect on sexual reciprocity intentions with friends and strangers. Thus, a video game can be an effective approach to improve sexual reciprocity among young, low SES African American men in their relationships with on-going sexual partners.",Health-Related Intervention Research (High-Density),Health Communication

This study investigated such negative consequences. We manipulated politicians’ responses to a potentially harmful endorsement (i.e., no response versus response) in a 2 × 2 between-subject experiment. We also manipulated whether an endorsement was initiated by a politician or a celebrity (i.e., controllability). Results revealed that the impact of endorsements involving scandalous celebrities was more negative when the endorsement was initiated by the politician. In that case, no response appears to be the best reaction. By contrast, public response is advised when the endorsement was initiated by another entity.

An Experiment on the Influence of Political Facebook News Posts on Subjective Knowledge,3,"Since news posts make an essential part of the content that is shared within Facebook, users get frequently in touch with political information when scrolling through their news feed. These brief encounters with redundant political news stories on Facebook may have consequences for the subjective knowledge of users. In an experiment, we investigate if the repetition of a topic in news posts has an influence on the subjective knowledge about that topic. We find that participants who saw a news feed containing news posts on a political topic rate their subjective knowledge higher compared to participants who saw a news feed without any political news posts. Moreover, we find a linear trend between the amount of news posts and the level of subjective knowledge. The results emphasize the necessity to strengthen the awareness that Facebook can advert to political topics but it should not replace the engagement with full news stories if users want to gain knowledge.",Processing Political and News Information: New Directions,Information Systems

Therefore, this experimental study investigated the influence of both disclosures and brand presence (as a content factor) on readers’ persuasion knowledge (PK) and subsequent evaluations. Online news readers (N = 290) were shown a native advertisement with either a top-, middle, or top-and-middle positioned disclosure and either high or low brand presence. Results showed that middle-positioned disclosures were most often recognized, resulting in higher conceptual PK. Yet, disclosure recognition did not affect attitudinal PK and evaluations. Conversely, high brand presence did not increase readers’ conceptual PK, but it did increase attitudinal PK, which subsequently decreased readers’ evaluations of the ad, brand and news medium. These findings have important implications to both news media and advertisers.",Processing Political and News Information: New Directions,Information Systems
2017-1195,2017,Paper Session,Knowledge is Power: Recognition of Native Advertising Increases Credibility for Online News,1,"Today we encounter online content from a plethora of sources, in email, social media feeds and websites. Native advertising complicates this landscape, as this content mimics news but may be completely advertiser-influenced. Native advertising changes the public’s ability to assess the source, and thus credibility, creating content that has gained the attention of the FTC due to its potentially deceptive nature. Expanded Prominence Interpretation Theory, EPIT, was developed to address deception in online communication. In this experiment, we consider native advertising through the lens of EPIT. Contrary to previous work, results show that when consumers understand the nature of content, they rate credibility higher, and this effect was even more pronounced for loyal consumers of the news brand. This work bolsters past work on native ad disclosure positions and adds support to the EPIT model, suggesting credibility is a measurable part of a decision-making process between media and deception.",Processing Political and News Information: New Directions,Information Systems

The similarity to journalistic articles is supposed to increase the persuasive effects of native advertisements. The study investigates the interaction between argument position and disclosure of persuasive intent in this context. For this purpose we conducted a 2 (source disclosure at the beginning vs. at the end) x 2 (arguments at the beginning vs. at the end) online experiment. We recruited 319 participants via an online panel. Results indicate that persuasive effects do depend on the sequence of warning and persuasive arguments. If a disclosure of a persuasive intent immediately precedes the arguments, their persuasive impact is diminished.

2017-1197,2017,Paper Session,The Impact of Conventional and Novel Metaphors in News on Issue Viewpoint,4,"Metaphors are often used to frame news. Different types of metaphor (conventional, novel) can affect issue viewpoint via different underlying mechanisms (cognitive and affective text perception). We conducted a single-factor (type of expression: conventional metaphor, novel metaphor, non-metaphorical expression) between-subjects experiment with text perception (cognitive, affective) and issue viewpoint as dependent variables and perceived novelty and perceived aptness of the metaphors as control variables. Type of expression did not affect issue viewpoint. Rather, we found indirect effects of metaphors on both cognitive and affective text perception, via perceived novelty and aptness. Perceived novelty positively affected cognitive ánd affective text perception. However, for cognitive text perception (not for affective text perception), the positive effect of perceived novelty was countered by a negative effect of perceived aptness. This shows that metaphors work through different mechanisms, evoked by two different types of metaphor perception (perceived novelty, perceived aptness).",Processing Political and News Information: New Directions,Information Systems
2017-1198,2017,Paper Session,Metaphor and Framing in Political Speeches: Framing Effects of Conceptual Metaphor on Recognition and Recall,2,"It has been suggested that metaphorical framing has strong cognitive effects. Cognitive linguists claim that metaphors emphasize intended meanings and suppress others. However, experimental research only showed small or contradictory effects. In this paper, an experiment is reported in which metaphor and framing were manipulated independently. Audible political speeches were developed containing metaphors or no metaphors, valence framing (positive versus negative), and generic framing (two news schemes). Recognition, recall, and attitude change were assessed for metaphors and frames in interaction. In total 965 participants listened to one of the speeches (all delivered by the same actor), and completed a questionnaire. There were no main effects of metaphor, nor did metaphor interact with generic framing. A main effect of negative valence on agreement, and several interactions of negative valence with metaphor and/or generic framing on various cognitive and attitudinal variables, showed that negative valence drives a politician’s persuasiveness more than metaphor.",Processing Political and News Information: New Directions,Information Systems
2017-1199,2017,Paper Session,"'Third Space' and Everyday Online Political Talk: Deliberation, Polarisation, Avoidance",3,"This paper takes forward a new agenda for online deliberation - the study of everyday political talk in 'non-political' online ‘third spaces’ - online communities devoted to issues such as parenting, food or sports (author 2012a, b). Online deliberation research has identified a series of problems with online debate: it often polarises with like-minded people talking to each other; disagreement and/or difficult topics are avoided; and it lacks deliberative characteristics and is plagued by trolling, flaming and curbing. This paper hypothesises that political talk in third spaces will avoid these limitations. It empirically analyses the nature of debate about the 2016 Australian federal election, in a discussion forum devoted to parenting. It finds that debates are broadly rational, with limited negative discursive behaviours. While participants lean to the left, there is significant crosscutting political talk and disagreement and debates focus on 'sensitive’ topics such as immigration and marriage equality.","Social Media, Political Participation, and Engagement",Communication and Technology

Less work has addressed how the motivations of social media users might influence such dynamics. We use two-wave panel survey data collected in the United States to test the possibility that online cross-cutting political discussion can indirectly lead to offline political participation, through the influence of social media political information sharing. We also test how specific motivations for using social media (political engagement, relationship maintenance, self-promotion) moderate the amount users share political information on social media when engaged in conversations involving political disagreement. Our findings advance one route from online political disagreement to offline political action through political information sharing, which can impact both politically and non-politically motivated social media users.","Social Media, Political Participation, and Engagement",Communication and Technology

2017-1202,2017,Paper Session,Vertical Movement and Horizontal Movement: The Dynamics of Public Opinion as a New Paradigm,1,"This study proposes to use the dynamics of public opinion as a new paradigm to understand the development of online collective action. Based on a comparative study, this study identifies two patterns of public opinion dynamics: the vertical movement and the horizontal movement. The vertical pattern focuses on the penetration of public opinion, which goes through three tiers of public sphere. The horizontal pattern focuses on the spread of the public opinion, which floats and circulates in the first-tier public sphere. Vertical pattern is more likely to facilitate online-offline transformation, whereas the horizontal pattern strengthens the discursive power of public opinion but is less likely to lead collective action offline. This study argues that different patterns of the public opinion dynamics are shaped by different community structures. The public sphere is not monolithic but has multiple dimensions. Each dimension plays a distinctive role in the movement of the public opinion.","Social Media, Political Participation, and Engagement",Communication and Technology

More specifically, it is argued that Facebook use promotes protest participation via strong-tie networks, while Twitter use has a similar effect through weak-tie networks. To test these expectations, two separate studies were conducted: one is based on a cross-sectional survey on a representative sample of young adults in Chile, another is based on a two-wave online panel survey of a general sample in the U.S. The findings are largely consistent across studies, that is, while both Facebook and Twitter have positive effects on protesting, the paths through which this influence occurs are different.

We further unpack general Internet use to specific Internet use and explore their relations with social capital returns. The results show that general Internet use is positively related to all online bonding, online bridging, and offline social capital returns, whereas specific Internet use (i.e., informational, participation, or recreational) is only positively related to online but not offline social capital returns.

In the current studies, we explore two potential implications of binge watching – increased narrative involvement and greater engagement in unhealthy behaviors. In Study 1, survey results indicated that participants binge watch more than they serial watch, and that binge watching is associated with more character identification, parasocial interaction, transportation, and enjoyment than is serial watching. Amount of binge watching was also significantly correlated with engagement in unhealthy behaviors. In Study 2, a two-wave survey was conducted to explore causality in the relationships from Study 1. Results in Study 2 largely replicated those from Study 1, with one interesting addition – that for participants who view binge watching as a positive activity, amount of binge watching positively predicted a temporarily expanded sense of self.",Emotion in Health Communication,Mass Communication

2017-1209,2017,Paper Session,"Understanding Fear of Zika: Personal, Interpersonal, and Media Influences",3,"The appearance of the Zika virus is worrisome for several reasons. It is clear that the virus can inflict neurological damage to unborn infants. Evidence of possible harms to adults continues to accrue (Peterson, Jamieson, Powers, & Honein, 2016). Transmission is also a concern given that it is the first known virus for which mosquitoes and sex are simultaneous vectors. However, public health researchers have noted that non-biologic outcomes may be equally consequential: “Widespread fear can lead to social and economic consequences as serious as the disease itself” (Lancet, 2005, p. 1751). An abundance of empirical research supports the idea individual and institutional processes can be degraded by fear (e.g., Lempel, Epstein, & Hammond, 2009). Thus, we sought to better understand the precursors of Zika-related fear. Our research focused on a segment of U.

2017-1210,2017,Paper Session,Public Reactions to Celebrity Illness Disclosures: A Cognitive-Emotional Model of Disclosure Effects via Prior Wishful Identification,1,"Much research has investigated what happens when celebrities disclose an illness (via media) to the public. While identification is the oft-cited theoretical mechanism linking an illness disclosure with audience health behavior change, many other psychosocial factors are likely at play as well, including the audience’s emotional reactions to the disclosure, how the disclosure is framed by the media, and cognitive perceptions of the illness. Moreover, differences in defining identification across subfields have made comparing results of celebrity illness disclosure studies difficult. Methodological limitations have also not allowed for a test of how pre-existing identification shapes post-disclosure reactions. The present study uses a nationwide experiment (N=1,068) to test a nuanced model of celebrity illness disclosure effects, with pre-disclosure wishful identification initiating a chain of post-disclosure effects. This model is largely supported by the data and underscores the need to include multiple emotional and cognitive predictors in theoretical models predicting disclosure effects.",Emotion in Health Communication,Mass Communication

By using individual exemplars, stories are expected to increase attention and facilitate cognitive processing. This should particularly apply to information closely related to the storyline. To examine the effect of exemplification on recall and recognition, a field experiment was conducted (N = 390) manipulating the level of personalization. Transportation into the story and emotional engagement with the story protagonist were considered as mediating mechanisms between news exemplification and audiences’ information uptake. Results show that personalization has only marginal effects on knowledge acquisition. Transportation into the story had a negative effect on the recognition of background information, whereas the emotional engagement with a character improved free recall.

The experiment provides evidence of two curvilinear relationships: an inverted U-shaped relationship between coherence and SOD, and a U-shaped relationship between SOD and the story consistency of beliefs. Mediation analyses show that SOD affects the story consistency of beliefs over and above the effect of narrative engagement. Thus, SOD complements the dominant explanations of narrative persuasion.",Narrative Involvement and Persuasion,Mass Communication
2017-1215,2017,Paper Session,Asynchronous Modernization of the Mexican Press: A Center-Periphery Comparison,2,"After seventy years of an almost complete hegemony, in 2000 the Institutional Revolutionary Party lost the presidency of the Republic to the oppositional National Action Party candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada. That moment was considered the hallmark of the political transition that started in certain regions two decades ago. According to a group of American scholars, the transformation of the political system involved the modernisation of the media system as well, as the Mexican press as a whole was moving towards its professionalization. Nonetheless, diverse case studies focused on specific regions have found empirical evidence that prove otherwise. That is, the findings consistently prove that local and regional journalism is still determined by the customs of the authoritarian model. Based upon a content analysis of the coverage of the 2015 parliamentary elections in both national and state newspapers, the main argument of this paper is that Mexican journalism oscillates between modernisation and stagnation. In other words, whilst the so-called national media – located in Mexico City – showed a more professional performance than those located in other regions (regarding – for instance - the use of diverse sources of information, and the implementation of different journalistic genres, other than the standard news story); both groups shared a similar political bias and a limited coverage of those elections. Therefore, the main conclusion is that instead of a general transformation or stagnation, Mexican press develops an asynchronous modernisation process in which there are simultaneously liberal and authoritarian features. However, the former are more frequent in national news outlets than in their regional counterparts, which tend to be inclined to the latter.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication

Results from a thematic analysis, considering the uses and gratifications theory as framework, show that participants of the roll call, which had an organic origin sparkled by individual citizens, are motivated by an emotional connection with the victims, and their desire to support the students’ parents. The commitment to engage is strengthened by the emergence of a shared identity among participants. Moreover, the protesters conceive that the roll call fulfills the functions of keeping the memory of the students present in public discourse, and filling informational voids in the coverage of the case by traditional media. The protest also constitutes a virtual assembly at a specific time and place to discuss other social and political problems.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication

2017-1218,2017,Paper Session,When Elites Protest: News Coverage and the Evolution of Antigovernment Demonstrations in Brazil,1,"In 2013, small demonstrations against bus fares in Brazil evolved into a series of large protests expressing generalized dissatisfaction with center-leftist President Dilma Rousseff. After she was reelected, another wave of protests returned in 2015 with a clear agenda: the removal of the President. Communication research has long examined the “protest paradigm,” a pattern of coverage delegitimizing social movements. The Brazilian context provided a chance to assess the extent to which the paradigm holds when protests take on an elite-driven narrative contesting the government. Through a quantitatively-driven mixed methods, results revealed that when grievances evolved into coherent anti-government demands, official sources from opposition parties served to legitimize the movement. This study departs from an understanding of protest coverage as paradigmatic towards a complex view of the relationship between protestors and the press. The experience of Brazil shows that when an elite opposition supports protests, journalistic norms and routines validate demonstrations.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2017-1219,2017,Paper Session,Is Peer Health Education Healthy?: Examining Immediate and Durable Emotional Contagion Among Peer Health Educators,1,"Peer Health Education (PHE), defined as the dissemination of health information by trained college students, has long been found to enhance health-related behaviors in college-aged students (Milburn, 1995; Webel, Okonsky, Trompeta, & Holzemer, 2010). The nature of PHE requires peer educators to frequently engage in emotionally burdensome conversations that leave them susceptible to emotional contagion, or the transfer of emotion between people (Kornman, 2001). Yet, few studies have examined the impact of PHE on the educators themselves. The current paper addresses this lacuna by examining immediate and durable emotional contagion among peer educators following one-on-one sessions with others. Upon communicating with a peer seeking help, peer health educators (N = 245) completed a survey. Analyses revealed significant positive associations between conversational factors of one-on-one PHE interactions (e.g., mimicry and emotional energy) and emotional contagion. Further, topic severity predicted durable emotional contagion two weeks following PHE conversations.",Roles of Emotion in Shaping Communication Effects on Well-Being,Health Communication
2017-1220,2017,Paper Session,Bringing Hope or Not Feeling Regret? Explore the Impact of Emotions on Living Organ Donation,5,"Organ transplants continue to face challenges of shortage of available organs in the United States, and worldwide. Living organ donation, as an alternative for deceased organ donation, has become an option given its low complication rates and more positive outcomes. An increasing number of communication studies examined the utility of negative emotions in encouraging individuals to register as organ donors; however, significantly less attention has been given to investigate the effects of positive emotions on intention to donate organs. This study presented results from an exploratory study in which hope and regret were elicited, and the impact of these two emotions on attitude toward and behavioral intention to register as a living liver donor, and willingness to discuss living liver donation with family were assessed. The findings indicated limited and inaccurate knowledge about living liver donation amount college students. Moreover, hope and regret were found to be powerful in influencing behavioral intent to register and discuss with family about living liver donation, depending on participants’ current registration status.

2017-1221,2017,Paper Session,Laughing About a Health Risk? Alcohol in Comedy Series and its Connection to Humor,1,"The purpose of this study was twofold: to investigate the portrayal of alcohol in comedy series and to examine the connection of alcohol and humor. We content analyzed twenty episodes each of the ten most popular U.S. comedy series. We coded all references to alcohol, as well as to non-alcoholic beverages, regarding the context of their appearance and their connection to humor. A fourth of all scenes were alcohol-related. Our findings show a comparatively high amount of prominent alcohol references in comedy series. Nearly a fifth is directly related to humor. This is mainly the case for negative aspects of alcohol consumption, such as excessive consumption, problem coping, and negative consequences. Considering positive affect transfer processes related to humor as well as social cognitive theory, we conclude that comedy series may trivialize negative aspects of alcohol consumption. These findings should spur a discussion about the portrayal of alcohol on television.",Roles of Emotion in Shaping Communication Effects on Well-Being,Health Communication

This growth also comes with the psychological symptoms caused by cultural shock and cultural adaptation. Listening to music is shown to have the function for mood management, entertainment, self-identity, and cultural identity. Using music may be helpful to these students. This study analyzes why Chinese international students use music and how music affect their emotion and cultural adaptation in the US. Using qualitative open-ended question survey and thematic analysis, this study finds that Chinese international students reported and identified listening to music as means to entertain themselves, manage their mood, maintain their home cultural identity, and engage in the host culture. The study also finds that musical preference may affect their uses of music for cultural identity.

2017-1223,2017,Paper Session,Influences of Gratitude on Health Status in the United States and Japan,4,"Previous studies have reported evidence indicating differences between Western and East Asian cultures in terms of gratitude and its physical health consequences. However, many of these studies have focused on a specific gratitude strategy and its relation with a psychological consequence. Here, we developed an integrated model that can comprehensively examine three different psychological antecedents, such as self-esteem, social anxiety, and depression, and the number of chronic conditions in physical health. We estimated the model using large samples of American and Japanese adults to examine the associations among one gratitude strategy, three psychological factors, including self-esteem, social anxiety, depression, and the number of chronic conditions in physical health. We compared the differences in the patterns of relationships among the key constructs between the American and Japanese samples. The results confirmed previously suggested cultural differences while also discovering new culturally different paths. The results generally suggest that an individual’s gratitude patterns matter more when self-esteem and social anxiety involve cultural and emotional well-being, such as depression, chronic conditions, which impact on physical health. The implications and limitations of the integrated model are also discussed.",Roles of Emotion in Shaping Communication Effects on Well-Being,Health Communication

Data gathered through in-depth interviews reveal that women employ specific strategies to succeed in this environment and to deal with sexist ad-hominem assaults – they either emphasize qualities traditionally considered feminine and act as “witty divas” or “nice mothers”, or accommodate to the masculine character of the environment by adopting “tough approach”. Some of them even experiment with masculine profiles. These strategies seem to reproduce the traditional patriarchal binary frame and show that even influential women strategically subordinate themselves to the rules of the majority of men.",What Counts as Political?

2017-1225,2017,Paper Session,“Kim Davis be Like...”: A Feminist Critique of Gender Humor in Online Political Memes,3,"In this era of participatory and social media, memes have become a user-generated form of political discussion. The recent online conversation surrounding Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis who was jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses provides insight into the rhetoric used in political memes. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis using a lens of feminist humor theory, this study of Davis-related memes suggests that users trying to battle anti-gay ideologies resorted to regressive anti-feminist rhetoric by targeting her physical appearance as a woman and using traditional ""slut humor."" Additionally, civil rights comparisons illustrate a misconstrued understanding of race and hegemony. Thus, far from serving as an alternative public sphere where marginalized voices can come together and articulate their identities without pressure from the mainstream sphere, we conclude Internet memes are maintaining the status quo, furthering gendered political and communications systems and virtually ignoring the underlying gay rights issue.",What Counts as Political?

2017-1226,2017,Paper Session,From Random Killing to Femicide: The Politics of Sticky Notes in the 2016 Gangnam Station Murder Case in South Korea,1,"This study explores the politics of sticky notes in the 2016 Gangnam station murder case in South Korea. After a young woman was stabbed to a death by a man who allegedly committed the crime because he had been ignored by women in a public restroom near Gangnam subway station, people left sticky notes with the messages of condolences, sadness and calling for change at the Gangnam station exit No. 10. By using a mixed-method approach that includes textual and discourse analysis of 1,004 sticky notes and interviews of women who participated in protests and activism regarding the case, this paper argues that sticky notes contribute to form an affective counter public sphere as an alternative medium, by archiving Korean women’s experiences of misogyny and gendered violence, critiquing mainstream media’s coverage about a woman killing.",What Counts as Political?

answering the Special Issue of Social Media + Society call for papers
Infancy Online


A Privacy Trusteeship Paradox.
How Parents Administer Their Newborns’ Digital Identity.

Many parents almost instantly share their children’s daily activities and experiences with a globally spread network of family, friends, and public. Research on self-disclosure describes this pattern as part of parents’ self-representation within processes of social interaction. However, a privacy paradox can be found: While social media users consider the protection of their private information to be important, their concerns rarely affect their online behavior. This paper adds a further perspective. It understands parents as trustees of their infants’ digital identity. The results of 16 in-depth interviews with young parents indicate that they are largely unaware of the described role duality and are only partially able to foresee the consequences of their activities. Finally, a privacy trusteeship paradox can be found: : Despite feeling unable to respond adequately to the risks of social media activities, even the most aware parents share personal information about their infants anyways.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1229,2017,Paper Session,"Adolescents, Social Media, and Internet Slang: Communicating Health Messages Through Text Symbols",1,"Kenya’s young people are at the center of the HIV and AIDS epidemic due to their likelihood to engage in high risk behavior (NASCOP, 2012). Despite the fact that there has been a 19% decrease of new HIV infections countrywide between 2013 and 2015, an increase has been noted among young people between 15 and 24 years. Mass media and social marketing campaigns have been identified as effective interventions targeted towards reducing sexually risky behavior among adolescents (National AIDS Control Council, 2015). Similarly, Text messaging has been identified as the most used social media platform by teens (Carroll & Kirkpatrick, 2011) throughout the country. To effectively communicate HIV risk to adolescents in Kenya, this study will investigate if using text symbols often referred to as cryptic language used for chatting, email and texting is more effective than using ordinary text.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1230,2017,Paper Session,Broadcast Media & Youth Participation in Sociopolitical Mass Protests in Emerging African Democracies,1,"This study examines the extent to which broadcast media in emerging African democracies mobilizes youth participation in socio-political mass protests, beyond social media. This challenges the widely held belief that social media platforms have become the sole rallying call for the success of these protests. A 2012 study by the US based Institute for Peace on the role of social media in mobilizing the Arab Spring confirms the significance of broadcast media in sustaining these movements. The study found that only 13% of Tahrir Square protesters relied on Twitter as opposed to the overwhelming 92% who said they relied on television. Thus would this finding be replicated in the Kenyan context? News stories from two mainstream news stations will be content analyzed to examine the prevalence of four media frames (Valence, Attribution of Responsibility, Violence, Democracy) in the coverage of the recent Independent Electoral Board Commission (IEBC) mass protests.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1231,2017,Paper Session,"Children, Youth, and Media in International and Global Conflict Zones",1,"Responding to research about children and media that has emphasized an analysis of the effects or reception by children living in peace zones of fictive violence, literature about children, media and conflict, has instead emphasized an analysis of effects or reception by children living in peace zones of non-fiction violence, or news. Both sets of literature focus on how to help children cope with the problem of violence. In this paper I discuss alternative conceptions for analyzing children, media and conflict. I critically examine youth and social movements literature and children and conflict literature. The latter posits children as passive victims and/or active perpetrators of conflict, and/or emphasizes children’s “normal” everyday practices amid physical and structural violence, to focus on how children might instead fix the problem, namely, end conflict. By merging these varied approaches and adding comparative international and global studies literature to them, I introduce an alternative formulation, “children, youth, and media in international and global conflict zones”. I do so to consider how children and youth living amid armed conflict, (might) respond to, interpret, use, and produce media to build and make peace.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media

In a democracy, moral arguments are unavoidable; or rather, the functioning of a healthy democracy depends on open debates around differences. When young activists run into arguments arising from moral or fundamental differences online, what strategies do they employ to navigate and negotiate differences in opinions? Relatedly, I ask how open-minded these youth are in terms of seeking diverse opinions and audiences, and whether they are willing to examine or change their own opinions on certain issues. How (if at all) do their own efforts at open-mindedness relate to rhetorical strategies they use in their online conversations?","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Furthermore, receiving positive feedback in SNSs is associated with beneficial outcomes to social self-esteem and well-being, while negative feedback has been associated to negative outcomes (Valkenburg, Peter & Schouten, 2006). By means of a six-wave panel survey, the study compares the emotional responses of youngsters to feedback received both in social networking sites and face to face before, during, and after taking the Prueba de Seleccion Universitaria (PSU, or the equivalent to the Chilean SAT’s test). Results are expected to ascertain the role of SNSs while undergoing a stressful test, and provide insights regarding the effects of receiving feedback face to face vs. online.

There are many studies which explore new technologies and its implications on different aspects of lives. According to Communication Authority of Kenya, in 2015-16, 39.7 million people are using mobile phones and the mobile penetration is 90.0%. To date fewer studies have been carried out in the East African region on the implications of technologies on family relationships. The study aims to know how parents and adolescents relate in the families and to what extend the smartphone use has affected the family bonding such as attachment, connection, emotion and closeness. Studying adolescents’ relationship in the families is significant because “relationship developed in the families play an integral part in the learning how to function and interact in the society” (Kennedy-Eden, 2014).

Qualitative in nature, this study explored the life experiences of 14 U.S female shojo manga fans through in-depth interviews. Both positive and negative influences were found. All interviewees claimed that shojo anime/manga influenced their perceptions of gender. They used shojo characters as role models and wanted to be as helpful, positive, feminine and cute as them, yet they all clearly stated their dislike of shojo characters’ passiveness. Shojo anime/manga provided them a dating script and they tried to apply it to real life. Failed to do so, they realised that this script is not necessarily applicable in the U.S context. However, they still prefer shojo anime/manga over romantic comedies in American media, claiming it is more pure, light-hearted and less sexual.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media

European parliamentary debates on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2010/13/EU), the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2011/92/EU) and the Better Internet for Kids program (COM 2012 196 final) make often reference to statistics provided by European institutions and associated agencies. These organizations play a role in the construction of knowledge and interpretation of socio-political phenomena. Aims. The research wishes to observe how international statistics create hegemonic, emancipated and polemic representations of audiovisual sexual risks for children, through reference to international and national data (Moscovici, 1961/76). Methods. The corpus is composed of 45 debates, held at the European Parliament between 2001 and 2016. A content analysis is carried on through the AltasTi software (Bauer, Gaskell, 2007; Dany, 2016). Results. Social representations are transmitted and transformed within European institutions through data produced by Eurobarometer, EuKidsOnline, Europol, Interpol, United Nations, NGOs. Policy concerning the most violent crimes, such as child pornography and sexual exploitation, tend to be tackled through reference to a higher variety of data sources and statistics, aimed at filling a gap in scientific knowledge.

More recent developments such as the advent and saturation of mobile technologies and social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter, have amplified concerns over their consequence.
This research examines the relationship between; (a) media gatekeeping teacher/parents and (b) their preschoolers. Research questions investigate what experiences or subjects triggered media policy discussions, decisions or actions by the teacher/parents. The effects of media content on children have been examined to a great degree, but little is known about those who actually deliver the media into the hands of preschoolers. Insight is provided into critical media gatekeepers and influencers of media policy, for children who are adopting new media in primary school environments. Results of this research will inform media adoption policy as well as technologically dependent curriculum.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Division - Research Escalator Sessions (Panel 2)",Children Adolescents and the Media

Taking our point of departure in the theoretical concept of the ‘cultural intermediary’ (Maguire & Matthews 2014), we demonstrate that the coverage is anchored in traditional cultural criticism, showing for example how all three newsbrands use reviews and previews to present Borgen as both ‘good taste’ and (more rarely) ‘bad taste’. At the same time the analytical findings indicate that tastemaking is a very complex process and that journalistic tastemaking also occurs and is performed outside the cultural pages and can be described as a hybridisation (Baym 2016) in which fictional and real narratives are combined. Consequently, we will discuss tastemaking in terms of performing taste intentionally and/or unintentionally.",Global Television: Formats and Transformations,Popular Communication

A nationwide survey was conducted with U.S. adults examining their relationship with a specific organization with which they were involved. Increased perceptions of symmetrical communication with oneself as well as with others had a positive effect on perceptions of organization-public relationships (OPR) as well as intention to engage in supportive behaviors. Furthermore, both the perception of direct symmetrical communication with oneself and the perception of symmetrical communication with others had both shared and unique effects on perceptions of OPR. The results have substantial theoretical and practical implications related to our understanding of the effects of symmetrical communication, even when an organization is merely observed to be engaging in such communication with stakeholders.",Theory Interventions II: Organization-Public Relationships,Public Relations
2017-1244,2017,Paper Session,Influence of Relationship Cultivation Strategies on Employee-Organization Relationships: Incorporating Positive and Negative Relationship Dimensions,1,"This paper explores the influence of relationship cultivation strategies on organization-public relationships (OPR) in the employee context, incorporating both the traditional OPR dimensions of trust, satisfaction, control mutuality and commitment, and the negative OPR dimensions of distrust, dissatisfaction, control dominance, and dissolution. Through an online survey (N = 574), the study found that the cultivation strategies with the greatest impact on OPR outcomes are the symmetrical cultivation strategy of positivity and the asymmetrical strategy of avoiding. Overall, symmetrical strategies (openness, networking, assurances of legitimacy, positivity, compromising) are positively related to traditional (or positive) relationship outcomes, and asymmetrical strategies (distributive negotiation, avoiding, negativity) are related to negative relationship outcomes. In terms of magnitude of the effect, asymmetrical strategies are more influential than symmetrical strategies, i.e. it’s easier to ruin a relationship than to build a relationship. This study contributes to theory development through synthesizing the multidimensionality of relationship cultivation strategies (symmetrical, asymmetrical) and of OPR (positive, negative), refining towards a more multidimensional, comprehensive relationship management theory. The practical contributions of this study lie in the implications for choosing appropriate relationship cultivation strategies for effectively managing relationship outcomes.",Theory Interventions II: Organization-Public Relationships,Public Relations

Thus, this study proposes a model that details a sequential chain of communicative actions that predict behavioral intentions to support organizations. Specifically, individuals that perceive a strong relationship with an organization are more likely to seek out information from or about that organization; after seeking out the organizational information, individuals filter messaging to keep the most helpful content while ignoring others before ultimately forwarding those messages to others in their personal network. Using an online survey of members of a state museum (n = 363), this study found support for how individuals process organizational messages.

In addition to insights about each separate identity, three tensions at the intersection of multiple identities are also explored: abiding with norms, credibility, and opportunity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Cross-Cultural and Intercultural Dimensions of Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-1249,2017,Paper Session,Effective Followership Characteristics: Self-Regulation and Intercultural Communication Competence,2,"Followership is a remarkably pervasive experience shared by all human beings who occupy the masses within national and global organizations. The purpose of the current study was to further knowledge and understanding of the followership construct by distinguishing a set of communicative characteristics that effective followers demonstrate—exploring the associations among perceptions of effective followership, self-regulation, and intercultural communication competence. This study examines whether self-regulation and co-cultural competence are characteristics of effective followership. Followership scholars suggest that followership research should develop followership characteristics based on variables focusing on the perceptions of followers in relation to leaders (Uhl-Bien, Riggio, Lowe, & Carsten, 2014). As such, the present study examines perceptions of both leader and follower participants in an online survey. The results of this study reveal that self-regulation and co-cultural competence are characteristics that effective followers demonstrate. Moreover, followers perceive emotion regulation to be an important characteristic of followership effectiveness; however, leaders do not share this perspective. The results of this study also indicate that there is no difference between leaders and followers’ co-cultural competence abilities. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.",Cross-Cultural and Intercultural Dimensions of Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-1250,2017,Paper Session,A Critique and Reconceptualization of Oetzel's Effective Intercultural Workgroup Communication Theory,1,"The primary focus of this research was to critique and reconceptualize Oetzel’s (2005) Effective Intercultural Workgroup Communication Theory (EIWCT). The research explored the foundational research concepts in Oetzel’s theory: situational features (history of unresolved conflicts, equal/unequal status, and ingroup/outgroup), self-construals, face-concerns, interaction climate, and task and relational group effectiveness and satisfaction. The central critique of Oetzel’s theory was the operationalization of group diversity through self-construals, face concerns and ethnic identification. The current study proposed that relational models and horizontal/vertical individualism/collectivism may more completely and accurately capture diversity dimensions because they are considered deep-level diversity features (Fiske, 2004; Triandis & Gelfand, 1998). Even though not all hypotheses were supported, several variables were significantly correlated with the tested outcomes, i.e. interaction climate, group satisfaction and group effectiveness. Specifically, the relational model of market pricing, and the cultural dimensions of vertical collectivism and vertical individualism were significantly related to some outcomes variables.",Cross-Cultural and Intercultural Dimensions of Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

2017-1252,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Message Fatigue on Resistance to Persuasive Health Messages,2,"Message fatigue refers to a state of being exhausted and bored by prolonged exposure to similar, redundant messages (So, Kim, & Heather, 2016). This study tests a mediational model that accounts for how message fatigue may contribute to two different types of resistance to an incoming persuasive message (i.e., reactance and disengagement), which in turn reduce intention to adopt behaviors the message advocates. The proposed model was tested in an online experiment concerning anti-obesity messages with a sample of overweight or obese adults in the U.S. In a meditational model, where reactance and disengagement were operationalized as counterargument and inattention to an anti-obesity message respectively, counterargument significantly mediated the negative effects of message fatigue on intention to adopt only one of four weight management behaviors promoted in the message. However, inattention significantly carried the negative effects of message fatigue on behavioral intention, consistently across all four promoted weight management behaviors.",Predicting and Avoiding Resistance and Reactance in Health Communication,Health Communication
2017-1253,2017,Paper Session,Antecedents to Psychological Reactance: The Impact of Choice Clustering and Descriptive Norms,3,"The current study extends the literature on psychological reactance theory by examining two additional antecedents to psychological reactance: choice clustering and descriptive norms. Participants (N = 455) were randomly assigned to view one of four print ads in a 2 (choice clustering: choice or no choice) x 2 (descriptive norm: high vs. low) between subjects factorial design. Results indicated that provision of choice (vs. no choice) in a behavioral cluster decreased freedom threat perceptions. Descriptive norms (high vs. low) were unrelated to freedom threat, but did influence behavioral intention as mediated through perceived descriptive norms. Furthermore, state reactance was negatively associated with perceived descriptive norms. Evidence in support of the intertwined model of reactance, and modeling reactance as a two-step process, was also found. Findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical and practical contributions of the current study.",Predicting and Avoiding Resistance and Reactance in Health Communication,Health Communication

Adopting psychological reactance theory and warning conspicuity and integration literature, the current study investigated the effects of incorporating warning messages on social media alcohol ads. This experimental lab study used a 2 (conspicuous vs. discreet warning) x 2 (integrated vs. disintegrated warning) x 3 (ad repetition) within-subject factorial design (N = 65). This study found that beer ads with conspicuous warnings, compared to discreet warnings, and integrated warnings rather than disintegrated ones were more effective in curbing underage youths’ intentions to consume alcohol. Further, eye-tracking measurements indicated that discreet and disintegrated warnings currently adopted by alcohol marketers were hardly being noticed.",Predicting and Avoiding Resistance and Reactance in Health Communication,Health Communication

Based on the literature regarding tailored message strategies, value theory, and psychological reactance theory, a 4 (self-enhancement value: presence vs. absence; self-transcendence value: presence vs. absence) x 2 (freedom threat: presence vs. absence) between-subjects experiment with within-subjects topics (2: nutrition and physical activity) was conducted for adults with diabetes or prediabetes. The findings from this study are 1) direct effect of personal value orientation and freedom threat to psychological reactance, 2) direct effect of psychological reactance to dependent variables related to decision-making, 3) correlation between dependent variables, 4) partial mediation effect of psychological reactance between personal value orientation and some dependent variables.

2017-1256,2017,Paper Session,Modeling Psychological Reactance Using Narratives From the AT&T “It Can Wait” Campaign,5,"Despite known dangers, texting while driving continues to be a problem in the United States, particularly among young adults. AT&T recently launched the “It Can Wait” campaign utilizing a series of celebrity and peer testimonials and stories about car accidents to encourage abstinence from texting while driving. Using narratives from the “It Can Wait” campaign, we tested the intertwined model of psychological reactance, assessed the potential for psychological reactance to explain message effects, and explored alternative structures. Using a sample of undergraduate students from a large public university and campaign narratives as stimuli, psychological reactance and intentions to text while driving were measured. Consistent with previous research, the intertwined model was supported, however, it did not provide an explanation for message effects in this study. Results suggested psychological reactance may be better modeled in a sequential chain where anger drives negative thoughts.

We investigate the institutional role a crowdfunding platform and its partners play in broadening participation in cultural crowdfunding. We consider the extent to which these actors relax the tendencies towards spatial clustering characteristic of the culture industries through an analysis of a particular practice—“curated projects”—that provides particular projects with additional public promotion. We find that curated projects tend to cluster in cultural hubs and that they enjoy much higher levels of funding. We suggest that platforms should make a conscious effort to promote more peripherally located projects in order to make their editorial practices compatible with the social justice framework they discursively champion.",Business Models and Business Strategies in Journalism and Television,Media Industry Studies

This study found that nonpublic affairs news is more likely to reach funding goals, have more supporters, and receive more money per supporter than public affairs news; author location makes a difference in how many supporters and how much donation a news column receives; and offering more reward options is associated with a significantly higher odds of a column reaching funding goals and having more supporters. Overall, findings from this study offer empirical evidence of how news organizations may learn from Byline’s successful crowd-funding strategy, and offers theoretical linkages between uses and gratifications and Cialdini’s rule of reciprocity in understanding why and how people pay for news.",Business Models and Business Strategies in Journalism and Television,Media Industry Studies

This paper studies the impact of a merger or acquisition on the financial position of a loss-making newspaper publisher (i.e. target firm) and on the continuation of its business activities (i.e. newspaper publishing). We combine insights from strategic management, corporate finance, and competition law with an aim to understand mechanisms behind operating synergies and (conflicting) interests. We provide contextualisation of detailed and longitudinal financial data analyses of three M&A cases in Belgium (1989–2010). Results show that the M&As realised a turnaround of the target firms’ financial position; activities were divested, costs reduced (e.g. remuneration), and falling sales compensated with a price increase. We elaborate on the implications of these findings for survival strategies, news(paper) plurality and the role of regulation.",Business Models and Business Strategies in Journalism and Television,Media Industry Studies

The paper demonstrates that shoppability—a convergence of marketing and marketplace—has been a feature of virtually all efforts to establish interactive services through multichannel television systems, and that the promise of facilitating instant shopping remains a fixture in the industrial logic of electronic media. Would the multichannel environment, and the nature of information and entertainment services, have developed differently if stakeholders had not aspired to building an interactive storefront?

Emphasizing the qualitative paradigm underscoring these cases, we researchers successfully map the news information flows -- its influences, power dynamics, and obstacles -- in Philadelphia, PA, and Madison, WI. The mix of locational sampling, a diversified internal openness to unusual areas of empirical consideration, and formal network analysis sets up the qualitative heart of these studies, allowing for multiple levels of investigation at the micro-meso-macro tiers of local community.

Previously defined as journalism dedicated to revealing its community’s values, beliefs, and structures, community journalism’s goal is to enable readers to situate themselves within their community and engage in public deliberation. This paper looks to four newspapers representing four different distinct communities – local, national, institutional, and racial – to understand the degree to which each publication practiced “good” community journalism in their coverage of the racial unrest on the University of Missouri’s campus in fall 2015 at its national fallout. Findings show the newspapers – regardless of the type of community they serve – grapple first and foremost with conceptions of power. Following the focus on the powerful actors within the social movement, the newspapers tended to cover leadership, economic fallout, diverse perspectives, and the evolution of the movement across generations and the nation.",Researching Ecologies of News: The Role of Markets and Communities,Journalism Studies

We address two underlying research questions: what is the state of small market newspapers in the United States and how are these papers adapting to the challenges and opportunities presented by digital technologies? Based on in-depth interviews with experts and practitioners, and drawing on grounded theory for analysis, we argue for the need for a more nuanced language to speak about newspapers and local news. Grouping all newspapers into a single monolithic industry – as is often the case with statistics and general sector analysis – suggests a homogenous experience. That is not the case. Smaller publications face their own sets of challenges and opportunities; and they define success and innovation on their own terms. This reality needs to be better understood and taken into account.",Researching Ecologies of News: The Role of Markets and Communities,Journalism Studies
2017-1266,2017,Paper Session,The Emergence of the Newspaper Comic in 1890’s New York City,1,"Fin-de-siècle New York City of the 1890’s witnessed a historically unprecedented birth of new media forms. Cinema historians often hail film as a product of this moment, and some journalism scholars recognize the press’ modernization in the period’s “yellow journalism”. Fewer scholars, however, have recognized this period as the birthplace of a foundational 20th-century art form: the newspaper comic. This paper situates the newspaper comic, in particular, as a new visual medium taking shape within the elaborately graphical urban newspapers of its time, while also gaining its segmented structure from the cinema filmstrip. The newspaper comic’s formal plasticity, which relies on the reader’s act of perception, in a sense anticipated the later development of modern media like the animated film and the interactive video game. This paper unites a media-theoretical approach with a practice-based visual analysis, seeking a third path of media scholarship amidst literatures dominated by either-or traditions.",New Temporal and Spatial Visual Environments,Visual Communication Studies

This study demonstrates that, in harmony with the discourse of Japaneseness celebrating the hybridity of Japanese culture in the context of postwar economic recovery, the mixed race star was imagined and represented as the embodiment of Japanese cultural hybridity in popular culture. It offers insight into the ways in which the representations of the mixed race star served to mask the historical disjuncture in U.S.-Japan relations between the prewar and the postwar periods, dissociating the image of mixed race people from the stigma of being occupation babies and submerging the memories of World War II and the U.S. Occupation.",New Temporal and Spatial Visual Environments,Visual Communication Studies

For Indian women, engagements with Indian produced mass mediated texts have underscored the complexities of the postcolonial feminine subject who is caught between poles of ‘modernity’ and ‘tradition’. In the globalized context of global cultural exchanges, routine engagements with Western popular television affirm intensified contradictions in the way cultural desire operates in the lives of elite Indian women. Based on fieldwork and in-depth interviews conducted with young women in Hyderabad, this study braids together global popular culture, nationalist postcolinality and ideations of modern femininity that women exercise while consuming popular shows. In doing so, contours of modernity and femininity emerge as young professional women utilize popular fictional narratives of to navigate conservative social expectations and individual aspirations while re-branding the Indian-state within the global imagination.",New Temporal and Spatial Visual Environments,Visual Communication Studies

After examining Harbin’s policymakers' international policymaking processes and foreign residents' evaluations of the city, we proposed a model to show Harbin’s international image-building efforts. The model consisted of public diplomacy, and soft power, city branding strategies, and relationship building with Harbin's residents, investors, and foreign visitors. From the theoretical aspect, this paper not only expands public relations by applying it to a city’s international image promotion, but also enriches current city branding literature by advancing a model in international image promotion. From the practical aspect, cities that are similar to Harbin can refer to this model to enhance their international image, and draw lessons from Harbin’s international image promotion process.",Exploring Country Images and Nation Brands Building,Public Diplomacy

My empirical focus is on the case of post-war Kosovo – a recently independent and still contested state where development, nation building, and nation branding have unfolded simultaneously. Although the case of Kosovo is unique in many ways, I propose that it reveals some key characteristics of the paradigmatic “neoliberal nation-state.” My arguments extend a critical and interdisciplinary perspective on nation branding as a neoliberal tool of governance. I focus on nation branding in post-war Kosovo as a way to get at two larger theoretical questions: What are some key characteristics of the neoliberal nation-state? And how does the ideological discourse of nation branding articulate the agenda of neoliberal development with the project of producing national subjects within the parameters of a reconstituted, neoliberal nation-state?",Exploring Country Images and Nation Brands Building,Public Diplomacy

Using semi-structured interviews with 17 expatriates living in Macao, the present study highlights their role and examines their communication behaviors as well as their experience of interacting with acquaintances living in their home countries. The results revealed very low awareness about Macao among the acquaintances. Expatriates acknowledged that the textual and visual information they shared could reinforce a positive impression of Macao, and that they strengthened or converted the stereotypical perception of Macao that their acquaintances held through intentional choices about the types of information they shared. The communicative pattern of the expatriates, revealed in this study, provides implications for understanding the communication behaviors of expatriates and their roles as grassroots diplomats.",Exploring Country Images and Nation Brands Building,Public Diplomacy

This paper examines how Ukrainian news consumers decide where to get their news and what to believe in a media environment where ‘propaganda’ and ‘disinformation’ are considered major threats to national security. Data come from 30 audio-diaries and in-depth interviews conducted among adult residents of Ukraine's Odesa Region in 2016. Through qualitative analysis of the diary and interview transcripts, the paper reveals how participants based their support for one narrative over another based on what they considered important (their ‘priorities’), not just what they thought had happened (the ‘facts’).

However, there are few data regarding the question of whether user comments have an impact on an audience’s assessment of journalistic quality. Thus, two experimental studies were conducted. In both experiments, the quality of a journalistic product and the valence of user comments were manipulated. The results indicate that, overall, high-quality journalistic products were (slightly) evaluated as better than low-quality versions. Furthermore, users evaluated the quality of journalistic products with positive user comments better than the quality of identical products with negative comments. Considering that, in reality, user comments are predominantly critical, it is worrying that the effects of these comments on the evaluation of journalistic work are rather negative.",Social Influences in News Making,Mass Communication

A quantitative content analysis compared characteristics of posts published on the news organizations’ main Twitter accounts during a one-month period in fall 2015. Most of the tweets included hyperlinks to articles posted on the news organizations’ websites along with text about the stories and a photograph or other still image. Statistically significant differences existed between news organizations in the use of such hyperlinks to their own websites, as well as socially and technically interactive functions of Twitter such as retweets, @mentions, hashtags, and the capacity to attach photographs or video.

How does exposure to what audiences want affect how journalists compare the news preferences of their audiences with their own editorial judgment? Based on a survey of 205 online journalists in the United States, this study found that journalists perceive some incongruence between them and their audiences across different topics. The journalists rated themselves as being more interested than their readers in both public and semi-public affairs news, while they rated their readers as more interested than they were in non-public affairs news. Subsequent analyses also found that social media use is related to incongruence across the three topic areas, while web analytics is related to congruence but only in public affairs news.",Social Influences in News Making,Mass Communication
2017-1280,2017,Paper Session,Clients’ Requests for Medication Changes in Psychiatry,3,"In psychiatry practitioners are encouraged to adopt a patient-centered approach that emphasizes shared decision-making. We investigate how clients with severe mental illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia) advocate for their treatment preferences in psychiatric consultations. Using Conversation Analysis, we analyze how clients request changes in their psychotropic medications. We show that medication change requests are made opportunistically at activity transitions. Clients may explicitly request a change, typically in a way that conveys a stance of low entitlement and high contingency of the requested outcome (“I was wondering if…”). More commonly, clients request medication changes indirectly by reporting a problem with a possible side effect (“I’m having a tremendous tremor”) or with a medication (“Geodon is the problem now”). We discuss how the design and positioning of these requests display participants’ orientations to the exigencies of this institutional context. Overall, the paper advances our understanding of patient advocacy in psychiatry and of requesting as a social action.",Getting People to Do Stuff in Interaction,Language & Social Interaction

Of the five individuals diagnosed with FTD participating in a longitudinal study, this practice is only recurrently observed in the interactions involving Robert. In context, it serves as a first-pair part designed to elicit instruction or assistance in navigating his participation in activities. It thus seems to be a compensatory strategy whereby Robert makes use of an available communicative resource to negotiate interactional challenges. I outline the sequential contexts in which this practice is employed and also examine its change in usage over 16 months as the disease progressed. Robert’s use of FPP ‘now what’ became more frequent and more varied in its usage across contexts, in turn eliciting less systematic responses from interlocutors.

This potential can be realized by explicitly saying that the other is not listening in the conversation or directly telling the other to listen. Interaction in the crisis negotiations during the standoff between the FBI and the Branch Davidians outside Waco, TX in the early spring of 1993 is rich with practices that hold the other accountable for displaying poor listening skills. This is a study of the intersection of talk and listening whereby analysis describes metatalk practices of “listen” that expose participants’ assumptions about how listening should be conducted and how the interaction should proceed. Implications for the analysis reflect on listening, metatalk about listening, and crisis negotiation as communication practices.",Getting People to Do Stuff in Interaction,Language & Social Interaction

I propose that recruitment also encompasses the practice of getting someone else to co-participate in a collaborative activity. Like requesting and offering assistance, when recruiting another to co-participate in an activity, interlocutors are solving an interactional problem: how to get someone to co-participate in an activity. This paper proposes that the practice of recruitment to co-participate solves the interactional problem of engaging someone in a shared activity. In other words, obtaining assistance is not the problem, but rather engaging someone to co-participate in a shared activity.",Getting People to Do Stuff in Interaction,Language & Social Interaction
2017-1284,2017,Paper Session,Activating Weak Ties for Social Support: Anticipated Future Interactions and Communication Channel,2,"Information communication technology (ICT) enables us to seek social support from weak ties. However, convincing these contacts to provide the requested support can be challenging due to lack of emotional attachment and commitment in weak-tie relationships. Drawing upon the self-presentational approach to compliance, the present study examines how weak ties can be activated for support provision via ICT. Specifically, we investigated how the level of anticipated future interactions (AFI) between support request senders and recipients and the choice of support seeking channel --- specifically email, texting, and voicemail --- affect support provision via self-presentational concern. Results from a between-group experiment (N = 398) show that self-presentational concern fully mediated the impact of AFI and support seeking channel on support provision. Specifically, voicemail caused less self-presentational concern compared to email and texting, which was then positively related to support provision. Our findings develop the literature on ICT and social support provision and provide practical implications to using ICT for support seeking.",Online Interactions and Social Support,Communication and Technology
2017-1285,2017,Paper Session,"The Relationship Between Use of Social Network Sites, Stress, Online Social Support and Life Satisfaction",2,"We used the data from six waves of a longitudinal study with a representative sample of Dutch online users to a) examine whether users and non-users of SNS differ in overall life satisfaction, stress and online social support and b) shed light on the underlying cross-sectional and longitudinal processes. Prior research basically identified two paths: 1) a negative effect of SNS use on well-being via frequent reading of positive status updates and unfavorable social comparisons, and 2) a positive effect via social support retrieved from the SNS network. Users reported higher levels of stress, but also more online social support than non-users; the two groups did not differ in overall life satisfaction. Crossed-lagged panel models suggest that the difference in stress is mainly due to a selection effect. For online social support, we found cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between asking for advice on SNS and online social support.",Online Interactions and Social Support,Communication and Technology

We asked whether self-disclosure to a friend would influence the amount of social support received 6 months later and whether, in turn, it would influence self-disclosure another 6 months later. We further analyzed spill-over effects from face-to-face to messenger communication and vice versa. Results from a longitudinal study with three measuring points (6 months interval) based on a representative sample of 576 German instant messenger users found effects of self-disclosure on social support in instant messenger, but not in face-to-face communication. Further, we found a spill-over effect: The social support mutual friends receive in messenger communication influences how they disclose in face-to-face encounters 6 months later. In light of these results, the impact of instant messenger communication on how individuals maneuver friendships through the interplay of self-disclosure and social support are discussed.",Online Interactions and Social Support,Communication and Technology
2017-1287,2017,Paper Session,The Relation Between Face-to-Face and Digital Interactions and College Students’ Self-Esteem: A Daily Diary Study,2,"The present study used a daily diary method to examine the associations between the quantity and quality of social interactions (i.e., face to face vs. digital) and college students’ self-esteem, as well as the moderating role of social interaction anxiety on this relation. Participants completed a daily diary checklist at the end of each day over a five-day period to report their social interactions and self-esteem for a given day. Results showed that the quality of face-to-face interactions and text messaging as well as the quantity and quality of social networking were positively associated with self-esteem. However, only yesterday’s quality of face-to-face interactions positively predicted today’s self-esteem. In addition, social interaction anxiety moderated the same-day associations between quality of text messaging / face-to-face interactions and self-esteem. The findings of the present study suggest that only meaningful face-to-face interactions are capable of enhancing college students’ self-esteem the next day.",Online Interactions and Social Support,Communication and Technology

The impact of Personal and Media Experience on the Evaluation on an Event,1,"This study tests whether media can exert an impact, if personal experience already exists. Research indicates that media have a bigger impact on those without than on those with personal experience. For those who gained personal experience, it is important whether the media depiction is in line with personal experience or whether it is contradictory. Public opinion research suggests that with incongruent personal experience media can exert an influence when it is perceived as portraying the majority opinion. These assumptions were tested with an experiment (n = 523). Participants and non-participants of an event received a film stimulus (positive, balanced and negative) covering that event. Results show that non-participants are stronger influenced by the film than participants of the event. Yet, even for those with personal experience, media can exert an influence: Participants changed their evaluation of the event accordingly. This effect is mainly mediated via the presumed majority opinion.",Media and the Construction of Reality,Mass Communication

2017-1293,2017,Paper Session,"Does Increasing Post Sex Communication Influence Satisfaction, Distress, and Conflict in Relationships?: A Pillow Talk Intervention",6,"The present study tested a “pillow talk intervention” where couples were randomly assigned to either an experimental condition in which they doubled their communication after sexual activity (i.e., “pillow talk”) for three weeks or a control condition. At the conclusion of the three weeks, couples came to the lab to engage in a conflict conversation. The aim of the intervention was to test whether increasing pillow talk promotes greater relationship satisfaction, reduced relational distress, and greater use of constructive conflict strategies. The sample consisted of 100 individuals (50 heterosexual couples). Results revealed that the intervention was successful in increasing men’s relationship satisfaction, but not women’s. For women, the amount of change in pillow talk from time 1 to time 2 negatively predicted relational distress, which mediated the association between changes in pillow talk and the enactment of constructive conflict strategies. More specifically, the greater the increase in women’s pillow talk from time 1 to time 2, the less relational distress they reported, which predicted the greater use of integrative conflict strategies and negotiation. These results have implications for the post sex disclosures model and suggest that the benefits of pillow talk may extend beyond the sexual episode.",Interpersonally Managing Conflict,Interpersonal Communication

However, little empirical research has examined how marital couples communicate about financial issues, specifically, and how these financial communication messages contribute to, or detract from, marital satisfaction. In the present study of 326 married individuals, we found that constructive financial conflict messages were positively associated with financial harmony, marital satisfaction, and financial communication satisfaction. Destructive financial conflict messages, the demand-withdraw financial conflict message pattern, and mutually avoiding financial conflict were each negatively associated with financial harmony, marital satisfaction, and financial communication satisfaction. In addition, financial communication satisfaction mediated the relationship between each of the different financial conflict message patterns and marital satisfaction.",Interpersonally Managing Conflict,Interpersonal Communication
2017-1295,2017,Paper Session,Successful Dominance Strategies in Romantic Couples' Conflict,5,"Domineering in romantic relationships - the ways romantic partners impose their will - is an integral and fundamental part of relationship functioning. This study explores the variability of behavioral domineering strategies utilized in couples’ communication. Romantic couples (N = 63) reenacted a typical conflict interaction while being recorded. We used open codes to qualitatively analyze the verbal and nonverbal behavior of partners during the reenactment. Codes were ascribed to behaviors that led to one partner’s display of situational dominance; these codes were categorized into domineering strategies. We identified 14 dominance strategies which featured qualities such as activity, pro-sociality, directness, and the strength of expressed behavior. We conclude that in real-life disputes of romantic couples, we can find several influential domineering strategies overlooked by the traditional socio-psychological literature, some of which are prosocial or indirect. A better understanding of the variability in domineering could help to improve diagnosis and therapy.

Participants included 147 individuals who were currently in a romantic relationship. Results revealed positive associations between argument frequency and relationship uncertainty, the perceived threat of the argument to the relationship and all three forms of relational uncertainty, and inverse associations between the perceived resolvability of the issue and all three forms of relational uncertainty. Interaction effects emerged for perceived threat by perceived resolvability for self and partner uncertainty, such that the resolvability of the issue diminished the strength of the positive association between the perceived threat of the argument and self and partner uncertainty.",Interpersonally Managing Conflict,Interpersonal Communication

This meta-analysis summarizes past research on processing fluency and its effects on liking to test that assumption. A random effects model using n = 43 correlations shows small support for fluency-liking link (r = 0.29 [CI= 0.21, 0.37], p < 0.001). Moderator analyses were also conducted and substantial and significant effects were found for study design type (between versus within subjects studies) as well as types of fluency manipulations. Results also suggest publication bias in the literature. Implications for theory and methods are discussed.

The aim of this study is to examine a key facilitator of advertising effects when multiscreening, namely task relevance. In an online (n = 280) and a laboratory (n = 185) experiment with different multiscreening settings, we showed that people who engage in related multiscreening have better brand memory and more positive brand attitudes than people who engage in unrelated multiscreening via attention and subsequent program involvement.

We conducted an experiment to test whether the violation of gender stereotypes leads to backlash against participants in online discussion using linguistic style that contradicts stereotypes associated with their gender. Based on status incongruity theory, we expect a backlash effect against agentic women. Results show that women who adopt an agentic communication style are perceived as less persuasive than agentic men, and that women are perceived as less persuasive than men in general, regardless of style. Meanwhile, we do not find a similar effect for status-incongruent men arguing in a communal manner. However, contrary to expectations, backlash against agentic women was not mediated by stereotyped perceptions of excessive dominance and a lack of communality.",Promising Student Papers (Best Papers by Student Authors),Information Systems
2017-1301,2017,Paper Session,Discourse of Renewal: Developing Multiple-Item Measurement and Analyzing Effects on Relationships,1,"Emphasis on protecting an organization’s image and reputation has dominated research in crisis communication. Crisis is assumed to only bring negative impact as it tarnishes an organization’s reputation. Priority is placed upon whether an organization can come up with response strategies that protect the organization’s image and reputation, rather than on rebuilding relationships. Discourse of renewal provides a complementary approach than image- and reputation-centered perspectives to theorize crises as opportunities to reflect, grow, and therefore renew to a better state. Bearing these gaps and untested assumptions in mind, the current study first established valid and reliable measurement for discourse of renewal, and investigated how discourse of renewal influences publics’ relationship with the organization. Results of the study showed that engagement, prospective foci, communication efficiency, and emphasis on organizational culture and core values are four distinct dimensions of discourse of renewal. Discourse of renewal was also shown to positively influence publics’ relationship with the organization.",Top Student Papers in Public Relations,Public Relations

However, the current literature offers little insight regarding the dynamics of publics and their shared information in social-mediated crises. By integrating the Social-Mediated Crisis Communication (SMCC) model, Information Utility Perspective, and Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model, our study examines the types of social media publics, their information sharing behavior, and the correspondence between publics’ shared messages and the corporation’s responses in different stages of a crisis. By applying network analysis and content analysis to the six-month Twitter data of the Chipotle crisis, we identify broadcasters as a new type of social media publics, along with influentials and followers. Moreover, the results show that publics’ shared message features (i.e., prevalence, diversity, and form) significantly changed based on the specific stage of the crises. Our study contributes to the crisis communication literature by empirically differentiating types of publics based on information flows on social media and unveiling the evolution of publics in the social media network by stages.

Adopting the investment model as a theoretical framework and using structural equation modeling, the study developed a crisis relational maintenance model to explain how crises may become opportunities for organizations to (re)build and even improve their relationships with the publics. Results of the study showed that an organization’s relationship maintenance strategies improved publics’ trust and commitment to the organization. Publics’ trust and commitment paid off in organizational crises as publics restrained from destructive behaviors and were more inclined to constructive behaviors towards the organization.

To address the issue, this study revisits Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) in Chinese contexts by taking an online discussion on Weibo about a high-profile homicide in a McDonald’s restaurant as the case. Built on framing theory and categorization of national contexts, an inductive framing analysis of 100 top forwarded posts demonstrates the complex negotiation process of context-embedded frames and its significant impacts on crisis attribution. Based on the empirical results, this study takes an initial step towards a contextually sensitive perspective in the field of crisis communication by refining the model of SCCT: first, the consideration of modifier should integrate contextual factors; second, the determination of crisis type should rely on crisis framing.

Using professionally-produced videos, we conducted a two-condition experiment (N = 73) to examine in which condition children were better able to learn a novel word. Results indicated an effect of condition and age: children in the participatory cues condition and older children demonstrated greater word learning than children in the third-party joint attention condition and younger children. There was also an interaction: children older than 2.75 years in the participatory cues condition learned significantly better than all other children. These findings demonstrate that participatory cues, used in children’s television, can promote children’s word learning. These findings run counter to a similar study which used stimulus videos that did not mimic children’s television, finding that the third-party joint attention was more effective.","Learning From Media (Part 1): Teaching Youngsters Through Television, Books, and Games",Children Adolescents and the Media

Lab-created stimuli included four different book formats (print-noninteractive, print-interactive, electronic-noninteractive, electronic-interactive) designed to incorporate novel word-object pairs. Novel word learning was assessed using a posttest in which children identified each target object from an array. Story comprehension was assessed using a posttest story sequencing task. Findings indicate that book effectiveness varied by age, condition, and learning outcome. Older children performed better on tasks than younger children overall. Additionally, eBooks supported children’s word learning, while interactivity hindered story comprehension. Contrary to popular belief, using electronic platform did not invariably lead to worse learning outcomes compared to print. However, interactivity may inhibit combining individual story events into a cohesive sequence. Results from the current study emphasize the importance of considering interactivity when examining the impact of different book types on children’s learning.","Learning From Media (Part 1): Teaching Youngsters Through Television, Books, and Games",Children Adolescents and the Media

The first aim of this study was to investigate whether the effect of vegetable-promoting picture books on toddlers’ vegetable consumption differed according to the reading style and the use of a hand puppet during reading. The second aim was to investigate whether these effects were mediated by toddlers’ narrative involvement and character imitation. In a 2 (reading style: interactive vs. passive) x 2 (puppet use: with vs. without puppet) between-subjects design, 163 toddlers (2-3 years) were randomly assigned to one of the four reading conditions. The story was about a rabbit that loves to eat carrots. After the fourth reading day, the eating task was conducted in which children could eat freely from four different snacks, including carrots. The main finding was that interactive reading produced the greatest carrot consumption. The explanation for this effect was that interactive reading stimulated toddlers to imitate poses of the book characters, even more when interactive reading was supported by the use of a hand puppet. The findings underline that young children should be actively involved with health interventions in order for them to be effective.","Learning From Media (Part 1): Teaching Youngsters Through Television, Books, and Games",Children Adolescents and the Media

This study assessed whether the effects of RTL media in early childhood sustained into middle childhood. We recontacted and reassessed 101 youth in middle childhood who had participated in an evaluation of an RTL literacy-themed computer game in early childhood. We found a curvilinear relationship between children’s early childhood pretest scores and middle childhood outcomes.

We investigate how they manage the dual challenge of advocating for public health and sustainability as well as corporate responsibility and accountability. We employ Bendell’s (2004)’s typology of viewpoints on corporate power among corporate accountability NGOs to analyze how food activists conceptualize corporate power and how that conception influences the tactics they use to promote change. We analyzed the discourse of March Against Monsanto, Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the Equitable Food Initiative. Although the framework facilitated important comparisons, these food activists differed in some important ways from the corporate accountability NGOs in that study. We also identified a significant approach missing from the Bendells’ framework. We describe the Cincinnati Union Cooperative’s Our Harvest and Apple Street Market as transformative, alternative efforts that represent potential replacements for the dominant corporate model.

2017-1316,2017,Paper Session,"Gender, Communication, and Organizational Paradox",2,"This paper reviews and synthesizes the role of paradox, contradictions, and dialectics in gender and organizational communication. It highlights two eras of research, modernist scholarship that shows how communication leads to identity, visibility, and meritocracy paradoxes that often result in double binds and inequality. It contrasts this work with organizational communication studies that focus on the doing or performing of gender that casts paradox as an opportunity to negotiate new identities and organizational forms. In this view, paradoxical tensions that stem from performing gender and diversity often lead to ambiguity, ambivalence, and dissonance that can create spaces for actions. The contrast of the two approaches shows how organizational paradox is not only indispensable to the production of gender and power but also to the ontology of organization itself.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication
2017-1317,2017,Paper Session,More Than a Moral Person: How Communication Networks and Identity Influence Online Volunteering,1,"Traditionally, volunteering has been described as prosocial behaviors primarily motivated by a desire to do general good for society. In the contemporary media environment, however, not all volunteering might be prosocial in this respect. People can easily select and volunteer for specific organizations or social issues they truly support in the online sphere, so they might be more concerned about pursuing the specific values rather than performing prosocial behaviors in an abstract sense. In order to investigate the motivations and dynamics of online volunteering, this study examines how communication networks and volunteer identities influence their commitment to online volunteering. The results from an online survey of 816 U.S.-based online volunteers suggest that volunteers identifying highly as strong supporters of particular organizations (high volunteer identity at the organizational level) or social issues (high volunteer identity at the collective level) are more likely to participate in online volunteering than volunteers from prosocial motivations (volunteer identity at the personal level), as they are supported by communicative communities. Implications for understanding online volunteering as an action beyond personal morality based on supportive community are discussed.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication
2017-1318,2017,Paper Session,Practices of Effective Natural Resource Management in the U.S. Arctic,1,"In the United States, where public opinion on anthropomorphic climate change remains divided and policy action on sustainable resource management is piecemeal at best and severely misguided at worst, the Arctic region—encompassing the state of Alaska—has predictably remained at the periphery of public discourse and/or hampered by political wrangling and corporate lobbying. This paper thus examines how key organizations engaged in the work of natural resource management (NRM) (e.g., for-profit corporations, nonprofits, state and federal government agencies, native Alaskan entities), and how they are able to nonetheless enact practices of effective NRM. Three broad aspects are revealed through this qualitative study - decision-making, communicative nature of NRM, and risk-management. Implications are discussed.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication
2017-1319,2017,Paper Session,Rethinking Calling as Communicative Practice and Theoretical Term: A Proposed Framework for Research and Practice,2,"Research on calling is limited because of definitional diversity and fragmentation of the rapidly proliferating, multidisciplinary literature. Taking a pragmatic approach, this paper proposes a framework that argues for studying calling as communicative practice and theoretical terms. In creating a productive tension between situated context and theoretical context of the concept of calling this framework helps productively advance scholarship on calling (and meaningful work). This framework will also prove helpful for generative research and practice of other organizational and social phenomena in which advances are impeded by fragmentation and definitional diversity within the literature.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication

By identifying key organizational- and community-level factors that influence the formation of alliance ties, this paper investigates how community-level interdependence, especially the interdependence derived from the overlap of resource and identity niche among the diverse immigrant-serving NGO populations, may impact individual organizations’ online alliance reporting. ERGM analysis results suggest that the overlap of resource niche significantly and positively predicts the formation of alliance relationships, whereas the overlap of identity niche has more complicated effects.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication
2017-1321,2017,Paper Session,Who is Included and Who is Left Out: Humanitarian Organizations’ Stakeholder Communication via Social Media,2,"This study employs a multi-theoretical framework to examine the mechanisms behind organizations’ strategic use of social media to target different stakeholders and the resulting outcomes. Moreover, considering the importance of accommodating different stakeholders’ technology access and usage habits, this study investigates organizations’ use of non-social media channels to engage with the stakeholders not reached through social media. Data from an online survey with 157 humanitarian organizations operating across the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and Europe showed that for the stakeholders with which organizations put on frontstage image building, organizations tend to use social media in diverse and interactive ways. Specifically, organizations’ diverse uses of social media help the informational, community-building, and mobilization gratifications related to organizational operations. To accommodate certain stakeholders’ interests and needs, organizations use non-SM channels to reach those targeted stakeholders, which helps organizations improve the overall communication capacity. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication
2017-1322,2017,Paper Session,Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in Nonprofit Collaboration: An Exploratory Study,3,"Although research has examined nonprofit organizations’ use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly social media and websites, we know little about how nonprofit organizations use ICTs in the context of interorganizational collaboration. To fill this gap, this article reports the results of an exploratory study on how nonprofit organizations use ICTs for collaboration, drawing from a random sample of human services nonprofit organizations in the United States. The results show that email, teleconference, and shared repositories were the preferred ICTs more than case management software and databases. ICTs were used for coordination, information sharing, relational communication, and client management. In addition, ICT use and utilities vary in different types of collaboration. Further, operational capacity, percentage of government funding, overall ICT capacity, and organizational size influenced the patterns of ICT use in nonprofit collaboration. Drawing from our findings, we suggest implications for the study of nonprofit collaboration and ICT use.","B.E.S.T.: Activism, Volunteerism and Nongovernmental Organizations",Organizational Communication
2017-1323,2017,Paper Session,Sports Serve Society by Providing Vivid Examples of Sexuality: The Hyper- and Hetero-Sexualized Images of Athletes in “ESPN The Body Issue”,1,"ESPN annually releases The Body Issue, featuring nude images of athletes. This study interpreted the images in ESPN The Body Issue to examine how both male and female athletes were represented. Even though some male athletes were still depicted in a masculine manner, they posed with some feministic gestures. Some female White athletes struck poses similar to nude models, but this trend seems to be obsolete in the most recent edition. Contrary to the traditional stereotype, they were depicted as strong athletes by showing their muscles and active sporting poses. It is obvious that both male and female athletes are sexually objectified in ESPN The Body Issue. But they also showed other gender traits simultaneously, by emphasizing their strength and unifying them as true athletes rather than nude models, especially for female athletes.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication
2017-1324,2017,Paper Session,Decolonizing Transness in Sport Media: On Transgender Representations in Sports Illustrated: A Summary,1,"This discourse analysis examines depictions of trans athletes in Sports Illustrated and sport culture through the lens of queer theory and the interpretive-packages model proposed by Gamson and Modigliani (1989). Four interpretive packages emerged from the print content: (1) Marginalization, (2) Labeling, (3) Fighting and Fairness and (4) Pride and Affirmation. The results illustrate that discourse has generally become more sensitive to trans issues. The author presents these results with cautious optimism. Blindingly affirming and romancing the transgender can be equally as superficial as marginalization, and representations of trans athletes secured by one person are problematic. Researchers and sport organizations should dismantle antiquated, coercive sex segregation in traditional sport and decolonize how it contributes to gender-based oppression. The author recommends that media outlets focus on presenting fair, accurate and inclusive representations of transness that combat oppressive positions.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication

Because understanding if motives for displaying national identity and motives for spectating sport could play a role in the consumption of Olympic media across televisual, print and digital platforms, a survey of 257 respondents was conducted, and structural equation modeling was used to determine the relationships among national identity motives, sport spectatorship motives and Olympic media consumption. The analysis revealed the strongest relationships in a three-step approach, where national identity motives directly influence sport spectatorship motives, which in turn directly influences media consumption. Specific relationships are discussed, along with their implications.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication

Specifically, we tested hypotheses derived from mood-as-information, social identity, and sociometer frameworks. A three-wave field study measured mood, group affiliation, and self-esteem among 174 students at two different universities right before the universities played in a much-anticipated football game and on two consecutive days after the game. Results indicate that self-esteem was still affected two days after game day; fans of the winning team showed increased self-esteem, but self-esteem of fans of the defeated team was unaffected. Both the game outcome and the social viewing context influenced self-esteem, and impacts on self-esteem were mediated by both mood and group affiliation changes.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication
2017-1327,2017,Paper Session,The Effects of a Nutrition Media Literacy Intervention on Parents and Children,4,"This pretest/posttest experiment with control group examined a family-based media literacy curriculum (N=101 dyads) designed to improve parents’ media management skills and decrease youths’ susceptibility to appealing but unrealistic food marketing. The six weekly sessions focused on minimizing marketing influences and strengthening the family communication environment for decision making about nutrition. Structural equation modeling and additional Bayesian analysis for small sample sizes showed that the curriculum increased parental mediation to foster youths’ critical thinking about food marketing, increased parent efficacy for making healthy dietary changes for their families, and fostered family discussion about nutrition labels. In addition, influences of perceived desirability and wishful identification on youths’ requests for marketed foods was reduced. The results showed that media literacy education that empowers parents and promotes critical thinking among youth can reduce negative effects of food marketing on families while improving their use media effectively for nutrition information that aids dietary choices.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication

An Intervention Study in Bangladesh,4,"This study examines the effects of theory-based intervention imparting health education messages to influence ANC uptake among expectant women in Bangladesh. We deployed a three-month intervention program using mobile phones and traditional platform to relay threat-framed and coping-framed information about pregnancy complications and ANC derived from Protection Motivation theory-based cognitive and socio-cultural constructs among 420 pregnant women. The findings revealed significant differences in hypothesized dependent variables, namely response efficacy, self-efficacy, social connectedness, women’s autonomy, and intention to uptake ANC among participants receiving mobile-based messages over those using traditional platform, but only among those exposed to threat-framed messages. In contrast, participants exposed to coping-framed messages, interaction effects with combined platform revealed significant more positive responses. The research findings suggest to the potential role of mobile phone in influencing pregnant women’s knowledge on pregnancy complications and ANC, and can be used to tailor mobile-based health education materials in a resource poor environment.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication

The current study presents results from three online surveys spanning more than a 21-week period to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multi-faceted, student-driven sexual consent education intervention. The intervention was created with extensive formative research and implemented under the guidance of an undergraduate student advisory board and university faculty, staff, and administration. Compared to baseline, at the end of the intervention period, students reported significantly greater positive attitudes about establishing sexual consent, perceived behavioral control to obtain sexual consent, intentions to obtain and respect a partner’s sexual consent, and understanding of what constitutes sexual consent. The intervention was especially effective with historically hard-to-reach populations, such as college men and sorority and fraternity members.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication

This study tested a sun protection intervention based on diffusion of innovations and transportation theory to increase vacationers’ comprehensive sun protection, i.e., use of clothing, hats, and shade and use, pre-application and reapplication of sunscreen. The trial enrolled 41 warm weather resorts in a pair-matched group randomized pretest-posttest controlled design and assessed adult vacationers at outdoor recreation venues regarding sun protection at pretest (n=3,531) and posttest (n=3,226). Results showed no overall effect on comprehensive sun protection across venues, the intervention produced statistically significant improvements in sun protection at waterside venues (pools and beaches). The intervention may have worked best with guests in the highest-risk recreation venue, i.e., waterside recreation venues where they exposed the most skin. Alternative approaches that alter resort organizations, such as through policy, environmental features, or occupational efforts might be more effective than targeting vacationers with behavior-change messages.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2017-1331,2017,Paper Session,The Culture-Centered Approach in Designing a Gender-Tailored Heart Health Intervention for Female Heart Patients,7,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number killer of women in Singapore and globally. Despite public health campaigns such as ‘Go Red for Women’, there is still a considerable gap in terms of improvements in heart health outcomes among women, and their knowledge of CVD risk factors and prevention behavior. In this study, grounded in the culture-centered approach, we report the findings from a one-year long gender-tailored heart health intervention with 100 female heart patients of a government hospital in Singapore. The findings suggest limited support for the role of a culture-centered health communication intervention in addressing the heart health risks experienced by women. However, the study offers preliminary insights on how a culture-centered intervention might impact on a patient’s willingness to discuss treatment options with their physician, and whether they seek out health information from health-oriented information sources.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication

Early Digital Copyright and the History of Computational Thought,1,"The 1978 Report of the Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) laid groundwork for three controversial issues today: 1) backing up digital media; 2) modifying software for personal use; and 3) using EULAs to govern users. CONTU is the first policy attempt to make digital media intelligible through the governmental apparatus of intellectual property and engages with questions digital scholars pursue today including: post/cyborg- humanism; materiality; form and content; inscription and legibility; and function vs. expression. However, CONTU is largely ignored in scholarship on media history, technology policy, software studies, critical information studies and the history of computation. I analyze the document in light of contemporary media theoretical questions, situating it as a key artifact in the genealogy of computational media and communication history. My analysis concludes that the unarticulated ethicopolitical question underlying the CONTU report was to identify what counts as a creative body.","Technologies of Communication: History, Policy, and Economy",Communication History
2017-1333,2017,Paper Session,"Investigating ""The Telephone of Tomorrow"": The Histories and Fictions of the Picturephone",1,"This paper examines the discursive construction of videotelephony surrounding AT&T’s release of the Picturephone in 1964. Through an analysis of its promotional and journalist rhetoric, as well as the science fiction accounts of videophones in The Jetsons and 2001: A Space Odyssey, this paper explores how videotelephony was envisioned in popular discourse. Although AT&T sought to paint the Picturephone as a utopian technology that would enhance domestic intimacy and corporate efficiency, journalistic and science fiction texts saw it more ambivalently. These accounts frequently constructed videotelephony as a source of anxiety, an expression of heightened corporate control and unfulfilling family relationships. Ultimately, I argue that despite their claims, the discourse that surrounded the Picturephone was not revolutionary, but saw the device as a means of exacerbating preexistent norms and anxieties, constructing a vision of technologically mediated domesticity defined by the traditional gender roles and class and racial hierarchies of 1960s America.","Technologies of Communication: History, Policy, and Economy",Communication History
2017-1334,2017,Paper Session,Simultaneous Observation: The Scientific Correspondence Network of Nicolas-Claude Febri de Peiresc (Top Student Paper in Division),1,"While Galileo Galilei was being persecuted by the church for publishing a book containing his heliocentric views, other members of the Republic of Letters in the early 17th century were able to continue their scientific work without impediment or censure. At the hub of a large of network of correspondence -- passing along data, studies of nature and results of experimentation -- was Nicolas-Claude Febri de Peiresc. This article looks at Peiresc's letters, how they functioned to bind together a community engaged in scientific research and data collection, which would have otherwise been hindered by the state and the Catholic Church. It looks at letters as an interactive medium uniquely suited for skirting censorship in this instance and girding the kind of small, risky conversations that characterized the nascent study of the natural world in Peiresc and Galileo’s time.","Technologies of Communication: History, Policy, and Economy",Communication History

This paper takes a different approach to conglomeration, examining it as a social, cultural, and economic phenomenon that registered widely in contemporary media and thought. Even for a public accustomed to corporate gigantism, wildly diversified conglomerates like Gulf+Western and ITT represented something new, and commentary on them could be found everywhere from popular films to architectural theory. I argue that conglomerates showed up in so many different venues because they were symbolically useful, providing an especially powerful example of the technocratic bigness and totalizing systems that social thinkers, artists, writers, musicians, and filmmakers placed at the heart of social experience in the 1960s and 1970s. In this regard, conglomerates were something to think with – an emblem of tendencies that pervaded public life in late-modern times.","Technologies of Communication: History, Policy, and Economy",Communication History

Since then, the country has made impressive social and economic growth, but little scholarly attention has been given to the media landscape during this redevelopment. This study uses qualitative, in-depth interviews with journalists to understand how they perceive their role in society and the level of press freedom afforded to them. Results reveal a complex relationship between journalists and the Rwandan government in which reporters describe working with the government to promote development aims while simultaneously trying to serve a watchdog function. While restrictions on press freedom do exist, journalists tend to censor themselves for the development and reunification of the nation, thus exemplifying McQuail’s (2010) media development theory and likely reinforcing the existing authoritarian power structure.",Top Papers in Global Communication and Social Change,Global Communication and Social Change

We did this by content-analyzing 279 articles from IS’s magazine Dabiq, undoubtedly the group’s most important written media. Findings are threefold: 1) IS perceives itself more through a political lens than through a religious one; 2) theological foundations to describe the group’s world views are reasonably narrow and referring to ahadith decreases significantly over time; 3) following Selective Moral Disengagement Theory, IS is increasingly hostile by consistently activating dehumanization practices.

Second goal is to recast the relationship between art and activism. I propose we consider rap as a lingua franca of Arab youth cultural politics, a movement of disengagement with the cultural politics of the immediate past and a re-inscribing of specific cultural and political values. It echoes Martin-Barbero’s (1993) definition of mediation as the articulations between communication practices (e.g., rap) and social movements (e.g., uprisings) and the articulation of different tempos of development and practice (Saudi Arabia and Tunisia).

Consequently, it offered the FCC an opportunity to re-evaluate its regulatory approach to best maximize the Internet’s democratic potential. Although the FCC acknowledged the critiques raised by various stakeholders through regulatory action, both its justification for them and their shortcomings reveal the limitations of the FCC’s current regulatory philosophy to broadband, net neutrality, and cable ownership regulation.",Public Interest vs State Interest in Regulatory Considerations,Communication Law & Policy

I contend that lauding the Marco Civil as a global legal template is a hallmark example of what the critical anthropologist, Anita Say Chan, describes as “the myth of digital universalism”(2013): the presumption that digital technologies, and their associated cultural forms, flow smoothly around the globe and present a uniform set of effects irrespective of socio-cultural variation.

These identities shape the ways in which they approach higher education as well as the ways in which they form relationships with peers and instructors. Thus, this study set out to examine how student identities and faculty verbal messages impact learning outcomes in a basic, general education communication course. Over 500 students completed identity, faculty verbal messages, learner empowerment, and learning indicators measures. A series of path analyses revealed that academic, social, and involvement identities positively impact confirming faculty verbal messages; academic identities negatively impact disconfirming verbal messages; and both confirming and disconfirming faculty verbal messages impact learner empowerment, which positively affects learning indicators. Teaching Interaction Identity did not fit the model well, but without it the model was unable to meet acceptable statistical analysis criteria. Overall, these results point to the need for faculty members to better understand the overlapping identities with which students enter their classrooms and also to tailor the messages they use when interacting with these students if they want to achieve desired learning outcomes.",Social Support,Instructional & Developmental Communication

The paper builds on recent examinations of “celebrity migration” between fields (Arthurs and Shaw, 2016; Driessens, 2012; Giles, 2015), but suggest that hitherto much of the scholarly discussion has focused on celebrities’ attempts to move from the media sub-fields to the field of politics or “high” culture fields. This paper is keen to develop this approach in relation to migration between sub-fields within the wider media field. Processes of synergy, the paper ultimately proposes, can be described as a streamlining of migration between networked industries.","Thoroughly Mixed Bag: Consumption, Culture, and Celebrity",Popular Communication
2017-1353,2017,Paper Session,“Just Another Day in 2016”: Reconciling Paradox Through the Millennial Rhetorical Style,2,"The millennial generation is characterized by paradox and contradiction. Empirical research indicates that individuals born between 1981 and 1997 tend to be relatively distrustful of traditional social institutions and suspicious of the challenging conditions they are confronting as they enter adulthood. Paradoxically, millennials also tend to be the most optimistic, confident, and civically engaged generation in recent memory. This paper examines the symbolic resources, cultural fictions, and discursive structures millennials develop and deploy to make sense of this paradox. We identify a unique style well equipped for making sense of these paradoxical conditions. More specifically, we use multi-platform media company theSkimm to identify three distinctive features of millennial rhetorical style: destabilization of problematic conventions, the revitalization of popular culture, and the encouragement of collective engagement. We close with a discussion of important insights for our pedagogy, discipline, and marginalized groups using language as a means of intervention.","Thoroughly Mixed Bag: Consumption, Culture, and Celebrity",Popular Communication
2017-1354,2017,Paper Session,Abstract Language as a Frame Device,1,"The purpose of this study is to understand abstract and concrete language use as a persuasive frame device in the context of the MMR-autism vaccine controversy. Literature elaborates on the significance of framing devices in making frame messages applicable and accessible. A 2x2x2 experiment showed that participants adopted discursive patterns (i.e., abstract or concrete language use) after exposure to a high or low abstract opinion article. That is, those who consumed op-eds with more abstract language would talk about it in more abstract language. This suggests a mimicking or adoption effect insofar as frame devices are concerned. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses, however, revealed that these participants reappropriated such language patterns to convey their own thoughts. Therefore, a frame device effect may operate independent of the intended framing effect.",Media Portrayals and Frames of Health Issues,Mass Communication

Further, this paper proposes a conceptual model to investigate how the photo-induced discomfort for physical contacts increase the dehumanizing perceptions of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. For this purpose, two experimental studies were conducted. Results overall showed that the headless photo of obese individuals triggered the disease avoidance responses, which, in turn, increased the dehumanizing perception of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. What is unexpected is the finding that this indirect effect of the visual framing was stronger when the gender of the obese person in the news photo and that of the reader match than when they do not match. Detailed discussions and implications of these findings for the usages of the photo in mass communications are included in this paper.",Media Portrayals and Frames of Health Issues,Mass Communication
2017-1356,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Alcohol Portrayal on Alcohol Expectancies and Attitude and the Influence of Viewer's Characteristics *Top Student Paper,2,"A number of correlative and experimental studies indicate that mass media portrayals of alcohol consumption impact viewers’ alcohol expectancies, attitudes and behaviors. Based on social cognitive theory, the portrayed consequence and the valance of the character experiencing these consequences are important to consider when investigating mass media alcohol portrayals. However, experimental studies manipulating character valence and consequences are scarce. The current study presents an experimental examination of an adult sample, manipulating the occurrence of consequences (no consequences, positive consequences, and negative consequences), as well as character valence (positive or negative character). Furthermore, the moderating role of participants’ level of alcohol consumption and sensation seeking are considered. We found that participants’ individual characteristics strongly influenced the effects of consequence portrayals; however, the valence of the depicted character does not moderate the impact of the portrayed consequences. A public discussion on the dramatic use of alcohol seems overdue.",Media Portrayals and Frames of Health Issues,Mass Communication

We compare the frames conveyed in news with those in special interest publications (SIP) and public service announcements (PSAs). We also investigate linkages between news sources and verbal and visual frames in order to understand why journalists and other actors convey the frames that they do. We find significant differences among the communication contexts with regard to the verbal and visual expression of the frames. Also, the news frames differed significantly among the news sources used; significant differences in the visual frames were observed among photo sources. These results are interpreted both from a normative and a practical perspective. By investigating frame building, this study contributes to a very important but rather neglected research avenue. By including visuals in our analysis of frame building, we expand the focus of frame building studies.",Media Portrayals and Frames of Health Issues,Mass Communication

Results showed that people exposed to uncivil comment streams had a less positive attitude toward the site and perceived it as less valuable than those exposed to civil comment streams or comment streams with a mixed tone. In addition, exposure to uncivil comment streams resulted in people feeling less loyal to the news site and seeing themselves as dissimilar to commenters on the news site. Overall, findings strongly supported a “hostile atmosphere effect” where incivility on a news websites damages the news audience, even if they are merely reading comments, not engaging in the comment streams.",Incivility in Audience Comments,Mass Communication

It also examined the extent of incivility in comments. News story comments (N = 2,497) posted on four news websites in regard to three controversial topics related to race, sexual orientation, and politics were quantitatively content analyzed. Results reveal that uncivil attributes, such as profanity, insulting language, and bigoted speech, marred 17.8% of comments. In contrast, deliberative attributes, such as providing evidence to support one’s view or asking legitimate questions, were present in 27.1% of comments. Notably, results showed that uncivil and deliberative attributes occurred in some of the same comments, suggesting that incivility and deliberation may co-exist. Findings also showed that the extent of incivility varied based on the topic and news site, not on whether the comment was posted anonymously or with a full name.",Incivility in Audience Comments,Mass Communication

Gatekeeping and news values literature suggests that journalists may tolerate some forms of incivility in comments. Drawing on research into cognitive biases toward negative information, we propose that news users may actively promote incivility. Using nine million comments from The New York Times, we analyze how journalists and news users engage with news comments. We examine whether the presence of uncivil terms affects whether users recommend comments or flag them for abuse. Results show that journalists are more likely to reject and news users are more likely to flag comments containing swear words. Comments containing uncivil terms other than swear words receive more recommendations from users than comments without these words. The patterns are heightened when comments contain both uncivil and partisan terms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Incivility in Audience Comments,Mass Communication

News sites therefore encourage user engagement (replying, evaluating, flagging) as supplement to professional moderation. This paper argues that incivility and impoliteness are differently evaluated by users and followed by different means of user engagement. To investigate influences of incivility and impoliteness on replying, evaluating, and flagging a 2 (civil versus uncivil user comment) x 2 (polite versus impolite user comment) online experiment was conducted. Results show that flagging is more likely for impolite than polite comments. Civil comments are flagged more often, when combined with impolite than polite language. No group differences are visible for the other means of user engagement.",Incivility in Audience Comments,Mass Communication
2017-1362,2017,Paper Session,Towards Politicized Tabloid News Online? A Methodological Assessment of the Spreading of Online News,3,Sharing has emerged as a keyword in the contemporary media landscape in the last decade. For journalism and the news industry sharing is viewed as both a threat and possibility as it enables greater reach but also less control. So far research has not to a great extent been able to show what kind of news stories that goes viral and there is also a lack of methodological discussions about how to measure shared news and what results different approaches provide. Results from this study show that politics is the most commonly spread news topic and that news sites with a tabloid background are the most successful media forms in encouraging spreading and interaction of news stories. The study also shows that different methodological starting points – starting at the news sites themselves or an aggregator – provides results that both overlap and differentiate.,Studying Online News Flows: The Role of Audiences,Journalism Studies

A negative relationship existed between the use in tweets of hyperlinks to news organizations’ websites and user retweets. A negative relationship also existed between the use of such tweets and user likes/favorites. Positive relationships existed between the use of socially and technically interactive functions of Twitter (e.g., hashtags, still images, moving images) and user retweets. Positive relationships also existed between such functions (e.g., @mentions, hashtags, still images, moving images) and user likes/favorites.

Simultaneously, emerging news media such as NGO journalists are also contributing to specific news beats like human rights. This study looks at the social institutional level of gatekeeping, namely the audience and sources, in traditional and emerging news coverage. A content analysis of online coverage (N = 540) and ten in-depth interviews of emerging news media professionals were analyzed. Results show a positive correlation between retweets/likes and LGBT rights and refugee related coverage. There was also a negative correlation between retweets/likes and government corruption and physical cruelty related coverage, even though it was commonly reported on. Overall, human rights are reported within the existing context of news cycles rather than on it’s own. Furthermore, while viral stories do influence news cycles, journalistic norms continue to guide the gatekeeping process regardless of audience reaction.",Studying Online News Flows: The Role of Audiences,Journalism Studies

Although the public’s interest in serious news has declined in recent years, satirical news has remained popular. Through a 2-by-2 between-subjects survey experiment, this study tested the effects of a satirical news story about mass shootings — displayed as either a traditional news article or on the photo sharing site Instagram — on readers’ affect, perceptions of story credibility, optimism, and story sharing behaviors. Results indicated that satirical news and serious Instagram posts increased positive affect. Further, results revealed that perceived credibility and sharing behavior increased due to affective activation regardless of whether participants experienced positive or negative affect, suggesting higher emotional cues might dictate the way individuals interact with news coverage.

2017-1366,2017,Paper Session,Testing the Model of Intuitive Morality and Exemplars in Children,6,"The MIME (Tamborini, 2013) argues that narrative media content highlighting altruistic intuitions can impact an intuition’s accessibility. Support for this is limited to adults. This study tested MIME predictions in two experiments using children between the ages of 10 to 13 years. Each study manipulated the salience of four altruistic intuitions identified in the MIME. Study 1 (a pilot) manipulated intuition salience with verbal primes provided in anecdotes during instructions. Study 2 (the main experiment) primed different intuitions in four versions of a comic book. In both studies, intuition salience was measured after the induction. Pilot study results suggest that priming care, fairness, and loyalty (but not authority) increased the salience of their respective intuitions. The main study showed that the comic book primes increased the salience for all four intuitions. The relevance for these results for the MIME and for understanding media’s influence on children’s moral judgments are discussed.

2017-1367,2017,Paper Session,The Role of Social Context During Television Viewing on Children’s Moral Judgements About the Social Inclusion and Stigmatization of Like- and Unlike-Others,2,"Research has considered how child exposure to prosocial television narratives about inclusion influence children’s social inclusion behaviors (e.g., Mares & Acosta, 2010). In these laboratory experiments, children typically view the stimulus episode alone; however, we know that children often watch with others at home (Chandler, 1997). Thus, in the present study we examined how children’s proximal social context during viewing influenced effects. Using data collected from a 3-condition experiment (control, child-alone, co-view with close friend) with children ages 5 and 6 (N = 80), we found that exposure largely did not influence children’s inclusion judgements or stigmatization beliefs. There was, however, an age by condition interaction, such that 6-year-old children in the co-view condition demonstrated greater stigmatization beliefs toward other children, compared to 5-year-olds in the same condition, or all children in the view-alone condition. We discuss the implications of these findings while considering moral socialization during childhood.",Learning From Media (Part 2): How & When Media Influence Children & Teens' Social Behaviors,Children Adolescents and the Media

In this study, 113 children (M = 9.03; SD = .738) and their friends participated. Children in the experimental condition were exposed to a Disney fragment in which the main character helped a friend high of cost, while children in the control condition were exposed to a neutral fragment from the same movie. Afterwards, children’s helping behavior towards their friends was assessed during a puzzle assignment. Regression analysis demonstrated that, while controlling for children’s sex and initial levels of prosocial behavior, children exposed to a prosocial Disney fragment were found to help more often and were found to spend more time on helping compared to children who did not watch a prosocial Disney fragment. Although replication is needed, findings indicate that watching Disney can encourage children to help each other.",Learning From Media (Part 2): How & When Media Influence Children & Teens' Social Behaviors,Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1369,2017,Paper Session,Immersive Virtual Reality Influences Children's Inhibitory Control and Social Behavior,4,"Currently, little is known about the effects of immersive virtual reality (IVR) on young children’s cognitive functioning and social behaviors. In this study, we compared the effects of IVR and non-immersive virtual reality (NVR) on four- to six-year olds’ inhibitory control (IC) skills, compliance, and sharing behavior with a familiar children’s character (Grover from Sesame Street©). Inhibitory control skills were assessed using a game of Simon says, and children’s compliance was indexed by their approach towards Grover after he requests that they come closer. Children in the IVR condition had more difficulty using their IC during Simon says (i.e., not imitating Grover’s actions at the appropriate time) compared to children in the NVR condition. More children in the IVR condition approached Grover, and they shared more with him than children in the NVR condition. These results suggest that IVR elicits differential inhibitory and social responses compared to less immersive technology.",Learning From Media (Part 2): How & When Media Influence Children & Teens' Social Behaviors,Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1370,2017,Paper Session,The Mediating Role of Sympathy in the Relationship Between Media Violence and Adolescents’ Social Behaviors,2,"Previous research has suggested that empathy could serve as a mediator in the relation between media violence exposure and social behavior. However, empirical findings are mixed and conceptualizations of empathy in these studies are diverse. Instead of formally differentiating between cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and sympathy, some studies measure empathy as a unidimensional construct, while others equate empathy with sympathy. Yet, theory as well as some previous research suggests that sympathy, more than cognitive or affective empathy, may explain how media violence can affect youths’ aggressive or prosocial behavior. The aim of the present study was to formally test this assumption. We employed a three-wave longitudinal design with a sample of 878 early adolescents (aged 10-14 years old at T1). Although neither sympathy nor cognitive and affective empathy provided a significant indirect pathway between media violence and aggression or prosocial behavior, the findings of this study show that sympathy is more strongly related to both media violence and social behavior than empathy. This study provides more clarity about the role of emotional responsiveness in the relation between media violence and social behavior.",Learning From Media (Part 2): How & When Media Influence Children & Teens' Social Behaviors,Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1371,2017,Paper Session,Signs of HIV Risk,6,"Field studies indicate that people may have intuitive impressions about potential partners’ HIV-risk, but lack insight into the communicative cues that trigger these impressions. Here we used a large set of photographs depicting individuals in daily life scenes and collected cue-judgments for 60 facial, bodily, and setting cues. Independent raters evaluated the perceived HIV-risk for all depicted persons. The correlations between each cue and perceived HIV-risk provide insight into which cues may serve as ‘lenses’ for inferences about HIV-risk. Next, a cross-validated regression model that predicts HIV-risk from cues reveals a correlation of r = 0.7 between cue-based predictions and actual HIV-risk ratings. These results point to a HIV-risk stereotype that is rooted in associative person knowledge and activated during first sight - despite its unknown validity.

The current study evaluated an innovative initiative that combined free condoms provided via condom dispensers with evidence-based, point-of-access messaging on the dispensers at an all-women’s Historically Black College in the southeastern U.S. Young Black women ages 18-24 (N=195), recruited from a central campus location, completed surveys before and three months after the intervention. The initiative produced a range of effects, including generating interpersonal and online conversations, and improved condom acquisition and carrying. Exposure to the dispensers and messages was associated with condom use. The findings indicate health communication strategies combined with condom distribution have the potential to reach those at risk of HIV/STIs, address psychosocial barriers to condom use (e.g., embarrassment and stigma), and engender important changes in condom acquisition, carrying, and use.",Health Communication and HIV Prevention,Health Communication

2017-1376,2017,Paper Session,Information Deficit or Information Overload? Reconceptualizing Uncertainty in Illness,1,"Communication scholars have been long interested in uncertainty and its connection to communicative actions. In recent years, there is growing literature, including both theoretical advancements and empirical investigations, on communication and uncertainty, especially in health communication contexts. For patients and caregivers who experience long-term chronic conditions or life-threatening illnesses such as cancer, “living under conditions of sustained uncertainty became part of the fabric of the everyday life of families and transformed their taken-for-granted world” (Cohen, 1993, p. 77). Individuals’ perceptions of their inability to structure, explain, predict, and make sense of an illness-related event with an unknown probability influences interaction and communicative behavior in crucial yet complex ways. However, substantial variation exists in how uncertainty is conceptualized and operationalized across different research traditions, with a heavy yet narrow emphasis on information deficit perspective. In this paper, conceptualizations of illness uncertainty across three literatures – uncertainty in illness, uncertainty in communication, and stress and coping literature – are reviewed and synthesized. Theoretical implications on conceptualizing illness uncertainty and practical implications for understanding illness uncertainty are discussed.","Stress, Coping, and Social Support",Health Communication
2017-1377,2017,Paper Session,Communicating Hope at a Community-Based Support Program: A Narrative Synergism Model,1,"Hope is critical to life and wellness, but when faced with addiction and other life traumas, hope can slip away. Using the appreciative approach including 24 interviews and 13 in-situ group recordings, this study explores the communication processes that facilitate the emergence of hope at a community based support program (CBSP). The findings of this study refine the construct of hope within a duality of narrative, as reclaiming narrative agency. This study proposes a narrative synergism model to explicate the interplay among the communication processes that facilitate hope at the CBSP. The three communication processes at the CBSP, story space, murmurations, and transitional messages, work in a reciprocal interplay. The narrative synergism created in this dynamic interplay facilitates reflexive moments which in turn facilitates the reclaiming of narrative agency and the resultant emergence of hope. This dynamic synergism creates something greater than the sum of the parts – that is, hope.","Stress, Coping, and Social Support",Health Communication

This exploratory study examined optimal matching for social support among postpartum mothers on Facebook. A content analysis of 654 postings and comments from the two most popular Facebook pages for postpartum depression revealed that the overall amount of support offered exceeded the amount of support sought, although the types of content shared (i.e., seeking support, providing support, and personal coping) and the types of social support exchanged (i.e., informational and emotional) differed across the two pages, each of which had a distinct purpose. In addition, the members of each Facebook page participated in the community by showcasing their coping strategies, simultaneously enriching community resources for other users.","Stress, Coping, and Social Support",Health Communication

Stressful life events are viewed as the leading cause of psychological distress. Self-disclosure, however, has been found to buffer the deleterious impact of stress on mental health. Recent studies show that college students are likely to talk about their problems on social network sites (SNSs), but it is unclear to what extent they benefit from doing that. This study examined the effect of self- disclosure on SNSs on young adults’ mental health. Survey data were collected from a probability sample of 560 university students. The results show that self-disclosure on Facebook moderates the relationship between stressful life events and mental health. Facebook disclosure was also positively associated with enacted social support on Facebook, which led to increased perceived social support, enhanced life satisfaction, and reduced depression. SNSs, therefore, serve as a promising avenue for delivering health care and intervention.","Stress, Coping, and Social Support",Health Communication
2017-1380,2017,Paper Session,Measuring Attitudes and Intentions Regarding Breathing Exercises as a Means of Stress Management,2,"Stress is a major health concern in the world today. Stigma surrounding stress and stress management continues to limit people’s willingness to seek help for stress or employ stress management techniques. While there are various stress management techniques available, many of them are costly in both time and money. Breathing techniques offer a viable intervention option that can reach most people. This study employed an online survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior in order to gauge people’s attitudes and intentions regarding breathing exercises, and to assess any stigma that might be associated with stress management techniques. Results indicate people have positive attitudes towards breathing exercises, but perceive a social stigma surrounding their use. This study also offers support for the Theory of Planned Behavior in the context of stress research, although a key construct, Perceived Behavioral Control, did not predict.

2017-1385,2017,Paper Session,When Images Meet Codes: Applying Computer Vision Methods in Communication Research,1,"Communication research has benefited substantially from the advances in computational content analysis—yet, it has mostly been used for linguistic data. To advance our analysis of visual materials, this paper reviews the current updates in a relatively new computational method, computer vision, and summarizes features that can be extracted by computer vision methods. This paper also links these features back to visual communication research and examines how computer vision features may be associated with concepts that are meaningful to the field of communication research, in addition to computer science. Next, this paper uses two research examples to illustrate the advantages of applying computer vision methods in communication research.",Computational methods for Analyzing Visual and Online Communication,Computational Methods
2017-1386,2017,Paper Session,Cultural Divides and Digital Inequalities: Attitudes Shaping Internet and Social Media Divides,2,"The attitudes and values of Internet (non)users have been studied over the years, but rarely used to identify broader ‘cultures of the Internet’ and their role in shaping digital divides. This paper builds on research in Britain, which focused on attitudes underpinning Internet cultures, to explore the degree that similar or distinctive cultures have developed in the USA, and whether and how they are useful in explaining digital divides. This study utilizes original data drawn from a 2016 telephone survey of residents across the State of Michigan that adapts survey items and methods from the Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS) of Britain. Based on these survey responses, the paper identifies and describes the cultures of the Internet among Michigan residents, as an exploratory case of the US as a whole, and shows how these cultures shape digital divides in Internet and social media use across this one American state.",Digital Divides,Communication and Technology
2017-1387,2017,Paper Session,In Pursuit of Digital Inclusion Interventions: Exploring the Utility of Mapping Intra- and Intercity Digital Divides,1,"This paper examines the utility of a novel triangulation of theoretical and methodological approaches, in an effort to further the theorization of digital inclusion – and inform digital inclusion interventions and policies globally. More specifically, similar to the process undertaken by researchers in London, it introduces a framework whereby the digital disparities within the city of Los Angeles, CA, were illustrated through various data visualization and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques. These maps and illustrations of public open-access data were then utilized to investigate community-level factors to Internet access and benefits of Internet usage. While previous academic literature has centered on individual-, city-, and country-level differences in examining first-level digital divides, the proposed framework opens up the potential for more nuanced and disaggregated understandings of the ways in which digital inequalities manifest within a city, and are influenced by neighborhood-level variables. Furthermore, the introduction of a replicable and cost-efficient methodological and analytical procedure will bolster and advance comparative inter-city research of digital inequalities, generating a more thorough (local and global) understanding of these issues. With such knowledge, this framework and procedure will lead to invaluable insights for future digital inclusion policymaking and intervention design, especially at the local level.",Digital Divides,Communication and Technology
2017-1388,2017,Paper Session,"Not There Yet! Access, Skill, and Expectation Digital Divides in American Public Housing Communities",3,"This study examines multidimensional and multilayered digital divides in extremely low-income American public housing communities. It drew on a census survey of this hard-to-access public housing population to examine how digital divides, including access, skill, and expectation divides, vary by markers of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, and how these three layers of digital divides are sequentially related. This study focuses on a nuanced view of access divide and identifies a new layer of digital divides—expectation divide—regarding how people anticipate positive changes that digital inclusion efforts would bring. The results show that even within this already disadvantaged population, some are more disadvantaged than others in terms of access, skills and expectations. The access divide remains the most important concern in disadvantaged communities as it contributes to the skill divide. The skill divide further contributes to the expectation divide.",Digital Divides,Communication and Technology
2017-1389,2017,Paper Session,Who Contributes to Wikipedia? The Role of Internet Skills in Online Participation Inequalities,2,"Digital inequality and participation gaps pose a challenge to the democratizing potential of the Internet. Given its broad reach, Wikipedia has received particular attention concerning its contributors with findings suggesting persistent gender and skills gaps. Our paper extends prior work by investigating the role of Internet skills in Wikipedia editing on a national sample. We use a unique survey dataset collected representing a diverse sample of 1,512 U.S. adults to assess how demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as Internet experience and skills explain who edits Wikipedia. Confirming prior work, we find participation gaps in Wikipedia editing by gender and Internet skills. In contrast to prior work, we also find evidence that lower age, higher education, and more frequent Internet use help explain contribution to Wikipedia. We conclude that these findings underscore the multidimensionality of digital inequalities and encourage future research to build on these observations.",Digital Divides,Communication and Technology
2017-1390,2017,Paper Session,Pathways to Political (Dis-)Engagement: User Motivations and the Role of Incidental and Intentional Exposure Modes in Adolescents’ Political Engagement,2,"Social network sites (SNS) have become primary sources for adolescents’ political information. Adolescents, however, may differ in terms of their user motivations and therefore in the intensity of exposure to political information on SNS. Based on data collected in a paper-pencil survey with 15-20 years old pupils (N=294), this study investigates the relationship between four key motivations of SNS use and political engagement via two modes of exposure to politics on SNS. The intentional mode, which is related to active information seeking, and the incidental mode, in which adolescents run into politics only by accident. We found that political information and self-expression motivations were positively related to political engagement via the intentional mode. In contrast, we found that entertainment motivations were negatively related to offline, but not to online engagement via the incidental mode. These findings indicate a vicious circle effect for some, suggesting that those who are motivated to use social media for political purposes benefit, while entertainment oriented adolescents are distracted.","Impact of Social Attention, Virality, and Engagement",Mass Communication
2017-1391,2017,Paper Session,Selective Attention in the Newsfeed,3,"Facebook is becoming increasingly important as a source for news. However, only few studies have investigated what drives the attention to news within the newsfeed and what influences the selection of news posts. We conducted a laboratory experiment with eyetracking measurement (N = 103) to investigate the influence of attitude consistency, source credibility and comments for the attention distribution on the newsfeed and the selection of news posts. Our results reveal that attitude consistency does not influence the time participants spend looking at posts, but users prefer the selection of like-minded content. Further, participants spend more time with news posts from sources with high credibility and prefer to select posts from credible sources. The comment is not relevant for the selection. However, if the newspost and the comment do not share the same opinion, the participants read it longer. We discuss the results and consequences for society and journalism.","Impact of Social Attention, Virality, and Engagement",Mass Communication

Effects of Hateful User Comments on Recipients’ Prosocial Behavior,3,"Many online discussions among users of news media platforms are characterized by a high degree of incivility and sometimes even hate speech. Existing research has investigated effects of uncivil and hateful user comments on recipients’ opinions and attitudes. Yet, it has been largely unexplored whether the repeated exposure to these comments has detrimental behavioral consequences. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, we investigated the effects of hateful comments on recipients’ prosocial behavior. Using an online experiment with a demographically heterogeneous sample, we tested whether reading hateful user comments against refugees reduces participants’ donation behavior in favor of a refugee aid organization. The results reveal a direct effect of reading hate comments on participants’ attitudes towards donating in favor of refugees as well as indirect effects on their intention to donate and on the amount of donated money. These results raise questions regarding the limits of free opinion expression online.","Impact of Social Attention, Virality, and Engagement",Mass Communication
2017-1393,2017,Paper Session,Source Effects and Personal Cause Involvement in Online Charitable Crowdfunding,2,"Individual motivations to contribute to online charitable crowdfunding campaigns from the donation model and collective action perspectives are investigated in this study. A between-groups with control experiment manipulating online sources of charitable crowdfunding mobilizing messages of different levels of personalness (personal: close friends, family vs. impersonal: organizational sources) and accounting for individual predispositions (i.e. cause involvement, altruism, attitude toward crowdfunding for charity, prior experiences with online donations and crowdfunding) was carried out. Findings affirm the influence of perceived source personalness on the relationship between cause involvement and willingness to donate, while highlighting that individuals can perceive a range of personalness of message source on social media. Discussion raised the possibility that the influence from a community as compared to a specific message source can be a stronger determinant of charitable crowdfunding campaigns and suggestions proffered for crowdfunders and future research on online crowdfunding.

The Influence of Linguistic Agency and Causality Attribution On Stigma About Depression,3,"In this study two language features-linguistic agency and causality- were manipulated to see their effect on stigma reduction against people suffering from depression, in an online support forum. 241 undergraduate students participated in the online experiment. Controlling for age, sex and education, preliminary results showed a reduction in avoidance and control related stigma, when viewers saw messages ascribing agency to depression and simultaneously depicting depression as biological in origin.

Given the negative consequences of stigma for people dealing with depressive symptoms, a deeper understanding of how to reduce stigma through the ways in which we discuss depression is warranted. In a multi-national study of five nations (United States, Spain, India, Korea, and China), the current study examines how culture moderates the influence of language used by support seekers with depression on reducing stigma.

2017-1396,2017,Paper Session,Impacts of Relational Closeness on Health-Related Stigma Dispositions,1,"Health-related stigma is a complex issue of social construction. As it is socially constructed through human interaction our orientation to health-related stigma may be culturally or contextually bound. Further this study posits that stigma is a concept of communication, meaning it is both created and managed through interpersonal communicative acts. Human (inter)action is impacted by a number of variables that shape our perspectives and relationships. The purpose of this study is to examine the role that relational closeness plays in assigning characteristics of stigmatization. In order to study this problem a large-scale survey of approximately 1000 is underway. The survey presents participants with a scenario to which they are asked to assess their attitudes and behaviors after it is revealed the person they are sharing space with over the weekend was recently diagnosed with a stigmatized health condition.

The purpose of this study is to explore research problem, “What are the characteristics of news reports on new diseases?”Especially, assuming that news media play a central role in the spread of fear for and stigma against new diseases, this study discussed what the characteristics reporting on new diseases really have and what results they can cause. Analysis frame was developed based on Extended Parallel Process Model which explains emotional and cognitive responses to risks and Attribution Theory which explains formation of stigma. Media disseminated the susceptibility component quite frequently, which raised fear levels. However, the efficacy component necessary for helping individuals coping with the risk occurred less frequently. High levels of onset controllability along with offset controllability are expected to increase stigma toward those infected. Taken together, preliminary results indicate the role of media on social unrest and discrimination against MERS patients",Communication and Health-Related Stigma (High-Density),Health Communication

This study examined the mechanism by which social media affects individuals’ belief for TB misinformation and their stigma against TB. Particularly, the role of community engagement in dispelling TB misinformation and stigma is studied. Survey was conducted in Singapore, using a large national sample (N = 794). Path analysis was executed. Results revealed indirect and direct effects of social media usage on TB-related misinformation and stigma. There is a positive direct effect of social media use on TB stigma (p < .001). For the indirect effect, an increase in social media use leads to an increase in individuals’ engagement in interpersonal communication within their online and offline social networks (p < .001 and p = .062, respectively), which reduces TB misinformation and stigma (p < .001 and p < .001 for misinformation, and p < .001 and p = .095 for stigma). The findings confirmed the effects of social media in reducing TB-related misinformation and stigma via the mediation of community engagement, and thus can contribute to our understanding about the role played by social media in dispelling health-related stigma.",Communication and Health-Related Stigma (High-Density),Health Communication
2017-1400,2017,Paper Session,Familiarity Breeds Less Contempt: The Effects of Familiarity in Reducing Stigma Attributed to News Stories,2,"National estimates suggest less than five percent of violent acts can be attributed to mental illness, yet stereotypes about criminality, dangerousness and personal responsibility for an individual’s mental health have persisted in news media content. Scholars suggest that stigmatizing messages are responsible for stigmatization, prejudice and discrimination towards individuals with mental illness, yet little research has been conducted to determine if reframing news media content concerning mental illness to include accurate and affirming messages reduce stigmatization, prejudice and discrimination. Using attribution theory and a nested factorial experimental design (N = 351) this study tested if affirming messages in news content reduces stigmatization, prejudice and discrimination. While affirming messages did reduce levels of stigmatization, prejudice and discrimination, attribution of responsibility and control was not significant, but higher levels of familiarity with mental illness—which are predictive of lower levels of stigmatization, prejudice and discrimination—were associated with affirming content.",Communication and Health-Related Stigma (High-Density),Health Communication

We seek to fill this gap, by modelling app decsion making within a dual-process model of the attitude-behavior relation and the role of privacy attitudes in two kinds of information processing: spontaneous, heuristic processes which rely on automated attitude activation and more elaborate, cognitive processes that rely on behavioral intentions to guide behavior. We use a quasi-experimental design to investigate app decision making processes in n = 254 cases. Participants were asked to provide information on their actions after downloading three apps on their smartphones over a 2 week period. We were able to identify two distinct types of information processing and found support for attitude activation and to a lesser degree intentions as requirements for privacy attitudes’ influence on app decsion making.",The Use and Effects of New Media,Information Systems

This not only regards industrial robots but more and more also service robots that are designed to help people in their daily lives. At the same time many people are still skeptical about the idea of being assisted by a robot.
An experimental study was conducted that compared participants’ evaluations of a humanoid service robot when either observed on a 2D video, or a 3D video, in virtual reality (VR), or in real life. Observing a live interaction or alternatively encountering the robot in a VR lead to more perceived realness. Furthermore, the kind of presentation influenced perceived human-likeness. Participants who observed a real HRI reported the highest perceived human-likeness.

However, habitually checking one’s mobile messages may often conflict with more important tasks, resulting in procrastination. Based on data from a daily diary study (N = 532), the present study investigates how smartphone uses contribute to the prevalence of procrastination in daily life. Moreover, the study extends prior research on connectedness and well-being by investigating the consequences of media-driven procrastination for the two central dimensions of well-being: hedonia and eudaimonia. Results from multilevel analyses indicate that both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ forms of smartphone checking mediate the effects of smartphone habits on procrastinatory behavior. Procrastination, in turn, negatively affects both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being by reducing daily experiences of accomplishment. This study is the first to link smartphone habits and messenger usage behavior to procrastination and uncovers the challenges for smartphone users to pursue both pleasure and virtue in everyday life.",The Use and Effects of New Media,Information Systems

However, it remains unclear if, and how, the interactive characteristics of the medium actually serve to reduce these geographical gaps between audiences. To investigate this possibility, we report preliminary results from a 2 (psychological distance: distant vs. proximal frame) x 2 (interactivity: 360 vs. non-360) between-subjects experiment that is currently underway to investigate the relationship between interactivity and psychological distance (spatial) in the context of environmental threats. Preliminary findings reveal 360-degree video to be significantly more interactive than traditional video, while also eliciting greater levels of cognitive absorption and behavioral intentions across both spatial conditions. Furthermore, 360-degree video appears to generate favorable attitudes and increased threat perceptions, when a threat is spatially distant versus proximal.",The Use and Effects of New Media,Information Systems

Considering that children can learn science and math from educational television (Fisch, 2014), it is important to understand what science and math topics are present in television shows for young children. We analyzed 20 U.S. children’s programs that were described as STEM programs and assessed their depictions of STEM content based on math and science learning standards.

Using this scholarship as a point of departure, I advance a postcolonial rereading of the Curious George series as a whole and argue that the entire series continues to position George as a diasporic figure who dreams of returning to the jungle of his capture while The Man in the Yellow Hat plays either the role of benign colonialist or pathetic father figure. Drawing on the emerging field of postcolonial children’s literary criticism, this essay contributes to understanding canonical children’s criticism as an important educational mechanism that, in this instance, teaches a benevolent narrative of both U.S. slavery and current diasporic citizens.",Under the Hood: Content Analytic Insight Into the Media Landscape of Children & Teens (HHD Session),Children Adolescents and the Media

From a general sample of television programs representing broadcast, cable (basic and premium), and popular streaming services, the results revealed that there were no gender differences in the portrayal of negative or positive consequences. However, within shows that primarily feature teen characters, negative consequences were significantly more experienced by female characters than male characters. And within shows that primarily feature young-adult characters (defined as characters in their 20s), male characters were shown receiving significantly more positive consequences than female characters.

Specifically, depicted sexuality and sexual objectification were investigated. Furthermore, we included the genre of the music video as well as the race of the artists. Our findings indicate that depictions of insinuated rather than explicit sexuality have increased over time. Furthermore, depictions of sexual objectification have increased in the investigated time period. This is specifically true for female artists, which are more likely to be portrayed as sexual and are more likely sexually objectified over time compared to male artists.

Study 1 offers a quantitative, systematic analysis of gender themes in 25 years of popular music. Here we found that women and femininity are often portrayed in limited ways that emphasize women’s appearance and sexual appeal, and frequently portray them as passive, relationship-focused, emotional, and manipulative. Study 2 surveyed 1,611 emerging adult women and demonstrated that regular exposure to specific music genres, especially pop, R&B, and rap music, is associated with stronger acceptance of stereotypical gender roles. Study 3 offered some causal support of this link, finding that women who were exposed to themes of docile femininity in three songs expressed less confidence in the competencies of other women and themselves.

We analyzed the integration of brands in 250 movies from 1991 to 2015. We found that 64.4% of all movies contained at least one placement of a real brand. Comedies and movies produced in the U.S. contained a higher number of brand placements compared to other genres and non-U.S. movies. Animated movies and movies presenting a nature-, or fantasy-scenery contained a comparatively low number of placements. Brands were inserted mostly visually, and placed in the center of the screen without explicit evaluation. Placements frequently presented a physical or verbal interaction with a main character. This practice was found to increase over time even though the sole number of brand placements remained stable over the past 25 years.

Social TV redefines the role of viewers by affording them richer control over program content, exposure to and dissemination of program feedback, and opportunities for program discussions with others − an experience suggested to heighten sense of community. Findings from this research indicate that during-viewing and post-viewing online participatory behaviors associated with a favorite TV program, also known as social TV behaviors, mediate relationships between hedonic and eudaimonic gratifications attained from the program (i.e., enjoyment and appreciation) and perceived membership in, contribution to, and meaningfulness of the fan community.

2017-1420,2017,Paper Session,The Moderating Effect of Immediate Gratification and Need for Cognition on Binge-Watching Attitude-Behavior Relation,3,"Binge-watching is becoming a new “norm” for viewers in the way they consume their favorite TV shows and movies; nevertheless, most scholarly research on binge-watching remains exploratory. This study explicated 1) the relationship between the attitudes toward binge-watching and the extent of binge-watching and 2) the role of viewers’ personality traits (i.e., immediate gratification [IG]) and needs for cognition[NFC]) on the association. The results from the analysis on survey data (N= 714) illustrated that there was a positive association between viewers’ negative attitudes and the extent of their binge-watching, showing a signature indicator of attitude-discrepant behaviors. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect of negative attitude toward binge-watching and IG on binge-watching behavior was found. High-IG respondents with negative attitude toward binge-watching were more likely to binge-watch than their low-IG counterparts, marked by greater negative attitude toward binge-watching as guilty pleasure.",Viewing Television and Second Screens,Communication and Technology
2017-1421,2017,Paper Session,"Paying Close Attention to News, a Bridge to Second Screening",1,"Second screening is part of a complex, hybrid dynamic of the media system that combines traditional TV media and social media across different devices, creating new forms of watching. In that intertwined media environment, attention to content has become the new currency. Relying on nationally representative panel data, this study explores attention to news as a positive predictor of second screening behavior. It also analyzes the differences between multi-platform consumption during live TV events and non-live events. In addition, the study tests second screening for news as a predictor for political discussion. Findings suggest that attention to news leads to second screening activities. However, attention to news, and TV use for news lose their effect on second screening when viewers consume video on demand and other forms of non-live events. Similarly, second screening for news and its motivations result positive antecedents of political expression.",Viewing Television and Second Screens,Communication and Technology
2017-1422,2017,Paper Session,Emotions “Based on a True Story”: A Mixed-Method Study of the Political Influence of Docudramas,1,"In this paper, I investigate the role of emotions in the political influence of docudramas. Specifically, based on affective intelligence theory (AIT, Marcus et al., 2000), I examine the link between the emotions these programs induced on their audiences and their potential influence on audiences’ political behavior.
Results show that emotional arousal caused by viewing the docudramas was positively correlated to audience members’ political participation and information seeking. This influence was explained mostly by negative feelings, once positive emotions were not significantly associated with the tested depended variables. In addition, the results showed important differences between the possible effects of anger and anxiety: while anger served as a strong predictor of political participation, it had no discernible connection with information seeking. Anxiety, on the other hand, was clearly related to a boost in a search for information, but not in political participation.","Emotion, News, and Politics",Mass Communication
2017-1423,2017,Paper Session,From Nightmares to Nightly News: Enduring Media Fright Reactions in the 21st Century,4,"Building on foundational work from Harrison and Cantor (1999), this study examines retrospective reports of media fright reactions across the lifespan, moving beyond the original study by taking into account participant maturation, the changing media environment, and continuity and change in the stimuli people found most threatening over the past four decades. Participants described two media fright experiences, one from their childhood and one from their adolescence or adulthood. Results demonstrate that abstract fears, like supernatural monsters, in childhood are replaced by more concrete fears, like human evil, in adulthood. Generational trends also provide evidence for increased fear of human evil and non-fictional media depictions across the last half-century. In the era of twenty-four hour news networks, global terror, mass shootings, and unfiltered Internet content, adult media fright reactions seem to stem more from non-fictional media and focus more on human evil than in the past.","Emotion, News, and Politics",Mass Communication
2017-1424,2017,Paper Session,News Consumption and its Unpleasant Side Effect: Studying the Effect of Hard and Soft News Exposure on Mental Well-being Over Time,2,"Following the news is generally understood as crucial for democracy as it allows citizens to politically participate in an informed manner; yet, one may wonder about the unintended side effects it has for the mental well-being of citizens. With news focusing on the negative and worrisome events in the world, framing that evokes a sense of powerlessness, and lack of entertainment value, this study hypothesizes that news consumption decreases mental well-being via negative hedonic experiences; thereby, we differentiate between hard and soft news. Using a panel survey in combination with latent growth curve modeling (n = 2767), we demonstrate that the consumption of hard news television programs has a negative effect on the overtime development of mental well-being. Soft news consumption, by contrast, has a marginally positive impact on the trend in well-being. This can be explained by the differential topic focus, framing and style of soft news vis-a-vis hard news. Investigating the effects of news consumption on mental well-being provides insight into the impact news exposure has on variables other than the political ones, which definitively are not less societally relevant.","Emotion, News, and Politics",Mass Communication

We know little about how conflict in talk shows emerges and evolves. Two studies investigated how substantial conflict—attacks and defenses—and stylistic conflict—interruptions of speakers—in political talk shows evolved within episodes and what interaction situations preceded them. In line with interpersonal adaptation theory, substantial and stylistic conflict reproduced (e.g. attacks are followed by attacks). Stylistic conflict spilt over to substantial conflict, but not vice-versa. Intensity of stylistic conflict escalated over the course of talk show episodes. Substantial (but not stylistic) conflict intensified when speakers held antagonistic issue positions. Situational influences were more important than between-person differences. Viewers tended to attribute substantial and stylistic conflict to the personality of the speaker, discounting the context in which conflict emerged. We discuss implications for audiences, politicians, and talk show producers.","Emotion, News, and Politics",Mass Communication
2017-1426,2017,Paper Session,Climate of Opinion as a Driver of Collective Action: Evidence From the 2011 Israeli Social Protest Movement,1,"In September of 2011, the largest social protests in Israel history occurred. Scarcely a few months before, nobody had predicted these events. How and why did the protests reach such magnitude so rapidly and what are the roles of media and framing in driving the expansion of this social protest? Social movement theory has advanced various explanations for mass mobilization pointing to factors such as grievances, elite support and resources, social network structures, and cultural frames. While acknowledging the role of these factors, we instead emphasize the role of information and information flow. Specifically, we argue that a key driver in the development of the Israeli social protests was the existence and the rapid erosion of climate of opinion concerning socio-economic grievances. Climate of opinion refers to the aggregative perception of the dominant opinion in society. The grievances in question can be loosely described as the increasing economic burden on the middle class coupled with a sense of distributive injustice. During 2011, climate of opinion regarding these grievances rapidly changed. Data were collected via seven public opinion polls, including a survey experiment among Israeli-Jewish adults. These surveys were conducted during the protest period among three populations, protesters, activists, and a representative sample at three points in time. Our study shows that climate of opinion regarding the protest movement is associated with involvement in the protest and led to readiness to be involved in the protest.",Protest Communication and Communication of Protest,Political Communication
2017-1427,2017,Paper Session,Protest Communication Ecology and Community Racial Crisis: The Case of the Michael Brown Shooting Death,5,"On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old African American, was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a Caucasian police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri. The shooting was followed by a vigil and peaceful protests in Ferguson that at times gave way to rioting and destruction of property. Overall these events represent a community racial crisis. Using a survey of 1,014 St. Louis residents, this study examines communication resource use related to this community crisis among community members who did and did not choose to participate in protest, and explores the influence of this communication resource use on attitudes about Ferguson people and events and overall Ferguson attitude polarization. Our results indicate a robust protest communication ecology that includes local mediated communication sources, opinion expression via social media, and in-person conversations with discordant others. A smaller non-protest communication ecology is also identified.",Protest Communication and Communication of Protest,Political Communication

This essay engages Deleuze and Guattari’s posthumanist approach in examining public performances as assemblages to fight within the martial law—the lines of flight. When public protests were prohibited after the 2010 violent crackdown in Thailand, public performances were staged on the streets to connect people at nodal points. These street performances were actants, forging new ways to resist within the existing limitations. The multiplicities of public performances that include practice of everyday life challenged the official narrative frames, memorialized the lives lost, and called for accountability and justice during the time of sheer suppression.",Protest Communication and Communication of Protest,Political Communication

The author worked closely with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Local 105 in Denver, Colorado for ten months producing documentary films and attending public demonstrations. Through an ethnographic study of the Justice 4 Janitors campaign, the communication strategies and networking efforts of the Local 105 are analyzed to understand its implications for social movements and democracy. Network theory is applied in order to understand how the distribution of activist media and organizing of subaltern counterpublics via social media complements local grassroots networks built on relationships. This study places ‘participation’ and ‘activist media’ in conversation with network and democratic theories to critically explore how social movements collaborate and pursue campaigns that encompass a broad-based, shared struggle for racial and economic justice.",Protest Communication and Communication of Protest,Political Communication

2017-1432,2017,Paper Session,Learning From the News? Examining Motivational Predictors of News Exposure and News Knowledge in Adolescence,2,"Today’s high-choice media environment renders individual motivations more important for becoming an informed citizen by following the news and learning about politics. At the same time, research reports rather low levels of news consumption and political knowledge for adolescents. Drawing on social cognitive theory and political communication research, the study investigates the role of self-efficacy, surveillance expectations, norm internalization, and need for cognition as motivational determinants of news exposure and knowledge in adolescence. A survey with N = 1,715 adolescents indicated that surveillance, self-efficacy, and norm internalization are positively related to news consumption. However, while some motivational predictors directly affected knowledge, the mere frequency of news exposure did not result in higher levels of knowledge. Instead, we observed a moderating effect of self-efficacy. Besides, while TV and newspapers contributed to knowledge, online and smartphone news did not. Further reasons for the missing link between news consumption and knowledge are discussed.",Influences on Learning and Knowledge,Political Communication

In this paper we explore relatively less well-studied questions concerning how social media use may be related to political knowledge. In particular, we examine the ways in which social media use may be associated with political learning among users with relatively lower levels of political interest, drawing on survey data from a sample of U.S. adults collected at the height of the 2012 U.S. presidential election cycle. Our findings suggest that such learning effects, similar to those that have been documented for exposure to political entertainment media, are observable in these data, contingent on a variable that we conceptualize as “feed diversity,” or the extent to which individuals’ social media feeds exhibit diversity in levels of political interest and political perspectives.",Influences on Learning and Knowledge,Political Communication

It specifically explores how ethnic identities and metaidentities interact and become salient as a result of participation in the Festival. The Festival did have a significant effect on the salience of both individual ethnic identities and larger group metaidentities of participants, and the region of origin was shown to have a moderating effect on identity salience for attendees. Standard paradigms regarding single identity salience are discussed as well as future avenues for intercultural work.",Contexts and Processes for Communicating Social Identity and Group Perceptions,Intergroup Communication

An online experiment was conducted with Asian (n = 93) and White (n = 85) adults living in the United States. Participants were randomly assigned to view a blood donation campaign message featuring an Asian-White biracial female model that either presented the donation solicitation message in English-only text or bilingual (English and Japanese) text. Results showed that White participants (but not Asian participants) perceived the model as more Asian when they were exposed to the bilingual text than to the English-only text. However, this perception did not influence willingness to donate blood for either White or Asian participants. The results suggest that language cues can influence how biracial or racially ambiguous models in health campaigns are perceived, particularly among the racially dominant group members.",Contexts and Processes for Communicating Social Identity and Group Perceptions,Intergroup Communication

Given this, the primary goal of this contribution is to highlight the importance of dress style within the field of intergroup communication. Dress style has received some attention in disciplines across the social sciences, but has received less attention among those studying intergroup communication. Applying prominent intergroup communication theories, we learn that clothing choices can reflect actual or desired group affiliations, demarcating group boundaries, shaping and reinforcing social identities, influencing our perceptions of others, and reducing identity uncertainty. Conceptualizing the role of intergroup dynamics in shaping dress style and body adornment practices, the second goal of this piece is to introduce a path model of dress style and intergroup communication to help guide future research in this area.",Contexts and Processes for Communicating Social Identity and Group Perceptions,Intergroup Communication

Appeals for movement support from dominant group members who stand in solidarity with the marginalized group may be more effective in building public support for the movement. We test the possible effects of such solidarity messages through an experiment using a newspaper article featuring either a White, Black or anonymous individual speaking in support of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Results show that the message featuring a White speaker (dominant group member) increases opinions of and support for the #BlackLivesMatter movement, particularly among participants likely to process the message heuristically. Solidarity messages, however, appear to do little to change participants’ underlying beliefs about who is responsible for racial injustice.",Contexts and Processes for Communicating Social Identity and Group Perceptions,Intergroup Communication
2017-1438,2017,Paper Session,Rethinking the Complexity of Virtual Work and Knowledge Sharing,2,"In virtual work arrangements, the lack of physical cues, common ground and face-to-face interaction has the potential to hinder communication and inhibit knowledge sharing. In turn, large multinational organizations often rely on transactive memory systems as a means of sharing knowledge. Prior research demonstrates that new information communication technology facilitates the development of transactive memory systems, but the connection between transactive memory and virtual work arrangements is less studied. This article explores how dimensions of virtual work impact transactive memory systems, with a specific focus on the use of information communication technology. Data were collected from a large multinational organization that provides technology consulting. Findings from this study demonstrate a clear relationship between the formation of transactive memory systems and the degree of geographic dispersion of employees. Moreover, the formation of transactive memory systems is negatively impacted by the diversity of job functions represented on a given team.

I drew on organizational learning and institutional theory to investigate how three forms of sociomaterial agency—the communication load of knowledge consumers, and the legitimacy and credibility of knowledge sources—influenced the structure of an organizational network of physicians and knowledge artifacts. Results from the estimation of exponential random graph models for multilevel networks indicated that physicians’ perceptions of the credibility of their physician colleagues and the legitimacy of artifacts as knowledge sources exerted a significant influence on network structure, whereas communication load had no effect. Results also offered qualified support for the premise that multilevel, sociomaterial conceptualizations of knowledge networks may hold the potential to explain more variance in knowledge communication than unipartite or bipartite networks alone.",Communicating Organizational Knowledge,Organizational Communication

Participants viewed an anti-binge drinking PSA developed by the CDC posted on a mock Facebook page in a 2x2 between subjects experimental design. Although, results showed that message source and message virality were not related to trustworthiness of the post, perceived virality mediated the relationship between virality and Facebook user norms, suggesting that virality influences Facebook users’ perceptions regarding message importance, encouraging online engagement. Trustworthiness of the post had an indirect effect on depth of processing and the relationship was mediated by message believability. Message believability positively predicted Facebook user norms, attitudes, and engagement. Depth of processing predicted attitudes and emotional responses.

Social cognitive theory and social comparison theory were used to make predictions about the conditions under which individuals’ (N = 232) exposure to exercise-related SNS posts from others in their social network were related to their weight concerns and exercise attitudes. The results revealed a paradox in which observing others’ exercise posts was associated with both adaptive and maladaptive responses. The number of exercise-related SNS posts received from members of respondents’ social networks was associated with greater weight concerns, and this relationship was stronger among respondents who viewed exercise-related posts from network members who were similar to respondents. Yet, among respondents who had a tendency to make appearance-related upward social comparisons, the number of others’ exercise-related SNS posts received was associated with pro-exercise attitudes.

One of the outcomes of these changes is the separation between content and device. By focusing on organizational identity changes and the attempts to maintain organizational legitimacy we can learn how medium-specific organizations negotiate the challenges to their identity and legitimacy stemming from the new environment of media convergence. Ethnographic research undertaken at the Israeli preschool channel Hop! reveals that economic pressures caused by growing competition with other screens and changes in audience viewing habits have created growing gaps between organizational myth and reality, especially with regard to guarding local culture, staying noncommercial, or remaining aloof from the culture of celebrity. Two organizational coping mechanisms were found. The first was to hire new personnel. The second was to transform from a purely television organization to a multimedia organization.","Data, Technology and Change in Media Industries",Media Industry Studies
2017-1448,2017,Paper Session,Becoming Data: Web Analytics and the Emotional Dimensions of Rationalization,1,"In contemporary media industries, analytics platforms that measure the popularity of content have become ubiquitous. Existing research often conceptualizes analytics as a technology of rationalization designed to supplement – or supplant – experts’ intuitive modes of decision-making with systematized methods. Taking the case of the news industry and drawing on six months of ethnographic fieldwork at Chartbeat, a media analytics firm, this article argues that analytics firms are incentivized to signal alignment with – rather than disruption of – experts’ traditional values and modes of decision-making. By including certain metrics in its platform and omitting others, Chartbeat sought to profess allegiance to clients’ professional values, demonstrate deference to traditional “news judgment,” and boost clients’ morale. The article concludes that research on the production of metrics – and specifically on how market dynamics shape the work of analytics firms – is crucial to understanding the data’s role in media industries and social life more broadly.","Data, Technology and Change in Media Industries",Media Industry Studies

In doing so, we make theoretical and methodological contributions to existing research on media substitution. First, most previous research compared the use of emerging and traditional media at a general level without considering content categories being consumed. This study categorizes mobile phone and PC usage based on genres (e.g., news, entertainment, commerce, community, etc.) and examines the relationship between two media with more granularity. Methodologically, this study uses improved measures of media usage by analyzing Nielsen Korea’s PC-Mobile 2-screen panel data collected from 3,000 participants at an individual level in two time points. The longitudinal analysis allows us to see the changes in people’s mobile and PC usage before and after mobile phones/services emerged and developed.","Data, Technology and Change in Media Industries",Media Industry Studies

The P-Tech model was chosen as an example of the foundational transformation the U.S. K-12 education system is seeing. This shift is characterised by ICT-centred schools shaped by market-driven education policies and one in which governance and control continues to shift from the public to private sector. Utilising a Political Economy of Communication framework, the analysis illuminates the ways in which forces of digital capitalism are propelling these models without evidence to suggest their aims are being realised. The findings show how key interpersonal ties are responsible for shaping the shifting landscape of U.S. K-12 public education.","Data, Technology and Change in Media Industries",Media Industry Studies

The study finds that early adopters are the most adept at information seeking about online tools, and using online tools. Consequently, they experience the least stress around information seeking about online tools.",A Focus On Instructors,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2017-1455,2017,Paper Session,The Impact of Cultural Intelligence on Community College Faculty Conflict Management Style Preferences,1,"Cultural intelligence (CQ), a conceptual framework for cultural competence, provides robust means for understanding faculty conflict management style preferences in culturally diverse community colleges. The objective of this study was to understand community college faculty member’s conflict management style preferences and how cultural intelligence predicts these preferences. Drawing from a sample of full-time community college faculty, this study used the 20-item Cultural Intelligence Survey (CQS) and Rahim’s Organizational Conflict Inventory II to examine the relationship between CQ and conflict management styles. The results indicate that faculty members demonstrated a strong preference for an integrating style of conflict management. The findings indicate that the four factors of CQ in combination and individually correlate with faculty conflict management styles. This study makes a unique contribution to research on conflict management style preferences and cultural intelligence in full-time community college faculty, a population to which this approach has not been previously applied.",A Focus On Instructors,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2017-1456,2017,Paper Session,Picturing “Law and Order” in Daesh-claimed Territories: A Visual Framing Analysis of Law Enforcement in Dabiq Magazine,1,"The international news coverage of Daesh’s executions as a representation of ultraviolence has prioritized the need to understand the role such acts play within the group’s strategic communication campaign. Employing content and visual framing analyses, this study examines 103 law enforcement images appearing in all 15 issues of Dabiq magazine released between July 2014 and July 2016. Dabiq editors use four visual frames to present the law enforcement images: Near Enemy Executions, Far Enemy Executions, Hudud Implementation, and Islamic Police/Hisba. Applying Entman’s four functions of frames, I examine the ways Daesh’s law enforcement images present the group’s actions. While the four frames all help bolster the “The Management of Savagery” manifesto’s goal of presenting an unbeatable force, each contributes in unique ways to establishing control through a combined strategy of inspiring love and fear.",Visual Framing: Theorizing the Management of Meaning and Memory,Visual Communication Studies
2017-1457,2017,Paper Session,Never Forget: Visually Framing Collective Memory of 9/11 in Anniversary News Coverage,1,"As the sixteenth anniversary of 9/11 approaches, questions of visual commemoration become increasingly relevant. With the passing of each anniversary, our collective interpretation of 9/11 is always selectively framed, especially visually. Through a rhetorical framing analysis (Kuypers, 2010), this paper will examine how mainstream anniversary news coverage, through commemorative visuals, persuades the American public to recall the events of 9/11 and their aftermath. Questions to be addressed in this study include how do we frame our collective memory of 9/11 through visual imagery? When we trace the visual commemoration of 9/11 through the last fifteen years, what images are solidified into the collective memory of the nation, and which images fade? Ultimately, how do the visual framing choices of anniversary commemoration of 9/11 work to shape our collective understanding of the event, and what are the implications of these visual choices in terms of crafting a post-9/11 national identity?",Visual Framing: Theorizing the Management of Meaning and Memory,Visual Communication Studies

One, to identify racist frames in visual communication; and two, to construct a generalized body of knowledge that offers a model to guide scholarly analysis of it. To meet these goals, this paper will review critical race theory (CRT) and scholarship on stereotyping and visual framing of race as well as recent theorizing on the visual rhetoric of racism. It then will identify commonalities to propose a critical communication model of visual racism. It will further identify dimensions that explain and predict how visual depictions work heuristically to convey racist attributes. Ultimately, it intends to encourage scholars to critically analyze racism embedded or proposed in visual communication.",Visual Framing: Theorizing the Management of Meaning and Memory,Visual Communication Studies
2017-1459,2017,Paper Session,The Effects of Darkness and Lightness Cues in the Visual Depiction of Political Actors Involved in Scandals: An Experimental Study,1,"Political scandals have increased lately and journalists frequently use specifically framed news images to depict politicians involved in scandals. Although, previous research revealed significant visual framing effects, the impact of news visuals in the context of mediated scandals remains largely unclear. Furthermore, research shows that light colors may result in positive evaluations, whereas dark colors can negatively affect a media recipient. With the help of an experiment the present study examined the effects of a particular image background (light versus dark). While the foreground of the image depicting a politician involved in a scandal remained unchanged, the background was systematically altered. The results revealed that a light background had a positive effect on a recipient’s attitudes toward the politician. In contrast, participants exposed to a dark image background demanded a more severe punishment for the politician.",Visual Framing: Theorizing the Management of Meaning and Memory,Visual Communication Studies

As with general framing theory, though, its definition, operationalization and theoretical significance are matters of considerable debate. Visual framing’s many applications may be advantageous for their bridging properties but at the same time demand theoretical refinement. Based on a broad-based review of 132 scholarly publications from the humanities and social sciences, this project examines the theoretical dimensions of visual framing in order to better define its boundaries. The analysis identifies the way different metaphors of visual framing have guided researchers, how those metaphors influence the concept’s application to various textual modes, and how materiality of images renders visual framing a unique and useful analytical approach.",Visual Framing: Theorizing the Management of Meaning and Memory,Visual Communication Studies
2017-1461,2017,Paper Session,How Media Influence Illusion? An Examination of Media Effects on Illusion in Perceived Knowledge Differential Between Self and Other,2,"Public knowledge of climate change has long been recognized as an important predictor of individuals’ pro-environmental behavioral intention. Moreover, prior studies suggest that how individuals perceive their knowledge level would also affect their behavioral intention. However, people tend to have positive illusion when they evaluate their own knowledge level, especially when they compare themselves with others. As the information source for public agenda, media is recognized as being useful in cultivating public understanding of climate change. Accordingly, the attention of most prior studies has been centered on how media affect people’s actual knowledge of this issue, whereas very few studies have explored how media affect individuals’ illusion in perceived knowledge. The results of this study indicated that individuals’ attention to media messages about climate change, elaboration of the messages, and perceived media messages’ influence on others had effects on the illusion in perceived knowledge differential between self and others.","Environment, Science, and Media",Mass Communication

A between-subject experiment was conducted, and the results showed that exposure significantly increased knowledge and interest. Engagement with the science content, rather than engagement with the narrative, predicted interest, and identification with the main character moderated the effect of exposure on trust. The findings demonstrate the potential use of popular entertainment narratives to foster informal science learning and build trust in science for non-expert audiences.","Environment, Science, and Media",Mass Communication
2017-1463,2017,Paper Session,Public and Personal Responses to Environmental Pollution in China: Applying a Differential Susceptibility Framework,3,"Based on the differential susceptibility to media effects model (DSMM), this study examined the direct, moderated, and mediated effects of multiple forms of media use on Chinese citizens’ engagement in two forms of pro-environmental behaviors: public environmental expression and personal environmental action. Consistent with the DSMM, results indicated that media use directly and indirectly influences pro-environmental behavior. Traditional media sources (e.g., TV, newspapers) as well as online news directly affected public environmental expression and personal environmental action. Traditional media, online news, and use of social network sites also indirectly affected public environmental expression through environmental self-efficacy. Moreover, the effects of traditional media use on environmental self-efficacy and perceived severity of pollution were moderated by direct experience with pollution. Direct experience also moderated the effects of social networking site use on perceived severity. We consider the implications of our findings for future theory-based research and campaign development in China.","Environment, Science, and Media",Mass Communication

The present study employs a two-wave panel survey (N=939). Special attention is paid to the role of different discrete emotions, i.e. anger, fear, hope and enthusiasm, with the potential to explain how such effects can come about. Findings indicate that exposure to news about the COP21 UN Paris Climate Summit had an impact on both positive and negative emotions towards the topic. Furthermore, anger, fear, and enthusiasm (but not hope) mediated the effect of news exposure on behavioral intentions. In line with expectations anger also showed to mediate the effect of news exposure on actual behavior.","Environment, Science, and Media",Mass Communication
2017-1465,2017,Paper Session,What Was I Doing Again? The Effect of Smartphone Vigilance on Goal-Neglect,3,"These days, people always have their smartphones at hand, which constantly presents them with the opportunity to access information and connect to others. While convenient, especially young people report to be in a state of permanent alertness due to those opportunities. In the current study, we define such a state as smartphone vigilance, an awareness that one can always get connected to others in combination with a permanent readiness to respond to incoming smartphone notifications. We argue that receiving a notification activates goals (e.g., checking the message) that interfere with other goals needed to perform a task. We thus hypothesize that smartphone vigilance impairs executive functioning, resulting in increased goal-neglect. To test this assumption, we propose an experiment that examines the effect of smartphone vigilance (incoming notifications) on goal-neglect in a Stroop task. This study represents an important step in understanding how the constant influence of technology can impact people’s lives.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 4,Communication and Technology

Along with this development the question arose, how norms (consisting of norm agent, norm content, norm point of time, and norm sanction) of use are negotiated and set among teenagers and their relevant socialization agents. In order to answer this question, we conducted qualitative interviews with 42 teenagers in Germany. Our findings demonstrate that the socialization process in the case of media innovations such as WhatsApp in part follows the logics laid out by long known concepts such as developmental tasks, but other parts of this process are different and pose unique challenges. Most importantly, the innovativeness of the service going along with non-existent societal behavioral norms and standards that could easily be passed on to adolescents poses challenges to socialization agents such as parents and teachers.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 4,Communication and Technology

Despite the rise in numbers, within the context of research, the question still remains; in the absence of nonverbal and other interpersonal cues, with the greater possibility for disconnection between online identity and the physical self, how do people make judgments and authenticate attributions on mobile dating applications? This paper details work in progress which utilizes qualitative methodology and warranting theory to investigate the natural processes in which individuals evaluate someone is credible online. Observing the steps that individuals take to formulate positive or negative impressions will demonstrate the ways in which people draw on multiple cues to make their final judgments. By focusing on cues and strategies used by Tinder users, this study can have a significant impact on communicative theoretical perspectives of relationships in the context of mobile platforms.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 4,Communication and Technology

To learn more about the potential of this technology to help advertisers persuade a target audience, the current study examined how users process the location check-in information shared by their friends on social media. A 2 (bandwagon cue: 1 star vs. 4.5 stars) × 3 (location cue: none vs. low vs. high) × 2 (friendship tie: close vs. distant) between-subjects experiment found that the bandwagon cue was a dominant cue in the processing of location sharing information, given its strong main effects on multiple types of thoughts generated. The location cue operated uniquely as it positively interacted with the bandwagon cue to generate a great number of thoughts in a positive direction when the location cue was incomplete. Lastly, the friendship strength with the source who shared the location information contributed to cue-accumulation effects.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 4,Communication and Technology

The smartphone use habits evolving in this climate might be associated with an individual’s cultural values. Previous research suggests that there are intercultural differences with regard to the appropriateness of using a smartphone in various situations. This study will build upon the idea that the motivations to use smartphones depend on the individual’s value system. Based on the distinction between individualist (such as power and achievement), collectivist (e.g., tradition, security) and meta-values (e.g., benevolence), and between independent vs. interdependent self-construals, the association between cultural values, self-construal, and the manifestation of specific patterns of smartphone usage will be discussed.

Although there is a wealth of research on adolescent bullying and aggression, much less is known about adolescents’ day-to-day negative peer interactions online. In order to investigate these negative peer interactions and to compare different perceptions, the present study uses a combination of photo diaries and semi-structured interviews (i.e., photo-elicitation interviewing). The sample consists of 34 participant between 13 and 14 years old. A thematic analysis reveals that early adolescents experience a wide variety of negative peer interactions online, ranging in, for instance, severity, number of persons involved, and relationship closeness. It seems that early adolescents often have different perceptions of the same event and do not always realize that certain interactions online are labeled as “negative” or “hurtful” by others.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 4,Communication and Technology

Surprisingly, little research has focused on the basic question of how defensive reactions are structured with regard to one another. Using data from two studies, we tested four possible structures via confirmatory factor analysis, frequency analysis, and latent profile analysis. One study assessed reactions to the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in the U. S., whereas the other evaluated reactions to a message designed to persuade participants to avoid indoor tanning. The data indicated that defensive reactions are best conceptualized as several related concepts that are positively correlated but cannot be reduced to a single phenomenon.

Forty-six participants were instructed to simultaneously complete a virtual street-crossing task while exposed to media messages in an immersive simulation lab. Results suggest that message complexity and sensory modality both influence people’s recognition towards media messages; however, in terms of physical street-crossing performance, only sensory modality influences physical responses, indicating that it is how people process information that matters, as opposed to what information they process. In general, there is a visual dominance effect during street crossing such that visual messages are remembered better than auditory messages: participants are more actively relying on visual cues during the street-crossing task. Within-modality interference is more salient than cross-modality interference, especially when interference is within visual modality.",Message Processing and Effects: New Insights,Information Systems

Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of different speech rates (160, 180 and 200 words per minute) on listener’s cognitive processing and physiological responses when listening to audio commercials. These different speech rates were applied to audio commercials to study the effect on psychophysiological arousal, attention, and recognition of information. The results showed that speech rate influences cognitive processing and modify the listener’s physiological response.

We describe two experiments that supported the message-primacy hypothesis. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to evaluate a series of individual arguments contributed during a discussion (evaluation of arguments) and then to judge the performance of the communicators (evaluation of proponents). Argument quality was varied by manipulating the validity of the underlying enthymemes. As expected, communicators who used valid arguments were evaluated more highly. This effect occurred irrespective of whether or not participants knew at the outset that they would be asked to judge the discussants afterwards. Experiment 2 replicated the effect and demonstrated that argument validity affects the evaluation of communicators also when additional information about the reputation of a communicator is provided.

Focused on Two Facets of Pride and Construal-Level Theory,3,"This research examines how authentic or hubristic pride induced by flattery advertising differently shapes individuals’ construal mind-sets, and subsequently influences their responses toward messages featuring different social referent groups. To do this, interaction effects were investigated between two types of pride appeals (authentic pride vs. hubristic pride) and two levels of construal messages (proximal social distance vs. distant social distance) on individuals’ attitudes toward the ad and brand, as well as purchase intentions. The results showed that individuals in the authentic pride appeal condition were likely to have more favorable attitudes toward the ad and its advertised brand when messages were framed in terms of the socially proximal referent group that is more compatible with their induced low levels of construal mind-set. On the contrary, individuals in the hubristic pride appeal condition were likely to show more favorable attitudes toward the ad and its advertised brand when messages were framed in terms of the socially distant referent group that is more compatible with their evoked high levels of construal mind-set. Through this study, this research both contributes to the emotion literature by confirming a dual-faceted nature of pride and expands the current body of research on the appraisal tendency framework and construal level theory.",Message Processing and Effects: New Insights,Information Systems

Determinants of Colloquial, Emotional, and Dramatized Style of Political Communication",2,"The recent success of populist political actors in several European countries and the US presidential election and the dramatization and emotional tone of political communication in news media have been the object of several theoretical and empirical studies in the past decade. It has been argued that the mediatization of politics and the convergence of populist and tabloid communication styles may foster these developments, as it helps to promote populist ideas in mass communication. In this paper, we disentangle the identity of assumed populist actors, populist communication strategies, and populist communication styles to investigate interactions between media logic and populism in Western democracies.
We find that tabloid media play a minor role in the promotion of populist communication. Opinionated weeklies, on the other hand, encourage the use of populist communication strategies and styles in their coverage on political issues - despite not paying more attention per se to populist actors. We also find that the styles commonly associated with populist actors are indeed more closely related to populist actors than they are to tabloid media.",Populism in the Press and Online,Political Communication

Although empirical research has provided initial insights into the effects of populist blame attribution on citizens’ political opinions, little is known about the contextual factors surrounding its presence in the media. Advancing this knowledge, this paper draws on an extensive content analysis (N = 867) to provide insights into how populist blame attributions are embedded in journalistic reporting styles. Using Latent Class Analysis, we first identified three distinct styles of reporting: neutral, conflict, and interpretative coverage. In line with our predictions, we find that populist blame attributions are present most in conjunction with an interpretative journalistic style, and least when a neutral journalistic style is used. Populist blame attributions are more likely to be used by journalists of tabloid newspapers than journalists of broadsheet newspapers. These results provide valuable insights for understanding the intersections between journalism and populist communication.",Populism in the Press and Online,Political Communication

Twenty-one interviews were conducted with seven individuals from three distinct age cohorts (Millennials, Boomers, and Older Adults). I probed for differences in the information search process in the topics of: health, shopping, crime, and digital safety. The findings showed that rather than age, normative user behaviors (Internet cultures) were primary drivers in the individuals’ search and selection process. A major barrier to seeking and acting on information in this realm is not knowing who to trust.",Information Processing and Technology,Communication and Technology
2017-1491,2017,Paper Session,"Prosocial vs. Trolling Communities on Facebook: An Information Exchange, Message Interactivity, and Participant Agreement Study of Individual-Group Behaviors",2,"This study systematically compared the communicative behaviors within and between a prosocial and a trolling community on Facebook. Messages posted on the community “Walls” were analyzed based on the following conceptual frameworks – 1) types of information exchange behaviors, 2) level of message contingent interactivity, and 3) proportion of agreement and disagreement. Findings revealed that participants in a prosocial community tended to exchange emotionally supportive messages and showed greater level of reciprocity and agreement. That is not to say that a trolling group exists in disharmony. On the contrary, findings revealed that participants of a trolling community tended to agree more with one another than disagree. Findings extend prior studies that had largely examined trolling as an individual activity, and showed that at the group level, a trolling community can instead be more collaborative than acrimonious. Implications of findings in the context of online communities and future research are discussed.

2017-1492,2017,Paper Session,“How Much Do You Say? What Do You Say?” Exploring the Interplay Between Information Complexity and Interactivity,2,"Information complexity is a prominent factor that influences online information processing, yet its psychological ramifications – especially in concert with technological affordances such as interactivity – have rarely been examined. Explicating information complexity in terms of information magnitude (Study 1) and information comprehensibility (Study 2), the current investigation examined the interplay between interactivity and information complexity on consumer responses in an e-commerce environment. Results from Study 1 indicated that interactivity positively influenced brand attitudes only when information magnitude was low. In Study 2, a high (versus low) level of interactivity elicited more favorable brand attitudes only when information comprehensibility was high. Both studies also identified perceived credibility as the underlying process of the positive effects of interactivity. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",Information Processing and Technology,Communication and Technology

Experiments on a Food Ordering Website,1,"A technology interface can convey cues that trigger heuristics and lead directly to behavior that is in line with the heuristics’ prediction. The first study, a field experiment, showed that interface cues on a food ordering website signaling the amount of food other users consume could trigger an anchoring heuristic and induced individuals to model that amount when deciding their own consumption volume. Study II, a laboratory experiment, further showed that the interface-cued anchoring heuristic induced the modeling behavior of individuals without them being aware of its influence, and such influence was especially pronounced when resources for cognitive deliberation were limited.",Information Processing and Technology,Communication and Technology
2017-1494,2017,Paper Session,“Is He Talking to Me?” How Breaking the Fourth Wall Influences Enjoyment,3,"We investigate the entertainment-related consequences of the TV trope of breaking the fourth wall (B4W), i.e., when a fictional character addresses the viewers directly. Based on the model of narrative comprehension and engagement (Busselle & Bilandzic, 2008, 2009) we assumed that B4W contributes to viewers’ cognitive and affective enjoyment by intensifying the parasocial interaction experience. Contrary, B4W should reduce enjoyment by disrupting viewers’ transportation into the narrative. An online experiment with 260 participants was conducted in which we manipulated a scene from House of Cards by removing two B4W moments for one group while showing the complete sequence to the other. A multiple mediation analysis revealed that B4W significantly increased the parasocial interaction experience which in turn heightened cognitive and affective enjoyment. However, no indirect effect of B4W on the enjoyment components through transportation was found. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research.",Psychology of Media Enjoyment,Mass Communication
2017-1495,2017,Paper Session,Blissed by the Past: Media-Induced Nostalgia as Audience Response Factor for Subjective and Psychological Well-Being,2,"Previous research found media to contribute to human well-being via hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment experiences. However, preceding exposure to media and its content which may contribute to these entertainment experiences have seldom been taken into consideration. We propose that nostalgia—defined as bittersweet and fundamentally social emotion (Sedikides et al., 2015) elicited by biographical closeness to media content—influences entertainment experiences and, thus, human well-being in several ways. Past research found nostalgia to serve a self-oriented, an existential and a social function. In this paper, we argue that by serving these functions, nostalgia contributes to both, hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment experiences and thereby influences psychological and subjective well-being. We acknowledge existing interdisciplinary literature and form directions for future research on media-induced nostalgia.",Psychology of Media Enjoyment,Mass Communication
2017-1496,2017,Paper Session,Psychological Effects of Repeated Exposure to Elevating Entertainment: An Experiment Over Six Weeks,3,"Non-hedonic responses to entertaining media have recently attracted an extensive line of research. Long-term investigations on the effects of cumulative exposure to entertaining media over time, however, remain the exception. Building on the theoretical concept of elevation and the notion that observing acts of human kindness can increase people’s prosocial motivation, well-being, and affiliative intentions, the present study examined whether these effects are sustainable after prolonged exposure to elevating media material. In an experiment (N = 93), subjects were repeatedly exposed to either (a) elevating, (b) violent, or (c) neutral videos over the period of six weeks. Results showed that prolonged exposure to elevating videos does not have direct enduring effects on viewers’ psychological flourishing and willingness to interact with stereotyped groups. Nevertheless, viewing acts of human kindness in online videos repeatedly can indirectly increase prosocial motivation and improve recipients’ conceptions of human beings – mediated through the sense of elevation.",Psychology of Media Enjoyment,Mass Communication
2017-1497,2017,Paper Session,The Psychology of Marathon Television Viewing: Antecedents and Viewer Involvement,2,"This study focuses on the increasingly popular trend of marathon (“binge”) television viewing. It examines the personality antecedents of this media consumption style and tests whether it involves changes in the fundamental psychological experience of viewers relative to the narrative and its characters. In a two-study design, theoretical models of media use and involvement are applied as marathon viewing is considered first as a continuum (predicting the extent of “binge” viewing) and then as a unique form of viewing (comparing “binge” and “traditional” viewing). The study identifies the role of attachment style, depression and self-regulation in the process. Additionally, marathon viewing is found to relate to viewer involvement with both the narrative (transportation) and the characters (PSR, identification). A relationship is found between marathon viewing and eudaimonic, but not hedonic, enjoyment. Results advance understanding of enjoyment and involvement theory and offer support for cognitive theories of media addiction.",Psychology of Media Enjoyment,Mass Communication
2017-1498,2017,Paper Session,Discussion Factors: How Relevance and Quality Cues in Media Content Promote Media-Stimulated Interpersonal Communication,1,"Although plenty of research has been conducted to show that and how news media use promotes discussions, little is known about why media content affects the motivation to talk with others. It is argued that communicatory utility is the driving force to assume that media content promotes media-stimulated interpersonal communication (MSIC). In this line, certain media cues, relevance and quality indicators (e.g. unexpectedness, actuality), were conceptualized as discussion factors, which indicate communicatory utility of media content. Consequently, it is assumed that receiving discussion factors through media content promote MSIC. The effect of discussion factors was tested with data collected via online diaries and content analysis in the context of the German media discourse on the climate change issue (N = 444 subjects). The data showed that only some discussion factors promoted MSIC as predicted. The selected issue and its relatively low media coverage might have possibly hindered stronger media effects.","Argument, Engagement, and Persuasion",Mass Communication

In order to better understand the conditions under which the effects of humor vary, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies across the domains in which humor has been popularly used over time (k = 93). Results indicate that humor has only a weak influence on persuasion in general (r = .15). However, stronger effects are recorded for studies in education (r = .35) and marketing (r = .18), as well as for messages that incorporate related-humor (r = .28), use parody (r = .28) or surprise (r = .19), and measure effects on knowledge (r = .31).

2017-1500,2017,Paper Session,When Similarity is Dissimilar: A Meta-Analysis of the Dimensions of Manipulated and Perceived Character-Audience Similarity on Engagement and Persuasion,2,"Character-audience similarity encompasses the alignment between a mediated character or model and the audience member. This similarity can be incidental during media exposure, though an intuitive tactic often employed in tailoring and targeting strategies in media-based persuasion is developing persuasive messages that foster similarity between the models or characters of the message and the intended audience. We conducted a meta-analysis of available published and unpublished studies in communication and related disciplines (e.g., psychology, marketing, advertising, public health). Specifically, we propose: 1) the manipulation of similarity varies greatly across studies, 2) perceptions of similarity have been measured inconsistently and address different aspects of similarity, and 3) that there is little empirical work linking message features designed to inspire similarity (i.e., manipulated similarity) to the perceptions of similarity (i.e., perceived similarity).","Argument, Engagement, and Persuasion",Mass Communication
2017-1501,2017,Paper Session,Empirical and Normative Argument Quality:The Need to Distinguish Convincing Arguments From Good Arguments,1,"The label ‘argument quality’ covers an empirical approach which is about the question “is this argument convincing?”, and a normative approach that addresses the question “should this argument be convincing?” As a result, the same argument can be classified as ‘weak’ from an empirical perspective, but ‘irrelevant’ or even a ‘counterargument’ from the normative approach. Whereas this discrepancy does not pose a problem for the use of argument quality as a litmus test for central processing, it does stunt our understanding of the persuasion process and blocks the ability to provide evidence-based guidelines for designing more effective persuasive messages. We propose to replace the label ‘argument quality” by more informative labels for the various manipulations of argument quality.","Argument, Engagement, and Persuasion",Mass Communication
2017-1502,2017,Paper Session,"How the Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction, Not Engaged Argument",3,"The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2 million people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim these so-called ""50c party"" posts vociferously argue for the government's side in political and policy debates. In the first large scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime's strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We discuss how these results may change our broader theoretical understanding of ""common knowledge"" and information control in authoritarian regimes.","Propaganda, Censorship, and Information in China",Political Communication

This study argues that social media are not only information channels; they can also be effective in communicating feelings and emotions. Social media use may contribute to political affects, which in turn impinge on civic and political participation. Based on a survey of university students in Guangzhou, China (N = 897), this study finds that, under China’s networked authoritarianism, political communication via social media is related to positive affects toward the government and society, while connection with activists via social media is related to negative affects. The positive and negative affects have different impact on different types of civic and political participation. The roles of three discrete negative emotions (anger, anxiety and fear) are also explored. The results show that anger does not drive political participation. Anxiety demobilizes, while fear leads to political participation.","Propaganda, Censorship, and Information in China",Political Communication

However, in recent years, news coverage on popular protest has been rising dramatically. How to make sense of the governments’ seemly contradicting behavior? One possible explanation is that the Chinese government adopted a more proactive one in response to the increasingly unimpeded information flow as well as the urgent need to rein in the local government officials. This article shows the specific strategies adopted by different level officials: the suppression approach will be taken by the local officials first, if the suppression failed, the rumor refutal approach, actively guide approach, propaganda approach will continue to be adopted by the higher-level government.","Propaganda, Censorship, and Information in China",Political Communication

I exploit the coincidence between the “My Dad is Li Gang” incident and the administration of China General Social Survey (CGSS) in 2010. Following a natural experiment approach, I find that the incident itself changed people’s perceptions of social conflicts – those interviewed after the incident considered the conflicts to be more severe. There were significant interactions between specific media use and the incident on people’s perceptions of social and personal equality, as well as trust in local government and officials. Different mediums had different effects. This study offers an empirical investigation in an understudied area, and suggests an approach with high internal validity to study opinion change caused by a single incident.","Propaganda, Censorship, and Information in China",Political Communication

2017-1508,2017,Paper Session,Issue-Specific Newsworthiness: The Impact of Individual Specialization and Party Issue Ownership on News Coverage of MPs (Top Student Paper),1,"The puzzle of which politicians make it into the media and why has received much attention in the political communication literature. Inspired by the seminal work of Galtung and Ruge, news value research has developed as one of the most prominent approaches to study journalistic news selection processes. Previous studies have laid bare issue-independent determinants of politicians’ news coverage, such as power, gender and charisma. In the current study we focus on issue-specific determinants of newsworthiness, i.e. characteristics of politicians that make them more valuable as a news source in news items about certain topics than in other news items. We claim that politicians’ field of specialization and the issue ownerships of the political party they are a member of are two important variables in this regard. We study this by means of a paired-comparison experiment imbedded in an online survey conducted among 174 political journalists in Flanders (Belgium). As expected, the results of the current study demonstrate (1) a main effect of individual specialization on MPs’ news coverage, (2) a main effect of party issue ownership on MPs’ news coverage and (3) the effect of the latter being mediated by the former.",New Perspectives on Newsworthiness,Journalism Studies

The main findings are that companies owned by the government are far more visible in the news than companies with other ownership structures.

2017-1510,2017,Paper Session,From Silence to Salience: Keystone XL and Rethinking How Issues Make the New,1,"The Keystone XL pipeline was a recurrent presence in U.S. and Canadian news until its eventual rejection in late 2015. Its predecessor, however, a similar pipeline from the tar sands of Alberta to refineries in the United States called Keystone Phase 1, was fully completed between 2005 and 2010 with little attention from the press. Why, when the projects were so similar on paper, did the original pipeline receive only passing mention in news, while Keystone XL became a flash point for media debate? Challenging theories of news values and source-centered explanations for journalistic attention, this paper argues that two major oil spills occurring in early 2010 allowed journalists to frame Keystone XL as part of an ongoing story of industry malfeasance. Coverage of these earlier petroleum disasters roused the attention of activists, allowing opponents to think of resistance to pipelines as both important and possible.",New Perspectives on Newsworthiness,Journalism Studies

With an increasing number of requests from subjects and sources in the news to unpublish stories that contain personal and now permanently public information, a closer look at the issue of unpublishing is crucial to enrich discussion and further guide newsroom policies and practices. This study examines and compares U.S. and South Korean journalists’ attitudes toward unpublishing through an analysis of discourse among American and Korean journalists on the web.

The existing research on informal economies has presumed the relation of place and class as a given backdrop: informal economy is a static workplace for the poor. To problematize this presumption, this paper uses Cultural Discourse Analysis (Carbaugh, 2007, 2016) to explore how hawkers constitute their identities and the meanings of place. Drawing from the participant observation and semi-structured interviews with 15 hawkers conducted between 2015 and 2016, two cultural terms of class identifications (i.e. the poor and businessman); and a term relating to the power dynamics in place, giving face, have been identified. The analysis shows these terms and associated practices constitute hawkers as precarious beings in place. This paper hopes to contribute to highlighting the constitutive role of place-based communication practice in making everyday precarity in place and contextualize precarity in developing Asia.",Communication in Public: From the Streets to Institutions and Businesses,Language & Social Interaction
2017-1513,2017,Paper Session,The Social Meanings of Urban Vernaculars: Differentiating Effects of Citélanguage in Advertising,2,"Many urban areas have become multilingual, as is the case in the former ghettoized areas (cités) of Flemish Limburg. The urban vernacular, Citélanguage, has gained popularity in mainstream media targeting Flemish youth, including advertising. Yet, its effectiveness has hardly been studied. In this experimental study we join language accommodation theory, sociolinguistics and advertising studies to examine its persuasiveness. Next to sociodemographic variances, local and ethnic identities are singled out as possible predictors of advertising responses. Moreover, the social meanings attributed to Citélanguage (cf. affective norms studies) are quantified by means of afree response task. The results suggest that language accommodation is a viable strategy to address the wider youth population in Flanders. Yet, the valence attributed to Citélanguage accounts for most variances in advertising attitudes and particularly steers the behavioral intentions of non-ethnic Flemish youth. This confirms a de-ethnicization of the vernacular itself, paving the way for inclusive advertising as well as an interdisciplinary research agenda.",Communication in Public: From the Streets to Institutions and Businesses,Language & Social Interaction

After providing background on small claims court procedures and studies of judge-litigant interaction, we describe the trial data and our discourse approach.

2017-1515,2017,Paper Session,Moral Argumentation in the Public Sphere: Studying Museum Visitor Discourse,1,"Recent studies of moral discourse and argumentation highlight the pervasiveness of morality in everyday life, and how the public sphere is shaped by moral ‘stuff’: speech acts, narratives, accounts and more. By taking a discourse analytic orientation, this article joins this line of research, and delineates the situated and interactional nature of moral argumentations and rhetoric. The article focuses on the role moral discourse plays in the formation of the public sphere, as conceptualized by Habermas, and specifically on moral discourse (co-)produced by museums and by their visitors. As cultural public institutions, museums play an important role in shaping the public sphere both thematically (topically) and materially (communication technologies and materialities of representation and participation). In recent years, museums have shifted to more interactive modes of operation, where visitors are invited to participate in the public sphere by producing discourse in situ. This study explores museum questions and visitors responses in a Jewish cultural/heritage museum in the Unites States. The study first looks at the museum apparatuses, through which discourse is publicly invited, produced and presented, to then study visitors’ responses as moral discourse. The analysis highlights the dramatic quality inherent to moral scenes, and depicts and discusses how visitors’ texts selectively address the moral Actor, Action and Motive as parts of the social moral drama they evaluate.",Communication in Public: From the Streets to Institutions and Businesses,Language & Social Interaction

The analysis of audio-recorded data shows that both racial groups bring Christian talk to shift footing in specific situations in which tensions can arise. Moreover, the Christian narrative per se carries a religious authority that the counterparts who have a Christian identity can hardly refuse. It also emphasizes their religious passion, which, in general, tends to be positively accepted within both Korean and African American communities in the U.S. Therefore, Christian talk could be a useful resource for this Korean entrepreneur both in communicating with African Americans and in maintaining his business in the local community. This may be one of the rare empirical studies on Christian talk between Korean Americans and African Americans, and it suggests the potential of religious narrative as a communication resource in interracial communication.",Communication in Public: From the Streets to Institutions and Businesses,Language & Social Interaction
2017-1517,2017,Paper Session,The Development of Social Media Practices Among PreTeens (Age 8-12): An Impression Management Perspective,4,"The current study explores social media practices among pre-teens aged eight to twelve. Pre-teens are in the midst of developing self-presentation skills, as gaining social acceptance is a key developmental goal in this period. Social media offer opportunities for self-presentation, namely: receiving feedback on self-presentations, having time to think carefully about self-presentations (asynchronicity), and editing self-presentations. The current survey among 600 pre-teens shows that the use of social media develops between ages 8 and 12, with particularly steep increases between ages 10 and 11. Pre-teens made use of the opportunities social media offer for self-presentation, in particular receiving (positive) feedback and asynchronicity, and this increased with age. Although girls did not have a social media profile more often than boys, girls did make more use of the opportunities for self-presentation than boys. These results show that we should not wait until adolescence to promote social media literacy.","The Mediated T(w)een Years: Self-Expression, Self-Concept, & Appearance Satisfaction",Children Adolescents and the Media

Structural equation modelling was conducted to test a hypothetical model in which media internalization mediates the effect of (a) pubertal timing, (b) media-related conversations with friends, and (c) perceptions of media as good information sources regarding appearance and attractiveness, on appearance dissatisfaction. The model also examined the protective role of social self-esteem in media internalization. For girls, pubertal timing positively related to media internalization over time, directly and indirectly through media information and media conversations. For boys, pubertal timing indirectly related to media internalization over time, through media conversations. Media internalization positively predicted body dissatisfaction over time, and vice versa. Social self-esteem did not serve as a buffer against media internalization.","The Mediated T(w)een Years: Self-Expression, Self-Concept, & Appearance Satisfaction",Children Adolescents and the Media

Yet, little work has been done on how these relationships evolve over time, and none has examined the reverse indirect relationships between passive Facebook use, social comparison, and body dissatisfaction. To examine these reciprocal, indirect relationships among an adolescent sample (ages 12-19), two-wave panel data (NTime1 = 1,621) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that boys’, but not girls’, passive Facebook use predicted increases in Facebook comparison over time, which, in turn, predicted increases in body dissatisfaction. No gender differences were found for the reversed relationships: lower scores on body satisfaction predicted increases in Facebook comparison over time. In turn, comparison on Facebook related to more passive Facebook use in the short-term, but less passive Facebook use in the long-term.","The Mediated T(w)een Years: Self-Expression, Self-Concept, & Appearance Satisfaction",Children Adolescents and the Media

Two pathways were tested to explain these relationships. The first pathway included the internalization of rewarded appearance ideals and self-objectification. The second pathway included appearance conversations with friends on social media as a mediating mechanism. The current cross-sectional study among adolescent boys and girls (N = 435, Mage = 15.72, SD = 1.46) tested these mechanisms with a structural equation model. The model revealed that adolescents’ frequency of viewing popular TV programs and time spent on Facebook indirectly predicted higher levels of objectification of same-sex friends. These relationships were mediated by the internalization of rewarded appearance ideals and self-objectification, as well as appearance conversations with friends on Facebook. This was the first study to examine the association between the use of televised and social media and adolescents’ objectification of their same-sex friends.","The Mediated T(w)een Years: Self-Expression, Self-Concept, & Appearance Satisfaction",Children Adolescents and the Media

Results show varying patterns of adolescent Facebook use are related to self-concept development of teenagers. Specifically, time spent on Facebook was related to a decrease in self-complexity, while posting status updates was related to an increase in self-complexity. Time spent on Facebook was unrelated to self-concept clarity, however posting photos, Facebook friend diversity, and receiving comments and likes on posts predicted an increase in clarity.","The Mediated T(w)een Years: Self-Expression, Self-Concept, & Appearance Satisfaction",Children Adolescents and the Media
2017-1522,2017,Paper Session,Navigating the Grey Zone: Developers’ Views on Imitation and Inspiration in the Game Sector,2,"This paper addresses the tension between inspiration and imitation in the games sector, based on semi-structured interviews with 20 German game practitioners. Developing new games necessarily involves adopting existing elements, but at the same time, there have been conflicts on alleged copying all throughout the young industry’s history. Given the ambiguous copyright situation, legal regulations do not provide clear guidelines. Therefore, this study positions itself in the field of empirical copyright research by looking at developers’ norms and views, with the central question: How do game developers delineate legitimate inspiration from cloning?
The findings show that developers disapprove of the wholesale copying of either one of the three main components of digital games, i.e. the audiovisual elements, the programming code as well as the game’s rule-set, even though the latter is not protected by copyright. However, as soon as a component is slightly altered, a complex mix of game features and external circumstances guides their view, which does not always result in an unambiguous judgement. Despite the uncertainty and varying opinions, game developers do not want more legal protection, in fear of it backfiring on their own freedom to reuse existing game mechanics. In order to further interpret and contextualize the data, a broader theoretical framework is needed.",Creativity and Creative Behaviors in Media Industries,Media Industry Studies

2017-1524,2017,Paper Session,Televising Hybrid Music Culture,1,"This paper explores the power dynamics of the Korean television and music industries in the process of cultural hybridization. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with production actors in the Korean television and popular music industries and an extensive analysis of industrial trade publications and scholarly journals, this study calls attention to the power relationship between major television networks and pop music companies in the production of Korean pop boom. In addition, this paper argues that the global spread of Korean pop music strengthens the interdependence of the television and popular music industries in Korean society and brings East Asia to the fore of debates about the production of global culture.

2017-1525,2017,Paper Session,Performing the Artist: Expertise and Social Media in Cultural Work,1,"This paper aims to provide new insight into the concept of expertise in contemporary cultural work. In much literature about the media and cultural industries, the notion of expertise is often mentioned yet taken for granted. The experts in these industries are often consultants, intermediaries (Prince, 2014) or critics (Bourdieu, 1996) and their status as experts accepted with little interrogation. What of the expertise of the workers in these industries, such as artists? How can we define expertise in the context of the cultural worker? Using my empirical research on a group of artists in the United Kingdom, I provide a critical appraisal of expertise in contemporary cultural work. I trace expertise through the artistic career - where it originates, how it transforms, how it is mobilised and how it is performed on social media platforms.",Creativity and Creative Behaviors in Media Industries,Media Industry Studies
2017-1526,2017,Paper Session,District Thailand: The Hunger Games and Censorship in Thailand,1,"On May 22nd 2014 the Royal Thai Army, led by General Prayuth Chan-ocha, took control of Thailand following political turmoil. The army leads a government which is described as the ‘toughest’ regime in forty years with frequent instances of crack downs on public demonstrations, most notably against students and anti-coup leaders. The current Thai political climate is closely mirrored in The Hunger Games (THG) series (Novels: 2008-10, Films: 2012-2015) written by Suzanne Collins. There is a parallel between the series’ political totalitarianism that aims to silence any form of dissent and Thailand’s current military junta. I suggest that it is the active fostering and support for this particular culture of silence that two cinemas in Bangkok would self-censor any potentially damning material in order to avoid punishment from the military authorities, in this case a film that mirrors the current Thai political climate.","Crossing Borders: Popular Culture, Politics, and National Identity",Popular Communication
2017-1527,2017,Paper Session,A New Public Sphere? English-Language Stand-Up Comedy in India,1,"The genre of English-language stand-up comedy is increasingly becoming popular in India’s metropolitan cities. This study uses the concept of the public sphere to examine YouTube videos of a prominent Indian live comedian—Daniel Fernandes. The analysis shows that Fernandes’ verbal humor is based on several performative techniques such as linguistic code-switching, calculative pauses and juxtaposition of incongruous things. The study, furthermore, demonstrates that English-language stand-up comedy extends the bourgeois public sphere by a satirical commentary on political, social, and cultural issues in contemporary India and internationally. The paper also argues that the public sphere exemplified by the genre of English-language live comedy is not entirely new, but an advancement of the classical public sphere.","Crossing Borders: Popular Culture, Politics, and National Identity",Popular Communication
2017-1528,2017,Paper Session,The First and Last Signs of Main Street: Semiosis and Modality in California and Hong Kong Disneylands,2,"Main Street is an indelible image in the American consciousness made hyperreal at Disneyland California in 1955. For subsequent parks in Tokyo and Paris, Disney recontextualized Main Street, but Hong Kong Disneyland’s version was formed as a copy of the California original. This copy demonstrates that transference of a structural form to a new cultural context is not a guarantee of the concomitant transmission of the originating culture’s sensory modality. The arising dissonant tension between the form (signifier) and substance (signified) of Hong Kong’s Main Street has led to its ongoing semiosis due to local cultural and corporate pressures. This paper presents a framework to analyseanalyze this dissonance and semiosis through comparison of external and internal photographs of the same eight landmarks at both parks. The problem of transferring meaning into a new cultural context for an international sign suggests Hong Kong’s Main Street as the last that Disney constructs.","Crossing Borders: Popular Culture, Politics, and National Identity",Popular Communication
2017-1529,2017,Paper Session,Exploring Traditional Chinese Medicine Physicians’ Insights Towards the Dialectical Tensions Between TCM and Biomedicine: A Critical Perspective,2,"This study examines the dynamics of medical pluralism in Singapore from local traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians’ perspectives. The dialectical tensions between TCM and biomedicine manifest in the form of ideological differences and power imbalances. Through in-depth interviews with 22 TCM physicians in Singapore, this article provides insight into clashes between the philosophical paradigms in TCM and biomedicine as well as the broader regulatory, political, and social context that govern health care practice. Findings from this study reveal the incongruences in ideological underpinnings between biomedicine and TCM. The different ways of knowing and the absence of common language erect knowledge-sharing barriers between TCM and biomedical practitioners. Both tangible and more obscure manifestations of power relations are inherent in local health care settings. Participants experienced uneven social standing, evident by their inferior role in comparison to biomedical physicians and patients’ lack of respect. The insufficient institutional recognition for TCM was observed in areas of limited access to material resources and decision-making authority. This study brings into foreground TCM physicians’ voice as the first step to identify communication barriers between biomedicine and TCM. The results also point out possible areas for more dialogue in the pluralistic medical system in Singapore.",Challenges to Effective Communication in Healthcare Settings,Health Communication
2017-1530,2017,Paper Session,The Management of Knowledge in Interprofessional Care: How Nurses Contribute to the Case-Construction in an Intensive Care Unit,2,"This paper focuses on the epistemic and interactional resources displayed by nurses participating in medical case-construction and the ways through which they make a difference in the unfolding of this activity. Drawing on ethnographic research in an Intensive Care Unit and adopting a Conversational Analytical approach to video-recorded morning briefings, the paper shows how the nurses orient the physicians’ ongoing reasoning by managing the epistemic resources and rights related to their professional territory of knowledge. The analysis illustrates that the nurses’ contributions can be distributed along a continuum of agency depending on the of type of discursive activity undertaken, the turn-taking and the turn-design. In the conclusion we advance the hypothesis that nurses make an epistemic difference thanks to their interactive competence: the more skillfully they manage the interaction the more they seem to impact on the diagnostic trajectory. Practical implications, limitations and indications for future research are discussed.",Challenges to Effective Communication in Healthcare Settings,Health Communication
2017-1531,2017,Paper Session,Examining Change in Hospital Built Environments: A Pre-Post Study of Nurse Communication and Patient Care,6,"This pre-post study examines communication and patient care processes in a hospital cardiovascular service line when it moved from an old hospital to a new hospital with a decentralized nurse station design. Prior to the move, seven focus groups were conducted with 28 healthcare professionals from eight different health professions. After the service line moved, eight focus groups were conducted with 51 healthcare professionals from 14 professions. RNs and other healthcare professionals described their pre-move environment as characterized by close proximity, enhanced team communication, and relational communication. Post-move, participants described a built environment where distance reduced nurse communication, fragmentation of nursing processes, and interdisciplinary communication characterized by information exchange. Implications of this study suggest that nurse station design shapes communication and patient care processes. Further, it is important to understand how the built environment, often invisible in communication research, is crucial to understanding communication within complex healthcare systems.",Challenges to Effective Communication in Healthcare Settings,Health Communication

To examine this, an online survey was completed by 267 participants who reported having a current general dental provider. When comparing those who did and did not experience positive communication with a dentist, individuals reporting positive experiences demonstrated significantly higher levels of oral health literacy and provider satisfaction as well as lower levels of medical mistrust. Also, those who had ever experienced an adverse communication episode with a dentist reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and dental mistrust, as compared to those who did not report experiencing negative communication. By contrast, positive and negative communication experiences with hygienists had limited impact on patient outcomes. Information derived from this investigation can be used to build theory in the domain of dental communication and can be used by treatment provides to guide communicative actions with patients.",Challenges to Effective Communication in Healthcare Settings,Health Communication

Analysis of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with CAM practitioners (N=17) reveals that alternative medicine was framed as breaking boundaries that comprised three themes addressing the relational (enabling the patient to find their own strength), systemic (because I don’t prescribe, I’m exploring other practices), and philosophical (ground yourself, and have an escape route) components. The study extends nascent research examining CAM providers’ view in integrative medicine. It is the first to explicate the specific practices comprising the three themes comprising the main frame of breaking boundaries with respect to identifying their potential in the primary, secondary, and tertiary stages of preventive medicine and provides an entry way to the meaningful practice of integrative medicine.",Challenges to Effective Communication in Healthcare Settings,Health Communication
2017-1534,2017,Paper Session,Perceived Smoking Cessation Control May Reduce the Perceived Necessity of Stopping Smoking,1,"High perceived behavioral control regarding the ability to stop smoking is considered to be a key factor for successful smoking cessation. That is why tobacco preventions campaigns emphasize the importance of control information. However, research has found a weak link between perceived behavioral control and the intention to stop smoking. The present study aimed at gaining a clearer understanding of this weak link. Based on previous findings, I assumed that higher perceived behavioral control would be linked with lower perceived vulnerability, resulting in reduced intention to stop smoking. I tested these assumptions in a representative sample of daily smokers (N = 362). The mediation model was confirmed. The results suggest that control appeals might be necessary for smokers feeling vulnerable and motivated to quit smoking. However, for smokers not feeling at risk because of high perceived control about their smoking behavior, fear appeals in prevention campaigns might be more helpful.",Understanding Audiences for Tobacco-Related Health Communication,Health Communication
2017-1535,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Prosmoking Information Scanning Using Social Media on Young Adults' Smoking Initiation,1,"This study examined the effects of pro-smoking information scanning using social media (i.e., routine patterns of social media exposure to pro-smoking information) on non-smoking young adults’ intention to smoke. Drawing upon surveys from 368 young adults (aged 18-25), this study tested predictions based on the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (Fishbein & Yzer, 2003) and the Reference Group Theory (Hyman & Singer, 1968; Sherif & Sherif, 1964). Results found both frequency of social media use and participation level on social media were positively related to pro-smoking information scanning. The results also supported the mediated effect of pro-smoking information scanning on smoking intention through behavioral, normative, and control beliefs suggested in the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction. Moreover, this study illustrated the relative influence of reference groups of scanned exposure on smoking intention. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",Understanding Audiences for Tobacco-Related Health Communication,Health Communication
2017-1536,2017,Paper Session,Information and Delivery Preferences of Adolescents and Young Adults for Tobacco Education Websites,6,"Background: As use of non-cigarette tobacco products (NCTPs) rises among adolescents and young adults, it critical to identify strategies to communicate the risks of NCTP use, Tobacco education websites are one such strategy, however, there is little guidance for message development.

Method: Four focus groups (n=39) were conducted to gauge preferences for message content and message delivery by evaluating three existing tobacco education websites.

Results: Participants shared preferences for novel and concise facts, embedded links to credible sources, and an anti-industry tone for website messages. Participants also expressed an aversion to message strategies that relied on scare tactics or seemed to attempt to simulate adolescent/young-adult media trends (e.g., overuse of hashtags). Participants recommended using social media for connecting to tobacco education websites.

Conclusion: Results of this study can inform development of both online tobacco education messages and general health promotion campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults.",Understanding Audiences for Tobacco-Related Health Communication,Health Communication
2017-1537,2017,Paper Session,Intervening to Say ‘No’ to Secondhand Smoke and Vapor: Psychosocial Correlates of Intentions to Ask Others Not to Smoke or Vape in Public Venues,4,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are increasingly popular and portrayed as a way to circumvent smoke-free policies. Yet, they are also increasingly incorporated into these policies. This study compares psychosocial predictors of intentions to ask others not to use e-cigarettes (vape) and not to smoke – i.e., assertive communication intentions (ACI). Data are from a 2013 online survey. The national sample of U.S. adults (n=474) reported ACI for public venues (restaurants, bars/casinos/clubs, and parks). Psychosocial correlates included perceived risks of secondhand vapor exposure (SHVe)/secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe), SHSe/SHVe attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived self-efficacy. Separate linear regression models for the two ACI outcomes adjusted for demographic variables. A majority of respondents indicated they were unlikely to intervene to speak up about SHSe/SHVe in public venues. Perceived risks and self-efficacy were associated with greater vaping and smoking ACI; subjective norms were only significant for vaping ACI.

2017-1538,2017,Paper Session,Smoking Prevention in China: Perspective From Cancer Patients,3,"Lung cancer death rates have increased 465% in the past 30 years in China, much of this increase due to smoking (China Ministry of Health, 2008). To battle the smoking epidemic, health care professionals in China have launched various national anti-smoking campaign hoping to encourage behavior change. Though previous studies have looked at factors such as smokers’ demographic and psychological state in relation to smoking preference, little effort was put to understand qualitatively the motivations for quitting smoking and the strategies smokers adopted to maintain abstinence. This study utilizes in-depth interview with Chinese smokers, particularly cancer patients, to gain valuable insight of their cessation experience, especially their evaluation on the current anti-smoking campaigns. We identified that cigarettes sharing and gifting culture poses serious threat on smoking prevention while the anti-smoking campaign exerted very little influence on smoker’s behavior.

Preference For and Understanding of Graphs Presenting Health Risk Information,4,"This study investigated younger (<65) and older (>65) adults’ preference for and understanding of graph formats presenting risk information and the contribution of numeracy, graph literacy and health literacy in explaining understanding. After preference was assessed, an experiment was conducted among younger (n= 219) and older (n= 227) adults using a 6 (graphs: clock, bar, sparkplug, table, pie vs pictograph) by 2 (age: younger [< 65] vs older [> 65]) between-subjects design. Understanding was measured with verbatim (speciﬁc numerical) and gist (general impression) knowledge. The bar chart was often preferred and resulted in high verbatim and gist knowledge in both age groups. Although less often preferred, the table yielded high verbatim and gist knowledge scores too. Age, graph literacy, and numeracy contributed to verbatim knowledge scores, whereas for gist knowledge only graph literacy and health literacy were decisive. The results can be used to communicate risk formats to vulnerable groups.",Theory and Research on Testing Health Message Effects,Health Communication

In a 2 threat (high vs. low) × 2 efficacy (high vs. low) × 2 sequence (threat/efficacy vs. efficacy/threat) experiment, each participant saw one of eight messages. As predicted, high threat messages increased higher anxiety than fear, which resulted in higher motivation to obtain protection-related information, and then led to higher attention to the information, increased self and response-efficacy. High response-efficacy increased intention to act; however, self-efficacy was negatively related to intention. Interactions among the independent variables were not significant, but sequence made a difference for individuals already aware of the virus.

2017-1543,2017,Paper Session,Sexually Permissive Attitudes: A Lens Through Which Televison Exposure Might Influence How Sexual Health and Sexual Activity are Linked in Memory,2,"This report describes findings from a larger study of young adults’ exposure to sexual depictions on entertainment television, their attitudes toward sexually permissive behaviors, and their implicit associations of sexual concepts in memory, including sexual health risk and responsibility and sexual gratification. Using an online instrument, young adults participated in a lexical decision task which recorded the time they took to identify letter strings as words or non-words. Some of the words were noted in a pilot study to suggest sexual activity, and some of the words suggested sexual health. In the lexical decision task, young adults responded to health words preceded by sex words, as well as health words preceded by control words, the pairs of which were interspersed among other words and non-word strings. Next, the participants answered questions about their own sexual attitudes and their television use. Responses were matched with a prior content analysis of television programs. As hypothesized, exposure indirectly related to the strength of association between sexual health and sexual gratification concepts in memory by first predicting stronger permissive attitudes. Increased scores on permissiveness then corresponded with a stronger linkage between health and gratification. The primary implication of this finding is that safe sex messages might be most effective if they take advantage of the positive associations with sexual activity most salient among young adults with permissive attitudes.",Theory and Research on Testing Health Message Effects,Health Communication
2017-1544,2017,Paper Session,"Beyond Luister: Postcolonial Casualties, ""Born Frees,"" and Decolonization in South Africa",1,"Luister, a documentary film about the experiences of black students at a historically white university, brings to the fore the issue of exclusion in certain spaces in postcolonial South Africa. ‘Decolonization’ has re-emerged as a new theme for identity, economic and cultural contestations among the youth. In this, the celebratory rhetoric of rainbow nationalism of post-apartheid utopia is confronted. This film inspires a broad analysis of postcoloniality in current South Africa. From a theoretical discourse of the problematics of ‘the postcolonial’ this inquiry engages a critical question: if decolonization is to undo colonial (and apartheid) economic, political and cultural legacies, to what extent has this been achieved? Drawing from public data, social statistical information, media narratives and academic literature, it seems little has been achieved to shake off legacy of colonialism and apartheid. As a result, the post-apartheid youth, although ‘born free’, remain victims of the difficult process of decolonization.","Postcoloniality, Nationalism, and Propaganda",Global Communication and Social Change
2017-1545,2017,Paper Session,The Commodification of Banal Nationalism: Daily Visual Representations of Nationhood,1,"Above entrances and on the rooftops of buildings, flags were a constant reminder of the country one is in. Informed by Billig’s (1995) proposal that the very idea of the nation is inconspicuously embedded within the infrastructure of our everyday life, this paper maps the presence of visual markers of the nation across four urban settings (Madrid, Bucharest, Rotterdam, and Calgary). This mapping serves as a launchpad for several empirical questions: who flags the nation, which nation is flagged, and for what purposes. The findings suggest that economic actors are increasingly re-writing urban daily life as inter-national. Yet, this inter-national dimension does not mean ‘the world is flat’ (Friedman 2005). Flagging different nations performs a triple function: it reproduces the nation as a universal epistemic category, it signals mobility as a condition of the contemporary urban life, and it reproduces as well as sanitizes the hierarchies of mobilities and nations.","Postcoloniality, Nationalism, and Propaganda",Global Communication and Social Change

Departing from this observation, we argue for the need of a theoretical and methodological cosmopolitanism. Using the case of Latin American scholarship, we examine how scholarly work from other geographical areas is systematically marginalized and excluded. This is not only based on language differences, but also on practices of academic production. The analysis is based on a review of the most important European academic conferences and European Journals of our subject. It reveals how postcolonial practices are segmenting European scholarship and unnecessarily delimiting theoretical and methodological accounts to knowledge-making.","Postcoloniality, Nationalism, and Propaganda",Global Communication and Social Change

Drawing on James Scott's notion of ""seeing like a state,"" this paper proposes that Tweeting like a state is not just how states speak like states through supposedly social platforms, but they actually enlist the public to speak like them as well. This raises questions about digital citizenship and agency in the social media era. This analysis is furthered through a review of the Israeli offensive in Gaza in 2014. Israel's military and its citizen supporters adopted the treatment of Palestinians as what Agamben described as “homo sacer,” a person who “can be killed but not sacrificed,” in social media content.","Postcoloniality, Nationalism, and Propaganda",Global Communication and Social Change

This paper analyzes online documents and news media to argue that the current phenomenon is primarily society-driven and bottom-up rather than state-driven and top-down. It is argued that the rise of this personality cult around Xi has its roots in national anxiety in an important transitional period in China. While some worry about a possible return to the politics of the Cultural Revolution by encouraging this personality cult, others are responding to economic anxieties and to the social anxieties occurred by social injustice greatly due to official corruption. We conclude that the possibility of society-driven personality cults will increase over time, as a paradoxical corollary of the potential of new media to allow for the democratization and opening up of politics and culture to new voices.

2017-1549,2017,Paper Session,Determinants of Harassment in Online Multiplayer Games,3,"The current study used the criminological framework of Routine Activity Theory to identify possible circumstantial and individual risk factors that predict both general and sexual harassment victimization in online multiplayers. An online survey of gamers (N = 886) was conducted. Measures included harassment exposure, guardianship, and target suitability.

Our models explained a sizable percentage of the variation in sexual harassment victimization (71%) and general harassment victimization (65%), indicating for the first time that the Routine Activity Theory can be applied to understand online harassment in gaming. The (revealing) gender of the gamer is associated with the type of harassment received; women are more likely to encounter sexual harassment, while male avatars are more likely to be harassed in the general sense. Playing in Player-versus-Player game modes predicts general harassment victimization.

It is, however, also a subject of apparent academic confusion. In order to shed further light on the subject, the present study aimed to: 1) determine which behaviours actual trolls consider as trolling, 2) explore the motivations behind trolling, and 3) examine the online community’s response to trolling as perceived by the troll. To do this, 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted via Skype with self-confessed trolls active in the online gaming community. From this sample, we found that there is a variety of behaviours trolls consider trolling. These, however, can now be put in clear categories based on target and method. Three key motivations to troll emerged: personal enjoyment, revenge, and thrill-seeking. Trolling also appears to be a cyclical phenomenon enabled by the online community at large.

How Cooperation and Competition Influence Hostility towards Teammates and Opponents in an Online Game,3,"Hostility among players is an ongoing problem for many types of online games, where the competitive, “high stakes” nature of ranked game play may foster anti-social behavior among game players. Not all games are created equal, however, as more online games now afford players with the opportunity to either play characters with cooperative goals or choose less competitive game environments. Does the mere presence of a competitive environment or a cooperative teammate affect hostile responses in violent online games? An online field experiment was conducted to answer to questions using a 2 (game mode competitiveness: causal vs. ranked) x 2 (cooperative confederate: present vs absent) x 2 (player allegiance: teammate vs. opponent) between-subjects design. Results suggest that teammates are typically more hostile than opponents, particularly in the absence of a cooperative confederate.

Previous research has tested the effects of video games on players’ Rape Myth Acceptance (RMA) with regard to either sexual or violent contents. The current study aimed at investigating the combined effects of sexual and violent material in video games on players’ RMA. Participants (N = 82) played either a sexualized female game character or a non-sexualized female game character in a violent video game. Participants’ pre-gaming RMA, gender role attitudes and gaming habits were found to predict RMA after the gaming episode, but sexualized game violence did not. Furthermore, no gender differences were found with regard to RMA. The present findings corroborate the important role of pre-existing gender attitudes for the concept of RMA. In addition, future research should also focus on long-term exposure to video games and players’ gaming habits when examining the effects of sexualized violence in video games on RMA.",To Troll or not to Troll: Online Harassment in Video Games,Game Studies

The results are compared to a control group longitudinally playing “The Westport Independent” (WI), a game that puts players in the role of a newspaper editor. Though PP and WI players’ attitudes showed no difference at baseline and after the first play session, PP players showed decreased attitudes toward migrants after the second play session compared with WI players. PP players also showed decreased perceived behavioral control in helping migrants relative to WI players after the first play session, but PP players’ baseline and second session perceived behavioral control scores showed no differences. Additionally, perceived behavioral control for helping immigrants significantly decreased among PP players after the first and second play sessions relative to baseline scores, but the first and second PP play sessions showed no differences in perceived behavioral control scores. WI players’ scores did not change over time. Overall, preliminary findings imply that playing PP reduced attitudes toward migrants relative to WI players.

Writing tasks are completed in short bursts of time (51 seconds) and small blocks of composition (10 words), with rapid switches between writing activity, task-related content, and wholly unrelated media stimuli. The impact of this process on writing performance is dependent on several structural and content-related parameters – including duration of writing, switching frequency, and relatedness of content accessed prior to writing – as well as the metric of performance considered. Implications for future research and solutions for mitigating the impact of this behavior are discussed.",Multitasking and Attention,Communication and Technology
2017-1558,2017,Paper Session,Distinctions in the Media Welfare State: A Bourdieusian Take on Audience Fragmentation,2,"This study draws on Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology of culture in order to shed new light on the ongoing fragmentation of media audiences and users. We use a multiple correspondence analysis on national survey data (n = 1604) collected in Sweden in 2015 to 1.) create a statistical representation of the contemporary Swedish class structure and proceed to 2.) analyze the distribution of a broad range of media practices and media preferences in that space. Results show that social groups reproduce their social status by monopolizing distinct media repertoires. We are able to show that class matters for how people orient in increasingly high-choice media environments – even in a so-called media welfare state. Accordingly, we argue that any attempt to understand the fragmentation of media audiences and users should take class seriously",Media and Audience Fragmentation,Mass Communication
2017-1559,2017,Paper Session,Fragmentation and Duplication: A Cross-National Comparative Analysis of Cross-Platform News Audiences,2,"The move to a high choice online media environment has been associated with fears of audience fragmentation, and the end of a shared public agenda and common culture. Others have challenged this thesis by demonstrating high duplication among audiences for the most popular media outlets. However, this challenge has almost always been based on data from the United States alone, and has not fully accounted for cross-platform consumption. Using data from the 2016 Reuters Institute Digital News Report from six countries (Germany, Denmark, France, Spain, UK, USA) we address these shortcomings and find (i) that incorporating significance testing reduces the amount of cross-platform news audience duplication (ii) that cross-platform news audiences vary country-to-country, with audience duplication lower in Northern and Western Europe, and although in some cases the difference is not statistically significant (iii) we find no support for the idea online news audiences are more fragmented than offline audiences.",Media and Audience Fragmentation,Mass Communication
2017-1560,2017,Paper Session,Fragmentation of Online Usage: An Analysis of Clickstream Data,1,"The advent of the Internet has reopened the debate about fragmentation of media audiences due to an increased number of outlets, in particular for special-interest contents. Considering how users combine mainstream and niche media in their daily repertoires, however, leads scholars to conclude that there is still far too much overlap to warrant fears about online fragmentation. Yet many of the most popular platforms offer various content items and different users may subsequently receive quite different sets of messages. The current study therefore addresses online fragmentation within platforms to determine overlap for the content online users actually see. Two platforms popular in Germany are studied via clickstream data to illustrate the dispersion of usage within large sites. For both YouTube and news site Spiegel Online, the results point clearly towards fragmentation rather than overlap among the respective userships.",Media and Audience Fragmentation,Mass Communication

2017-1563,2017,Paper Session,Examining Dual-Process Models of Emotions: Two Systematic Reviews,1,"Many dual-process information processing models examine the interplay between reason and emotion. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis (RaF) and the appraisal tendency framework (ATF) state that risk perceptions and decisions follow two parallel paths: analytical calculations and spontaneous reactions. The current study presents two systematic reviews of the use of RaF and ATF in health studies. Empirical studies support both theories. For the review of RaF, results show that emotions are effective in helping people make decisions even when cognitive assessments are absent. Stronger negative emotions predict more ideal outcomes. Emotional reactions and cognitive assessments sometimes conflict. However, RaF does not specify the function of discrete emotion. For the review of ATF, results show that negative emotions in gain-framed conditions and positive emotions in loss-framed conditions can arouse ideal outcomes. However, the main effects of emotions and cognitions are not consistent across studies.

People may modulate attention paid to advertisements featuring same-sex couples in order to avoid or diminish negative emotional responses. Modulation of attention (and subsequent emotion response) may occur in the brain before conscious awareness. For example, rapid, automatic neural responses to advertisements are influenced by gender composition of pairs of models and their physical proximity to each other. Using 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG), the current study investigates gender differences in early emotion and attention in subjects exposed to fictitious advertisements featuring male and female same-sex pairs that are either physically touching or not touching.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems

The present study explores how companies can increase memory of information about themselves (logos and names) and associations with the CSR issues they support by using emotional visuals in their CSR messages. We conducted a 2 (valence: positive/valence) × 2 (arousal: calm/arousing) within-subjects experiment. The results showed that calm negative images outperformed other types of emotional images on company logo recognition but the relative advantage of negative images disappeared at higher arousal levels. In an inverse pattern of interaction, both recognition and cued recall of company names were better for arousing negative images than other types of emotional images, showing greater difference between arousing negative and arousing positive images than between calm negative and calm positive images.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2017-1566,2017,Paper Session,Portrayal of Emotional Rewards and Prosocial PSA Effectiveness,2,"The present study identified emotional reward as a naturally formed distinction in message design of prosocial PSAs and examined the role of emotional reward depiction in various goals of prosocial PSAs. Inclusion of emotional reward depiction was found to have a main effect on awareness and knowledge gain. Such effect can be intensified by the arousal level of the PSA content. By reconciling two conflicting perspectives regarding the nature of prosocial behavior, this study pinpointed trait empathy and egoism as individual characteristics that can interact with emotional reward depiction and subsequently affect prosocial behavior. It was found that emotional reward has a main effect on prosocial behavior and it may potentially have increased effect on audience of lower trait empathy and higher trait egoism. In total, this study provides a new angle in designing effective prosocial PSAs and offers a solution in targeting those who less likely perform prosocial behavior.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems

The Role of Reviewer Expertise Cues and Review Valence,3,"Emotionality of messages can exert significant influence on how people process and act upon the message. In electronic word-of-moth (eWOM) research, studies on how message emotionality of online product reviews affects consumer decision-making has yielded mixed results. Guided by consumer behavior research based on attribution theory, the present research examined whether reviewer expertise cues moderate the effects of review emotionality on perceived argument strength and purchase intention. An online experiment conducted with U.S. adults (N = 368) showed that a three-way interaction effect of review emotionality, reviewer expertise cues, and review valence on perceived argument strength was significant. Analyses further revealed that review emotionality had a significant effect on perceived argument strength only when the review valence was positive and the reviewer expertise cues were present. Likewise, review emotionality influenced purchase intention through perceived argument strength only when the review valence was positive and the reviewer expertise cues were present.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2017-1568,2017,Paper Session,Cognitive and Affective Processing of Fast Food Warnings and Their Impact on Fast Food Consumption,1,"This study applied the omnistructure model of information processing theory as a framework for understanding how young adults processed warning messages about fast food. Message receivers’ cognitive and emotional processing was explored in the layers of topic evaluation and message evaluation. This paper posited that interplays of emotional factors (e.g. emotional involvement, emotional ambivalence, primary emotions) and cognitive response factors (e.g. risk threat assessment and attitude) would have an impact on behavioral intention during information processing. An online experiment was conducted to examine how warnings influenced the interplay of topic and message evaluations. The results demonstrated that warnings about three fast food items generated a dynamic interplay between the emotional and cognitive evaluation of the topic and the messages. Such interplay had an effect on the post-message behavioral intention to consume fast food. Beyond the findings of the experiment, this study adds knowledge of the factors (e.g. emotional ambivalence, food sensation) that influence the processing and persuasive effects of the fast food warnings. Ad hoc analysis also found moderation effects of past behavior (i.e. total fast-food use frequency measured before message exposure) on some of the key cognitive information processing paths (e.g. risk threat assessment on attitude and emotional ambivalence on behavioral intention). In general, this study can contribute to health communication and social marketing efforts fighting against unhealthy fast food eating behavior and ultimately obesity.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems

A total of 954 mothers of children between the ages of 5 to 12 from the United States and 437 from the Netherlands participated in the study. The results suggest that there are considerable differences in how children in these two countries are socialized as consumers and what parents report concerning their child’s consumer development and consumer behavior. These differences may be attributable to the differences in the consumer culture between the two countries.",Are They Buying It?

Drawing on 12 focus groups entailing 60 European children of ages 9-11, this article investigates children’s advertising literacy by exploring their knowledge and judgments (and according reasoning strategies) of the new advertising formats. In particular, insight is provided into children’s critical reflection on the tactics of brand integration, interactivity and personalization in the advertising formats brand placement, advergames and retargeted pre-roll video ads on social media. It is shown that while children not spontaneously do so, they appear to have the ability to understand these tactics and form judgments about their (moral) appropriateness, thereby considering a wide range of societal actors.",Are They Buying It?

Our paper consists of early analyses from three studies that attempt to assess the impact of food advertising restrictions on children in Singapore. The studies include an assessment of changes post-policy implementation via (1) a content analysis, (2) a large-scale survey of school children, and (3) a door-to-door household pantry survey of families. Our primary analyses revealed that unhealthy food advertising has declined since the policy implementation. In parallel, children’s consumption of a selected number of unhealthy foods have decreased, and that children’s cognition about unhealthy foods have shifted desirably, and household stocks of a number of unhealthy foods have decreased. Age and gender effects were found. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.",Are They Buying It?

2017-1574,2017,Paper Session,Featuring Fitness: Demographic Differences in Children’s Responses to a Food Advertisement Depicting Physical Activities,1,"Childhood obesity is one of the largest public health concerns of the 21st Century. While many factors influence children’s diets, food advertising is known to play a role. Furthermore, food advertising has been shown to differently impact children based on race and gender, contributing to health disparities between demographic groups. This study investigates the impact of a popular advertising technique, the portrayal of physical activity in conjunction with a high sugar product, on various demographic subsets. The results suggest that this type of advertising leads non-White children, and particularly non-White females, to hold greater intentions to engage in physical activity in the future. However, minority children who viewed the advertisement depicting physical activities incorrectly matched healthy foods with healthy activities more so than did White children shown this ad, or minority children shown an ad absent depictions of physical activities. Racial and gender differences need to be further investigated before concluding the known effects of this food advertising tactic.

2017-1575,2017,Paper Session,Shaping Children’s Healthy Eating Habits With Food Placements in Movies? An Experimental Investigation,7,"Research on media induced food choices of children has not sufficiently investigated whether food placements of healthy products can strengthen healthy food choices. Furthermore, we lack knowledge about the moderating role of children’s individual characteristics such as BMI or parental food-related mediation. The current study combines data from an experiment involving children with a survey of their parents. We exposed children to a movie either containing no food placements, mandarins, or fruit gums. Afterwards, food consumption was measured by giving children the option to choose between fruit gums or mandarins. Children in the two food placement conditions showed stronger preference for the unhealthy snack compared to the control group. Interestingly, compared to children with a lower BMI, children with higher BMI levels had a stronger disposition to choose the candy if a healthy food placement was present. Also, neither restrictive nor active food-related mediation prevented the effects of food placements.",Are They Buying It?

2017-1576,2017,Paper Session,The Influence of Peer Communication on Adolescents’ Persuasion Knowledge and Attitudes Toward Social Advertising,4,"This article examines how peer communication among adolescents (14-16 year) on social networking sites affects the processing and evaluation of social advertising (i.e. targeted advertising that uses an individual’s social ties as endorsers for an ad). More precisely, the focus lies on how engaging in online peer chatting on these social platforms alters persuasion knowledge and attitudes. Across two experiments, results reveal that adolescents engaging in online peer communication on a social networking site display more positive attitudes toward social advertising (compared to non-social advertising), and at the same time, generate less persuasion knowledge. This difference does not emerge when they do not engage in peer communication. Furthermore, the depth of the relationship between the chatters (tie strength) plays a significant moderating role, meaning that only peer communication with strong ties yields effects. These findings reveal important social influence dynamics that lead to valuable theoretical contributions and practical implications.",Are They Buying It?

2017-1577,2017,Paper Session,Adolescents' Reactions to Food Products and Body Images in Advertisements,2,"This study suggests that teens' heavy exposure to food advertising may shape and reinforce body perceptions because of the juxtapositioning of (largely fattening) food products and (mostly thin) models. It examines reactions to food ads through in-depth interviews with 82 adolescents. Guided by the media practice model (MPM), the study finds that adolescents were not confused by mismatches between food products and model body shapes. There was a strong consensus that models in food ads (especially women) must be thin and attractive, reflecting an internalization of the thin ideal. The fame status of models emerged as a meaningful criterion in adolescents' reactions to ads. Though the MPM predicts gender differences, the reactions to and expectation from food ads were largely similar for male and female adolescents. A clear interplay was identified between adolescents' lived experiences – their concern for nutrition, physical exercising, and body image – and their perceptions of food ads.",Are They Buying It?

2017-1578,2017,Paper Session,Facing the Music: Using Disclosures to Activate Adolescents’ Persuasion Knowledge,3,"Embedded advertising has become commonplace as a form of advertising in new media. To counter its effects, written disclosures for embedded advertising have been found to activate persuasion knowledge. However, there has been a lack of disclosure studies on adolescent demographics, music videos, and the wording of disclosures messages. This study used a one-factor experimental design to test the effects of four different disclosure types in music videos on adolescents’ activation of persuasion knowledge, as well as their attitude towards the promoted brand, artist, and video. A total of 279 adolescents aged 14-17 participated.

While three types of disclosures yielded no effects, one type of disclosure messaging (‘this clip contains product placement, which can help artists pay for music video costs’) actually decreased the activation of persuasion knowledge–leading to positive indirect effects on the brand, artist, and music video.",Are They Buying It?

Groshek (2010) found that from 1994-2003, the internet had limited national-level democratic effects, suggesting that internet diffusion should not be considered a democratic panacea but rather a component of contemporary democratization processes. Updating those analyses, this study examines the democratic effects of the internet and mobile phones from 2004-2014, and similarly found limited evidence that emerging media diffusion resulted in augmented democratization: only four countries demonstrated greater democracy levels than were statistically predicted by the forecasting models. Within a framework of diffusion of innovations and demand for democracy, the study extends the understanding of emerging media’s role in democratic development, and represents an important step in identifying emerging media diffusion’s limited democratic agency in cultivating institutionalized democratic growth at the national level.",Technology and Democracy,Communication and Technology

The success of the election led the government to call EVMs ""the leitmotif of the world's largest democratic exercise"" (Press Information Bureau 2014, 205). In this paper, I explore the relationships that variously constitute the market for and production process of EVMs. Through a close reading of newspaper articles, Annual Reports, and other primary documents, I contend that the EVM, as both a technical artifact and a commodity, acts as mediator in the formation of this market, tying together technological innovation, customer demand, and democracy promotion. This paper is designed to provide an initial map of the field in which EVMs are sold as democratic commodities and deployed as democratic technologies.

Applying the Gamson Hypothesis, which states that a combination of high internal political efficacy and low political trust is the optimum condition for political mobilization, and extending the differential political implications of new media, this study illustrates how internet use and two types of social media use, i.e., capital-enhancing use and recreational use, and the trust-efficacy typologies jointly affect political participation, with empirical reference to three Asian polities, i.e., mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Results from two comparative surveys echoed previous literature that capital-enhancing social media use always facilitated political engagement whereas recreational use might reduce engagement. Supporting the Gamson Hypothesis, Dissidents, who had high internal efficacy but low political trust, were more politically active; and for these Dissidents, the capital-enhancing social media use casted a stronger political impact.",Technology and Democracy,Communication and Technology

A hierarchical technology model for assessing employability outcomes through the access, usage and appropriation of ICTs is proposed. We validate the model, testing the influence of the ICT access-usage-appropriation hierarchy (independent variables) on employability (dependent variable), with primary data collected from 78 unemployed, low-income workers in Singapore, using multiple regression techniques. The findings show that ICT access and usage did not affect one’s perceived employability, but higher-order ICT appropriation is associated with the dependent variable, supporting claims made by scholars such as Humphreys, Von Pape, and Karnowski (2013) that one’s appropriation of ICTs in everyday life transcends mere physical access and usage of the ICT devices.",Digital Skills & Inequality,Communication and Technology

However, internet skill has been identified as an individual-level difference that can lead to digital inequalities relative to the benefits made possible by online technologies. Scholars have worried that only those with high motivation through political interest and ability through education will engage in citizenship online. This study uses nationally representative cross-sectional survey data collected during the 2016 US Election to investigate online news behaviors. Guided by research on digital inequalities, the opportunities-motivation-ability framework, and communication gaps, we find that internet skill and political interest predicted greater online news reading and sharing. We also find conditional relationships where digital inequalities in online news behaviors fostered by internet skill were exacerbated for those with greater political interest but the gap was reduced for those with less education.",Digital Skills & Inequality,Communication and Technology

Findings from the current experiment (N=153) confirmed several predictions. First, college students perceive that other college students are more influenced by celebrity endorsement in advertising than they are, suggesting a strong third-person perception (TPP) bias in their attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand, and purchase intention. Second, when it comes to endorsements by their favorite celebrities, college students perceive that they are more influenced than other college students are, suggesting a strong first-person perception (FPP) bias. Third, both the TPP bias and the FPP bias are moderated by the strength of self-celebrity identification and mediated by the perceived trustworthiness of the celebrity endorser. A high level of self-celebrity identification enhances the perceived trustworthiness of the celebrity endorser, which, in turn, leads to the FPP bias for their favorite celebrities.",Issues in Advertising Research,Mass Communication

This counter-intuitive prediction was supported by data from of an online experiment using a national sample of US adult shoppers of organic products (N=375). Specifically, the study investigated consumer responses to ads which promoted organic and non-organic foods either due to their functional health benefits (virtue frame) or due to their hedonic, taste aspects (vice frame). An interaction between the type of product and the type of frame was observed, with organic foods perceived as healthier only when the communication was framed in terms of hedonic aspects (a vice frame). Significant main effects of several other variables are hypothesized and discussed.

This study examined how advertising customization and advertising variation influenced users’ perceptions of multiple ad exposures as well as their attitudes toward the ads and the website in the context of forced ad interruption. Using a 2 (ad customization: ad self-selection option vs. no option) X 2 (ad variation: ad variation vs. a single ad repetition) factorial experiment, the researcher noted that advertising content control through a customization feature is an influential factor which leads to positive attitudes toward multiple exposures to the ads. The results also showed the possibility that offering ad variation tended to induce users’ positive attitudes toward forced exposure to online ads as similar to offering ad customization feature. In regard to the impact of ad variation on advertising effectiveness, users’ perceived intrusiveness and feelings of irritation particularly play an important underlying mechanism in this relationship. This study finding has theoretical and practical implications on advertising repetition in the forced online advertising interface.",Issues in Advertising Research,Mass Communication

Results of the research reject the assumption that consumers tend to pay more attention on the attractiveness rather than the expertise of the sport celebrity in purchasing the endorsed brand, but validate the salience of the model. Audiences, who hold parasocial interaction with the sport celebrity, are driven by both homophily with the celebrity and reverence to the celebrity as well as ideal congruity between their ideal self-image and image of the celebrity.

Drawing on theories of mediatization and celebrity politics, it analyses how various forms of symbolic connectivity are expressed and performed by 16 leading politicians in Sweden, and moreover how their social media use relate to traditional mainstream media. The study leans on a content analysis (n=800) and results show that journalism still holds a strong symbolic value, even when politicians are in charge of the political discourse. In addition, it reveals how the platform logic of Instagram contributes to the formation of digital life style politics, where symbolic connections between politicians and a variety of actors are staged through new mediatized relations. Visual political communication does inherit a democratic and interactive potential. However, according to the analyzed data, most politicians avoid public interaction. Instead, they are preoccupied with the branding of their public persona.",How Political Actors Use Social Media: Lessons for Success,Political Communication
2017-1592,2017,Paper Session,Exposing Themselves? The Personalization of Tweeting Behavior During the 2012 Dutch General Election Campaign,3,"The concept of personalization has increasingly become central to our understanding of political communication, particularly during election time. With the rise of social media such as Twitter, which places more focus on individual politicians and opens up more direct links with voters, the opportunities for more personalized campaigning have been expanded. Although studies of personalization in politics and online campaigning have been popular avenues of research in the last 20 years, an empirically-led understanding of the nexus between the two is still underdeveloped, at least with respect to Twitter. In this paper, through an analysis of the ‘personal’ tweeting behaviors of Dutch candidates in the 2012 general election, we therefore attempt to understand how politicians in an advanced Western democracy attempt to disclose aspects of the private life through social media – which aspects these are and how they are intermingled with the ‘political’.",How Political Actors Use Social Media: Lessons for Success,Political Communication
2017-1593,2017,Paper Session,Predicting the Digital Success of Swiss Politicians and Parties on Facebook and Twitter,2,"This paper proposes two measures for the success of political communication on social media platforms: First, political actors need to build a large online community, and second, they need to motivate their followers to spread their messages. With a unique data set of sociodemographic, structural, and platform-specific characteristics of 246 Swiss politicians and 11 parties, the paper then predicts digital success on Facebook and Twitter. Results show that high coverage in traditional media has a large impact on the size of the digital followership. In turn, digital followership influences the average amount of digital interactions on Facebook, yet not on Twitter. Thus, politicians’ digital success on social media depends on the platform and online community, but also on their presence in traditional media.",How Political Actors Use Social Media: Lessons for Success,Political Communication
2017-1594,2017,Paper Session,Talking it Personally: Features of Successful Political Posts on Facebook,3,"While the centrality of Facebook as a political arena has been widely acknowledged, only scant attention has been given to what makes some political posts more successful than others. Addressing this gap, we analyzed 400 political posts written by diverse political actors in Israel. We explored, in particular, two main groups of factors that have been associated with major attributes of Facebook usage: content engagement and self-presentation. The analysis yielded a model of six features that promote the success of a political post: implied emotions, humor, first person, self-exposure, personal stance, and anger-evoking cues. We also identified differences in successful posts written by right-wing and left-wing actors; while humor was found to be a significant predictor of success only in left-wing posts, references to an out-group are associated with success only in right-wing ones. Overall, the findings showed that attributes of self-presentation are strongly linked to the success of political posts.",How Political Actors Use Social Media: Lessons for Success,Political Communication

Drawing on existing literature on political social media, we propose ways in which online social networks impact contemporary political and civic engagement in India and Romania. We find that the two politicians used a range of discursive techniques to signal personal qualities that align with a notion of modern technocratic leadership. We explore the ways that personal drive and rectitude, commitment to neoliberal development, and an appreciation of technology are proposed in social media to advance the political brand of these leaders — both of whom emerged as challengers to entrenched political leaders. Social media affordances such as interactivity, following, and message spreadability reconfigured national electioneering in both countries, creating the appearance of a horizontal collective in which the leader participates with equally valued and likeminded citizens.",How Political Actors Use Social Media: Lessons for Success,Political Communication
2017-1596,2017,Paper Session,The Effect of Politicians’ Personality Traits on Their Media Visibility,4,"While being frequently covered in the news media is key to political success, previous literature demonstrates that some politicians are systematically more visible in the media than others. These studies explain variations in media visibility using either institutional factors, such as holding an influential political position, or specific behavioral indicators, such as activity in parliament. The current study advances our understanding of the newsworthiness of politicians by exploring their core personality traits as determinants of their media visibility. Utilizing a sample of 339 incumbent politicians in three countries (Belgium, Canada and Israel), we find that two of the Big Five personality traits—Agreeableness and Extraversion—significantly predict media visibility. Our analysis finds that, holding all else constant, politicians who are less agreeable (i.e., more critical and quarrelsome) and more extraverted appear more frequently in the news. The contribution of these results to political communication and personality psychology literature is discussed.",Visibility in News Coverage: Attention to Actors and Issues,Political Communication

Based on research on the international flow of news, we identify traits of conflicts and the nations involved that potentially determine visibility. In our study, we combine data on 119 armed conflicts between 1992 and 2013 and an analysis of German newspaper coverage. We can show that several event- and context-oriented factors exert an influence on how much attention the media devote to a conflict. Conflict visibility was determined by the geographical distance between the reporting country and the conflict, the involvement of nuclear weapons, a military involvement of the reporting country, political sanctions imposed by supranational organizations, and (to a lesser extent) the number of fatalities.",Visibility in News Coverage: Attention to Actors and Issues,Political Communication
2017-1598,2017,Paper Session,Understanding the Dynamics of Politicians’ Visibility in Traditional and Online Media,2,"In this study, we examine the extent to which politicians’ visibility in traditional news coverage explains individual politicians’ online visibility, and vice versa. We also explore the extent to which visibility of politicians offline and online condition each other depends on commonly identified characteristics of the individual politician, including status, seniority, party affiliation, gender and age. We collected data on offline and online visibility for each elected MP from the 2012 Dutch national elections covering each 15 days prior to Election Day (N = 2,250). This includes 2,736 newspaper articles and 136,131 online entries. Our results have important implications for research that studies effects of political communication, determinants of news production, online/social media content as indicator of public opinion developments, and the relationship between different types of media. Specifically, we provide insight into the question whether online content might influence the offline news agenda on an aggregated level.",Visibility in News Coverage: Attention to Actors and Issues,Political Communication

We present an exploratory study of this phenomenon, which we conceptualize as transnationalized election campaigns, based on content analysis of newspaper articles published during the 2013 general elections in Germany and Italy. We find that transnational news coverage follows asymmetrical patterns between the two countries. Whereas the Italian press both covered the German campaign and discussed German politics during the Italian campaign, the German press covered the Italian campaign but did not mention Italian politics while covering the German campaign. These findings suggest that power relationships affect how national media cover foreign countries as part of both their domestic and foreign news. The fact that transnational coverage is widespread but asymmetrical has important implications for the public’s ability to understand the interdependencies between countries.",Visibility in News Coverage: Attention to Actors and Issues,Political Communication

2017-1601,2017,Paper Session,"Facebook in the News: Social media, Journalism, and Public Responsibility Following the 2016 Trending Topics Controversy",1,"In May 2016, two stories on Facebook’s Trending Topics news feature appeared on the site Gizmodo, the first exposing the human curators working surreptitiously to select news and the second containing accusations that certain curators censored conservative news. These revelations led to public outcry, both from conservatives upset at possible bias and others who criticized Facebook for its largely secretive and haphazard approach to news. This study examines the response to the controversy as metajournalistic discourse—talk about news that seeks to define appropriate practices and legitimate news forms. It finds a divergence between Facebook’s approach to news as content driven by popularity and journalists’ efforts to place Facebook as an active participant within the news ecosystem and therefore beholden to an enhanced institutional commitment to public responsibility.",Journalists’ Discourses About Journalism: Negotiating Professional Practices and Boundaries,Journalism Studies

But studies of how journalism is depicted in popular culture make the same claim. This study, through a textual analysis of television dramas The Wire and House of Cards, bridges these two disciplines and, utilizing the theory of metajournalistic discourse (Carlson, 2016), argues that with shifting boundaries of who is and who isn’t a journalist, metajournalistic discourse produced by former journalists, meso-level journalists, working in popular culture could provide the most influential type of metajournalistic discourse.

2017-1603,2017,Paper Session,Photojournalism and Iconic Images in a Digital Age: Editorial Coverage of the Deliberations Over the Alan Kurdi Photographs,3,"This article investigates how editorial coverage critically reflects on the role and impact of “iconic” photojournalistic images in today’s digitalized media landscape. Specifically, we examine reactions to the photographs of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian refugee whose drowned corpse washed ashore in 2015. We analyse editorial content (editorial leaders, opinion columns, guest columns, letters to the editor) around this imagery in Danish, Canadian and British papers over a four-month period, from 2 September 2015 to 2 January 2016. The analysis reveals four issues central to editorial deliberations, namely: a) editorial boundaries and iconicity in a digital age; b) instantaneousness and historical photographic precedent; c) social media and the impact on photojournalism; and d) authenticity, compassion and the representational quality of images. This article accordingly points to a media ecology that has disturbed previous visual practices to a point where the norms governing photojournalistic communication are being reconsidered and redrawn.",Journalists’ Discourses About Journalism: Negotiating Professional Practices and Boundaries,Journalism Studies

Media discourses in the Western and the Eastern part of the world further aggravated already tense situation around the world by polarizing the issue. Western media fully supported the Charlie Hebdo right to offend and redraw cartoon of Prophet Muhammad whereas Islamic media termed the crisis as a Western hegemonic narrative to impose Western values on Muslims. This study examines how the Western media (The New York Times; BBC News) and Islamic media (Al-Jazeera News; Al-Arabia News) frame the issues about freedom of expression and Anti-Islamic Sentiments in the aftermath of Charlie Hebdo attack respectively. Results show that Western media endorsed Charlie Hebdo’s right to offend religious sensitivities and lauded its role to protect the Western value of free speech. The Islamic media view the entire Western discourses as anti-Islam/anti-Muslims and emphasize on the need for good taste and professionalism in journalism, particularly in relation to religious beliefs.

Attributions and sympathy were found to be mediators of the interaction effects of controllable vs. uncontrollable messages and sensation seeking on punitive opinions. This study contributes to research on attribution theory and sensation seeking in the sports communication context and provides practical implications for sports marketers and public relations professionals.","Why Sports Communication Matters: Identity, Representation, and Social Responsibility",Sports Communication

However, even with the recent increase in participation, women remain marginalized due to the hegemonic masculinity ideologies of sport, which causes women’s sport fandom to be called into question. Over the course of the 2013 fall football season, I interviewed 28 highly intelligent, very media savvy women who play fantasy football. Through a grounded theory analysis within a critical discourse studies framework of the interviewee data, I found that these interviewees felt excluded by the NFL, but were able to overcome this exclusion through their participation in fantasy football; arguing that fantasy football is inclusive. Ultimately, I found that through participation in fantasy football, these women are resisting the hegemonic masculinity of American football on multiple levels.","Why Sports Communication Matters: Identity, Representation, and Social Responsibility",Sports Communication
2017-1609,2017,Paper Session,Make a Wish: Does German Public Broadcasting Meet Normative Expectations and Audience Preferences in Regard to their Media Coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympics?,5,"Sport mega events such as the 2016 Rio Olympics draw global attention as billions follow the athletic competitions. Such events are regularly overshadowed by precarious circumstances concerning global sport problems or socio-political issues in the host country. This poses a journalistic conflict how to reconcile reporting on entertaining and incriminating aspects. How do the media react, given their mission of simultaneously entertaining and informing its audience? Using the example of German public broadcasters, a content analysis indicates that the media follow a dualistic strategy by covering all relevant issues. Subsequently, we ask whether this actual coverage meets the audience’s preferences. An additional conjoint experiment with 289 television viewers shows that viewers and non-viewers differ in their thematic interests. The journalistic middle ground leaves both groups unsatisfied, resulting in low appreciation of program composition. Thus, the veritable crisis of global sport events negatively affects journalism and its audience.","Why Sports Communication Matters: Identity, Representation, and Social Responsibility",Sports Communication

Investor relations (IR) has been a distinct corporate function for some 50 years in the US and about 30 years in Europe. Accordingly, research on IR is still in its early stages. In this contribution, we present the findings from an interdisciplinary systematic literature review focusing on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English since 1990. We differentiate strands of research focusing on the organization, strategy, instruments, content and effects of investor relations. IR research is shown to have strong roots in the business and management, accounting, and communications literature. We document a rising interest in the topic and a steady development beyond descriptive accounts of the function to distinctive lines of inquiry.

This article gives an overview of the representation of older women in the media starting with a short literature review showing that older women are nearly invisible in the worldwide media and when represented they are often depicted in negative ways. In the following text, we show that such under- and misrepresentations should be taken seriously because media representations have an influence on how older people regard themselves and how they are regarded by younger people. We then analyze some recent cases of older women in the media that might represent some positive changes and conclude the article with a discussion and recommendations on how to improve media representations of older women.","The Construction of Body: Age, Disability, and Plastic Surgery in Media Portrayals",Feminist Scholarship

Age, Gender, and Negotiating a Xena Reboot",1,"In this paper I examine the online discourses around, and negotiations between, NBCUniversal and fans concerning the Xena: Warrior Princess reboot, especially related to sexism and ageism. One online fan group, the Xena Movie Campaign (XMC), has especially worked to persuade the media industry to revive Xena with the original actresses. Fans and XMC hold two primary concerns about the industry: 1) that the industry doesn’t see value in the franchise or, increasingly, in casting the ageing original actresses in an action film/series, and 2) that the industry doesn’t value the age demographic of the original series’ (typically older female) fans. XMC and other fans deploy four primary strategies to impact the industry: 1) flood NBCUniversal with demands, 2) pressure NBCUniversal by alleging sexism, 3) boycott the reboot, 4) don’t alienate. This case study illustrates the complexities surrounding, and negotiations of power involved in, media representations of gender and age.","The Construction of Body: Age, Disability, and Plastic Surgery in Media Portrayals",Feminist Scholarship

The show has drawn acclaim for its realistic depiction of disability as well as for casting an actor with a disability: Micah Fowler, who has cerebral palsy but exaggerates the characteristics of his disability to play the role of JJ. Using Critical Race Theory and Butler’s theory of gender performativity, this study considers the disability performances in the show, not only of JJ but also of the other members of the DiMeo family and his aide, Kenneth. The study also addresses how these depictions intersect with performances related to other identity markers, namely social class, gender, and race, and whether they reinforce or challenge media stereotypes.","The Construction of Body: Age, Disability, and Plastic Surgery in Media Portrayals",Feminist Scholarship

According to NOW (2011), Lebanon is one of the top five countries with the highest plastic surgeries along with the US, Brazil, and Venezuela. This study implements the objectification theory to explain how women objectify themselves when exposed to images and how this self-objectification alters their attitudes and behaviors. Thus, a quantitative survey will be conducted in order to analyze how the advertisements play a role in spreading a standard beauty image, how women feel towards the models present in the ads, if women believe this image can be achieved through plastic surgeries, how they feel towards plastic surgeries and how these surgeries could affect their self-esteem and social life.","The Construction of Body: Age, Disability, and Plastic Surgery in Media Portrayals",Feminist Scholarship

By analyzing different patterns of normative influence associated with cervical cancer detection among Latinas (N = 982), the study concludes that network brokerage provides individuals with non-redundant information, helps resist normative pressure, and contributes to efficacy beliefs, promoting a more informed decision-making. Conversely, network closure perpetuates conformity, increases the influence of social norms, and induces less confidence in individuals’ ability to comply with cervical cancer screening, subjecting Latinas to unnecessary health risks. Overall, the results suggest that the study of normative influence should go hand in hand with social network analysis, trying to shed a light on the distinct social structures and communication practices that can either reinforce or challenge norms.","Social Norms, Social Capital, and Social Influence in Health Communication",Health Communication

Our model was largely supported by the data from a two-wave panel survey with a Korean nation-wide sample. It was found that both personal cancer history and cancer worry were positively associated with exposure to stomach cancer information from the media. In turn, exposure to media information was positively related to reflective integration of that information, which ultimately leads to stomach cancer knowledge only among people with high levels of social capital. These findings clearly show that media uses and effects are not only an individual but also a contextually dependent experience.","Social Norms, Social Capital, and Social Influence in Health Communication",Health Communication

Results indicated differences across the five major celebrations among the college student sample. Additionally, regression results showed that general descriptive norms – measured by asking participants to estimate the number of drinks consumed by members of different social groups – were better predictors of self-report celebration drinking than scale measures of descriptive and injunctive norms; specifically, in relation to estimation of the number of drinks consumed by close Facebook friends.

This unfavorable gap is to a great extend a communication issue that can partly be addressed with public health campaigns. In academic research the role of interpersonal communication among relatives is often reduced to the communication after a decision is made but it is also found that sharing ones will with relatives depends on prior discussions. Therefore, the goal of our research project is to include the dual roles of interpersonal communication in a model of interpersonal communication about organ donation and to identify the relevant factors that influence these two types of communication. Based on a survey among 2’031 persons (representative stratified random sample) and structural equation modeling we are able to disentangle the two types of communication and study their interplay. The findings are currently used to consult an ongoing public health campaign.","Social Norms, Social Capital, and Social Influence in Health Communication",Health Communication

The analysis documented the prevalence of stigma frames, which communicate stereotypes concerning schizophrenia, and stigma-challenge frames, which contradict stereotypes, in 558 articles. The study also examined the relationship between framing and reader commentary, including the likelihood of readers posting stigmatizing comments, stigma-challenging comments, and comments in which an individual discloses experience with mental illness. Stigma frames were prevalent in the sample, suggesting the news media continue associating schizophrenia with violent and criminal behavior. Stigma frames stood greater chance of eliciting stigmatizing comments from readers when compared to stigma-challenging and neutral frames. Conversely, stigma-challenging frames stood greater chance of eliciting stigma-challenging comments from readers. Readers were more likely to disclose personal experience with mental illness when they encountered the stigma-challenging frame.

A 2 (framing: gain vs. loss) x 2 (images: professional model vs. everyday person) x 1 (control group) between-subjects experiment (N = 204) revealed no significant main effects. Interaction effects for predicting maintaining a healthy weight and body satisfaction were significant.

2017-1624,2017,Paper Session,Prospect Theory to Health Communication: Interplay of Goal and Attribute Framing With Certainty Information,2,"Although framing studies in health communication stem from prospect theory, there are major differences in how gain-loss, risks, and outcome variables are operationalized in these two fields. Specifically, prospect theory tests how certainty interplays with attribute-framed gain and loss on option choice, whereas most health communication framing studies examine the effects of goal-framed gain and loss on persuasion without addressing certainty. To disentangle these discrepancies, we conducted a randomized on-line experiment in a 2 (certainty: certain vs. uncertain) X 3 (framing: gain vs. attribute-loss vs. goal-loss) between subject design. The results showed that certainty interacts with goal framing on policy support and with attribute framing on policy evaluation. The pattern of the interactions was consistent with prospect theory: certain-gain messages led to higher ratings than uncertain-gain, and uncertain-loss led to higher ratings than certain-loss. These findings offer plausible explanations for the inconsistent findings reported on framing effects in health communication research.",Message Framing Effects in Health Contexts,Health Communication

Results indicated that no message was more persuasive in changing the intention of the participant to sign an organ donor card. Additionally, personality characteristics such as openness (intellect), conscientiousness, and agreeableness were seen to have an effect on intent to sign an organ donor card when compared to identifying highly with personality characteristics such as extraversion or neuroticism. Implications for health campaign theory and design are considered.",Message Framing Effects in Health Contexts,Health Communication
2017-1626,2017,Paper Session,Can an Algorithm Commit Libel? Applying Media Law to Automated Journalism,2,"The rise of automated journalism—the algorithmically driven conversion of structured data into news stories—presents a range of potentialities and pitfalls for news organizations. Among these is one issue that has yet to be explored in journalism studies: the possibility for libel in news content produced by algorithm. However hypothetical such a scenario may seem, our review of legal cases involving algorithms and libel suggests that news organizations need to take media law more fully into account as they develop and deploy news-writing bots. Drawing on the U.S. legal framework as a conservative baseline for press defenses against libel, we outline three key issues to consider: (1) the complicated matter of determining fault in a case of algorithm-based libel; (2) the inability for news organizations to adopt defenses similar to those used by Google and other providers of algorithmic content; and (3) the inability to claim that automated journalism produces constitutionally protected opinions that are immune from libel accusations. These concerns are discussed in light of broader trends of automation and artificial intelligence in the media and information environment.",Doing Justice to Journalism: Legal Challenges in the News,Journalism Studies
2017-1627,2017,Paper Session,Feeding Big Brother: Why the Synergy of Commerce and Convenience Calls for Institution-Based Privacy,2,"This project outlines how classical philosophy and legal theory inform a 21sst centuryst understanding of privacy, particularly where that concept intersects with journalism, the mass media and digital technologies. It accepts that law and ethics are foundational to the concept, thus eschewing Immanuel Kant’s view that law and ethics as entirely separate endeavors. The paper employs feminist epistemology to connect both domains to the role that technology now plays in how people and the machines that they program and control consider privacy. By triangulating the “issue” of privacy in this way, this effort proposes additional theorizing about how privacy might be articulated and how both responsibility and accountability for that conceptualization be understood at the institutional but non-state level.",Doing Justice to Journalism: Legal Challenges in the News,Journalism Studies
2017-1628,2017,Paper Session,Constructing Justice in Media Trials: An Analytical Typology of Social Justice in China,2,"Existing studies have long recognised media trials as the tension between media freedom and rule of law. However, either paradigm of media freedom or rule of law alone fails to provide a complete picture of competing logics of social justice in a transitional society like China, Viewing media trials as “media events” going through formal judicial trial, we analysed 49 media trial cases between 2000 and 2016. We examine the legal logic of these cases, as shown in the courts’ decision assessment documents; and the media logic as presented in news coverage of these events. We propose an analytic typology to understand the evolving social justice in today’s China.",Doing Justice to Journalism: Legal Challenges in the News,Journalism Studies

Specifically, it examines the ways in which these two institutions constructed and framed the memory of the 1983 murder of 14-year-old Danny Katz from Haifa, Israel. Common scholarly criticism maintains that journalists covering legal affairs tend to internalize the values of the legal system. The findings of this study point at an opposite pattern: throughout 32 years of coverage, the dominant journalistic voice has challenged the rulings delivered by the legal system, and thus undermined the “redressive rituals” it offered. We argue that this kind of journalistic criticism became possible due to the fact that throughout the years voices from within the legal system challenged the formal verdicts and questioned the guilt of the convicted murderers.",Doing Justice to Journalism: Legal Challenges in the News,Journalism Studies

The materials shared in this essay are a part of a larger ethnographic project that aims at understanding the national and ethnic belonging of Jewish Iranian (that is, Persian) immigrants in Israel. In this essay, I examine transnational dialogues and identities in spaces of cultural and political contention. I endeavor to theorize the coupling of conflicting narratives of identity and memory (i.e. resistance and embracement) through coining the term “affirmative opposition,” describing how members of the Persian community reaffirm existing social structures within the Israeli society through acts of opposition.","Global Exclusions: Refugees, Exiles, and Migrants",Global Communication and Social Change
2017-1632,2017,Paper Session,"Decolonizing Refugee Empowerment initiatives: Challenging Ableism, Neoliberalism, and the American Dream",1,"As the number of forcibly displaced people continue to rise globally, humanitarian organizations will continue to play an increasingly important role in creating solutions that “empower” some of the most structurally disadvantaged populations in the world. This analysis is the result of a participant ethnography at a regional headquarters located in the United States of one of the world’s largest international refugee resettlement and aid organizations, The Global Refugee Agency (pseudonym), to discern organizational discourses and practices that construct formations of empowerment. This study takes a critical approach, applying theories of decoloniality to understand how refugee empowerment initiatives: (1) complicate and reinforce neoliberal tropes of self-sufficiency (2) reinforce ableist notions of the American Dream (3) illustrate instances of empowerment as agency and self-representation. This study argues that humanitarian organizations are important actors in the process of enabling better material realities for refugees while also producing economic subjectivities and proliferating neoliberal values of independence. By examining the implications of constructing empowerment as centered around consumerism and self-sufficiency, non-profits and humanitarian organizations can begin to conceptualize empowerment in a way that challenges neoliberalism, ableism and legacies of colonialism.","Global Exclusions: Refugees, Exiles, and Migrants",Global Communication and Social Change
2017-1633,2017,Paper Session,Exit and Voice in a Digital Age: Iran's Exiled Activists and the Authoritarian State,1,"Digital media have given dissidents from authoritarian contexts opportunities to stay involved in domestic debates and channel political information to international audiences, building up external pressure on the regime. Yet, these media also create multiple points of exposure that state actors can exploit. Using the case of Iran this paper shows how the internet enables new and influences established tactics of state repression beyond borders. Based on interviews with Iranian activists, I analyze mechanisms and aims of repressive measures. I argue that in an environment of intense transnational information exchange authoritarian regimes can monitor and respond to the activities of political exiles rapidly and on a large scale. State actors seek to undermine the links of exiles into the country (horizontal voice) as well as to punish claims to public attention that challenge the regime’s position in the domestic and international arenas (vertical voice).","Global Exclusions: Refugees, Exiles, and Migrants",Global Communication and Social Change

This study investigates how LGBTI refugees and asylum seekers, specifically gay men, navigate their identity through the interactions (mediated and interpersonal) in their pre-asylum, native homelands. Identity is produced and reproduced through social interaction. In order to answer the overall research question of identity negotiation, interviews with six self-identifying gay refugees/asylum seekers from the Middle East region, now residing in the U.S, were conducted. The gay men’s use of media was influenced by English and computer literacy. In a pre-asylum context, media were used for asylum seeking, to find information on gay culture, and to build relationships with other queers living in secret. Whereas interpersonal communication was used to find and initiate escape routes.","Global Exclusions: Refugees, Exiles, and Migrants",Global Communication and Social Change

The research aim in this paper is to examine participants’ experiences of curating images in social media. The reasoning is based on an empirical study of curated participation at the photo-sharing platform Instagram to improve the reputation of a large public hospital. The paper analyzes the conditions of participation and how employees perform the task through the lens of practice theory and Goffman’s (1959) dramaturgical theory of social life. It is argued that visual representation is foregrounded by negotiations between participants and the imagined audience. The study sheds light on the social conventions that underpin the performance of participation at visual social media platforms and point to the implications for engagement.,Visual Methods Focused on Photography,Visual Communication Studies

To promote healthy diets or design health messages in general in today’s networked, visual-oriented media environment, we need a better understanding of how visual content gets popularity. Using human rating and computer vision methods, this study examined what contributed to the visual appeal of a diversity of food photographs (N = 300), and likes and comments they received in an artificial newsfeed from participants (N = 401). The results revealed that tasty and unhealthy foods were most likely to attract likes, though certain healthy foods were able to reverse this trend. In addition, visual features, such as use of arousing colors, compositional complexity and color variety, also contributed to the popularity of food images. This work demonstrates the potential of applying computational methods in analyzing visual content, and offers insights into image virality as well as guidelines for promoting dietary choices with visual content.",Visual Methods Focused on Photography,Visual Communication Studies
2017-1639,2017,Paper Session,Habitual Media Selection and Attention to the Content During Exposure,2,"Attention to media content is one of the central intervening variables in effects research. The paper explores the barely researched influences of habitual selection and frequency of media use on attention. Media use in everyday life often is repeated frequently and selection is habit driven, thus executed with little awareness. Knowledge on whether such a low activity level during selection affects attention in the subsequent reception phase is highly relevant as it captures many everyday life usage situations. The results of two studies covering different media use behaviors – news use via TV and app, and TV series use – point to an independence of attention of habitual selection and to an inconsistent relationship with frequency. This underlines the importance to distinguish carefully between different phases of the communication process. The results shed light on the relevance of different stages of habit formation and point to complex influences of genres and platforms.",Media Choice and Selection,Mass Communication

At the same time, new media environments have been complicating the users’ task of judging the realism of media information. Against that background, our study addresses the cues and criteria on which media users base their realism assessments using an online survey of a diverse population. Based on our respondents’ assessments of a broad spectrum of realism cues, we first identify fundamental criteria underlying users’ realism judgments across media and media genres. Second, using cluster analysis we identify homogenous groups of users based on the criteria they perceive as enhancing or reducing media realism. And third, we investigate how these perception patterns relate to users’ realism assessments and use of various media and genres, media skepticism, and sociodemographic variables.",Media Choice and Selection,Mass Communication

The Role of Impulsive vs. Reflective Media Selection in Procrastinatory Media Use,3,"The pervasive access to a plethora of media options poses serious challenges to users’ self-regulatory abilities. One prevalent example of deficient self-regulation in the context of media use is procrastination, which is characterized by impulsively ‘giving in’ to readily available media options despite goal conflicts with more important tasks. The present study investigates such procrastinatory media use across three types of media (TV, computer, smartphone) from a dual-systems perspective, taking both dispositional and situational predictors into account. Results from a 14-day long diary study (N = 347) suggest that procrastinatinatory media use is largely driven by impulsive media selection, which, in turn, is facilitated by strong media habits (person level) as well as low motivation for behavioral control (situation level). Results from this study underline the unique value of a dual-systems perspective on media choices in our media-saturated environment.",Media Choice and Selection,Mass Communication
2017-1642,2017,Paper Session,"Surfing in Funland: Digital Overabundance, Media Consumption, and Choice Satisfaction",4,"In media studies, the reasons why people expose themselves to mediated content have been extensively studied. However, recent developments in the digital media environment challenge this literature. As observed in other consumption domains, the immediate availability of seductive options increases individuals’ tendency to act impulsively, in ways that do not necessarily correspond to their declared evaluations and goals. We review the main theories of media choice, highlighting the theoretical gaps that still exist when trying to explain this phenomenon. Finally, a theoretical proposal is offered, based on the role of sensational content, whose attraction power grows as overabundance increases. We argue that sensational content in overabundant environments can explain an inverse relationship between attraction for media content and the satisfaction it produces. The theoretical and policy implications of this perspective are discussed in the conclusions.",Media Choice and Selection,Mass Communication
2017-1643,2017,Paper Session,Improving First Impressions of Health Websites: The Influence of Visual Complexity on Favorable Elaboration,2,"Researchers have noted the need for more research on visual design in health communication, with particular interest in visual message features. Research provides evidence that visual complexity influences judgments of strategic messages like advertisements and websites. The present study examined two dimensions of visual complexity—feature (FC) and design (DC)—that have been theorized in the advertising literature and applied in strategic health communication research. Existing theorizing suggests that higher DC and moderate FC will result in the most positive audience evaluations. Unexpectedly, there was a linear pattern of effects for design complexity (DC) and feature complexity (FC). Considering indirect effects models, though, the present study provides evidence that visual complexity does affect positive elaboration of web content through subsequent perceptual evaluations of website content. Overall, the study offers evidence about specific mechanisms visual complexity influences that, in turn, improve people’s evaluations about website design.",Message Effects on Health Behavior and Related Outcomes (High-Density),Health Communication

Using breast cancer screening as a case example, the current study asks the following research questions: 1) To what extent are women aware of breast cancer overdiagnosis/overtreatment, and 2) How do women respond to statements about overdiagnosis/overtreatment? In other words, do they find the arguments persuasive? In 2016 we conducted a population-based survey of U.S. women aged 35-55 (N=429). Overall, we found that awareness was low and may be socially patterned by socioeconomic position. Using established methods from communication science to identify strong arguments for use in subsequent health messages, we found that most women did not find statements about overdiagnosis/overtreatment to be persuasive. Communicating about overdiagnosis/overtreatment is a pressing health communication concern; practical and theoretical implications of this study will be discussed.",Message Effects on Health Behavior and Related Outcomes (High-Density),Health Communication

Based on Construal Level Theory, we investigated if a match between temporal frame and message format could increase health message persuasion effects. The results revealed that the use of a day temporal frame accompanied with infographics can significantly enhance people’s risk perceptions, elaboration, and even health promoting behavior. Contrarily, the message effects of a year frame seemed to increase when it was used in the text-based message format.

Such interpersonal health communication is increasingly taking place on social media. We investigated whether communication mode (face-to-face vs. social media) influences people’s willingness to provide positive WOM about a health campaign. After watching a health campaign video, participants completed a questionnaire including a measure to assess their willingness to provide positive WOM (in which communication mode constituted a within-subjects factor). Results demonstrated that participants were less willing to provide positive WOM about a health campaign on social media than face-to-face. This effect appeared to be stronger for participants who judged social media to be less appropriate for endorsing health campaign videos. Perceived social risks associated with providing positive WOM did not differ between the social media and face-to-face context.

Results of path analyses support the predictive power of the model and emphasize the role of affective factors in predicting information seeking. More specifically, certain characteristics of online information are likely to increase perceived importance of climate change, which can significantly contribute to perception of personally relevant impacts and consequently motivate users to seek out additional information through the mediation effect of anxiety towards current state of knowledge. Findings of this audience study are expected to provide new insight into the improvement of climate change communication.","Information Seeking, Sharing, and Diffusion",Information Systems
2017-1652,2017,Paper Session,Exploring the Impact of Discrete Emotion on Information Seeking About Flood Risks: An Integrative Approach,1,"This present study investigates the relationships between cognitive appraisals and emotion and the impact of emotion (anger) on information seeking behavior with regard to flood risks. We develop and test an integrative model to explore how unique sets of cognitive appraisal patters are associated with anger and how anger relates to key cognitive predictors in the RISP model. Results indicated that cognitive appraisals of responsibility, personal control, certainty and importance significantly predicted emotional reactions of anger. Emotional responses of anger not only directly motivated information seeking behavior but also triggered more need for information. Informational subjective norms, information insufficiency and perceived information gathering capacity continued to serve as positive predictors of risk information seeking. Perceived knowledge and appraisals of importance exerted a direct relationship with effortful information seeking. The sense of being uncertain about what happened in terms of flooding associated with higher information sufficiency threshold. Implications for risk communication theory and practice are discussed.","Information Seeking, Sharing, and Diffusion",Information Systems

Undermatch occurs when students enroll in and attend a college or university that is less selective than their academic ability allows. Its implications are clear: due to improper information seeking strategies on the student’s part, and improper information sharing strategies on the part of college recruiters and counselors, low-income students often miss out on chances to attend more selective universities than they wind up attending. Findings of this paper indicate there is a considerable and statistically significant difference in the information seeking habits of low-income students that is not overcome by academic performance or the recruitment habits of college representatives. Low-income students reported that despite access to and contact with the same or similar sources as their high income peers, results still highlight the presence of an undermatch in high performing, low-income students.","Information Seeking, Sharing, and Diffusion",Information Systems

First, the concept of physical restraint was introduced as an important factor that influences psychological restraints. More specifically, we wondered whether physical proximity could explain how the majority of protests were held in Ferguson, yet the public demands for justice was not constrained by geographical distance. Second, we adopted the situational theory of problem solving to understand public’s psychological and motivational perceptions toward information sharing behavior in social media context. Lastly, we proposed a revised model of situational theory of problem solving in social media by focusing on the factors influencing information forwarding and sharing of the protests.","Information Seeking, Sharing, and Diffusion",Information Systems

Methods: using microblog field study, study 1 examined the relationship between microblog emotionality and information diffusion. Furthermore, using experimental design, Study 2 explored the psychological mechanism of the effect of microblog emotionality on information diffusion. Finally, Study 3 integrated the mediator and moderator into the same framework through Total Effect Moderation Model with bootstrap methods. Results: The larger the proportion of emotion words in a microblog post, the more often it was retweeted. The affective involvement, was defined as the state of arousal, totally mediated the relationship between microblog emotionality and retweet tendency. Additionally, cognitive involvement, was defined as the self-relevance of the message, moderated the relationship between emotionality and information diffusion. Specifically, in the condition of high cognitive involvement, emotionally charged messages were more likely to be retweeted. Furthermore, cognitive involvement moderated effect on the second stage of the meditation model.","Information Seeking, Sharing, and Diffusion",Information Systems

Integrating research on the two-step flow of political communication and psychological theories from the cognitive sciences, we outline a model for understanding frame strength in the two-step flow: We argue that frames that resonate with psychological biases will be transmitted to a larger extent and have stronger influence on opinion when citizens transmit elite frames in their social networks. Focusing on the case of episodic and thematic frames we test this model. We introduce a new research design for studying frame strength in the two-step communication flow, i.e. the children's' game ‘Telephone’ implemented in consecutive experimental online surveys fielded to nationally representative samples.

This journalistic practice has often been discussed as a potential democratic problem because of its effects on perceptions of and attitudes towards political issues. Taking exemplification theory as our starting point and drawing on research from decision-making literature, we add to this discussion by examining how exemplars in news reports affect people’s political participation. Using an experimental design we randomly exposed respondents to a news report with or without exemplars or no news report at all. We found that for respondents who were similar to the exemplars, exposure to a news report with exemplars triggered empathy and increased political participation. For dissimilar respondents, exposure to a news report with exemplars decreased their empathy, which in turn decreased their political participation.",Advances in Framing Effects Research,Political Communication
2017-1660,2017,Paper Session,"“Keep it Simple, Stupid”? The Effects of Rhetorical Complexity on Public Opinion",1,"Multiple studies from the past two decades document decreasing levels of complexity in parliamentary and presidential rhetoric. These studies demonstrate that politicians’ public communication becomes increasingly simple in specific political contexts, such as election campaigns and political crises, and also point to a trend of substantial simplification over time in political rhetoric. While this growing body of literature provides important insight into the political conditions that induce the presentation of simple rhetoric, the actual effects of such messages on the public have rarely been demonstrated. The current study experimentally manipulated rhetorical complexity (n=947) and examined its effects on the capacity of elite communication to (a) inform citizens and (b) persuade them. Results show that holding all else constant, complex rhetoric is both more informative and more persuasive than simple rhetoric.

Findings of an experimental study with a quota sample of 471 participants reveal that, overall, symbolic threat appeals exert stronger effects on anti-immigration attitudes than economic threat appeals. Textual symbolic threat appeals affected anti-immigration attitudes of lower-educated voters by evoking intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes. The additional presence of a stereotypical image amplifies the effects of the symbolic threat appeal and activates perceived symbolic threats, intergroup anxiety, and negative stereotypes among all individuals regardless of their education level, which resulted in stronger resentments toward immigration. Economic text appeals only affected anti-immigrant attitudes when combined with a stereotypic image via the activation of negative stereotypes. Implications of these findings are discussed.",Advances in Framing Effects Research,Political Communication
2017-1662,2017,Paper Session,Alienation in Digital Labor,3,"On the basis of a survey among 804 workers on the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that (1) alienation, a form of detachment from working life, may be present in digital workplaces in the form of powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation, and self-estrangement. Furthermore, on the basis of qualitative vignettes, we argue that (2) the perception of digital labor as alienating is not universal, perhaps because it is often wrapped in a learned narrative of entrepreneurial belonging and empowerment. Finally, on the basis of a multiple-group analysis, we propose that (3) individual mattering (high vs. low), in the form of perceived awareness, importance and reliance may be the key to explaining differences in the effect of alienating factors such as powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement on emotional exhaustion, work engagement and organizational commitment in the digital workplace.",Critical Digital Labor and Algorithmic Studies,Communication and Technology

The aim is to explore the ways in which digital platforms encourage the direct participation of audiences in the circulation and consumption of international media products, while shedding light into new and complex forms of collaboration and tensions between audiences and media industries. Through the analysis of a digital platform and interviews with volunteers that translate TV shows, this study finds that people find rewards in the personal satisfaction, social connections and recognition gained through their labor in spite of the profits that they produce for private corporations. A main objective is to look at the role of audience in relation to new models of global circulation of media products which have produced concerns because of their openly commercial nature.",Critical Digital Labor and Algorithmic Studies,Communication and Technology

Television commercials urge us to “find out our credit score” while online ads offer services promising to mitigate the effects of a low score. Although one may theorize the cultural and political impact of indebtedness in a variety of ways, I approach debt via a study of the technological mechanisms that concretely articulate it in (and to) everyday life. Taking a perspective informed by recent work in media studies, I suggest that computational systems play a central role in mediating debtor-creditor relations. More specifically, I argue that credit scores — and the computational techniques which support them — perform an essential logistical function, providing an important precondition for contemporary processes of capital accumulation, while simultaneously constituting an key avenue through which the abstract social forms of the economy are concretized within the phenomenal world of the neoliberal subject.",Critical Digital Labor and Algorithmic Studies,Communication and Technology

While there has been an explosion of research into and training materials about how to do data science, there is substantially less critical investigation into topics such as who has access to these tools, what motivations animate these uses, and the effects of such work. This essay calls for more critical work that tackles such questions; such work can be broadly described as “data studies.” To clarify and organize these questions, the paper imports and adapts Harold Lasswell’s model of communication—who, says what, to whom, in what medium, with what effect—to create a model for data studies research. The study illustrates this model with an interdisciplinary survey of some of the relevant work to date, proposing a means of organizing this work and of prompting future research questions.",Critical Digital Labor and Algorithmic Studies,Communication and Technology

The extant literature suggests that deception is a salient issue for new online relationships, but it is unclear how often lies permeate the conversations before daters meet face-to-face. We collected mobile dating conversations and approximately 20% of all messages sent to a partner were rated as deceptive. Further, approximately one third of lies were used to avoid social interactions with the date, while other deceptions were about personal interests and daily activities. Participants also rated 18% of their partner’s messages as potentially deceptive and lies contained themes about availability management and the sincerity of compliments. Finally, we observed that the participant’s rate of lying was highly correlated with the number of messages from their partner that they rated as lies. These data suggest that mobile dating conversations present a fruitful domain to evaluate deception in computer-mediated communication.",Digital Deception,Communication and Technology

The 10 most realistic scenarios, based on a pilot study, were selected for the main study, in which students rated their preference for, the attributed motive (altruistic vs. selfish), and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the deceptions described. The main findings of this study indicate: (1) Students prefer to use computer-mediated channels of communication when engaging in deceptive behaviors with their teachers, although this medium was not perceived as more effective for successfully using deception, and (2) students perceive altruistically motivated lies as more appropriate than selfishly motivated lies in both computer-mediated communication channels and face-to-face channels.

The results implicate the use of cognitive shortcuts triggered by the cues afforded in Facebook’s interface. Individuals appeared to be using the phisher’s friend count as a heuristic for judging the authenticity of a level-1 request. They, thus, responded to a phisher displaying a large friend count even in the absence of a profile picture. Interestingly, the affordance of smartphones used to access social media—an issue that has received little academic attention—increased the odds of considering such requests sevenfold.",Digital Deception,Communication and Technology

Limited research has, however, explicated the CRB construct. The current research redresses this. Using a series of sequential studies, the research develops a valid measure for CRB and examines whether it predicts how people deal with a suspected spearphishing email—a critical behavior of interest to cyber security researchers that remains unexamined. Findings suggest that people’s CRB are not based on factual knowledge but are grounded in cyber security self-efficacy. Consequently, people with poor CRB are cavalier in their reactions to suspicious spearphishing emails—which significantly enhances their likelihood of victimization.",Digital Deception,Communication and Technology

In this study, we investigate what individual-level differences shaped New York City residents’ dependency on media for information that facilitated making sense of the recent economic crisis. Guided by media system dependency theory as well as information seeking behavior research, we examine three determinants of dependency: (a) perceived economic threat, (b) financial literacy, and (c) individuals’ coping strategies. We study how these variables, independently and in interaction, shape individuals’ dependency on local communication resources (i.e., newspapers, radio and television, Internet-based information resources including social networking sites). Participants (N = 338) were recruited into an online survey. Logistic and OLS regressions showed that although socio-economic factors and threat are important determinants of media dependency, the combined and understudied roles of financial literacy and individuals’ preferred coping strategies in dependency can be critical.","Issues in Crisis, Risk, Disaster Comunication Research",Mass Communication
2017-1671,2017,Paper Session,"Distilling Crises as Entertainment: The Depiction of the Ukraine, Eurozone, and Refugee Crises in Political Comedy",2,"The news media’s coverage of international crises has often been criticized for taking a predominantly national perspective, resorting to official sources (indexing-thesis) and supporting the position of the own government (rally-effect). However, also political comedy shows take up on international crises. Since they follow a different logic than the news media they might provide a different picture of a crisis. This study examines how political comedy covers the Ukraine, Euro, and refugee crises and how the crisis frames correspond to the news media’s logic. To this end, three German shows were analyzed between 2014 and 2016. Findings reveal that the shows adopt the national perspective of the news media and tend to index the range of crisis frames used by them. With respect to the evaluation of the frames clear differences relate to the causal interpretations and blame attributions that are largely directed towards the own nation in the shows.","Issues in Crisis, Risk, Disaster Comunication Research",Mass Communication

A survey finds that the effect of exposure extensity on personal risk is stronger than that of exposure frequency, and the effect of exposure frequency on social risk is stronger than that of exposure extensity. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived response-efficacy negatively predict personal risk, and the effect of perceived response-efficacy on social risk is stronger than that of perceived self-efficacy. The moderation effect of prior experience in predicting personal risk by exposure extensity and self-efficacy is confirmed, while the moderation effect of personal relevance in predicting risk perception by exposure extensity and self-efficacy is not found.","Issues in Crisis, Risk, Disaster Comunication Research",Mass Communication

Nuclear energy is beneficial to society in many ways but also comes with a certain probability to be detrimental. The empirical risk of this study considers these “positive” and “negative” sides of the technology when studying how the coverage of this technology looks. By applying this model to a period of five years of coverage the different risk dimensions help picturing changing media coverage and a phase pattern in the coverage. This risk attention phase model is not only relevant to show how media coverage changes over time and is influenced by detrimental events such as Fukushima, but it also carries important evidence considering the political phase model. Moreover this innovative way to study risk holds promising solutions to some of the field’s struggles, e.g. the disadvantage of non-comparable risk coverage studies.","Issues in Crisis, Risk, Disaster Comunication Research",Mass Communication
2017-1674,2017,Paper Session,A Primary Definer Online: The Construction and Propagation of a Think Tank’s Authority on Social Media,2,"Abstract:

Who has power in the construction of economic news in the UK? Are social media reshaping how this power is enabled? We examine the public Twitter interactions between journalists, political elites, and what is arguably the UK’s most important think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), during the 2015 UK general election campaign. Combining human-coded content analysis and network analysis of Twitter discourse about the IFS during a 38-day period, we explain how and why the authority of this think tank is being translated to social media. We develop a new, social media theory of ‘primary definers’ and show how the political authority on which such roles rest is co-constructed and propagated by professional journalists and political elites. Central to this process is a behaviour we conceptualize and measure: authority signalling. Our findings call into question some of the more sanguine generalizations about social media’s contribution to pluralist democracy. Given the dominance of public service broadcasters in the processes we identify, we argue that, despite the growth of social media, there can be surprising limits on the extent to which contemporary media systems help citizens gain information about the assumptions underlying economic policy.

Political will and public will are crucial elements of social change efforts. This article details a process for public administrators, public and nonprofit administrators, and other change agents to use in analyzing and subsequently building political will and public will. The framework provides guidance about when and how to engage with different publics. Four basic tasks, based on formal conceptual definitions of political will and public will, make up this framework for analysis and action. These tasks are: stakeholder identification, assessment of stakeholder views of problems and solutions, alignment of problem and solution definitions, and the building of firm commitments and mutual accountability. The process is often iterative.

Instead of describing them as fully rational players, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes an alternative view of interest organizations by characterizing them as actors that are also dependent on their institutional environment. The basic assumption of this framework is that there is no unidirectional relationship between motives and structures and online activities. Instead, there is a dynamic interplay of motives, structures, environmental conditions, and online communication. Against this theoretical background, we discuss findings from an interview study of the online communications of interest organizations in healthcare and environment policy fields. The aim of this study was not to resolve the debate on whether political organizations communicate “strategically” or not. Instead, we examined the “black box” of organizations in order to understand the motivational and structural dynamics that constitute the organizations’ online communication.",Understanding and Advising Organizations in Their PR Efforts,Political Communication

By using well-established theoretical approaches of communication research, such as the influence of presumed influence approach, this study examined to what extent subjective perceptions of German political PR practitioners contribute to explaining their professional social media activities. The results of a standardized survey (N = 1,067) indicate: the more political PR practitioners thought that other political PR practitioners use Facebook and Twitter, and the more Facebook and Twitter were perceived as influencing other practitioners, the more often the respondents used social media. In contrast, the presumed reach among politicians, journalists, and citizens, as well as presumed influences on these groups had no effects on their activities. These findings suggest that the practitioners’ social media activities are rather driven by an in-group orientation toward their colleagues and less by strategic considerations referring to external stakeholders.",Understanding and Advising Organizations in Their PR Efforts,Political Communication

I will argue that not only is this practice significant and important for the women producing the images for creating subjectivity for themselves, but also for creating images that push back against usual media stereotypes and presenting these women as subjects rather than objects, openly available for consumption.",For (All) the Times of Your Life: Photo-Sharing Platforms,Visual Communication Studies
2017-1683,2017,Paper Session,App Features That Fulfill Parents’ Needs in Apps for Children,3,"Parents play a prominent role in selecting apps for their children. When it comes to app-selection for young children (3-7), parents are looking to fulfill particular needs. Although these needs highlight what parents want, they do not reflect the specific characteristics of apps (e.g. features) that parents are looking for. Guided by theory, it is likely that parents’ needs relate to specific features within apps. Interviews (n=20) revealed 23 features in apps for children that parents believe are important. A subsequent survey (n=591) showed that parents suggest that in general, (1) apps should have clear design, (2) apps should incorporate tailored, educational content that can be controlled, (3) apps should include appropriate challenges and rewards, and (4) apps should make use of technological innovation. Further analysis showed that, as U&G predicts, parents’ needs relate to their most important app-features.

This study examines mobile communication among parents and teens, testing the relationship between various motivations for mobile communication, family function, and relational closeness. A survey of 504 U.S. parents and their teen children indicates that mobile ICTs are used for developmentally specific purposes in parent-teen relationships. Multiple parenting factors (e.g., parenting style or involvement) predicted family outcomes, consistent with previous research. However, family function and closeness were negatively predicted by use of mobile ICTs to express support, and positively predicted by use of the devices to handle parent-child conflict. In this regard, mobile ICTs become a means for teens to establish independence from parents, thereby contributing to both parties’ perceptions of family function and closeness.",In the Palm of My Hand: Mobile Media Throughout Childhood & Adolescence,Children Adolescents and the Media

After substantiating the interrelated concepts of corporate elitism and groupthink, the study offers the experimental findings that in companies characterized by corporate elitism, the groupthink phenomenon comes to mediate decision-making and desensitize organizational empathy in a crisis. The study has values in theory and practice. Firstly, it identifies the precise source of the dynamics behind an organization’s prone-ness to crisis, asking to what degree these dynamics are impacted by an organization’s operational infrastructure, its managerial culture or its communications systems. Secondly, it offers empirical analysis of the ways that key components of organizational empathy are either activated or suspended in cognitive, affective and behavioral terms during organizational crises.

2017-1689,2017,Paper Session,Pairing Organizational and Individual Factors to Improve Employees’ Risk Readiness,2,"Employee health and safety are the centerpiece of organizational stability. Particularly within organizations whose function mandates the careful management of risk, there is considerable attention placed on training workers to respond to workplace hazards. Yet focusing on ways to improve employee training neglects the complexity of other influences on employees’ risk readiness—the state of having both the efficacy and willingness to appropriately respond to risks. In this study, we surveyed employees at a Southern U.S. oil refinery. Our integrated model adapts and tests prior health communication models and demonstrates that individual and organizational-level variables significantly predict all three factors of risk readiness: risk information seeking, self-efficacy, and risk knowledge. All three factors of risk readiness explain significantly more variance in our proposed model than either individual or organizational-level variables alone. Furthermore, organizations can positively impact workers’ risk readiness if they improve the availability and accessibility of safety-related information.","Crisis, Risk and Reliability in Organizational Communication",Organizational Communication

Numerous studies conclude that the engagement, dialogic and social affordances of social media have not yet been realized. But despite the lack of direct interaction, active audiences are, by their own actions in social media, taking part in DPL since audiences do not only receive political messages but contribute significantly with their own user-generated content.

The results show that most of the communications work is actually performed by the audiences, and not by the parties themselves.

An experimental study tests how the type and timeliness of responses to public accusations against a CEO affect the audience’s propensity to prejudge the CEO, and the degree of residual stain after public rehabilitation of the CEO. Crisis responses only marginally influenced the extent of prejudgment and residual stain. Quick and substantial responses led to stronger prejudgments, CEO resignation led to higher residual stain. Substantial crisis responses were obviously interpreted as implicit admission of guilt, leading to negative thoughts about the case, the CEO, and the climate of opinion. The study highlights that (1) the ability to curb prejudgments by picking appropriate crisis responses is limited; (2) there is high ambiguity when categorizing crises into types; (3) accounting for ambiguity in attribution of responsibility is essential to improve theories of crisis communication.",Interventions in Political and Government Relations,Public Relations

The influences of agenda indexing are also discussed with regard to different media profiles. A quantitative content analysis was conducted to examine the influence of Polish and Russian government messages from presidents and prime ministers regarding the Smolensk plane crash on media coverage in both counties. Newspapers were categorized by political profile representing pro government, mainstream, or opposition profile. Nearly all of the hypotheses were fully supported for the first, second, and third level of agenda building. Results of this study demonstrate that political public relations’ success and agenda indexing can be affected by a medium’s political profile, particularly in the case of opposition media. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed along with areas of future research.",Interventions in Political and Government Relations,Public Relations
2017-1697,2017,Paper Session,Who Sets the Political Agenda? Applying the Network Agenda-Setting Model to Twitter,2,"Based on the network agenda-setting (NAS) model, this research aims to reveal the links between agendas in the domains of politics and media. Also referred to as the third level of agenda-setting theory, the NAS model suggests that the salience of the network relationships among issues can be transferred from the news media to the public. The model draws on the potential offered by network analysis, therefore enables the analysis of issues as a bundle. This exploratory research carries the NAS model to Twitter, and expands its context to include the political agenda. It questions whether the media in Turkey can still have an effect on political discourse in a setting where direct political pressure is a growing issue of concern. Findings from the Twitter accounts of the MPs in the Turkish Parliament and a large variety media accounts are compared to explore the interrelations among the domains of politics and media.",Advances in Network Analysis,Computational Methods
2017-1698,2017,Paper Session,Hybrid Contagion: Theoretical and Practical Implications for Communication Campaigns,2,"Simple contagion and complex contagion explain two different diffusion phenomena in social networks. These two contagions have been studied separately and the dichotomy simplifies the real word scenarios, where simple and complex contagions can go parallel. Previous literature has not considered the interactions of simple and complex contagions and suggests that in order to spread effortful behaviors, we may need to reconfigure people’s social network to make it highly clustered. This strategy is not practical or is too costly in real life settings. We propose a model that can solve the problem of complex contagion’s failure in random networks. We propose a new model, hybrid contagion, to allow a simple contagion (i.e., message diffusion) to enable a complex contagion in highly randomized networks. Practically, instead of suggesting reconfiguring social networks, our findings suggest that we can design strategic communication campaigns to maximize complex contagions through randomized social networks.",Advances in Network Analysis,Computational Methods

Massive demonstrations, protests, riots, and shifts in public opinion respond to the coordinating potential of communication networks – which are now pervasive and constantly pulsating with information. Here, we propose a model that aims to analyze the contagion dynamics that take place in networks when recurrent activation is allowed, that is, when actors can repeatedly engage in action. Recurrent activation relaxes one of the main assumptions made by previous theoretical models where activation is assumed to be a one-off event; and it offers, we argue, a more accurate approximation to how social influence unfolds in most empirical settings, especially when communication is mediated by digital technologies. Our results show that, under recurrent activation, network topology has counter-intuitive effects on coordination dynamics that are overseen by previous approaches to contagion in networks.",Advances in Network Analysis,Computational Methods

To what degree is unplanned group communication predictable? We use established measures from Shannon’s ‘mathematical theory of communication’ to quantify the limits of predictability of spontaneous group communication in 38 large-scale online collaboration projects. Big databases enable us to calculate entropies and entropy rates. We find that most structure is contained in dyads of two consecutive interventions. Systematically considering longer conversational motifs, we find that the next intervention can potentially be predicted with up to 75 – 90 % accuracy. We present a methodology that shows that about three quarters of this predictability stems from differences in participation frequency, and the remaining quarter originates in particularities of the temporal sequence.",Advances in Network Analysis,Computational Methods
2017-1701,2017,Paper Session,"""Social Hypergraph Analysis"": Towards an Operationalisation of Actor-Network Theory Using Hypergraphs",4,"Despite its wide-ranging influence in social science, the field of actor-network theory (ANT) has proven difficult to operationalise quantitatively. Although social network analysis (SNA) and ANT appear to share certain affinities (e.g., the term ‘network’), attempts to develop an ANT approach to SNA (and vice versa) have stumbled upon fundamental problems or ‘discontinuities’ between them (Venturini, Munk, and Jacomy, 2016). These problems constitute serious obstacles for progressing ANT research using digital data. In this paper, we propose hypergraphs as one way forward to operationalising ANT. Broadly, we term this method ‘social hypergraph analysis’ (SHA). We outline SHA in this paper and apply it to analyse social media data, using a case study of the anti-vaccination debate on Twitter.

Social media data provide us with trace representations of ordered social life. Yet the order we impose on these data has important consequences for how we come to understand, interpret, and model the ‘social’. Nowadays, it is common to reconstruct social media data as networks, using a mathematical formalism (graph theory) that squeezes reality into pairwise relationships (edges) between human and non-human objects (vertices). For example, a friendship network is a type of undirected graph, where the existence of an edge between “John” and “Sally” denotes that they are friends. The World Wide Web provides a well-known example of a directed graph, where a webpage may contain a hyperlink to another webpage, although this relationship is not necessarily reciprocated.

Whilst graphs provide a practical structure and formalism for analysing data as networks, the order that they impose upon the data can be problematic. For social phenomena in particular, interactions between entities are often complex and supra-dyadic, involving more than two actors, and taking place in the context of multi-user groups (Heintz and Chandra, 2015). From a computational perspective, we know that graphs can result in unexpected information loss, which impacts upon algorithm performance and output (Zhou, Huang, and Scholkopf, 2010). A solution to this problem has been to model complex networks as hypergraphs (Estrada and Rodríguez-Velázquez, 2005). Broadly speaking, hypergraphs are generalisations of graphs, whereby an edge, or ‘hyperedge’, can connect more than two vertices. This provides the ability to represent complex relationships between entities unambiguously compared to graphs. In other words, hypergraphs capture higher order relations between entities—not only binary, but also N-ary relations that reflect the supra-dyadic dynamics of many social processes. This more relaxed structure of hypergraphs offers a precious resource for operationalising key social theories, such as ANT, computationally.

Recently, ANT scholars have resurrected Tarde’s ancient theory of the ‘monad’, showing how a ‘monadological’ approach can provide powerful new insights into digital trace data (Latour et al., 2012). Yet an unsolved problem is how to coherently and practically implement a ‘monadological’ approach to network analysis and visualisation, given the discontinuities between SNA and ANT (see Venturini et al., 2016). It seems that a key aspect of these problems stems from the ontological constraints inherited from graph theory, that is, the social order it imposes upon data-qua-networks.

We contend that hypergraphs provide surprising affinities and continuities with ANT. All actors in the network (human and non-human) are considered equal; they are granted the same level of importance and ontological status. People, words, objects, buildings, institutions, and so forth, are all assembled as vertices in the network. Proceeding from this, we are able to differentiate and trace associations between entities by assembling them within hyperedges that represent different kinds of relationships and processes. Such an approach implicitly dethrones the privileged status of humans as the only entities capable of ‘acting’ in the network (read: having agency). It is perfectly reasonable that non-human vertices, such as institutions or hashtags, have a more “stronger, wider and longer lasting associations” in the network (Latour et al., 2012, p. 591). Rather than preconceived notions of ‘structure’ we are led to consider “differently conceived wholes” (Latour et al., 2012, p. 592) composed of heterogeneous entities who are mutually co-defined through their hyperedge relationships. Thus, we can learn about entities in the network not via a separate stratum of ‘node-level attributes’, but by tracing associations through the intersecting hyperedges of the network. Indeed, it is this kind of navigational practice that has been recently operationalised within ANT through Tarde’s idea of the ‘monad’: “A monad is not a part of a whole, but a point of view on all the other entities taken severally and not as a totality” (Latour et al., 2012, p. 598). It is the complex, traceable, and quantifiable interrelations of hyperedges that defines the identities and roles of entities in the network.

To position and illustrate these ideas further, we outline an alternative form of SNA using hypergraphs, which we term social hypergraph analysis (SHA). We provide examples and preliminary findings from a project where we apply SHA to study the anti-vaccination debate on Twitter.

importance to scholars of social movements, contentious politics, and political behavior
generally. However, little prior work has systematically addressed the role of images in
mobilizing participation in social movements. We theorize that images are more easily
processed than text, lowering the cost of deciding to participate in a social movement. In
addition, images might trigger emotional responses, increase expectations of success, and
generate collective identity - all leading to greater mobilization. We test these theories
through a study of Black Lives Matter, utilizing both observational and experimental
data. We find that both images in general and the proposed key attributes of images
contribute to online participation. Our paper thus provides evidence supporting the broad

2017-1703,2017,Paper Session,Wearable Cameras and Contagion: Spreading Embodied Images of Violence,1,"The emergence of small digital cameras that can in some way be fastened or tethered to the body has facilitated a number of “life-logging” practices, or the ability to capture and store the accumulative moments of daily life. These technologies create “embodied images,” or images that ask the spectator to assume a particular perspective in order to simulate a memory or experience. This presentation examines how these technologies also allow for the capture and transmission of violent images. It uses the case study of the on-air execution of two journalists in August 2015 to argue that the dissemination of personal images can be at once devastating, shocking, and empowering. The conjunction of wearable cameras, cloud storage, and social media offer the possibilities for violence to be confronted and understood in potentially new dimensions of mediation, while also illustrating the ways in which the histories of cameras and guns continue to be intertwined.",Images and Social Media,Communication and Technology

Based on media events theory, the results of this quantitative visual analysis (N = 1,000) suggest Instagram users interrupted their routines when they posted images referencing the shooting rather than the selfies or personal photos typically characterizing Instagram’s content. The study also found that most posts originated from outside France immediately after the incident, while French users largely posted days after the incident. Moreover, while it is the Instagram norm to post original photos, users from outside France used unoriginal images already circulating on social media. The study adds to the current literature on media events theory by analyzing online visual reactions from Instagram users during the Charlie Hebdo attacks.",Images and Social Media,Communication and Technology

For instance, the mechanisms that account for this association have not yet been examined. To address this gap, the present study explores the underlying role of closeness to friends in the relationship between Instagram use and adolescents’ well-being. A two-wave longitudinal panel study (NTime1 = 1,840) was set up; participants filled out a paper-and-pencil survey twice with six months in between. Structural equation modeling showed that Instagram use at Time 1 positively predicted adolescents’ depressed mood at Time 2. In addition, adolescents’ closeness to friends mediated this relationship: Instagram use at Time 1 positively predicted closeness to friends at Time 2, which, in turn, was negatively related to adolescents’ depressed mood at Time 2. Hence, if Instagram use is capable to stimulate closeness to friends, using Instagram can be beneficial for adolescents’ well-being.",Images and Social Media,Communication and Technology

A total of 389 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The findings revealed that elevated viewers reported high levels of prosocial motivations, and the motivations were positively related to behavioral intentions to promote the inspiring media. Those exposed to UGC reported greater levels of perceived authenticity—perceiving that media characters’ behaviors and interactions are genuine—than those viewing company-sponsored media.

The present study examined whether comments on video sharing platforms can also influence the emotional reactions toward entertaining videos. This question is especially relevant with regard to meaningful video material that has been shown to increase prosocial motivation and reduce stereotypes by eliciting the emotional experience of elevation. In a 3x2x2 between-subjects online experiment (N = 732), we varied type of video (unity of humankind, portrayals of human kindness, funny control videos) and content (positive vs. neutral vs. negative comments) as well as internationality (English vs international comments) of peer reactions. Results demonstrate that peer comments indeed alter the emotional effects of the video clip, with negative comments leading to a reduced sense of elevation.

To gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between social surveillance and envy, we investigated whether depression is a risk factor for engaging in social surveillance and, in turn, experiencing envy; and this pattern persists over time. A two-wave panel survey conducted over a year with a German sample shows that (1) depression predicts Facebook surveillance which in turn predicts envy; (2) the relationship between depression, Facebook surveillance, and envy is stable over time, appearing identically at time1 and time2; but (3) envy experienced at time 1 does not aggravate depression experienced a year later.",Emotion and Social Media,Mass Communication

There is a need for more research that considers individual differences in readers and how they evaluate sources of news information and comments. This experiment will consider the individual’s news media literacy and involvement with the news topic as potential predictors of how well the individual separates their assessment of the credibility of the comment from the credibility of the news source. The researchers will also manipulate the strength of the arguments the commenters see in order to determine whether the strength of the comment argument could influence the perceived credibility of the comment source.

Instead of deliberative debate and participation, some comment sections indicate a rather one-sided expression of opinion, often paired with a high level of incivility. Past research offers several approaches explaining comment quality through sociotechnical, cultural, or news factors. Our study, in contrast, examines the effects of users' personality traits (Big5, Dark Tetrad) and states (cognitive/affective involvement) on the deliberativeness and civility of user comments on news websites, using a multi-method approach. Results show that, consistent to previous research, personality traits like everyday sadism or extraversion impact comments' civility, while socio-cognitive involvement affects deliberativeness. Thus, writing (non-)deliberative and (un-)civil comments partly seems to be “a personal matter”. The key variable to understand the emergence of specific commenting behavior, however, seems to be the specific type of situational involvement triggered by specific kinds of news stories and comments.",User Comments and Feedback,Information Systems

Drawing on ideas from the spiral of silence theory, exemplification research, and studies on social information effects, we contend that individuals use popularity cues such as likes as sources for assessing public opinion. We further argue that individuals may even adapt their personal opinions to the tenor reflected in those cues. The assumptions were tested using data from an online experiment with 501 participants who encountered media items with varying numbers of likes for two controversial issues. Findings show that only individuals with low levels of need for cognition are likely to use likes as indicators of public opinion.

However, actual sales of green products have not been increasing, which may be attributed to consumers a priori biases toward green products. Such products are often perceived as lower quality than their non-green counterparts. Providing information on green products may help overcome such biases. Recommendations from other consumers can be especially helpful here, because they have been shown to be the most trustworthy source of information for consumers. However, literature investigating the role of green product reviews is scarce. Hence, this paper is looking at the role of review exposure, valence and volume in purchase probability of green versus non-green products.

While vloggers are legally obliged to disclose this sponsorship, they can decide how they want to disclose it. These disclosures may vary in terms of modality (audiovisual vs. textual) and explicitness (implicit vs. explicit). Yet, knowledge about how these two concepts affect consumers’ behavior is scarce. Accordingly, this study examines the roles of the modality and explicitness of disclosures of sponsored vlogs on YouTube on consumers’ online brand engagement. An experiment demonstrates that text-based (vs. audiovisual) disclosures lead to lower engagement intentions because they increase consumers’ persuasion knowledge. Moreover, the explicitness of a disclosure moderates this process: for audiovisual disclosures, explicit disclosures can decrease consumers’ persuasion knowledge, but not for text-based disclosures.

We recently have shown (authors, 2016) that when research participants were allowed to bring something to the lab to occupy their controlled attention, such as books to read or phones to use to send text messages, orienting responses to re-occurring jingles and production effects did not habituate. This was as predicted since having subjects focus on a specific central task subsequently influences how they process background audio stimuli (Hughes et al., 2013; Halin et al., 2015; Sörqvist & Marsh, 2015).
Still the work of Hughes et al.

Recently, news organizations promoted mobile and personal computer applications that enable push notifications for breaking news alerts. In the United States, over 60 % of adults use the Internet to watch videos (Olmstead, Mitchell, Holcomb & Vogt, 2014). Among them, 36% watch news videos (Olmstead et al., 2014). With diversification of news format, and despite their best intentions, viewers are still missing key visuals, such as push notifications and alerts (Cunningham, 2016).

2017-1720,2017,Paper Session,How Different Visual Metaphors Influence Resource Allocation and Memory for Advertisements,4,"In previous research (Authors, in press), we explored how two structures of visual metaphor (juxtaposition and fusion) influence cognitive resource allocation and recall memory for advertisements. However, because an immediate recognition test yielded a ceiling effect, no insights emerged into how these visual structures differ with respect to recognition memory. Because secondary task reaction time (STRT) measures resources allocated to encoding, and recognition memory is also an indicator of the extent to which a stimulus was encoded, this leaves a gap in the literature. Here, we report the results of two studies meant to address this gap. The first study (N=43) is a direct replication using the same STRT paradigm and adding a third visual structure (replacement) for additional comparison. The second study (N=150) explores recognition memory for all three structures of visual metaphor using a delayed recognition task. Results generally support the previous finding that fusion images require more sustained resource allocation. Recognition memory is influenced not only by the type of visual metaphor but also by whether a target or foil is being recognized. These results are discussed in terms of implications for both visual cognition and advertising.",Attention and Divided Attention,Information Systems

As a result, interface features can affect users’ automatic resource allocation to a specific content associated with the feature. 279 participants were exposed to three travel websites at various levels of interface complexity. The secondary task reaction time and recognition memory tests were administered to indicate resource allocation and encoding respectively. Participants responded slower when looking at websites with high levels of complexity compared to those with moderate and low levels.

The present study examined enjoyment and signal detection memory outcomes in single-task and dual-task experimental conditions, where the primary task was watching positive, negative, and neutral television content, and the dual task condition permitted participants to go online on a second screen. Results demonstrate that multitasking viewing situations had negative effects on enjoyment and memory for neutral, but not on emotional primary task television messages, contrary to prediction.

The current study investigates the extent to which citizens make fine distinctions between scientists’ domain of expertise under conditions in which it may be difficult to do so. We use eye movements to determine the extent to which citizens retrieve, from their memories, professional facts about scientists that signal their level of expertise. We also employ self-report measures of memory retrieval. Our results indicate a dissociation between our two measures: eye movements reveal that citizens are more likely to access professional facts about experts than non-experts while self-reports indicate that they access them at similar rates. Our results suggest that citizens do discern expert from non-expert sources and self-report measures may underestimate the degree to which citizens access professional facts about scientists.",Attention and Divided Attention,Information Systems
2017-1725,2017,Paper Session,"How We Use Media Matters: The Relationship Between Media Automaticity, Media Multitasking, and Attention",1,"Media psychologists have argued that the ubiquity of media technologies makes unique demands on human cognitive systems and may fundamentally change certain processes over time, including attention. Attention research to date has particularly focused on screen media use and media multitasking, though evidence of effects is mixed and sometimes contradictory. The present research suggests several approaches to the study of media effects on attention that may help to clarify and strengthen research going forward. The first suggestion is theoretical: research should focus on how individuals use media (cognitive processes), rather than more narrowly focusing on amount of media used. Specifically, we emphasize media multitasking and a distinction between reflective and automatic media uses, which may have different attention outcomes. The second suggestion is methodological: attention performance should be assessed using behavioral task measures when possible and such data should be analyzed with respect for data distributions. Two studies are proposed.",Attention and Divided Attention,Information Systems

Drawing on focus group interviews, we find that people see many benefits to sharing information online, but also recognize that not all sharing may be in their interest. Disincentives to sharing include skepticism, distrust, and fears of discrimination and online harassment. Decisions about sharing are related to the information type, the context in which information is revealed, and the institution to which they are – or think they are – providing information. Significantly, many participants were mistrustful of both governmental and corporate actors. Participants displayed both awareness of privacy risks and resignation towards privacy violations, suggesting that they perceived little control over their ability to protect their privacy, which may influence their privacy behaviors.",Trust and Tradeoffs for Online Privacy,Communication and Technology
2017-1727,2017,Paper Session,"The Privacy Trade-Off in Mobile Apps: The Roles of Intrusiveness, App Value, and Privacy Concerns",1,"During the past years, personal data has become the currency for app users to pay for various mobile services, such as social networking or entertainment apps. Although this new “reimbursement-system” might jeopardize app users’ online privacy, there is a dearth of research on the cognitive dynamics that drive app users’ decisions to accept an app’s terms of use, thereby sharing information with the app. Drawing on privacy calculus theory, we conducted an online experiment among 687 app users to investigate the effects of app intrusiveness and app value perceptions, as well as interactions of these two variables with privacy concerns, on app users’ intention to accept an app’s terms of use. The results demonstrated that app users seem to engage in a privacy trade-off, but only when the app in question is of low value to the user. In that case, app users with low privacy concerns base their decision to accept the app’s terms of use on how intrusive that app is. Highly concerned users, on the other hand, do not intend to accept regardless of how intrusive the low value app is. However, when the app in question is of high value to the user, app value seems to overrule any influence of app intrusiveness and privacy concerns in the decision making process.",Trust and Tradeoffs for Online Privacy,Communication and Technology
2017-1728,2017,Paper Session,The Role of Habits and Prior Experience in Motivating User Cybersecurity Behavior,5,"Numerous communication initiatives have attempted to help inform computer users and motivate them to better digital safety practices. Extending protection motivation theory (PMT), the effects of the role of protection habit strength as well as previous experiences with online security threats were incorporated into a causal model that included both protection motivation intentions and current safety behaviors. This model was tested using a survey of 988 MTurk workers. Previous experiences with common security threats were directly related to perceptions of threat vulnerability and threat severity and also to beliefs in response efficacy. Partial least squares analysis among PMT variables showed habits were strong predictors of protective behaviors (β = 0.44, p < .001). The model explained 37 percent of the variance in protection motivation and 24 percent of the variance in protective behaviors. Experiences with common online security violations were significantly related to perceptions of threat vulnerability and threat severity.",Trust and Tradeoffs for Online Privacy,Communication and Technology

The federal court case of Ross William Ulbricht, Silk Road's architect and executive operator, constitutes the core of my source material, along with Ulbricht's online statements. I argue that Silk Road represented an aggressively capitalist mode of exchange, marked by an absence of state economic regulation, a lack of status codes, an ineffective reputation system, and a resulting deluge of blackmail, scam, coercion, and monopoly. Contrary to its founder's vision of a libertarian utopia, the digital in free market in contraband was plagued with fraudulent economic practices, underwritten by a market logic that exploited the site's unique infrastructure. The salient principle of economic relationality on Silk Road was not cooperation and freedom but deception and intimidation.",Technology Studies,Communication and Technology
2017-1731,2017,Paper Session,TerrorTube: Algorithms and Islamic State on YouTube,1,"Algorithms play a major role in our experience of YouTube. For example, the platform’s algorithms recommended videos that YouTube decides will be of interest to a user. These automatically play for most people. Surprisingly, this is also true with the recommendation of content produced by Islamic State (ISIS). A key purpose of this study is to explore what role YouTube’s recommender algorithm plays in directing users to ISIS-related content. To investigate this question, a social network analysis of a YouTube video network consisting of 15,021 videos (nodes) and 190,087 recommendations between them (edges) was conducted. There is a need to understand what role YouTube’s black boxed algorithms play in terms of determining whether viewers are recommended radical content from both non-ISIS and ISIS videos. This case study reveals that the terror organization is benefiting from the ways in which their content is being proactively recommended by YouTube’s algorithms, particularly and non-English language contexts.",Technology Studies,Communication and Technology

In Study 1 (N = 3375) we use a novel method for eliciting metaphors for how people understand the Facebook News Feed and Twitter. In Study 2 (N = 1547) we used factor analysis to aggregate these metaphors into underlying folk theories for both Facebook and Twitter. In Study 3 (N = 1597) we replicate the factor analysis from Study 2 and examine the semantic dimensions for each of the folk theories across these two cyber-social systems, finding that there are four primary folk theories that people hold for the News Feed and Twitter: the rational assistant, the unwanted observer, the transparent platform and the corporate black box. The implications of identifying and understanding these folk theories for these cyber-social systems are discussed.",Technology Studies,Communication and Technology
2017-1734,2017,Paper Session,"Disgust, Need for Affect, and Responses to Microbiome Research",5,"Contributing to the literature on affective processing and attitude formation, this study investigates the effects of a discrete emotion (disgust) and an emotional disposition (need for affect) in the context of microbiome research. Specifically, the investigation aims to unpack how need for affect, the motivation to approach or avoid emotions, moderates the emotional pathway from disgust-eliciting content to support for regulation. Data from a Web-based experiment (N=1005) showed that experienced disgust mediated the effect of disgust-eliciting information on support for regulation. This mediation was moderated by need for affect, with the locus of moderation residing in the relationship between experienced disgust and support for regulation, but not that between message exposure and experienced disgust. Furthermore, the two dimensions of need for affect (emotion approach and emotion avoidance) played different moderating roles such that emotional approach amplified the disgust-attitude relationship whereas emotional avoidance attenuated it.",Not-So-Good-Feelings in Media Consumption,Mass Communication
2017-1735,2017,Paper Session,Effects of Guilt Inducement on Subsequent Media Behavior: Lessons From Two Studies,4,"Media use may elicit guilt as an unpleasant moral emotion. We assume that when media users are induced with guilt, they will strive to compensate for this feeling by trying to re-instate their moral self. Based on approaches on moral management, namely moral cleansing and moral licensing, we analyze how media users react towards guilt induced via media use. We present findings from two studies: In study 1 we focus on guilt induced through racist online comments and observe subsequent action of political sub-activism. In study 2, we induced guilt through violence in a video game environment and analyze the procedural character of guilt management through evaluation of other peoples’ online profile. Results for both studies demonstrate the nature of guilt inducement in and through media, but did not find effects on subsequent behavior.

2017-1736,2017,Paper Session,"Grossed-Out Givers: Inoculation, Reactance, and Disgust-Eliciting Charitable Appeals",3,"Disgust is often elicited in prosocial messages to capture attention, convey the realities of an issue, and motivate action. However, discrete emotion theories suggest disgust feelings trigger a desire to distance oneself from the object of disgust. This distancing could lead to unintended outcomes like issue avoidance and reactance. Recent evidence suggests inoculation can reduce reactance to fear-inducing prosocial messages and promote intended outcomes. Studies have not tested whether inoculation offers similar benefits for disgust-eliciting messages. We tested this idea with a 2x2 (plus control) randomized experiment, varying the vividness of disgust imagery and the use of an inoculation pretreatment. Results show the inoculation treatment reduced the level of disgust elicited by a vivid disgust message. Inoculation did not reduce reactance as expected, and level of disgust elicited was positively associated with behavioral intention, contrary to our hypothesis. We discuss the implications for understanding disgust’s role in persuasion.",Not-So-Good-Feelings in Media Consumption,Mass Communication
2017-1737,2017,Paper Session,Guilty Pleasure No More: The Relative Importance of Media Use for Coping With Stress,3,"Despite the substantial attention paid to stress management in the coping literature, media use has been surprisingly overlooked in this context. Media scholarship on this issue has also been sporadic and, until recently, disconnected from the larger conversation about stress management. The present research investigated the relative value of media use compared to the range of stress coping strategies. Across two samples (students and breast cancer patients), media use emerged as one of the most frequently selected strategies to manage stress across numerous individual difference variables. Further, heavier television consumers and those with higher perceived stress evidenced elevated use of media for coping purposes. Finally, coping-driven media use was seen as an effective stress management tool on par with other popular strategies. This research documents the centrality of media use in the corpus of stress management techniques, highlighting the value of inquiry into media-based coping.

Although there was considerable variability in the level of sexual objectification both between and within celebrities, female celebrities were on average more objectified compared to their male counterparts. Sexualization was not related to the number of likes; however, media consumers gave more likes to photographs featuring celebrities in personal (rather than professional) contexts. Implications of these findings for sexual socialization and parasocial relationships are discussed.","Media, Gender, and Gender Roles",Mass Communication
2017-1739,2017,Paper Session,Patterns Behind Social Media Usage: Comprehending Facebook as a Set of Features to Separate its Functional Domains,4,"What patterns lie underneath the individual usage of Facebook features and do specific features relate to specific expectations? Drawing on the dichotomy between active and passive media use, this article assesses a modern application of the uses-and-gratifications approach: Conceptualizing Facebook as a toolkit of features (Smock, Ellison, Lampe, & Wohn, 2011) has significantly broadened the understanding of how individuals use social media. This article identifies functional domains behind those features, and argues that these bear the potential of explaining the parallel and blended use of different media services by terms of the uses-and-gratifications approach. Within a focus on contribution and consumption as functional domains and based on survey responses from 482 European Facebook users, we find that the manner of how Facebook is used being related to certain gratification expectations—but these relations become clear only when controlling for a general bias of liking the service.","Media, Gender, and Gender Roles",Mass Communication
2017-1740,2017,Paper Session,The Heuristic-Systematic Processing in Mediated Transgender Intergroup Contact: A Social Cognitive Approach,2,"Taking the experimental design approach, the present study investigates how narrative perspective (Ingroup Perspective vs. Outgroup Perspective) interacts with valence of intergroup interaction in transgender-related media content to redirect people’s heuristic-systematic information processing implicitly and explicitly. The findings reveal that telling the storyline from the ingroup perspective will increase the amount of systematic thought processing, which also reflects on people’s longer latency during the secondary task reaction time assignment. Also, negative interaction depiction elicits significantly more self-reported systematic thought processing after exposure, while people implicitly allocate more cognitive resources during their exposure to positive interaction depiction. Despite perspective narrative, positive interaction depiction leads to positive attitudes towards the featured outgroup character. However, among participants exposed to the outgroup perspective, negative interaction depiction elicits more negative attitudes towards the outgroup character. Such attitude outcomes for the featured outgroup character are not generalized into people’s attitudes towards the outgroup as a whole.","Media, Gender, and Gender Roles",Mass Communication

However, little is known about the role of different types of pornography, the mechanisms that underlie the relations, and individual differences in susceptibility to pornography effects. We used data from a three-wave panel survey among 826 Dutch adolescents. We focused on affection, dominance, and violence as different types of pornography, resistance to pornography as an underlying mechanism, and individual differences based on hyper-gender orientation. Structural equation modeling showed that resistance to pornography mediated the relationship between Internet pornography and sexual attitudes: more frequent use reduced resistance, which in turn increased notions of women as sex objects and instrumental attitudes toward sex. This pattern was stronger among hyper-masculine and hyper-feminine adolescents than among other adolescents. We found no differences in the effects of different types of Internet pornography.","Media, Gender, and Gender Roles",Mass Communication
2017-1742,2017,Paper Session,Can I Stick to My Guns? Motivated Reasoning and Biased Processing of Balanced Political Information,3,"Many citizens seek balanced political messages. The media also primarily offer content that presents two sides of a political issue. Despite that, most work on information processing studies exposure to one-sided content, i.e., either pro- or counter-attitudinal. We advance research on information processing by studying (1) how balanced and one-sided message affect information processing; (2) whether processing of balanced content is moderated by individual motivations; and (3) the impact of balanced exposure on attitude polarization. Using an online experiment, we prime either an accuracy or defensive motivation and examine information processing about climate change and Syrian refugees (N = 677). On both issues, participants engaged in less biased processing in response to balanced content, compared to pro- and counter-attitudinal content. Second, defensive and accuracy motivated individuals processed balanced content similarly. Third, only pro-attitudinal content, not balanced content, polarized individual attitudes, and this effect was not moderated by motivation.",Information Processing and Motivated Reasoning,Political Communication
2017-1743,2017,Paper Session,The Force of the Better Evidence in Political Belief Updating,1,"There are long-standing skepticisms about citizens’ ability to use information. Prior research suggests that citizens tend to mechanically rely on contextual cues and adopt elite positions as their own. And they tend to use a modicum of information they receive to rationalize and strengthen their partisan viewpoints. In this article, I present three experiments that challenge these claims, in favor of a Bayesian model of information processing. The experiments examine whether people take the strength of empirical evidence into consideration when they process information about contentious political issues. Across the experiments, I find that people update their beliefs and attitudes in light of presented arguments. People did not mindlessly accept whatever arguments they encounter, nor did they categorically reject uncongenial arguments. Instead, they accounted for the (un)certainty of evidence as they form their posterior opinions, even when it disconfirms their prior opinions.",Information Processing and Motivated Reasoning,Political Communication

Particularly the latter, how online opinion leadership is accredited – what message features trigger the attribution of opinion leadership to otherwise unknown communicators in online surroundings – remains understudied. Based on findings suggesting a heuristic processing of opinion-leader endorsements, we applied a 2x2-experimental design (n = 497), examining how two common heuristic message features (informational vs. emotionalizing wording; inclusion vs. lack of substantiating reference) impact the users’ perception of opinion leadership. PLS-SEM analysis shows that users base their attribution of opinion leadership primarily on quality valuations, indicating a rather systematic processing of information and chatterer. This relation is however moderated by affect; an emotionalizing wording positively increases the impact of quality valuation on perceived opinion leadership.",Information Processing and Motivated Reasoning,Political Communication

This article forwards our understanding of partisan motivated reasoning by systematically varying political contexts in a nationally representative survey experiment focused on an increasingly salient issue: vote miscounting. We find that partisans’ views of election counting are significantly moderated by whether or not their preferred party won or lost an election. In addition, nonpartisan cues are found to play as significant a role as partisan messages in shaping assessments of election counting. Finally, the study explores whether Independents have a ‘screen’ of their own, and if partisan differences extend to explanations of vote miscounting evaluations.",Information Processing and Motivated Reasoning,Political Communication
2017-1746,2017,Paper Session,Accounting for Judgment Formation Strategy in How People Respond to Corrective Information,2,"Persistent belief in misinformation, even upon exposure to corrections, has been one of the more striking findings in the literature on misperceptions. This phenomenon is often attributed to directional motivated reasoning, suggesting that people resist corrections when they go against their prior attitudes. However, we argue that the role of prior attitudes in shaping responses to corrective messages varies depending how people form judgments about new information. Using an experimental design, this study observes whether responsiveness to corrective messages is conditional on whether information is processed in either an on-line (OL) or memory-based (MB) fashion. Findings suggest that the effect of prior attitudes in influencing responsiveness to corrections is isolated to MB processors, while OL processors showed no differences in their responses to corrective information regardless of their prior views.",Information Processing and Motivated Reasoning,Political Communication

In a field experiment, 332 children (aged 8-13 years) were exposed to negative news stories written in either a constructive (solution-based, including positive emotions) or a non-constructive reporting style (problem-based, emphasizing negative emotions). Analysis of covariance showed that constructive news reporting had a less negative impact on children’s emotional responses to negative stories than non-constructive reporting. Moreover, constructive news reporting was more likely to inspire children to engage with the story topic. Thus, constructive reporting could be a promising way to improve children’s responses to negative news and therewith may enhance the bond between children and the news.",Constructive Uses of Journalism,Journalism Studies

For areas long stigmatized and associated with high levels of violence, crime, and poverty, negative news may be the only local news available. Drawing from communication infrastructure theory and literature on local news audiences and civic journalism, this study explores how a local solutions journalism project is received by members of an underrepresented and stigmatized community. Solutions journalism stories focus on responses to social problems, usually exploring problem-solving efforts that have the potential to be scaled. This case examines a community-based media project in South Los Angeles which was followed by six focus groups with 48 African American and Latino residents examining how participants responded to coverage. Study findings illustrate how residents navigate and critically interpret local media coverage, and how their response to ‘solutions journalism’ is largely positive but tempered by concerns regarding structural inequalities.",Constructive Uses of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2017-1749,2017,Paper Session,When Empathy is Not Enough: The Possibilities for Solidarity in the San Francisco Homeless Project,1,"Journalism that seeks to humanize marginalized communities can advance social justice by appealing to collective solidarity. News reporting, however, often appeals to readers’ empathy instead of solidarity, which risks increasing the audience’s compassion fatigue. This paper examines mechanisms of empathy and solidarity in representations of homeless people in two news outlets that participated in The San Francisco Homeless Project. The Project was a collaborative journalistic effort in June 2016 that called for attention and action to address homelessness. The San Francisco Chronicle’s coverage focuses on idiosyncratic reasons that individuals become homeless, which encourages empathy. In contrast, AlterNet emphasizes shared conditions that homeless people endure as a community, which invites solidarity. This distinction is important because strictly evoking empathy may erect a barrier to social change as people feeling sorrow for homeless individuals often become pessimistic, while appealing to solidarity invites readers to view social change as achievable through collective action.",Constructive Uses of Journalism,Journalism Studies

Despite this dramatic journalistic shift, there is little academic or professional understanding of “contextual” journalism. A recently-termed genre of journalistic storytelling, termed “restorative narrative,” falls within the canopy of contextual news stories. Intended to report on the response of communities and individuals in the wake of traumatic events or systemic dysfunction, restorative narrative includes among its recommended elements: long-term reportorial engagement; a willingness to confront the hard realities of a given situation; and a receptivity to the human capacity for solidarity and resilience. Through in-depth interviews and narrative analysis, this research seeks to understand how “restorative narrative” as “contextual reporting” fits into the landscape of modern journalistic storytelling.

How Guanxi Orientation Affected Income and Job Satisfaction of Chinese Public Relations Practitioners Through Public Relations Value,2,"The study examines how guanxi – the use of social networks and influential connections -- benefits public relations practitioners in the Chinese cultural context. Guanxi orientation is the term to identify characteristics of East Asian people influenced by Confucianism which posits that individuals position themselves and treat others based on their social networks. This study shows that perceived importance of guanxi cannot directly help public practitioners gain more income and achieve higher job satisfaction. A mediation model shows that the preference of guanxi contributes to the perceived effectiveness of public relations which can bring higher income and job satisfaction. Believe in professionalism is the actual mechanism underlying the direct relationship between the guanxi orientation and income. In addition, through the moderated mediation model, this study finds indirect effects happened with gender as boundary condition. Guanxi orientation can facilitate women better believe in the effectiveness of public relations. Traditionally, social networks were viewed as important resources contributed to higher income and job satisfaction.

With multiple organizational purposes, these hybrid organizations rely on social media to generate social changes in China’s semi-authoritarian environment. To understand how they achieved success through social media-based communication, this paper conducted qualitative inductive analysis of the Sina Weibo tweets sent by two successful net-roots organizations. The analysis reveals three key communication strategies: changing perceptions, mobilizing action, and building and maintaining relationships as well as specific tactics associated with each. Both organizations used these strategies and tactics to tap into media’s interactive features to actively engage publics. Findings from this study of successful nonprofits’ social media use in understudied political and social media contexts enriches social media-based communication research and classic social moment rhetoric.

Based on stigma management, minority stress model, and social cognitive theory, this paper tests the interplay between different dimensions of stigma, collective efficacy, and community mobilization among gender and sexual minorities. Data was drawn from a cross-sectional survey of men who have sex with men, transgenders and hijras (“MTH”) in south India (N=225) to predict protest participation and intention to participate in communication campaigns to decrease public stigma and increase community access to stigma-free healthcare. Factor analysis indicate 5 distinct dimensions of stigma among sexual and gender minorities. While stigma dampens community mobilization and advocacy, and is negatively associated with collective efficacy, we find partial support that collective efficacy attenuates the negative impacts of stigma on community advocacy.

Using three iterations of Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) conducted between 2008 and 2013, our results showed that U.S. immigrants engaged with individual-level and interpersonal-level e-health tools, mainly for the purpose of health information seeking and tracking and doctor-patient communication. Furthermore, by using two cultural proxy variables (race/ethnicity and length of residence), our results demonstrated the distinctive e-health engagement patterns for different immigrant subgroups.",Health Communication and Vulnerable Populations,Health Communication

The study examines the narratives of health that immigrant women articulate in the context of science and engineering careers. ? The study focuses on the agentic expressions of everyday practices through which they maintain their health amid these structural challenges to health. The data was gathered across two countries, Singapore and the US, and drawn from in-depth interviews conducted with immigrant women working in science, engineering, and technology careers over a five year period. The contextually situated narratives shared by the women point toward gendered stereotypes about competence and masculine norms of participation in work translate across spaces and result in similar experiences of stressors that threaten the health of the participants.",Health Communication and Vulnerable Populations,Health Communication
2017-1761,2017,Paper Session,Communicating Structural Violence in Health Care: Lived experiences of Street-based Female Sex Workers in Kathmandu,1,"Thirty-five in-depth interviews were conducted with female, street-based, commercial sex workers in Kathmandu, Nepal. Lived experience reveal how participants negotiated and engaged with structural limitations such as lack of access to education, jobs, and health infrastructures. The framework of structural violence guided this study in identifying the structural context that impacts the sex workers’ lives and may cause harm to their health. Structural violence is any violence or suffering caused by the structure and institutions of a society (Farmer, 2003). Structural violence in health care was revealed through thematic analysis as (a) enacted stigma, (b) forced choice, and (c) informal health sources. Additionally, five practical implications for health interventions can be suggested from the findings. Structural violence communicates what a society emphasizes and expects regarding acceptable health behavior while at the same time lacking an understanding of how structural limitations are negotiated in a marginalized space.",Health Communication and Vulnerable Populations,Health Communication

For this purpose we designed a community-based study and collected data from 300 AI parents. The study used an experimental design exposing participants to one of three messages. Messages differed in the extent to which AI culture was made salient: The first featured a white youth playing soccer; the second an AI youth playing lacrosse; and the third an AI youth in regalia at a powwow. Culturally tailored messages were seen as more similar to parents' children; were seen as more effective; and were associated with more positive attitudes and control perceptions than non-tailored messages. These findings have important implications for the design of messages that encourage HPV vaccination in AI populations.",Health Communication and Vulnerable Populations,Health Communication

Through analyzing how PTS develops the programs, selects the shows, and frames the content of television shows produced by foreign television companies, this paper argues that PTS’s programming discourses and practices play an important role in maintaining its brand identity and further promoting its brand image in the competitive commercial television environment in Taiwan. Facing structural changes and societal challenges, PTS emphasizes the public interest that it intends to create for the audience and the society through a cosmopolitan discourse. After justifying its direction, PTS integrates more popular cultures and more relevant approaches into its selection and framing of the shows to attract more audience and to enlarge the scope of public interest.",Entertainment Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies

In the contemporary media industries, it functions as a semantic place where the different elements of “the circuit of culture” are temporarily articulated. Drawing on the understanding of genre as a cultural and industrial linkage, this research investigates the industrial and sociocultural contexts that have conditioned the rapid growth of television food shows in Korea. To explore this inquiry, I conducted in-depth interviews with media practitioners, governmental officials, and professionals in the food industry, who have been involved in the production of TV food shows. Through the lens of genre, this research will elucidate how media producers negotiate their habitus, institutional routines/knowledge, and audience’s horizon of expectation.

I focus on the 29 film and TV productions that have been funded by ACPCultures+. I employ content analysis of the films themselves, as well as utilizing data from policy documents, fieldwork at the ACPCultures+ headquarters in Brussels, and interviews with film producers and directors. Although they include documentaries and TV dramas, these productions skew heavily toward “art house” feature films that resemble European productions both aesthetically and industrially. At the same time, I argue that these productions suggest new ways of conceptualizing local audiovisual industries and media diversity in an era of globalization, and can be understood as a kind of de facto global media policy that attempts to expand European Union cultural policy to the global south.",Entertainment Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies

This paper examines the legitimation strategies that web dramas use to establish their presence by aligning with more validated forms of culture. Analyzing trade journals, reports, newspaper articles that discuss web dramas, it found that web dramas drew connections with television dramas through three ways: by highlighting the talent affiliated with television, the possible economic contribution that it can bring to the Korean Wave, and the experimental forms that enable them to adapt to the changing audience viewing patterns. Placing the findings in the larger context of inter-Asian connections, this paper argues that the way web dramas incorporate the Korean Wave as a cultural currency for legitimization indicates how it is developing as part of a larger East Asian pop culture.",Entertainment Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies
2017-1767,2017,Paper Session,"Residual Practices, New Technologies and Reluctant Change: Film Distribution in Greece Since the Financial Crisis",1,"The paper will explore the dynamics between old and new practices and players in the formal and informal networks of film circulation in Greece. It will focus on the period since 2009, and assess the extent to which the financial crisis precipitated or slowed down change. By formal networks I refer to commercially organized theatrical, DVD and online distribution. Informal networks are various forms of piracy – illegal DVDs, downloading and streaming (Lobato, 2012; Crisp, 2015). The paper will map out these different systems of circulation of films in Greece, as well as their interactions and clashes of interests.

While the formal networks of distribution consist of top-down processes whereby a few agents representing legitimate interests regulate the circulation of certain films, the informal networks are bottom-up, user-driven and unregulated. An exploration of each system will reveal its workings, while their interaction and clash will help draw a picture of the broader cultural landscape in which they circulate, especially in terms of access to viewing options, conflicting interests and audience choices. By focusing on a period of ongoing financial difficulty for the country, the paper will examine the rate, drivers and direction of change with regard to organized frameworks, business practices and consumer behavior. It will argue that while there has been remarkable resilience in the established formal structures of the film distribution system in Greece, the technology-driven process of change has been led by informal practices. The established formal agents have been slow to respond and adapt, while the effects of the very recent entry of new international players (eg. Netflix in 2016) are as yet to be seen.

By situating this national case study in a global context, the paper aims to offer a contribution not only to the understanding of this particular national industry, but to its relation to broader networks of circulation and exchange. Based on extensive interviews with industry members, it will examine the structure and processes of both formal and informal film distribution in Greece in 2015 (when the interviews were taken), while also referring to the preceding period, especially since the advent of the financial crisis. Its aims are threefold: As a media industries study, it focuses mostly on formal distribution; it aims to identify the main players that are involved in the process of rights acquisition and promotion of feature films in Greece, and explain their working practices. From a film studies perspective, it explores the mediating role of - both formal and informal - film distribution in helping (re) define and question the notion of national cinema. And finally, from a broader cultural studies angle, it presents a profile of the country in terms of what films circulate and how they are being watched, while pointing to comparisons with global and other national patterns of change. The fact that Greece was one of the European countries most visibly affected by the financial crisis of 2008 gives the analysis that follows additional heuristic value: it allows us to examine the effect of the financial crisis and the extent and ways in which it affected the ecology and landscape of film distribution at a time of broader global transitions driven by technology and economy.

Overall, the paper will position Greece in the broader context of recent debates around contemporary film distribution and piracy, and identify the way in which global distribution practices manifest themselves locally in a specific ‘small’ territory of the European periphery.",Entertainment Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies
2017-1768,2017,Paper Session,Conceptualizing and Measuring Political Information Using Topic Modeling and Exponential Random Graph Models for Two-Mode Networks,3,"Integrating the concept of knowledge representation and mental models of comprehension as well as relying on machine learning and social network analysis methodologies, this paper proposes to model political information as a complex, two-mode network. Underlying latent topics (topic modeling methodology) and political entities (named entity recognition) are extracted from unstructured text and are then connected according to their affiliation in the text. A two-mode semantic network analysis is applied to model political information as a network of interconnected political topics and actors.
This model of text as a network gives an advantage of representing textual political information as knowledge structure, providing a model of information that likely resembles how it is processed by humans. Having a structural, comprehensive model of information is crucial for better understanding of people’s psychological engagement with political processes such as political learning, acquisition and processing of political information, information retention, etc.",Computational Methods for Studying Political Communication,Computational Methods

2017-1770,2017,Paper Session,Examining the Impact of Civic Participation on Crowdsourced Policymaking with Natural Language Processing,3,"This paper examines the impact of civic participation on a crowdsourced policymaking process by using a novel data analytics method, Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using data from a crowdsourced urban planning process in the City of Palo Alto in California, we examined the impact of civic input on the city’s Comprehensive City Plan update. Our findings revealed big differences between the crowdsourced input, the representatives’ input, and the final policy. The differences reflect three agendas from the crowd, representatives, and bureaucrats. Although crowdsourcing aims to combine the three agendas to extract epistemic value in civic engagement, the civic data overload constrains the government and representatives’ ability to process and consider crowdsourced data. This paradox of asking for civic participation but not considering it in the policymaking process poses serious challenges to participatory democracy—a challenge to which NLP can provide at least a partial solution by automating data analysis.",Computational Methods for Studying Political Communication,Computational Methods

Scholars theorize that this increased flow of informa- tion influences market outcomes because banks act as credibility leaders: sin- gle sources of truth to which markets react. But credibility leader theories break down when applied to central banks abroad, which release multiple streams of information—one in English, for the world, and one or more in their country’s common language or languages. As such, central banks may influence market expectations by sending different signals to international and domestic players (regardless of intention), a route termed the “babel effect.” In this paper, I seek ev- idence of this previously un-noted market manipulation mechanism using a novel dataset of more than 8,000 international central bank communications developed to discern differences among matched press releases in different languages. The findings are important because they suggest unexplored routes through which central banks might be able to influence economic and political outcomes.",Computational Methods for Studying Political Communication,Computational Methods

2017-1773,2017,Paper Session,What’s the T? Personality Politics in Media Coverage Over Time: The UK Case 1992-2013,3,"Over the last decades there has been a substantial amount of research about the phenomenon of the personalization of politics, especially in parliamentary democracies. The key tenet of the literature is that there has been an increase over time in the centrality of individual politicians at the expense of collective institutions (parties, cabinets and parliaments), which is manifested in, and in turn is reinforced by, personalized media coverage (e.g. Balmas et al. 2014; Boumans, Boomgaarden and Vliegenthart 2013; Karvonen 2010; Kriesi 2012; Mughan 2000; Rahat and Sheafer 2007). Within media personalization, the literature suggests that there has been a rise not only on the emphasis on individuals but also a greater focus on their personalities, including ‘hard’ and especially ‘soft’ character traits, which is understood to come in detriment to the coverage of policies and issues (Langer 2011; Van Aelst, Sheafer and Stanyer 2012; van Zoonen and Holtz-Bacha 2000). Most research, however, has focused on the first dimension (i.e. individualization) with much less systematic empirical work carried out on the personality politics dimension, especially outside the US. This is particularly problematic as it is the dimension that raises stronger normative concerns due to its potential impact on the quality of information citizens receive, electoral behavior and the quality of elected representatives.

To a large extent this strand of research has been limited by methodological difficulties. The complexity of analyzing this dimension of personalization has meant that, up to now, it generally has been carried out with manual content analysis, and hence only in relatively small samples of data. As a result, there is not enough evidence to confirm (or reject) the assumption that personality—and especially ‘soft’ traits—has become a major focus of media coverage, and even less to help us understand under which circumstances this is more the case. Thus, this study seeks to better understand the degree to which media focus on politicians’ personalities, and the characteristics that they choose to portray. Specifically, it aims to answer these three research questions: How much of the coverage focuses on politicians’ personalities and how does it compare to that with policy-focus? Which types of personality traits predominate? Has the characteristics of the coverage changed over time and which factors explain these changes? In order to answer these question, we have created a novel dataset constructed from over one million newspaper articles in the UK covering a continuous 22-year period (1992-2013). This dataset will enable us to carry out the analysis via computational quantitative text analysis techniques. Our approach first breaks newspaper articles into sentences, which then become the basis of analysis. These sentences are subsequently analyzed on two fronts. First, we identify policy and personality-focused content. In a second step, we categorize the personality-focused-text referring to party leaders in particular according to the types of traits they emphasize. Specifically, these sentences (over 26 million in total) are analyzed via Keyword-in-Context to keep the meaningful words before and after each politician’s name (our search terms). The selected words are subsequently analyzed for their content to classify coverage into categories via a Latent-Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. We furthermore use dictionaries to categorize words and clusters into appropriate policy dimensions and appropriate brand personality categories.

Our preliminary results indicate that there are four main types of coverage: policy, process, party, and personality. It should be noted that these types are co-occur in the same article and hence the importance of carrying out the analysis at the sentence level. The proportion of coverage focused on personality is relatively low and does not appear to have systematically increased over the period under study. Instead, it fluctuates both as a result of variables related to the individual and due to institutional factors such as campaign periods and the presence of a coalition government. It also varies depending on newspaper type, although not as much as might be expected. We do not yet have findings to report on the types of personality traits but it would appear that competence (or hard character traits) are more prevalent than those associated with ‘likability’ (or soft character traits). Overall these findings posit an interesting contribution to the literature. First, they come to show the exact extent to which, both during electoral and government periods, the press focuses on the personality of politicians and how this compare with other—and often argued more relevant—type of content. It also reveals some of the mechanisms through which coverage is personalized. We manage to do so with—in our knowledge—the largest coverage of any previous research project on the topic. Second, it offers an innovative method to identify personalized coverage, as well as other types of coverage. This will enable further research not only on personality coverage itself but also linking it to changes in public opinion, voting behavior, and even politicians reactions to media coverage. Finally, they help to provide some sound empirical bass for the much discussed normative questions about to the role of personality on the media reporting of politics.",Computational Methods for Studying Political Communication,Computational Methods

To facilitate research on understanding social media self-control failures, we constructed a brief social media self-control failure (SMSCF)-scale to assess how often social media users give in to social media temptations. Social media users (N = 406) completed a survey (including a 4- week follow-up) to test the scale’s psychometric properties. The self-report SMSCF-scale showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Demonstrating its construct validity, the SMSCF-scale was moderately related to existing problematic media use and general self-control scales. Demonstrating its predictive validity, the SMSCF-scale was positively related to social media use and feelings of guilt about one’s social media use, and negatively related to psychological wellbeing. The SMSCF-scale provides a useful indicator of social media self-control failure. This could facilitate future research on the psychological processing underlying social media self-control failures.","Social Media Connection, Addiction, Escapism",Communication and Technology
2017-1776,2017,Paper Session,Permanently Online and Permanently Connected: Development and Validation of the Online Vigilance Scale,8,"Smartphones and other mobile devices have fundamentally changed patterns of Internet use in everyday life by making online access constantly available. Routines of ubiquitous online communication seem to have grown firmly into many people’s cognitive structures. The present paper offers a theoretical explication of the concept of online vigilance, referring to users’ permanent awareness of the constant availability of online content and communication as well as their motivational disposition to exploit these options anywhere, anytime, and with regard to virtually any situational circumstance. Based on four studies, a validated and reliable self-report measure of this communicational disposition was developed. In combination, the results suggest that the Online Vigilance Scale (OVS) shows a stable factor structure in various contexts and user populations. Our findings clearly support the notion of online vigilance as a trait variable with considerable temporal stability and the ability to explain variance in state measures of online vigilance.","Social Media Connection, Addiction, Escapism",Communication and Technology

However, in the context of social media, little is known about the prevalence and mechanisms of escapism. Against this background, we conducted an online survey with 775 Facebook users that examined the antecedents of Facebook escapism as well as its outcomes on entertainment experiences. The results reveal that Facebook escapism is provoked by a low need for cognition and low life satisfaction. Regarding the effects, the findings indicate that Facebook Escapism not only fulfills the hedonic need for enjoyment but also the eudaimonic needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness. Furthermore, we found that differentiating between consuming, participating, and producing Facebook user types is insightful for explaining differences in the relationships of escapism with its antecedents and outcomes.","Social Media Connection, Addiction, Escapism",Communication and Technology

The current study uses moral foundations theory to examine the effectiveness of the BYAF technique by examining whether individual differences in emphasis on freedom predicts compliance rates of the BYAF technique. It was expected that those who place a higher emphasis on freedom would find the BYAF more amenable to comply with than a direct request, and thus would be more likely to comply. Results indicate that those who endorsed the moral intuition of liberty – economic/government (i.e., belief that one’s finances should remain free from external control) were less likely to comply with the BYAF request and more likely to comply with a direct request.

Two different methods of anger induction (incidental vs. integral anger) were used. The data (N = 258) were collected before the 2012 presidential elections. We found that although the integral anger induction created marginally higher levels of anger than the incidental anger induction, different types of induction had different effects on behavioral intentions and misperceptions. As predicted, high incidental anger increased intentions to participate in the political process. Although having strong efficacy beliefs had an overall positive influence on behavioral intentions, having strong political efficacy increased the endorsements of political misperceptions. Furthermore, a significant integral anger by efficacy interaction indicated that when paired with high efficacy beliefs, high integral anger resulted in the most own party misperceptions.","For a Good Cause: Compliance, Political Participation, and Climate Change",Information Systems

Based on Construal Level Theory, it has been argued that one effective communication strategy might be to proximize climate change by focussing on socially and geographically close consequences for the addressed audience. Our research asks whether media communication of social/geographical proximity vs. distance influences recipients’ psychological social/geographical distance of climate change, their relevance attribution, acquired knowledge, and climate change engagement. We hypothesize that the effect of communicated distance is moderated by individuals’ salient identification with all humanity. In an online experiment with N = 508 residents of the UK, participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions in a 2 (news text: proximity vs. distance) × 2 (video: salient IWAH vs. control) + 1 (no stimuli) design. Data are analysed with structural equation modelling.","For a Good Cause: Compliance, Political Participation, and Climate Change",Information Systems
2017-1789,2017,Paper Session,Let’s Talk About It! The Effects of Conversation on the Interplay of Trust in Climate-Related Information and Confidence in Collective Agency to Protect Climate,5,"Citizens’ confidence in collective agency to protect climate lays the pivotal groundwork for their motivation for subsequent political and environmental behaviors as well as collective action to achieve the goal of climate protection. Based on a three-wave panel study, we analyzed how trust in climate-related information during the UN Climate Conference influences citizens’ confidence in collective agency subsequent to the conference. Moreover, this study sheds light on the effects of interpersonal communication with different conversation partners during the conference. Results show a positive influence of peoples’ trust in climate-related information on their confidence in collective agency. Conversation with family and friends about climate politics seems to strengthen this relationship, whereas conversations with colleagues and acquaintances seem to weaken it.","For a Good Cause: Compliance, Political Participation, and Climate Change",Information Systems
2017-1790,2017,Paper Session,I Text Therefore I Am: Message Interactivity vs. Message Exchange in Addictive Use of Instant Messaging,2,"This study employs the concept of message interactivity to disambiguate addictive from non-addictive use of instant messaging, by hypothesizing that addicts would prefer numerous mechanistic exchanges of reactive communications whereas non-addicts would expect more contingency in their interactions. We tested this hypothesis with a 2 (Message Interactivity: Low vs. High) x 2 (Message Exchange: Low vs. High) x 2 (Levels of Addiction: Low vs. High) between-subjects experiment (N = 188). Findings revealed that both addicts and non-addicts prefer message contingency. However, while non-addicts’ appreciation of message contingency leads to content elaboration, addicts are focused on being absorbed in the experience of texting rather than elaborating on the content exchanged in the experience. This discovery not only confirms the process-oriented characteristic of IM addiction, but also offers us an opportunity to redefine and reevaluate media addiction based on the nature of user engagement with interactive tools rather than on individual differences.","Relational Interaction, Texting, and Social Media",Communication and Technology
2017-1791,2017,Paper Session,"Textual Harassment as a Form of Bullying, Drama, and Obsessive Relational Intrusion",4,"This study examines the nature of harassment that occurs via text messaging. Specifically, the nature, contexts, and consequences of textual harassment (TH) were explored by examining the phenomenon via the lens of other forms of interpersonal harassment, such as cyberbullying, drama, and obsessive relational intrusion. Seven focus groups were conducted with 30 total participants, which resulted in 36 distinct TH narratives. Analysis of the focus group transcripts revealed that TH is a complex phenomenon. Incidents ranged from relatively trivial to severe. Some incidents were resolved within a day; other events lasted several years. Ultimately, the analysis revealed that TH is a fundamentally relational phenomenon that occurs between individuals with some form of latent, weak, or close social connection. Results are framed within the context of previous research into harassment and bullying in both online and offline contexts.","Relational Interaction, Texting, and Social Media",Communication and Technology
2017-1792,2017,Paper Session,What the Selfie Says: An Experimental Test of How Selfies Change Social Judgments on Facebook,3,"Selfies are everywhere on social media. Research has focused only on who is posting selfies and has not addressed the audience members viewing selfies. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the judgments people make of selfies posted on Facebook. Using an online experiment, we test how including a selfie on a Facebook status update changes people’s appraisals of narcissism, message intimacy, message appropriateness, and social attraction. We also consider how the valence and intimacy of the status update text interplay with the selfie to change social judgments. Participants rated posts with selfies as more narcissistic, intimate, inappropriate, and less socially attractive. Selfie evaluations also depended upon the valence and intimacy of the status update text. Gender of the selfie poster did not influence the evaluation of the selfie. One implication from these results is that posting selfies on social media may lead to negative judgments about the poster.","Relational Interaction, Texting, and Social Media",Communication and Technology

A Three-way Interaction Among the Present, the Constant, and the Past",1,"This study first explicated the acceptance of lookism from a communication perspective. Factors related to appearance orientation and representing individuals’ present, past, and constant characteristics were chosen: selfie exposure (the present), self-esteem (the constant), and experience with cosmetic procedures (the past). A two-wave online panel survey was conducted in Korea among females aged 20 to 39 (N = 1,064 and 782). The result showed a significant three-way interaction. Selfie exposure increased lookism acceptance only among those who seem furthest from lookism: individuals with high self-esteem and fewer cosmetic procedures. The findings suggest that people with a positive self-view are more sensitive to information related to self-worth. Based on the findings, this study attempted a theorization of lookism.","Relational Interaction, Texting, and Social Media",Communication and Technology

It creates a feeling or a sense of knowing people in online social media. We took a closer look at this emerging concept and examined possible relations between intensity of social networking site usage, ambient awareness, social connectedness, and well-being. We conducted an interview study (N = 14) as well as an online survey (N = 235). Results indicated positive relations between intensity of Facebook usage and ambient awareness as well as between ambient awareness and increased well-being.

Based on a field experiment (N = 61), this study tested whether the effects of this form of social pressure on smartphone users’ perceived stress and well-being are mediated by the fulfillment of the intrinsic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, during smartphone use. The results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and competence, but that it did not significantly influence relatedness need satisfaction. As expected, intrinsic need satisfaction mediated the effects of social pressure on the investigated outcomes. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for smartphone use.",Social Connectedness and Well-Being,Communication and Technology
2017-1796,2017,Paper Session,Cost of Caring and Communication Technology: Assessing Awareness of Network Life Events and its Mediating and Moderating Impacts on Stress,1,"New communication technology has increasingly become efficient channels for exchanging information about one’s personal life with a mix of strong and weak ties. Although sharing personal experiences provide an opportunity to exchange social support, receiving a continuous flow of information about others’ lives can be problematic. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 1007 adults conducted through Amazon Mturk, this study examined the relationship between use of mobile/Facebook, awareness of major life events others experienced and one’s stress. My finding suggests that use of communication technology is indirectly associated with stress through awareness of network life events. Specifically, this association varies depending on how the technology is used, relationship to information source and the content of information communicated thorough the medium. This work adds to the literature on communication technology and psychological well-being by demonstrating an additional relationship between awareness of events in others’ lives and psychological stress.",Social Connectedness and Well-Being,Communication and Technology

2017-1798,2017,Paper Session,Is Sharing Really Caring? Examining Predictors of Facebook Pictivism and its Perceived Influence on Users,2,"Several online social campaigns in recent years have encouraged individuals to change their Facebook profile pictures for a cause, such as the Human Rights Campaign’s red and pink equal sign in support of same sex marriage. These “pictivism” campaigns allow individuals to participate in a low effort way to raise awareness about an issue among their social network. Given the prevalence and potential impact of these campaigns, it is important to understand what predicts one’s participation. This study applies the Theory of Reasoned Action and Technology Acceptance Model in an online survey (N = 300) of Facebook users to investigate which individual and social factors predict participation in these campaigns. Results indicate that attitudes about participation are predicted by network norms about participation, ease of participation, and perceived usefulness of participation, which in turn predicts intention to participation, and actual participation. Implications for theory in this context are discussed.",Social Connectedness and Well-Being,Communication and Technology
2017-1799,2017,Paper Session,"Femvertising: Activation of Empowerment and Objectification Schemas Following Exposure to Ads With an ""Empowerment"" Message",3,"Companies who have historically produced objectifying advertisements are switching to messages that empower women in an attempt to appeal to consumers, a trend referred to as “femvertising.” Couture and Harrison (2016) argue that objectifying images in femvertisements may undercut their empowering message. This experiment expands on Couture and Harrison’s (2016) study about beauty femvertisements to test empowerment and objectification outcomes in a wider range of campaigns. Whereas the detrimental effects of self-objectification have been studied extensively by media scholars, very few studies explore situations where these seemingly contradictory schemas may co-occur. Participants were randomly assigned to view advertisements from one of five experimental conditions and then completed a lexical decision task (LDT) to measure activation of objectification and empowerment schemas following exposure. As contemporary media messages frequently include both messages of empowerment and objectification, understanding how these schemas interact is critical to the study of representations of women.","Gender, Sex, and Sexuality",Mass Communication
2017-1800,2017,Paper Session,The Effectiveness of Using Sexual Appeals in Advertising: Memory for Sexual and Nonsexual Visual Content Across Genders,1,This study empirically investigates the effectiveness of using visual sexual appeals on the memory of men and women. It examines memory for the commercials activated by sexual versus nonsexual visual appeals. A mixed-factorial experiment was conducted. Visual recognition and free recall were recorded in 146 participants (males = 71 and females = 75). The results substantiate the evolutionary psychology claims. Support for the motivational information-processing and the distraction hypothesis was found in male viewers. The results indicate that sexual appeals enhance memory for the ads themselves. But they distract men from processing brand-related information. Male participants encoded and recalled less brand-related information from ads with sexual appeals. The study offers guidelines for advertisers and marketing producers while also bringing insight into gender/sex differences in processing sexual stimuli. It also makes key theoretical contribution to the field by parsing out the influence of sexual versus nonsexual visual content from confounding impact of visual sexual versus verbal nonsexual memory.,"Gender, Sex, and Sexuality",Mass Communication

The current study addresses this void by employing content analytic methods to measure the frequency and context of depictions of sexual behavior within three popular television genres, while taking into account the type of sexual behavior. In addition, this study tries to provide a better understanding of the hookup script and casual sexual relationships script in popular television shows. The results indicate that the televised scripts are not congruent with early definitions and findings regarding the hookup culture. By providing a fresh view on portrayals of the hookup culture on the screen, these findings thus set the stage for media-effects studies interested in the association between television exposure and attitudes towards and behavior in the hookup culture.","Gender, Sex, and Sexuality",Mass Communication

Although there are a great amount of studies about the effect of SEIM, only very few previous studies have focused on the nature of content in SEIM. In addition, previous studies usually treated SEIM as a homogeneous whole and only focused on the individual sexual behaviors. Using social network analysis method, the current study aims at comparing the similarities and differences of sexual co-occurrence pattern across the top 10 categories on Xvideos.com. The study will help researchers to better understand what different sexual scripts pornography consumers might learn from different categories of SEIM and further predict which specific effects different categories of SEIM may exert on their viewers.","Gender, Sex, and Sexuality",Mass Communication

Advancing previous research, analyses did not only include media attention and media sentiment, but also corporate information released with regard to the 50 IPOs that went public in Germany between January 2011 and December 2015. The main findings point to a negative relationship between negative sentiment in the media coverage and the flotation performance of IPOs as well as a negative relationship between the presence of information on new products of IPOs and the win of the share price after the second day of trading. These relationships were particularly present when considering media coverage on the day of the IPO itself, instead of coverage from six days prior to the IPO date.","Media: Market, Ecology, System",Mass Communication

An overview of the media landscape in the territory before and after 1999 is presented, allowing for comprehensive understanding of which changes did take place after the departure of the Portuguese colonial authorities and which characteristics of today’s media system were already in place during Portuguese rule. Evidence of the level of freedom given to the mass media before and after the handover is presented and discussed.","Media: Market, Ecology, System",Mass Communication

Expanding on the work of Fenton (2011) on New Social Movements, this article draws out the failures and successes of the ‘Brexit’ campaigns within a new context of political and civic participation. Analysis highlights the failure on both sides of the debate to utilize new and traditional media platforms to overcome barriers of low trust and political efficacy. Furthermore, analysis reveals how fragmentation in political networks across socio-economic and generational lines was utilized by ‘Leave’ groups and under-addressed by ‘Remain’ groups in the course of campaigning. Through a dual analysis of data from the campaigns and the outcome, lessons can be learned as to how political and social movements can be best placed to intervene in both institutional and broader politics.

Research usually assumes that this decision is strategic, and within this framework two elements stand out: the prospects of electoral failure (competitive standing) increases the use of negative campaigning, and so does the temporal proximity of the election. We contribute by testing two new expectations: 1) parties and candidates are more likely to go negative when they face unfavourable competitive standings and voting day is near (frantic loser hypothesis), and 2) they are less likely to go negative when they faced a substantive degradation in their competitive standing over the course of the campaign (anxiety hypothesis). We test these expectations on a database of campaign ads published in the press before federal referenda in Switzerland (1999-2012), and provide empirical evidence consistent with those expectations. These results have important implications for existing research on the strategic underpinnings of campaigning and political communication.",Campaign Strategies and Information Effects: Insights From Europe,Political Communication
2017-1809,2017,Paper Session,Tainted Love: How Stigmatization of a Political Party in News Media Reduces its Electoral Support,2,"In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This paper addresses this question by examining voters’ reactions to the Dutch party PVV being associated with stigmatized other parties. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that exposure to such indirect stigmatization lowered these voters’ perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. Both effects occurred exclusively among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, which are key to voting for the PVV. The finding that stigmatization worked in the case of this well-established party suggests it can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party.",Campaign Strategies and Information Effects: Insights From Europe,Political Communication

The principle aim of this study is explaining the occurrence of confirming and disconfirming communication through the lens of attachment theory. We predicted that attachment anxiety and avoidance would lead to less confirming communication and more disconfirming communication in romantic relationships. To examine these predictions, we recruited 87 romantically involved couples to complete our survey. We found that a romantic partner’s attachment anxiety positively associated with two types of disconfirming communication and negatively associated with confirming communication. The effect for confirming communication was qualified, however, by interaction between the partner’s anxiety and the actor’s anxiety. We failed to find sufficient evidence that a partner’s attachment avoidance associates his/her disconfirming communication but we did find a qualified conditional main effect for the negative association between a partner’s avoidance attachment and his/her confirming communication. Again, this effect was conditioned on the actor’s own level of attachment anxiety.",Interpersonally Managing Close Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

Multilevel model results (n = 2,722) indicated that four episodes (i.e., affection, meaningful talk, catching up, joking around) were associated with greater relatedness and affective well-being. Energy expending episodes occurred less frequently than less expending interactions. The ratio of relatedness to energy expenditure was associated with greater well-being and decreased likelihood of future social interaction.

2017-1812,2017,Paper Session,From Pals to Paramours: Relational Escalation is More Successful When it Facilitates Approach Than Avoidance Superordinate Goals,2,"Relational escalation can transition a friendship into romantic relationship. We examine the superordinate goals that motivate escalating a friendship into a romance by seeking to understand escalation with a focus on goal hierarchies and how superordinate goals are associated with perceived face threats, politeness strategies, message directness, as well as the success of the escalation attempt and the escalation target’s reaction valence. Approach and avoidance superordinate goals predicted threats, politeness strategies, and directness. Mediation analyses demonstrated that approach and avoidance goals were indirectly and directly correlated with reaction valence and escalation success. However, approach goals were more consistent predictors of success and valence than avoidance goals, which suggests that an escalation goal aimed at jumping from pals to paramours is more successful when it facilitates approach goals, such as experiencing emotional/physical closeness and securing a compatible partner, compared to when it facilitates avoidance goals, such as eliminating jealousy.",Interpersonally Managing Close Relationships,Interpersonal Communication

This study is an early exploration of what has been deemed network uncertainty (i.e., the degree of confidence partners have that their networks accept their and facilitate their relationship’s development). An exploratory factor analysis was run in order to develop an initial scale for measuring network uncertainty. In addition, a series of regressions were run in order to gauge the relationship between network uncertainty and relational uncertainty.

Just in 2015, more than one million refugees made their way into Europe (BBC, 2015). This surge in immigration is constantly being debated as a topical issue on several political, economic and social platforms. In Finland, with an immigrant population of about two hundred thousand (Statistics Finland, 2014), this situation has been received with mixed feelings. Attitudes towards immigrants have however hardened especially amidst the refugee crisis. Such circumstances however point to the necessity and constant need for empirically and theoretically grounded research that helps us understand important aspects of the relationship between immigrants and members of the host society. One of such aspects which is under consideration in this study is to explore the relationship between acculturation preferences (assimilation / integration) of majority Finns towards immigrants and perceived threat (realistic threat and symbolic threat) towards immigrants and the predictive power of intergroup contact.",Communication and Ingroup-Outgroup Attitudes,Intergroup Communication

We found that regardless of social context people reported more harming behaviors toward the science fiction/fantasy fan compared with the sports fan. Moreover, we found that task-type interacts with fandom-type in predicting helping behaviors. We found that people reported more helping behaviors toward the science fiction /fantasy fan when the task was social compared to when it was technical. We found the reverse pattern for the sports fan. Specifically, we found that participants reported more helping behaviors toward the sport fan when the task was technical, compared to when it was social.

Ten groups of 3-4 non-suicidal adults per group were randomly assigned to one of five test conditions. Data were collected with focus groups and analyzed via the documentary method. There were three predominant types of emotional reactions to all films: a deterioration of mood, concurrent positive and negative emotional reactions, or indifference. Furthermore, participants in all focus groups showed psychological defense mechanisms such as humor, denial, or intellectualization when discussing topics related to suicide or death. The findings suggest that audiences react differently to suicide films, and that psychological defense mechanisms may play a key factor in the processing of suicide portrayals in fictional films.","Communication, Mental Health and Well-Being",Health Communication
2017-1822,2017,Paper Session,“She Finally Smiles… For Real”: Reducing Depression and Bolstering Resilience Through Self-Affirmation in LGBTQ Youth,3,"LGBTQ youth face well-documented health disparities, such as depression. Many develop resilience despite challenges, yet much remains unknown about depression and resilience mechanisms in youth. In pilot Study 1 (N = 102), a two-group pretest-posttest design evaluated the effects of a leadership camp on LGBTQ youth ages 12 to 20. Results showed campers experienced greater increases in self-affirmation and hope, and mediation analyses found self-affirmation mediated the relationships between condition and depression and resilience. While change in hope was high (perhaps at ceiling) for campers, non-campers experiencing a high change in hope approached campers’ level of self-affirmation. A stepwise regression revealed aspirational identification with program counselors as the main driver of self-affirmation. In Study 2 (N = 54), a post-camp survey assessed parents’ perceptions of changes in their child. Findings validated Study 1. This study elucidates underexplored psychological links, demonstrating the potential for affirming programs to improve immediate well-being and long-term resilience.","Communication, Mental Health and Well-Being",Health Communication
2017-1823,2017,Paper Session,The Impact of Electronic Media Use on Adolescents’ Well-Being,4,"The present research studies the impact of frequency of exposure to screen-based media, i.e., television, Internet, and social networking sites (SNS) on subjective well-being of adolescents in Germany. Based on panel data that covered a period of six years the present study found that frequency of Internet use in general decreased satisfaction with life of adolescents, but was unrelated to depressive symptomatology. The use of SNS and Television use do not affect subjective well-being of adolescents over time.","Communication, Mental Health and Well-Being",Health Communication
2017-1824,2017,Paper Session,Indirect Effects of Loneliness on Substance Use Through Stress,3,"Loneliness is associated with a range of physical health problems, and health behaviors have been specified as one factor that explains the compromised health of lonely people. Accordingly, in this investigation we sought to test direct and indirect (through stress) effects of loneliness on substance use (i.e., alcohol consumption, drinking problems, and prescription medication use) over the course of 1 year in a 2-wave longitudinal study. These effects were tested in a sample of 210 young adults who completed self-report measures of loneliness and substance use at time 1, and then completed measures of stress and substance use at time 2. The results showed that loneliness did not have prospective direct effects on substance use, but that it did have significant indirect effects, through increased stress, on all indicators of substance use. These findings highlight the role of stress in compromising the health of lonely people by increasing their propensity for health risk behaviors.","Communication, Mental Health and Well-Being",Health Communication
2017-1825,2017,Paper Session,Adolescent Wishful Identification With Risky Media Characters and the Co-Occurrence of Alcohol Use and Sexual Behavior,6,"Approximately one in five sexually active adolescents consumes alcohol or drugs shortly before or during sexual behavior. The influence of media exposure on adolescent risk behaviors is documented, but behavioral combinations such as alcohol use and sexual activity remain understudied. The present study examines the exposure-behavior relationship using the context of TV portrayal of co-occurrence of both alcohol use and sexual behavior, and tests whether adolescent involvement with characters that engage in co-occurring sex and alcohol use onscreen may influence their likelihood of emulating that behavioral combination. Prototype perceptions for the type of person who engages in the combination of alcohol and sex is the hypothesized mediator. Results suggest that wishful identification with a media character who models the combination of alcohol and sex is associated with more positive prototype perceptions of people who behaviorally combine alcohol and sex, and those perceptions are associated with adolescents’ combining alcohol and sex.",Studies of Media and Contextual Effects on Health Behavior,Health Communication
2017-1826,2017,Paper Session,"Media Dependency, Third-Person Perception, and Influenza Vaccination Intention",2,"Limited research has focused on how media dependency may affect health behaviors during an influenza outbreak. Similarly, how the relationship between perceptions of media influence on others’ health behavior may affect one’s own health behavior has yet to be more fully explored. The current study examines the potential effects of both media dependency and third-person perception – via online news and social media – on young adults’ intentions to receive the H1N1-flu vaccine. A survey was conducted using a sample of 515 college students. Findings show that information dependency on online news instead of social media positively predicts an individual’s vaccination intention, aside from risk knowledge and the interaction between exposure to online news and social media. While perceived others’ vaccination intention mediates the relationship between perceived others’ online media dependency and one’s own vaccination intention, perception of others’ vaccination intention significantly predicts one’s own vaccination intention.",Studies of Media and Contextual Effects on Health Behavior,Health Communication
2017-1827,2017,Paper Session,"Do They Like it? Believe It? Cross-Cultural Consumer Responses to Pharmaceutical Advertising: Skepticism Toward and Liking of Different Drug Ad Appeals – Evidence From Brazil, Germany, and the US",3,"The pharmaceutical industry is of immense importance as a global sector, and drug manufacturers currently spend one third of all sales revenues on marketing their drugs. Yet, this increasing flood of drug advertising is not mirrored in research on the topic: Apart from a very small number of investigations, research on consumer attitudes towards advertising in general and non-prescription drug advertising in particular, is very limited, and consumer evaluations of over-the-counter (OTC) drug ads in a cross-cultural setting have hardly been addressed to date. Given the increased relevance of OTC drugs and OTC drug advertising, it is important to gain greater knowledge about consumers’ attitudes and skepticism toward commercial messages for such products. Previous research conducted by Diehl et al. (2008) revealed that consumers in both Germany and the United States did not much like pharmaceutical ads, but they believed them. Cross-cultural differences were found to exist between German and American respondents, as the latter were both less skeptical and exhibited more positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical ads.
This cross-cultural investigation extends previous research and examines how consumer attitudes and skepticism toward advertising in general, and pharmaceutical advertising in particular, as well as perceived legal regulations, can impact the evaluation of four different ad appeal types in three different countries (Brazil, Germany and the U.S.). A field study on three continents (total sample size: 727 subjects; ~ 240 subjects per country; non-student sample) revealed interesting findings. Consumers overall held quite positive attitudes towards advertising in general, but exhibited significantly less positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical advertising. Interestingly, however, with the exception of Brazil, respondents were significantly less skeptical of pharmaceutical promotions than of general promotional messages. The perception of a high level of legal regulation was found to reduce skepticism towards pharmaceutical advertising in general, as well as towards specific OTC drug ads; at the same time, the perception of regulatory oversight was also found to increase favorable attitudes towards pharmaceutical advertising in general, as well as towards specific OTC drug ads. Reasons explaining these results are addressed. In conclusion, study limitations as well as implications for further research are addressed.",Studies of Media and Contextual Effects on Health Behavior,Health Communication
2017-1828,2017,Paper Session,"Media Exposure, Online Appearance Interaction, Internalization, Social Comparison, and Male Body Dissatisfaction: An Integrated Examination From Sociocultural Perspective",1,"This paper examined the effect of online appearance interaction, new media exposure and mass media exposure in predicting young males’ body fat dissatisfaction and body muscle dissatisfaction. It also explored whether internalization and social comparison could mediated these three proposed media influence. A survey of 791 undergraduate males from Northwest, Northeast and Southeast parts of China found that online appearance interaction was directly associated with male’s body fat dissatisfaction, while new media exposure to perfect body ideal was associated with male’s body fat dissatisfaction.
In addition, effects of new media exposure, mass media exposure, and online appearance interaction on male body muscle dissatisfaction and body fat dissatisfaction were mediated by internalization. Besides, social comparison also mediated the influence of online appearance interaction on male body fat dissatisfaction. To conclude, it found that inspect of traditional influence from mass media exposure,both new media exposure to perfect body ideals and online appearance-related interaction have significant effects on young male’s body dissatisfaction. Besides, internalization and social comparison, the two mediators proposed in tripartite influence model, could be adapted to examine new media influences as well.",Studies of Media and Contextual Effects on Health Behavior,Health Communication
2017-1829,2017,Paper Session,Exploring the Role of Product Placements for Children`s Obesity-Related Shopping Behavior,1,"Children’s frequent exposure to advertisements for unhealthy food is linked to worldwide obesity. Policy interventions usually don’t address the implicit effect mechanisms of embedded advertising (unlike traditional advertising forms). As a basis for future policy strategy, this paper provides first-ever real-life findings on how product placements of candy in films influence children’s obesity-related selection behavior in an actual shopping situation. It allows for inferences about the underlying effect mechanisms. A field experiment was performed with children aged three to eight in natural viewing and shopping scenarios. Results of logistic regression moderation and mediation analysis show a major susceptibility to product placements via implicit persuasion, indicating that a completely different approach to prevention than the one used for explicit, traditional advertising is needed to address childhood obesity comprehensively. The results also indicate the challenge associated with identifying defense mechanisms against implicit persuasion. Theoretical and policy-related implications are discussed.",Studies of Media and Contextual Effects on Health Behavior,Health Communication
2017-1830,2017,Paper Session,FCC’s Indecency Regulation: A Comparative Analysis Between Broadcast and Online Media,2,"Lawmakers and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have implemented policies, many at the urging of special interest groups and parents, aimed at restricting content on broadcast television and radio and the Internet in the interest of protecting children. Through comparative analysis, this research studies the FCC broadcast regulations and online regulations to determine how indecency standards are applied in both mediums and whether there is common ground. The study finds that the courts accepted arguments for broadcasting that resembled a public interest approach but for the Internet, accepted arguments that included public interest and marketplace approaches. There is a component of both approaches in the current regulatory scheme for the Internet.",Challenges in Content Regulation,Communication Law & Policy
2017-1831,2017,Paper Session,Defaming Officials and Celebrities: Evolution of Libel Law and the SULLIVAN Impact in China,1,"Over the last 30 years, Chinese legislators and the Supreme Court have refused steadfastly to recognize the New York Times v. Sullivan principle to constrain politicians and famous persons from suiting for defamation. Likewise, no courts have cited or adopted the concept of public persons in libel suits brought by public officials. Yet this paper finds that an encouraging trend in Chinese libel law is that more and more local courts, though still few in numbers, have either cited or adopted the public persons v. private citizens concept in libel lawsuits brought by public figures/famous persons. Chinese judges have ruled in several celebrity libel cases that public figures, unlike ordinary citizens, should understand and endure the “possible minor harms” inflicted upon their reputation from negative media reporting. Through case and statutory analysis, this paper investigates the development of libel law in China, focusing on how public officials and public figures have been treated statutorily and judicially.",Challenges in Content Regulation,Communication Law & Policy
2017-1832,2017,Paper Session,Media and Governance Under Transformation:Chinese Propagate Policy in Popular Protest,1,"It’s widely believed that the Chinese government put much attention to censor the coverage to maintain regime stability. However, in recent years, news coverage on popular protest has been rising dramatically. How to make sense of the governments’ seemly contradicting behavior? One possible explanation is that the Chinese government adopted a more proactive one in response to the increasingly unimpeded information flow as well as the urgent need to rein in the local government officials. This article shows the specific strategies adopted by different level officials: the suppression approach will be taken by the local officials first, if the suppression failed, the rumor refutal approach, actively guide approach, propaganda approach will continue to be adopted by the higher-level government.",Challenges in Content Regulation,Communication Law & Policy
2017-1833,2017,Paper Session,Nanny State vs. Helpful Reminder: Evaluation of Privacy Nudges as Policy Interventions From a U.S.-German Perspective,2,"The protection of individuals’ online privacy is one of the main challenges for Internet policy. As the informed consent paradigm has largely failed to ensure privacy protection online, we examine nudging as a tool of soft paternalism as an alternative intervention to sensitize users towards online privacy. Building upon the criticism that nudging is judged for being manipulative and reducing people’s autonomy in decision making, we inquire how media users themselves evaluate nudges’ effectiveness and intrusiveness. In particular, we distinguish nudges either as targeting heuristic decision making (system 1) or deliberate decision making through education and information (system 2). Empirically, we carried out an interview study among German and US media users (N=52) to also address cross-cultural differences in the evaluation of privacy nudges. Our results point to a preference for system 2 nudges. Germans in particular perceive state interventions addressing privacy awareness as more acceptable and helpful.",Challenges in Content Regulation,Communication Law & Policy
2017-1834,2017,Paper Session,Online Content Policies in Brazil and Russia,2,"This article considers, from a comparative perspective, the policies on Online content in Brazil and Russia. It argues that the two countries’ policies are inefficient to ensure protection to freedom of expression online. Russian and Brazilian regulations are based on opposing principles and are, therefore, largely contrasting. Brazilian policies take a democratic stance reflecting the country’s ongoing democratization after a military dictatorship. In Russia, the concept of information security has driven content policy since 2000 and has promoted an anti-Western legal paradigm with regards to Internet regulation. In some way Russian policies represent somewhat of a rollback to the country’s Soviet past, and its censoring practices. The article examines the key principles, and statutory and judiciary elements grounding the regulation of online content in the two countries, identifying similarities, ambiguities and differences, to conclude that despite their initial contrasts both are facing similar challenges that need to be urgently addressed.",Challenges in Content Regulation,Communication Law & Policy
2017-1835,2017,Paper Session,Free Speech v. Privacy: Neighboring Implications of Revenge Pornography Legislation,1,"Pornography, which has legal precedent as free speech in the United States and Canada, has evolved with new communication media. In recent years, revenge pornography has been at the center of debate regarding free speech, pressing the question of legal harms and remedies. The United States has no law which criminalizes revenge pornography. Conversely, Canada enacted the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act (S.C. 2014, c. 31), which makes revenge pornography a federal, prosecutable crime. This paper analyzes both the United States and Canadian federal legislation relating to revenge pornography and the factors shaping each country's jurisprudence on publishing revenge pornography, weighing the issues of free speech v. privacy. The analysis provides insight into implications of national legislation and its potential effects on an international level.",Challenges in Content Regulation,Communication Law & Policy
2017-1836,2017,Paper Session,A Booster for Better Adaptation? The Effect of SNS on Acculturation of North Korean Refugee Youths,3,"How does Social Network Service (SNS) usage facilitate acculturation and eventual adaptation of North Korean refugee youths (NKRY)? It remains impossible for North Koreans to experience Social Network Service (SNS) in their home country because of rigid restriction. However, after becoming refugees through tough journeys to escape, they obtain a huge chance to use SNS in South Korea whose mobile environment is a world-class level. Dominating our everyday life including refugees’ one, SNS is regarded as a key factor to acculturation and their adaptation. This research examined the impact of SNS on NKRY in South Korea. Through a survey of 206 NKRY, we classified them into four SNS user types, and found that “Mix & Minglers” are better for acculturation as well as adaptation than other types. Moreover, the findings indicated that the degree of participation on SNS outweighs that of exposure on SNS in terms of acculturation and adaptation.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication

The goal of this study is to explore the socialization process of Chinese students in Korea at different socialization stages and the influence of SNS usages on three socialization stages.
Under the context of socialization stage model, this study performed in-depth interviews on ten Chinese students in Korea. The positive effect of SNS usages on their socialization mentioned by participants mainly include the elimination of stress, the promotion of Korean language, the formation and the maintenance of interpersonal relationships and the aid of school work. In addition, some suggestions for future research were proposed based on the findings of the interviews.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication

In-depth interviews and the screenshot of their posts on Social media were conducted and analyze with six Mainland postgraduates. Results suggest that although Macau is under multi-cultural environment with different educational and political system from the Mainland China, socio-cultural stresses were not as obvious as other stresses. Besides, their online life interwove with offline adaptation. Before their arrival, they have built a virtual but reliable social network with co-nationals (other mainlanders) via social media. This social network turned to be a solid social support after their arrival. With the exception of seeking help from co-nationals, social media also provided them a convenient way to contact with left-behind family and friends, and their self-presentation on social media reflected a part of their acculturative process.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication
2017-1839,2017,Paper Session,Refugee Integration and Social Media: A Local and Experiential Perspective,1,"The refugee crisis has spurred the rapid development of creative technology and social media applications to tackle the problem of refugee integration in many European countries. In this article, a qualitative study with 18 refugees from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan is presented in order to investigate the uses and purposes of social media associated to the different areas of refugee integration in the Netherlands. The results indicate that social media networking sites were particularly relevant for refugee participants to acquire language and cultural competences, as well as to build both bonding and bridging social capital. Another important finding concerns the role of government, host society and refugee actors in determining the way refugees experience with social media. Building on these results, a theoretical model for analysing refugee integration through social media is demonstrated.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication

Interviews with refugees living in and around the country’s capital of Amman suggest that these cultural similarities appear not to have made it any easier to establish meaningful connections with Jordanians, leaving the refugees in the same position as their fellow Syrian diaspora now scattered across Europe and beyond: often information-isolated and dependent on family and other Syrians rather than local information sources.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication
2017-1841,2017,Paper Session,The Impact of Time Spent Abroad and the Internet Toward Saudi Marriage Attitudes and Expectations,2,"This study investigated factors which impact Saudis’ expectations and attitudes towards marriage, particularly the potentially opposing influences of time spent abroad and time spent on the Internet. Both may have important roles in shaping Saudis’ attitudes towards the institution of marriage, by either exposing them to Western ideals or reinforcing traditional, collectivistic beliefs. These attitudes may then shape how their expectations for marriage. A questionnaire written in Arabic and English languages was distributed to Saudis inside and outside Saudi Arabia (n = 1,196). Results showed that time spent online had a stronger influence on Saudis’ attitudes and expectations toward marriage than extended face-to-face exposure to Western cultures. Interestingly, results also suggested that increased Internet usage may actually strength traditional beliefs by negatively affecting foreign attitudes towards marriage. Implications for the role of the Internet as a bridge between cultures are discussed.",Social Media and Cultural Adaptation,Intercultural Communication
2017-1842,2017,Paper Session,Creative Placemaking for Neighborhoods: Positioning a Game to Circulate Stories,3,"RESEARCH PAPER. Neighborhood placemaking is a growing opportunity for game design. Neighborhood cohesion has been linked to economic renewal, increased life expectancy, and greater civic engagement. However, for game design to be a powerful tool for urban communities, clearer ties to the tools and social practices of placemaking are necessary. This paper investigates how games can facilitate participation in creative placemaking, emphasizing the group storytelling of place. A case study of one game (Sankofa Says) is analyzed. Rather than analyze the impact on individuals, this study traces how it structures participation in communication practices. Playing the game involves circulating and performing the neighborhood stories of a specific city. Several design principles emerge that align with spreadable media and findings from Communication Infrastructure Theory (CIT). The results emphasize a shift away from placemaking with a single application (e.g., mobile games), and instead weaving together multiple communication platforms to facilitate circulation and spread.",Playful Learning?

The current study surveyed 260 players of the games Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire on both the motivations behind their use and the self-assessed educational impact of the games. Results showed that the motivations behind playing these games are tripartite, corresponding to social, entertainment and competitive motivations. Based on this, five motivational types were discovered: Enthusiastic, Social, Entertained, Competitive and Demotivated. These types differed among their learning effects and underlined the importance of use motivations. Overall, this form of digital gaming not only has the potential to directly transfer knowledge but also spur further self-administered information seeking.",Playful Learning?

The use of serious video games may be an effective and enjoyable way to increase positive health outcomes. Additionally, we sought to understand if these studies utilized theory and involved the parents in any way. For inclusion, studies had to 1) use a video game intervention; 2) test the impact on healthy behaviors or a chronic condition; 3) assess one additional psychosocial variable; 4) be an RCT; 5) have child participants 21 years or younger, and 6) be in English. The search resulted in 4,929 articles, with 1,917 articles resulting. Ten of those articles met full criteria.

This study assessed long-term effects of the social mechanics by integrating a systematic analysis of mobile games and a longitudinal study. The results showed that social mechanics of real SNS interactions increased later problem solving social skills for female game players. The same effect was not found for male players, instead, the amount of monthly payments increased later conversational social skills, but also game addiction scores and weekly game exposure. This study suggests effects of social mechanics have both positive and negative effects, and differ in gender, possibly in playing style.",Playful Learning?
