2014-0000,2014,Paper Session,Against Policy Failure: Designing a Media System That Enables “The Good Life”,1,"Any conception of the “good life” would likely include a media system founded on normative values like openness, diversity, and information rich. Enabling freedom of speech and other essential liberties, this system would need to be accessible and affordable to all members of society. However, commercialized media systems often run counter to these ideals. American digital communication systems have become dominated by oligopolies driven by a corporate libertarian logic—one that conflated individual freedoms with corporate privilege—that does not accommodate public interest principles in line with “good life” ideals.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0001,2014,Paper Session,Access to Knowledge and Cultivating the Good Life,1,"The Access to Knowledge [A2K] movement encompasses a broad theoretical, political and activist landscape that is concerned with the use of information and creative works outside the realm of intellectual property [IP]. A core principle of A2K is that the expansion of IP law is often anti-democratic, restrictive and an outright threat to cultural participation and creative practice. Restricting sharing, openness and access to information can prove a direct threat to “the good life” as imagined in an information society. In this position paper, I provide an overview of the problem of emerging IP enforcement regimes and explain how A2K approaches to information policy can cultivate social well-being.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0002,2014,Paper Session,Digital Human Capital: A Policy Framework for Transitioning From Digital Exclusion to a “Good Life”,3,"***This proposal is for the Communication Policy & Law extended session on ""The Good Life"" conference theme***

This position paper argues for policymakers to implement a Digital Human Capital framework for designing ICT programs. This approach would help move marginalized community members into mainstream society through computer literacy initiatives that also address social exclusion. It has the potential to shift digitally excluded residents from a life on the periphery to, ideally, a “good life” with professional and educational opportunities.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0003,2014,Paper Session,The Goods Life: Local Journalism From Public Good to Merit Good,1,"This position paper contributes to the discussion of how to ensure the sustainability of journalism by arguing for a rhetorical and semantic shift away from labeling journalism as a “public good” to thinking about it as a “merit good” (Musgrave, 1959). While public goods suggest regulatory intervention only to the point that “respect[s] the wishes of consumers,” merit goods suggest regulatory intervention regardless of consumption habits (Eecke, 1998, p.5). That is to say that merit goods are deemed so socially valuable that they should be provided regardless of consumer behavior. Positioning journalism as a merit good, rather than a public good lends political economic leverage for increased regulatory and legislative support for journalism, and may revive efforts to ensure the sustainability of journalism, particularly at the local level.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0004,2014,Paper Session,The Right to Communicate as a Foundation for the Good Life,1,"This position paper argues that communication is a basic human right, and therefore a fundamental aspect of the good life. Accordingly, the right to communicate should be formally codified in international human rights law. Human rights are international norms that protect each human being from an array of abuses and seek to identify basic needs necessary to lead a minimally good life. Human rights are a “realistic utopia” in that they institutionalize the utopian ideal of a just society in the laws of modern constitutional democracies (Habermas, 2010). These rights exist as ideal statements that may be embodied in laws and regulations at local, national, or international levels. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations, 1948) and other treaties serve as standards which identify norms to be embodied. In this regard, communication laws and policies can help to structure the good life within communities.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

Position Paper – Communication Law & Policy and “the good life”
Revenge Porn: Criminalizing the Posting of Provocative Pictures When Breakups Go Bad

It has been dubbed “involuntary porn.” A couple breaks up and one of the parties posts once-intimate nude photos of the other all over the internet – sometimes including identifying information such as the subject’s name and address.
Hurtful and humiliating, yes. But should such cruel conduct be criminalized? That’s the law on the books now in California and New Jersey, while other jurisdictions consider outlawing “revenge porn” in the digital age.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

2014-0009,2014,Paper Session,Contexts of Digital Surveillance and Trust: Ethical Action and the Good Life,1,"Ethical and legal charges about digital invasions of privacy usually surface in response to some apparent surveillance. Nissenbaum (2010) claims that privacy can be understood within a structure of “contextual integrity” in which streams of personal data, originating in different social contexts, are handled by entrenched socio-legal conventions. These conventions may be violated by the monitoring practices associated with information technologies; thus contextual integrity is broken. Privacy violations, then, are judged in accordance with the goals and values of a specific context. This research proposes a contextual reading of surveillance as it pertains to Nissenbaum’s contexts of privacy and the notion of contextual integrity and ethics. Specifically, it examines principles of “the good life” in terms of ethical responsibilities in legal remedies for privacy violations. In what contexts do we expect surveillance? How do “caring” forms of surveillance modify our perceptions of privacy rights? What technological routines support surveillance? What are the implications for human dignity and respect? How have current legal regimes surrounding privacy neglected basic notions of humanity that contribute to “the good life”? Using a critical theoretical perspective, this paper seeks to understand what surveillance contexts mean for individuals in terms of values, the law, and morality.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0010,2014,Paper Session,Available Resources as an Indicator of Brand Placement Processing,6,"The present study applies the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) to persuasive communication. Specifically, it aims to investigate whether and how (1) a brand logo placement in a video clip affects cognitive processing resources, and (2) the measurement of available resources with STRT reflects message elaboration. In a between-subjects experiment, 69 students were shown a video clip including brand placements with varying prominence. STRTs were measured immediately after the placement during the clip, and cognitive and affective processing measures were assessed after the clip. Analyses showed faster STRTs for prominent placements compared to nonprominent placements, and faster STRTs for nonprominent compared to no placement. This pattern indicated that with increasing logo prominence, message recipients had more resources available. The measured resources mirrored the cognitive and affective measures of message elaboration, indicating that brand logo prominence affects message elaboration, and that elaboration can be validly assessed through STRTs.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0011,2014,Paper Session,Beyond Time and Frequency: Attending to Attention in Media Multitasking,5,"The purpose of this study is to extend assessment of media multitasking to situations that involve more than two activities and to introduce attention as an additional outcome variable to time and frequency measures of media multitasking. Both frequency and attention measures supported the hypothesis drawn from limited capacity. Two-group multitasking activities were pursued more frequently than three-group multitasking activities and activities with TV/Video in the mix were pursued more frequently than activities without TV/Video in the mix. Further, attention allotted to the primary task decreased with increasing number of activities in the multitasking mix. The sharpest decline in attention to the primary task occurred when the number of activities increased from two to three. Overall, these findings suggest that time, frequency and attention are a triumvirate of variables that should be considered in concert when measuring multitasking.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0012,2014,Paper Session,Can Exemplars Trigger a Spiral of Silence?,3,"Research on exemplification has shown that exemplars can affect people’s perceptions of public opinion. More specifically, the distribution of exemplars, that is the proportion of individuals expressing a certain opinion, influences the way people perceive current opinion distributions in society. Climate of opinion perception is also an integral part of Noelle-Neumann’s spiral of silence theory which posits that people will fear to become socially isolated when they express opinions on morally loaded issues which contradict public opinion. They will therefore refrain from expressing such opinions in public. The current experimental study links research on exemplars and the spiral of silence by testing the effects of exemplar distributions on individual public opinion perception, fear of isolation, and the tendency to speak out. As a stimulus an online discussion group on Facebook was presented where we manipulated user comments regarding the issue of evicting violent immigrants.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0013,2014,Paper Session,Effects of Testimonial and Informational Comments on News Perception,2,"Online reader comments (ORCs) are located in close spatial proximity to the online news stories eliciting them. Previous studies have found that such ORCs can affect perception of news stories or issues discussed in them. The purpose of the current study is to build on this growing pool of literature on ORCs by examining how two types of ORCs found on health news websites, testimonial and informational, affect readers’ perceptions of credibility, newsworthiness, quality and liking of the professional health news content. The study will also investigate the possible moderating role of issue involvement. Petty’s Elaboration Likelihood Model will provide the theoretical framework for the study.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0014,2014,Paper Session,Engaging Readers: What Makes Readers Actively Seek More Information During Controversial Message Processing,5,"This study tests (1) the direct effects of personal traits, like need for cognition, open-mindedness, and issue interests, on information seeking behavior, and (2)whether the effects of these personal traits are contingent on characteristics of the issue context in which information seeking takes place. We use the emerging science of nanotechnology as a case study because, despite low levels of awareness (Smith et al., 2011), previous research has found that strongly held values and other types of heuristic cues are used by individuals to form opinions about the issue even in the absence of issue-related knowledge (Brossard et al., 2009). This work finds significant direct effects and interaction effects of personal traits and issue-interest factors on information seeking processes. Implications for the theoretical understanding of information processing of controversial science issues are discussed.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0015,2014,Paper Session,Exploring Effects of Controlled and Automatic Processes for Cognitive Information Processing on Perceived Interactivity,3,"The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) could offer an explanation for the automatic process of how an audience reacts to online interactive elements. The other explanation will be the audience’s intention for future use of the website.
RQ1: How does intention affect users’ perceived level of interactivity of the website?
H1: When exposed to self-relevant interactive features that are in-line with their intention, appetitive activation will be enacted, and memory span will be higher than when the users are exposed to other neutral stimuli.
RQ2: How are controlled and automatic processes for cognitive information processing taking place in the presence of different interactive elements?
The participants will be randomly assigned to a 3 (intention: exploratory vs. information-seeking for self vs. information-seeking to help others) x 3 (motivational state: appetitive vs. aversive vs. control) between-subjects design.

The stages from the Precaution Adoption Process Model were included in the analysis as a moderator. The PRISM fit the data well. Moreover, the results showed overall model differences among people who have not decided to take action about hydraulic fracturing, people who have decided to take action, and people who have decided not to take action.

2014-0017,2014,Paper Session,"Resources Available to Processing Antismoking PSAs as a Function of Smoking Cues, Argument Strength, and Structural Complexity",1,"The current study examines how cognitive resources are allocated and required to processing audio and video information of antismoking PSAs, as function of three message characteristics: the argument strength (AS) of messages, the presence of smoking cues, and the structural complexity. By conceptualizing the three variables in terms of resources required and resources allocated, this study predicts resources available to processing antismoking PSAs by employing Secondary Reaction Time Measures accompanied by audio and video recognition. This abstract reported preliminary result supporting that strong argument elicit more resource allocated and smoking cues have impact on both resource allocation and the amount of resources required to process. Further, the result also suggests that structural complexity should be considered to explore available resources influenced by various message’s features.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0018,2014,Paper Session,"GIFTS: Communication, Gender, and Theory: Exploring the “Good Life” of One’s Childhood",1,"Through this activity, students recognize and relate communication and gender theories to real life scenarios. By applying their own childhood experiences, students engage directly with gender and communication theories. Moreover, when students apply these course concepts to their own childhood memories, their individual voices and perspectives enter the conversation. This activity encourages students to be active learners and critical thinkers in the classroom. After discussing which theories students perceive impacted their childhood memories, the teacher should poll the students to see which theories resonated with them the most. Even though gender is a culturally based construct, students often do not perceive it as having an impression on their gender construction. Rather than the teacher imposing this message directly, the results of this activity provide students with the opportunity to assess to what extent gender is a perceived cultural concept in their interpretations about gender and their own identity construction.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2014-0021,2014,Paper Session,GIFTS: Intercultural Transmedia Storytelling,1,"“Intercultural Transmedia Storytelling” is a bold, engaging concept, which helps multilingual, multicultural students, coming from different educational systems, assessment and learning styles, find fresh, fun methods to develop their awareness of story, exposition, and the respective power of sound and image and their ability to communicate their ideas. Based on intercultural and media components, the content is adaptable and the structure is flexible enough that it can be easily adapted (in its entirety or by using individual components) to different circumstances, for workshops or courses and different age groups. The key components include harnessing the power of sound and the visual in conveying story, combining the components in various media and individual and group basic storyboarding and transmedia storyboarding exercises. “Presentation assessments” throughout allow the “storyteller” to understand the audience perspective as well in adapting content, format and style.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2014-0022,2014,Paper Session,GIFTS: Internet-Based Audience Awareness Activity,1,"This critical thinking activity was created for an online upper-division course taken by communication and writing majors. However, the activity could be used in any online or face-to-face course dealing with persuasion and reader/audience awareness. This activity helps students learn to tailor communication to a specific audience. After the activity, students are able to:

* Dissect an organization’s self-published documents to extract paradigms, priorities, and preferences.

* Predict whether a particular organization would likely accept a planned proposal.

* Defend their predictions with linguistic evidence found in the organization’s documents.

This activity allows online teachers to comment on student opinions conversationally and in front of the whole group, as is so often done in a face-to-face classroom. This activity encourages students to use the Internet to search for specific information, make a decision about that information, and find supporting evidence to justify that decision to others.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2014-0023,2014,Paper Session,GIFTS: Nonverbal Speech Delivery and Humor: Discovering the “Good Side of Your Face”,1,"This activity addresses the need for students to develop nonverbal delivery skills and improve their proficiency in critical thinking. First, it introduces students to the seven nonverbal behavioral categories of speech delivery. Class discussion is facilitated through the application of these ideas to popular television sitcoms. Because the students watch the video first without any sound, they are given the opportunity to critique the speaker’s performance of nonverbal cues. Once they listen to the speaker’s message with his/her nonverbal behavior, students determine to what extent the speaker’s nonverbal behavior is effective. By opting to focus solely on the nonverbal cues first, this activity connects a speaker’s core message to the nonverbal behavior he/she demonstrates. Students evaluate and critique the speaker’s nonverbal cues. Ultimately, the activity motivates students to learn more about enhancing their own speech delivery by constructively evaluating speech deliveries on sitcoms.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2014-0027,2014,Paper Session,GIFTS: Using the Sandtray to teach Mindfulness of the Good Life,1,"College students are at a time in their lives of developing identity and autonomy. However, they often get torn in our incredibly networked society between the goals their parents want for them, what society says is the best career, and what is currently reinforced in media. Ellen Langer writes about the importance of mindfulness in interpersonal communication. This activity uses a sandtray to increase intrapersonal awareness through art. Based on work done by Rachel Naomi Remen, a physician who has used the sandtray across multiple groups, this activity uses the sandtray as a tool to explore the Good Life. Using miniature toys, students create a picture of their life journey and examine the event schema and personal narratives they have developed.

2014-0029,2014,Paper Session,Complex Dynamic Systems in Communication Research,1,"Almost all communication research can be described as seeking to understand different types of dynamic systems--systems that change over time. This paper introduces mathematical properties of dynamic systems to communication research and discusses their implications for understanding communication phenomena. Using what can be described mathematically about such systems, scholars should be able to better understand and explain the predictive boundaries of their theories. Specifically, this paper argues first, that the majority of systems described in communication research are complex in nature, as they are made up of large groups of simultaneously interacting components. Then the paper describes major properties of such systems and their implications on predictability of behavior.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0030,2014,Paper Session,"A Dynamic, Human-Centered Conceptualization of Flow, Presence, and Transportation States",3,"This paper builds on previous conceptualizations of flow, presence and transportation from a motivated cognition perspective (Lang, 2006; Lang, 2009) and argues that they are the result of the motivated cognitive system, which is a self-organizing dynamic system composed of the human information processing and motivational subsystems, settling into different attractor states. Literature on each of the states was examined and predictions about their formation and concomitant cognitive and motivational responses were made based on theoretical statements of scholars in the field. In Study 1, predictions were made and generally supported regarding the types of motivationally relevant information that would create each distinct state. In Study 2, certain types of psychophysiological and behavioral responses were expected to be present during consumption of mediated messages previously identified as producing each distinct state. Limitations and conclusions are discussed, and future research is proposed.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0031,2014,Paper Session,A Simulation of a Dynamic Theory of Reasoned Action With Shock: Implications for the Fit of the Cross-Sectional Theory of Reasoned Action,5,"Recently, a longitudinal version of Fishbein and Ajzen’s (1975) TRA, the dynamic theory of reasoned action (DTRA), was developed (Boster, Shaw, & Liang, 2011). Simulations of the DTRA show that it predicts that the strength of endogenous autoregression parameters influences model equilibrium, on the fit of the cross-sectional model of the TRA, and on changes in the distributional properties of endogenous variables. This manuscript extends that program of research by simulating the effects of a shock, such as a persuasive message, to a system of attitudes (A), subjective norms (N), behavioral intentions (I), and behavior (B) that begins in disequilibrium (Simulation 1) and to a system that begins in equilibrium (Simulation 2) in the DTRA. Effects of a shock on the fit of the cross-sectional TRA model and on the number of trials required for A, I, B, and the four-variable system to reach equilibrium are assessed and discussed.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems

2014-0033,2014,Paper Session,Blending Behavioral and Cognitive Science to Produce a More Rigorous Theory of Human Communication,1,"This paper advances a paradigm of communication systems theory blending behavioral and cognitive sciences. The paradigm marries traditional communication science observation (behavioral science approach) to a model of neural processing from cognitive science. The mechanism tying the two together is neural synchronization. We explicate the distinction between behavioral science and cognitive science, propose a general theory of communication informed by cognitive and behavioral science, and provide a number of examples of how this theory/paradigm may expand our understanding of complex communication phenomena.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0034,2014,Paper Session,Can Identity Serve Simultaneously as a Moderator and Mediator of Communication Effects? Evidence for the Prism Model,2,"A recently proposed model of communication effects (the prism model; CITE WITHHELD) argues for the potential of identity to serve both as a moderator and mediator of communication effects on behavior-relevant outcomes. Although these intervening roles have been studied in previous work, typically only one of the roles is examined at a time. This may be surprising because highly influential views of identity including the social identity perspective suggest the potential for these roles to be co-occurring. The prism model brings these roles together in a simultaneous model with implications for hypothesizing about communication effects. This paper builds on conceptual development of the model by presenting empirical evidence based on re-analysis of experimental data. Results provide support for the prism model's propositions.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0035,2014,Paper Session,Comprehension Models of Audiovisual Discourse Processing,4,"The landscape model of comprehension maintains that comprehending involves integrating past knowledge and new information into a coherent situation model to make sense of interconnected concepts and ideas. Previous research testing the landscape model of text comprehension has primarily relied on factual stories. This study applied the landscape model to three clips from entertainment programming. Across all clips, the landscape model explained 85% or more of the variance in participants’ memory for the clips. In addition, the results support the more recent dual-code version of the landscape model, which assumes separate verbal and visual representations of the story in memory. Finally, this study begins to explore the potential merger of the landscape model and the event-indexing model. The event-indexing model hypothesizes five dimensions of information that are critical to narrative comprehension: time, space, motivation, causation, and entities. This study provides preliminary data supporting the value of merging these two models.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0036,2014,Paper Session,Evaluating Movies: A Review and a Framework for Investigating Underlying Psychological Processes,4,"Evaluation is pervasive and vital for daily life: humans constantly evaluate what is good or bad for them, be it in a more automatic or in a more deliberate way. In the present paper we examine the concept of evaluation in the context of entertainment research with focus on movies. Our aim is to delineate the role of evaluation before, during, and after watching a movie and highlight its similarities and differences to common related concepts (e.g., enjoyment and appreciation). After selectively reviewing previous research that dealt with such concepts, we describe the associative–propositional evaluation model as a useful tool to unravel underlying psychological processes of movie evaluations and discuss its advantages for application in entertainment research.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0037,2014,Paper Session,3D Screening and Entertainment: A Model of Entertainment for Cinema,1,"3D screenings increased in popularity and it seems that 3D might be ready to stand the test of time. To examine the effect of 3D on the experience of entertainment we refer to the model of entertainment by Vorderer, Klimmt, & Ritterfeld (2004), in which technological as well as personal prerequisites can induce entertainment. The model was further adapted for the cinema context by including the appeal of special effects, fanship, age and gender. To figure out the impact of the suggested prerequisites we conducted a field study comparing the entertainment experiences of 2D and 3D audiences’ of the same fantasy movies in a between subject design (N= 289). Results showed that the technological features cannot predict entertainment. However, the feelings of presence, the appeal of the special effects and fanship are predictors for entertainment.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0038,2014,Paper Session,Egocentric Projection Into Story Characters,2,"Understanding how audiences perceive narrative characters is important to understanding how audiences engage in a story and how persuasive and/or entertaining narrative messages work. The current studies examine to what extent and when do audience members understand a character’s mental processing by egocentric projection—projection of the audience member’s own mental processes into the mind of the character. The results of two experiments indicate that this depends on a number of factors including familiarity with the character, whether audiences anchor on the self, availability of mental resources and existence of competing stereotypes. Overall the results support theories indicating that egocentric projection is most likely for unfamiliar characters. This study helps clarify some common misunderstandings of egocentric projection and shed light on the mechanism of narrative processing.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0039,2014,Paper Session,Experiencing Sports Entertainment in the Light of Fan Group Involvement,7,"Our research addresses the experience and cognitive processing of television-based sports entertainment. We conducted an experimental study during the 2013th European soccer Champions League Finals in London, focusing on supporters of the final teams Borussia Dortmund and FC Bayern München. Fans were compared on media entertainment experience as well as the fan-specific involvement in terms of the affective impact of the game. Furthermore, it was examined whether different fan groups show different cognitive processing patterns of the game. Results show stable but strongly diverging fan cultures that influence the cognitive processing of the game.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0040,2014,Paper Session,Media Entertainment and Well-Being: Linking Hedonic and Eudaimonic Entertainment to Media-Induced Recovery and Vitality,4,"This paper addresses the notion of two-factor models of entertainment and their impact on well-being via a hedonic and a eudaimonic route. It is suggested that media-induced recovery and the satisfaction of respective needs can provide an important link in bridging these two entertainment experiences (hedonic and eudaimonic) with well-being after media consumption. Using structural equation modelling, relationships between hedonic/eudaimonic entertainment experiences, involvement, enjoyment, recovery experience and vitality as recovery outcome were tested experimentally (N=120). Results suggest that satisfying recovery needs is achieved via hedonic as well as via eudaimonic experiences by enhancing either relaxation or mastery. Both pathways to recovery are positively related to an increase in vitality and thereby able to foster well-being.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0041,2014,Paper Session,Same Same But Different: Antecedents and Consequences of Eudaimonic Entertainment in a Political Format,1,"Two studies were conducted to look into the influence of entertainment experiences as need satisfaction on information processing. Self determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and the affect infusion model (Forgas, 1995) serve as theoretical basis. First, an online survey (N = 82) aimed to establish existing measures in the new context of political talk shows and test the hypotheses without the influence of a laboratory setting. In the second study a 2 x 2 x2 (autonomy on/off, competence on/off, positive/negative video) mixed design laboratory experiment with 94 subjects was conducted to account for the causal relationship between needs and entertainment experience. Results from both studies support an influence of need satisfaction on eudaimonic entertainment. Furthermore, an influence of eudaimonic entertainment on substantive processing is established.

2014-0042,2014,Paper Session,Story Character’s Goal Achievement and Goal Pursuit on Readers’ Implicit and Explicit Goal,2,"Previous studies indicated that when readers observe other’s goal achievement, they become less likely to implicitly pursue the goal—including health-related goals. However, observing other’s goal achievement may explicitly encourage people to model the observed behaviors. In an experiment, participants read a story in which a story character succeeded in losing weight (goal-achieved) or failed it (goal-failed), and she continues or discontinues pursuing that goal. When the story character continued to pursue the goal, readers implicitly pursued the observed goal more than when the character discontinued it while the story character’s goal achievement did not have an effect. On the other hand, when the character’s goal was achieved, as readers perceived more similarity with the story character, explicit behavioral intention toward diet-related behaviors increased. The results indicate vicarious goal satiation occurs because story characters stopped pursuing the goal—not because they succeeded or failed.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0043,2014,Paper Session,"The Influence of Media Portrayals of Care, Loyalty, and Purity on Elevation and Connectedness With Humanity",5,"The purpose of this research was to examine how media portrayals of morality focused on care, purity, or loyalty interact with the moral domains of viewers to elicit the emotional response of elevation and resultant feelings of connectedness with humanity. An experiment was conducted, with results showing that the portrayal of care elicited the strongest feelings of elevation, followed by loyalty. Both of these portrayals were associated with feelings of greater connectedness, mediated by elevation responses. The effect of care portrayals was most pronounced among viewers with progressive moral attitudes emphasizing care and fairness over loyalty, purity, and authority. The portrayal of purity not only failed to elicit moral evaluation, but appeared to dampen this response among individuals higher on progressive moral attitudes.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0044,2014,Paper Session,Viewing Meaningful Entertainment and Altruistic Behavior: Investigating Potential Mediators,2,"Recent research has shown that exposure to meaningful entertainment media content, or that which shows examples of moral beauty, may influence not only affective responses, but also altruistic behavior. This process has been said to be an effect of a set of feelings referred to as “elevation,” although the processes by which the effects take place have not been explored. This experiment (N=107) showed that participants watching a meaningful clip of a television show were more likely to engage in helping behavior than those who watched a non-meaningful clip. The effect of the clip was mediated by the degree to which the clip produced mixed affective response in participants. Although clip meaningfulness led to increased empathy with the character and increased feelings of elevation, neither of these predicted helping behavior after controlling for clip meaningfulness. Helping behavior also increased when the help recipient was less similar to the participants (age, race, and university affiliation).",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0045,2014,Paper Session,Communication Can Reduce Stereotyping Behavioral Decisions,3,"Stereotypes are oversimplifications of a complex social environment, and they can contribute to a host of social problems. Based on decision science literature, we conceptualize stereotype decisions as a hybrid of both rule-based and experience-based decision process, and explore how feedback of decisions and the way we communicating categorization information during the decision process can help reduce stereotyping behavior. We designed a novel decision game experiment to study how people make interpersonal interaction decisions based on the stereotypes provided in the cover story at the beginning of the game and trial-by-trial feedback over time throughout the game. In addition, the decision trials required different communication effort for the categorization information during the decision process. Through a multilevel time series logit model, we found that communication of categorization information and feedback information can significantly reduce stereotyping behavioral decision.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems

Besides contact lists and (discussion) groups, these networks feature detailed information on working history, as well as categories regarding personal but job-related information but have so far largely been ignored. In the context of discussions about a wider inclusion of women in the workforce, it is worthwhile to investigate similarities and differences in the use of self-presentational resources that might have consequences with regard to visibility and hiring probability. One can expect differences between men and women resulting from gender roles and stereotypes that suggest corresponding behavioral preferences. The study analyzes similarities and differences in the profiles of men and women with regard to the outer form, quantitative aspects, and qualitative presentation, finding that there are indeed several differences.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems

An experimental research design utilized a computerized simulation game to measure participants' cognitive performance. 114 participants were assigned randomly to four groups and one control group. Manipulation achieved by exposing participants to messages (using ‘Push’ technology) in Mobile phones (SMS/MMS) and online application (text/banner). A significant difference between experimental groups was found regarding the time of the task. Analysis also reveals a significant effect of the richness of the message and a main effect of the media type.This research seeks to broaden our understanding of the incorporation of information technology, such as mobile phones and the Internet, as an integral part of the workplace.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0048,2014,Paper Session,Online and Retrospective Negation of Media Stereotypes,2,"The present study investigated the negation (e.g., “No! This is not true!”) of media stereotypes and its consequences on media-induced changes of prejudice. This study is the first to measure negation during exposure by utilizing a process-oriented continuous measurement approach with eye tracking methodology. The data show that individuals negated the repeated depictions of the “criminal foreigner” stereotype during reception (online) as well as in a subsequent situation (retrospective). However, they rarely negated the stereotypic information directly at the moment of encoding. This is unfortunate, because scholarship has indicated that negation directly at the moment of encoding may have important beneficial consequences. In addition, this study investigated negation’s consequences on media-induced attitude change: Whereas some scholars have argued that media effects on attitudes typically occur during exposure, others highlighted the situation when the attitude judgment is constructed. Our data emphasize the importance of the judgment construction situation.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0049,2014,Paper Session,Parsing Gender Gaps on News Memory Making and Decay,4,"This experiment investigated gender differences in audiovisual news acquisition by manipulating emotional personalization in stories and measuring memory and comprehension at two time points, one week apart. Data (N=80) offer evidence that gender gaps are intricate and resisted uniformity across three memory and five comprehension measures. Over time, memory decay showed up strong but without substantial gender variance. Free recall tests point to women as having an edge over men. Recognition and comprehension did not vary across gender but men were more efficient (used fewer words) than women in articulating what they learned from news. Education of participants (a control factor) revealed that highly educated women gave lengthy responses to open-ended items without improving accuracy in articulating the main point of stories. Taken together, these findings reveal the value of employing multiple memory measures to map an overview of where future gender gap studies might be productively focused.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems

2014-0051,2014,Paper Session,No Woman No Cry?: How Televised Women’s Football Affects Moods and Judgments,3,"The objective of this article is to improve the understanding of mood and judgment effects evoked by major televised sport events like national football matches. According to disposition theory of sport spectatorship, viewers’ affective experiences, specifically their moods, are assumed to be effected by the outcomes of the matches they watch. This study tests whether these mood effects depend on viewers’ team identification as well as viewers’ sex. Moreover, past research has indicated that mood changes as effects of sport viewing could influence viewers’ subsequent judgments in line with feeling-as-information theory. Based on this line of arguments, a quasi-experimental pre-post-test study with 180 participants was conducted to assess the moods and judgments (self-confidence, evaluation of the economic situation, government satisfaction) of viewers before and after a win and a defeat of the German national football team during the 2011 women’s FIFA World Cup. The results support disposition theory of sport spectatorship as well as feeling-as-information theory and give new insights into the moderating role of team identification and sex.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems

2014-0054,2014,Paper Session,Audience Targeting Strategies for Seeking Information on Facebook,2,"Because Facebook acts simultaneously as a social and informational resource, using the site to seek information has become common practice. Social networks provide better information for more nuanced needs and may offer additional social benefits. However, little is known about how to access knowledge that various topic experts in these networks hold. By targeting specific friends using the various communication features offered by Facebook, individuals may obtain more relevant information with less network disruption. The present study uses a within-subjects experiment in which participants ask a question of their Facebook networks using four audience targeting strategies ranging from public to private: 1) status update to the full network, 2) status update to a custom audience, 3) post on a friend’s wall, and 4) private message.

2014-0055,2014,Paper Session,Credibility of Anonymity in Third-Party Content Online,2,"A growing controversy over communication and pseudonymity online has led many news organizations to ban the use of pseudonyms in online commenting (e.g., The Buffalo News and the Voice of San Diego). This trend has developed without sufficient empirical evidence to show that pseudonymous comments are less civil or less credible (Reader, 2012; Sullivan, 2010). This study will attempt to move us closer to a more thorough understanding of reader perception of the credibility of online comments. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion, this study will examine whether levels of anonymity (providing pseudonyms vs. real names) really make a difference from the perspective of a reader. More specifically, we investigate whether individual difference variables, specifically people’s tendency to think deeply about issues, and the comment’s argument strength can affect how credible readers perceive the source of the comments to be in the presence or absence of source’s real identification.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0056,2014,Paper Session,Discussing News on Facebook? The Interplay of Sharing of and Commenting on Online News Articles,3,"Similar to interpersonal communication, social media enable both manifestations of diffusion and discussion of online news content in one platform. On Facebook, content can be “shared”, i.e., posted in one’s own profile and thus allowing for further dissemination within the private social network and comments on the post, which falls within the realm of follow-up communication. In order to shed further light on this double-role of Facebook in news diffusion, we analyzed the interplay of Facebook sharing and commenting behavior of online news content. In order to do so, we developed a large-scale driven methodical framework which matches standardized information on online news articles with the available indicators of interest on Facebook (i.e., comments, shares). Altogether, 39,386 articles from major online news outlets in Germany and the U.S. were analyzed, summing up to a total of 10,972,128 observations of sharing and commenting behavior of these articles.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems

The Effects of Message Valence on the Willingness to Respond to SNS Status Updates,2,"The present study aims at exploring the communicative norms and expectations in Social Network Sites (SNSs). We argue that a “positivity bias” in SNS communication can restrict the availability of public social support via public responses to status updates. Our data derived in an online experiment (N=870) show that users are significantly less willing to respond to a negative status update with a public comment than to a positive status update. In contrast, users show a higher willingness to react to a negative status update with a private message than to a positive status update. These effects were moderated by the strength of the relationship between the sender and receiver of the status update and mediated by perceived message appropriateness and perceived need for social support. The results suggest that SNS users tend to canalize supportive reactions to negative experience of their SNS friends through private modes of communication.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems

A recent study by American College Health Association (ACHA, 2012) shows, more than 25% of college students have been diagnosed or treated by a professional for a mental health condition within the past year. College students tend to suffer from mental health problems for a variety of reasons. Being away from families and friend circles, facing new and unfamiliar environment, and peer pressures and fear for uncertainty all contribute to the problem (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2012). Naturally, social support gained through social network has been proposed to be a plausible buffer protecting college students from mental illness (Feyza et al., 2008). The proposed study aims to examine the relationship between social media use and social support among college students, and propose constructive ways that social media can be used to help build social support among college students.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems

Due to the increasing importance of social networking sites as sources of information, news media organizations have set up Facebook channels in which they publish news stories or links to articles. This research investigated how journalistic texts are perceived in this new context and how reactions of other users change the influence of the main articles. In an online experiment (N = 197), a Facebook posting of a reputable news site and the corresponding article were shown. The type of user comments and the number of likes were systematically varied. Negative comments diminished persuasive effects of the article, particularly when they included arguments instead of subjective opinions. However, huge number of likes did not lead to conformity effects.

2014-0061,2014,Paper Session,A Case Study in Computational Content Analysis: Comparisons of Sentiment Analysis Methods on News Media,1,"The advent of the Internet has been a boon for the field of communication. The digital mediums of online communication platforms hold promise for a new era of quantitative, data-driven analyses of communicative behaviors. Content analysis specifically stands to benefit greatly from advances in computer science, particularly text as data approaches. However, not all computational methods are equally suited to the content analysis domains typically studied in communication. In this paper, I survey existing text as data methods as they pertain to sentiment analysis, including the assumptions that are foundational to each method (and which are often ignored in the pursuit of automated content analysis). I review the practicalities of each of these approaches as they pertain specifically to the types of content analysis performed in social science as opposed to computer science. Finally, I present an analysis of the relationship between average daily news sentiment for 24 news outlets on presidential favorability ratings that allows for the comparison of each of these methods against each other. I find that the daily average sentiment computed by these models produce point estimates that are substantively and significantly different from each other. Additionally, I find evidence that the use of one model over another can lead to substantively different inferences regarding the relationship of news sentiment to public opinion.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

First, this computational approach employs TNA connectedness measures of betweenness centrality and degree common in network analysis eliminating the need for subjective validity and reliability coding. Second, TNA measures are not based on the most frequently counted words, but emphasize relationships or connections among words or communities of words. Third, our TNA is informed by the Landscape Model of Reading Comprehension, which is a reader oriented theory, therefore focusing on the message that is likely received from reading the content. Last, TNA provides a graphical visualization of the analysis that provides an easily understood overview of the entire text. The graphical depiction clearly identifies key words and major themes. We illustrate the benefits of this method by analyzing the 2002 and 2012 ExxonMobil CEO CSR introductory letters.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems
2014-0063,2014,Paper Session,Development of a Short Measure of Media Multitasking for Adolescents,3,"Despite increasing research interest in media multitasking, there is a lack in measures of media multitasking that can be used with younger people. The aim of the present study was to develop a new measurement of media multitasking that is 1) short but still able to fully capture the concept of media multitasking, 2) normally distributed among adolescents, and 3) internally and externally valid. Data for this study were collected at six urban and suburban high schools. In total, 523 adolescents aged 11 to 15 (48.2% girls) participated in this study. The short measure seems to be a reliable and valid measure of media multitasking that is normally distributed among adolescent samples. Due to its brevity it can be easily applied in survey studies among children and adolescents. Because of its high utility it may be an adequate alternative for existing extensive measures of media multitasking.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

In testing, researchers often face a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency specifically with regard to the number of raters per message. In this light, the current study examines how the number of raters affects the accuracy of overall ratings relative to the population. Five data sets evaluating anti-smoking messages were utilized. Bootstrapped samples and populations are compared using various techniques. Results suggest that after 23 to 25 raters per message, increasing the number of raters does not enhance evaluation accuracy appreciably. Nonetheless, variation across messages and tolerance level for misclassification may require more or fewer raters per message.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

Without such systematic research, it is difficult to know the true effect of media violence exposure on aggressive behavior. To enable critical evaluations of past studies, as well as optimal measurement in future research, this study assesses the reliability and validity of two commonly used self-report measures of exposure to violence in TV shows and games (direct estimates and favorites). We use data from a longitudinal survey with a sample of Dutch adolescents aged 10 to 14. The results will be interpreted alongside the strengths and weaknesses of each of the measures, showing that apart from reliability and validity, utility is a third important characteristic of media exposure measurement. This study will provide important information to researchers as they make decisions about which media exposure measurement to use within their own research.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems
2014-0067,2014,Paper Session,Using a Response Deadline Procedure to Understand How People Process Alcohol PSAs,5,"Positive portrayals of alcohol in drunk-driving PSAs (e.g., presentation of alcohol in a positive social setting) may increase the accessibility of pro-alcohol attitudes which suggests that anti-alcohol advertisements may be interpreted as pro-alcohol at a very early stage in the processing of the PSAs. To test whether people are initially interpreting certain anti-alcohol advertisements as pro-alcohol, a response deadline procedure was used. Participants made judgments of whether an advertisement was pro- or anti-alcohol at one of three response deadlines: 800, 1600, or 2400 milliseconds. Response deadline procedures are more sensitive to the effects of relatively fast, automatic interpretations of public service announcements because the procedure controls for the effects of relatively slow developing strategic or controlled processes. The results suggest that drunk=driving PSAs that include visuals with alcohol prominently displayed in a positive way are incorrectly interpreted as pro-alcohol advertisements even after 2400 milliseconds of exposure to the advertisement.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

Park et al. (2013) reported that the additional dimension in the visual field increased cognitive load for individuals to process information, which resulted more cognitive effort paid and poorer performance in information processing.
This study attempts to extend the findings from Park, Lee, Lee, & Kim (2013) by adding another concept to the picture: information introduced. Ongoing study is collecting data (target N=60) and this extended abstract will provide some of the preliminary results from data gathered to date.
Results from data collected to date shows general support for LC4MP, which suggests 3D technology leads to early cognitive overload for viewers. Implications from this finding is that structural features that consume cognitive resources needs to be used even more carefully in 3D environment in order to successfully deliver information to viewers.
an experiment has been designed using video clips varying in its density of structural features and levels of arousing content. The results provides general support for LC4MP, suggesting that additional dimension in the visual field provided by 3D technology do increase the cognitive load in processing mediated messages.

The central hypothesis within this approach suggests that the emotional tone of the message preceding the to-be-remembered content influences the encoding strategy for that content by signaling to a cognitive system which motivationally relevant content should be prioritized during encoding. The framework suggests that positive emotional tone vs. negative emotional tone support different information processing strategies and as a result, they can produce different outcomes for information processing. The main propositions of the framework are described and initial empirical evidence from three experiments is reported.

Recognition percentages of 193 PSAs derived from campaign evaluation studies were related to content analysis data of the ads measuring the number of camera changes per second and the information introduced per camera change. The study reveals increasing the number of camera changes may slightly increase PSA recognition if the amount of information introduced by these camera changes is small, but increasing the number of camera changes tends to decrease PSA recognition substantially as the amount of information introduced by these camera changes increases. Combined, the number of camera changes per second and the information introduced per camera change account for 5% of the variance in PSA recognition. These findings corroborate theoretical propositions from the LC4MP outside the laboratory setting.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0072,2014,Paper Session,How Perceived Information Quality of Online News Sources Determines Political Knowledge Through Self-Efficacy,1,"The Internet is a challenging news source. Young users have to choose between so-called ‘quality media’ and diverse semi-professional or non-professional sources. We suggest that the perceived information quality of online news sources plays a crucial role in the acquisition of political knowledge. Based on self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977, 1986) we propose that in the course of an individual’s media socialization, perceived information quality, media self-efficacy, internal political efficacy, and political knowledge should be understood as consecutively linked.
Based on a student sample (N = 560), aged 12 to 22 (M = 16.04, SD = 1.37), our assumptions were supported for general online news exposure. Further, we examined whether the model holds true for professional, semi-professional and non-professional information sources. Here a more complex picture revealed.

Being reminded as such may play a role in the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated adaptive ability. The study asked whether the likelihood of being reminded to an “old” situation by an analogous “new” situation is influenced by: (a) four types of similarity between the two scenarios; (b) amount of elaboration on the old scenario; (c) number of times the old scenario was thought about; and (d) extent to which the earlier episode was interesting or emotional. Results showed that participants were reminded to more old situations when they elaborated on the old situations than when not, and when the old situations were processed twice, rather than once.

In general, pictures and words did show different motivational activation responses across the time course. Pictures showed greater motivational activation, while words showed lesser activation initially but showed a second firing response that generally increased motivational activation. This supported these theoretical predictions. Movement as it relates to the imminence of threats and opportunities in our environments was also investigated, but results did not follow predicted lines.

2014-0077,2014,Paper Session,Emotional Cues and Thought Confidence in Persuasion: Attitudinal and Behavioral Outcomes,2,"Substantial work has examined persuasion using the Elaboration Likelihood Model which examines the dual routes. Recent revisions of the model suggest that thought confidence can serve as a mediator for persuasion by affecting attitude change. The present study sought to replicate and expand the previous work done on thought confidence by looking at thought confidence’s effect on behavioral intention. Participants were exposed to brief strong or weak ads advocating donations to animal shelters accompanied by happy or sad music and photos. Replicating prior research, thought confidence mediated attitude change. In addition, thought confidence was also found to mediate the relationship between posttest attitudes and behavioral intention. Furthermore, the emotional frame manipulation replicated past work finding that the happy condition led to increased thought confidence. Finally, analysis of message bias showed an effect of emotional frame such that sad-framed messages were seen as more biased which led to decreased posttest attitudes.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

2014-0079,2014,Paper Session,Is Personalization Too Fragile to Work? How Priming and Need for Uniqueness Influence the Effectiveness of Personalized Communication,2,"Personalized communication is becoming an industry trend due to rapid development of Internet technologies. A personalized message is believed to be more efficacious than a non-personalized message because it creates a match between the message and the message receipt. The current study challenges this widely-accepted notion by arguing that personalization may not always outperform non-personalization since the effectiveness of a personalized message can be affected by both external factors (e.g., the context where the message is placed) and internal factors (e.g., the message recipient’s personality). Through a 2 (message type: personalized vs. non-personalized) × 2 (prime type: positive vs. negative) × 2 (need for uniqueness: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment with 223 adults, it is illustrated that a personalized message is more effective than a non-personalized one only when the immediate message context suggests so (when the prime is positive), and such a phenomenon is especially characteristic of individuals with a lower need for uniqueness. Theoretical and practical implications based on these findings are discussed.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems
2014-0080,2014,Paper Session,Killer Ads: A Terror Management Account of Fear in Advertisements,4,"Building on terror management theory, three experiments tested whether advertisements with a mortality reminder increase purchase intentions for products that provide an (un)important source of self-esteem. Study 1 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) design for art library and newspaper subscriptions. Study 2 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) x 2 (brand familiarity: low vs. high) design for newspaper subscriptions. Study 3 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) x 2 (product type: healthy vs. unhealthy) design for a beverage with importance of the product for consumers’ self-esteem as a continuous moderator. Across studies advertisements with a death reminder increased unconscious thoughts about death, which, in turn, increased purchase intentions. These effects occurred independent of mood, brand familiarity, product type, product relevance to self-esteem, and ad liking. Findings suggest that ’killer ads’ trigger unconscious consumer fears that may be alleviated by the urge to buy.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

Using the mere thought protocol, the study found that message conformity effects explain 350% more variance in attitudes than the traditional account of consistency-induced persuasion. The message conformity effects were predicted by the discrepancy propositions of information processing theory. Participants at a large eastern university (N = 232) were randomly assigned to receive the mere thought induction or a distraction task in a pretest-posttest control group design. Topic familiarity was also manipulated in the design. Regression analyses indicated that receivers’ perceptions of their referent group’s attitude toward the target concept, combined with their premessage attitude toward the target concept predicted attitude change. Causal modeling was used to track the effect of target attitudes on the rest of the attitude hierarchy.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

This study collected data in France (N = 372) and the US (N = 240) to test a 3 (direct request, polite request, or BYAF) X 2 (requester benefits or 3rd party group benefits) design. The study was designed to offer a critical test of the reactance and the reciprocal politeness explanations of the technique. The French sample replicated the effectiveness of the technique and was consistent with the reactance explanation. The American sample did not replicate the technique but found an increase in compliance for the polite request, but only when the requester was the beneficiary. Possible explanations for the discrepant findings are discussed.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

In the worst case, the attempt to rectify misinformation can lead to solidification, resulting in even more people remembering the misinformation as true. So far, this so called backfire effect has been found in the context of health statement. In the present study, we transfer this phenomenon to the media environment and can show that misremembering myths as facts also occurs when misinformation is presented within an interview. Furthermore, we identify two moderators that amplify the backfire effect: The repetition of the myths before its rectification and the judgment formation strategy. Furthermore, results show that this flaw in memory also has consequences for people’s attitudes.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

However, the field of journalism remains divided along gender lines. Female journalists are underrepresented in older age groups and in media sectors, news areas and positions that are associated with high levels of prestige. The goal of our research was to study whether and how female journalists experience gender-related obstacles in their professional life. We examined this by means of in-depth interviews with 19 female journalists in Flanders (Belgium). The analysis confirms the existence of all ‘traditional’ barriers that women experience in journalism. The added value of this study is that we registered several additional difficulties, and that we gained insight into the strategies that our respondents use to deal with these gender-related barriers, and prevent them from having a negative impact on their job satisfaction (support of a partner, part-time or freelance work, use of digital technology, …).",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: International Communication Association Annual Awards and Presidential Address

My paper argues that it is in the negotiation of this contact via the cell phone that students creatively negotiate their sexual identity. Based on my own research (interviews, focus groups, and surveys) at an American liberal arts college, I discuss how students, in extensively texting for sex, experience a disconnect between their subversive behavior in hookups and their hegemonic explanations of campus sexual culture. Drawing on two divergent models of mediated self – Turkle’s “collaborative self” (2011) and Bauman’s egocentric consumer self (2003) – I explore how and why the mobile phone allows men and women to play with gender boundaries. Applying a feminist critique to texting for sex, I evaluate the impact of these revolutionary sexual subjectivities within a highly dominant fraternity culture.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: International Communication Association Annual Awards and Presidential Address

Previous work utilizing this and other scales has had low explained variance and null results. The current study utilized a grounded research approach to generate items for a homophily scale that were based on how participants made judgments of homophily in natural settings. Results suggested that some items utilized in previous homophily studies (e.g., demographics and physical appearance) were, indeed, unimportant when individuals were making similarity judgments.

Informed by the Common Ingroup Identity Model (CIIM; Gaertner et al., 1994), we hypothesized that adoptees’ abilities to reconcile their personal identities with their shared family identities with birth and adoptive families would contribute to their well-being in adulthood. SEM analyses demonstrated that adoptive identity work and shared family identity mediated the relationship between parental communication and adoptee self-esteem. Specifically, adoption structural openness predicted adoptees‘ reflective identity exploration, which in turn predicted adoptive shared family identity and adoptee self-esteem. The current project serves as an important first step in understanding the role of family communication in fostering integration of the complex layers of identity within diverse families.

It also investigates the factors that play a role in the influence process, including children’s persuasive strategies (argumentative vs. non-argumentative) and parents’ attitudes toward technology (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness). Using a parent-child survey conducted in three schools and dyadic analyses, the results suggest that youths influence their parents’ acquisition of all technologies examined in this study, particularly the Internet. They also suggest that youths’ argumentative strategies have a greater influence than non-argumentative strategies on the influence youths exert on their parents’ technology adoption. Finally, parents’ attitudes toward technology play a minor role in the influence process.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

In addition, we explore how these adolescents use mediated communications in their romantic relationships. Data are from 5 focus groups and 1 depth interview with 44 Latino adolescents (14-18 years old) in the Midwest U.S. Findings indicate the adolescents believe media portray ideals of romantic relationships to be modeled. They are familiar with the terms major motion pictures use to describe romantic experiences, yet did not reach consensus on their use or meaning. Lastly, the youth perceived one-to-one mediated communication as beneficial to their relationships, but evaluated one-to-many mediated communication (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) as largely negative. Our findings identify three sources of evidence in the latter context that creates relational uncertainty: (1) photographs, (2) partner communication, and (3) third-party communication.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0096,2014,Paper Session,Parasocial and School Relationships of Preschool Children,2,"This research answers calls for more examination into the role parasocial relationships play in children’s lives. Specifically, this research explores the impact parasocial relationships have on preschool students’ interpersonal relationships – to see if these media bonds change whom children choose to have relationships with in school. Results of this study found that girls are more likely than boys to select opposite-sex media characters as their favorite and that this selection impacts their friend choices in school. Specifically, girls with male parasocial partners are more likely to play with boys and have male best friends in school. Previously, Maccoby (1998) argued that same-sex relationships create disparate cultures between the sexes and that this divide continues to influence adult life. From this, it is now clear that the media’s increasing importance in the lives of toddlers and young children can have long lasting repercussions on future relationships, in particular, future opposite-sex interactions.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

The results shed light on the complex interaction between family processes and cognitive media beliefs. Above all, we found that mediation strategies differ from acknowledged media usage conceptions in that parents play a more active role than previously assumed. Restrictive mediation comprises rules and restrictions, but also parents’ educative explanations that media do not reflect reality. Patronizing mediation includes shared media consumption, but also parents commenting on media contents. Pointing out and emphasizing socio-emotional features in the media content (e.g., acts of empathy) characterizes an active-emotional co-use (AEC). Parental fear of negative media effects predicted both AEC and restrictive mediation. Children and parents’ congruent perceptions of family interactions predicted AEC and patronizing video game mediation. Overall, positive ratings of family interactions were associated with children using media less frequently.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Results also showed that the effect of mediation’s timing consistently depended on children’s age. Older children responded better than younger children to the mediation when it was delivered prior to their exposure to a violent TV program. On the other hand, only older children exhibited reactance when they received the mediation message after watching a violent TV program. The timing of active mediation may be, therefore, an important factor in interpreting research and in the design and implementation of mediation interventions.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

I also compare and contrast the history and regulation of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and China. The comparison focuses on the U.S.’s maximalist approach to IPR, which views IPR primarily as a commodity, and China’s IPR development in the context of Confucian and Communist philosophy, which views IP primarily as a resource.

Its 2009 Audiovisual Communications Services Law (Audiovisual Law), promoted by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, explicitly seeks to “democratize,” and promote competition within, Argentina’s media industry. A federal appeals court in Argentina brought about by the media conglomerate Grupo Clarin SA (Clarin Group) ruled, in April 2013, that the law would unconstitutionally restrict broadcast licenses. Several analysts speculate that the Audiovisual Law was designed to target the political influence of the Clarin Group, the media conglomerate whose coverage of the Kirchner administration had become increasingly adversarial.

2014-0108,2014,Paper Session,The Effects of Regional Concentration and Vertical Integration on the Flow of Cable Programming Networks,1,"Using a 2009 cross-sectional database of digital cable systems in the U.S., this study examines the combined effects of vertical integration and regional concentration (cable TV clusters) on the carriage and tier positioning decisions of cable networks. Focusing on four basic cable network segments—the Outdoor, Cartoon, Movie, and Comcast affiliated networks—this study finds that the effects of vertical integration (the vertical favoritism of affiliated networks and vertical exclusion of their rival networks) still exist, confirming the results of previous studies. This study shows that in general, integrated cable systems (a) have a tendency to increase their subscriber base by carrying their affiliated networks more frequently, positioning them on an analog tier with more subscriber access, or both; and (b) tend to limit rivals’ subscribers by either carrying unaffiliated rival networks less frequently or positioning them on digital tiers. This study also examines the effects of cable clustering (the regional concentration of cable systems), a subject that has not been investigated in previous studies. In general, the increase in the regional concentration of cable systems positively affects the carriage rate of overall basic cable networks regardless of vertical ownership, while it negatively affects the placement of basic cable networks on the analog tier. The increase in regional concentration is also associated with the decrease in the effects of vertical integration, suggesting that system efficiency through regional concentration may mitigate the vertical integration effect.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0110,2014,Paper Session,Measuring Public Attention on Environment and Energy Issues With Google Trends: A Validity Assessment,2,"The study aims to assess the face, convergent, and predictive validity of Google Trends in measuring public attention on environment and energy issues in the United States, by comparing it with that measured by the “most important problem” question in Gallup opinion polls. A bottom-up approach is adopted to generate queries used to capture public attention on environment and energy issues, which guarantee the face validity of Google Trends. Google Trends is found to have convergent and predictive validity in measuring public attention on environment issue, but fails in measuring public attention on energy issue. This finding suggests that web queries data, as a measurement of public attention, should be used with caution by taking issues peculiarity into account.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0111,2014,Paper Session,Coping With Unemployment Through Online Social Support,3,"This paper posits that online social support plays an important role helping to cope with unemployment, and facilitate the search for new employment. Based on a structural equation model, we develop and test the influence of online-mediated, enabling and caring social support on job search self-efficacy that may positively encourage the job search behavior of unemployed persons. In addition, we control the model for the factors gender, age, user experience and attitude towards the Internet. Based on 2,400 telephone interviews with unemployed individuals in Germany, we identify and confirm online social support as influential driver of job search behavior. Our results show that social support derived from new information and communication technologies does counteract to a certain degree the adverse effect of being unemployed. Furthermore, our model confirms that these relationships differ in gender, age, user experience and attitude towards the Internet.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This study explores how two types of feedback in exercise video games (exergames) can impact a user’s game experience and sense of self-efficacy about performing an exergame-based physical activity. An experiment (N = 47) using a between-subjects design manipulated feedback messages: non-supportive vs. supportive. The investigation finds that supportive feedback favorably influences a user’s exergame experience (e.g., enjoyment), and social presence mediates the relationship between the type of feedback and exergame play outcomes. The paper concludes with the implications of these findings for research about presence, exergames, and perceived exercise efficacy.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Women represent an estimated 16% of global Wikipedia editors and 23% of adult Wikipedia editors in the United States. In searching for sources and solutions to this persistent disparity, previous research has focused on analyzing aspects of current contributors and the existing Wikipedia community. We draw on unique panel survey data collected in 2009 and 2012 on a diverse group of American young adults with detailed information about not just contributors, but also non-contributors. We examine the role of individuals’ background attributes and Internet skills in participation on the site. We find that the gender gap in editing, widely documented in the literature, is exacerbated by a similarly significant Internet skills gap.

We expected that effects depend on patients’ level of emotional approach coping. 133 Dutch breast cancer patients filled out a T0 and (six month later) a T1 questionnaire, assessing online activity within the support group, emotional approach coping and psychological wellbeing. Results showed three-way interactions of time, online activity and emotional approach coping on wellbeing. For patients who were active online, a low score on emotional approach coping caused an increase in wellbeing, while patients actively approaching emotions did not show this beneficial effect, but reported highest wellbeing overall.

However, recent research on the Moral Balancing Theory suggests that an individual may be less likely to comply with a subsequent act after agreeing to an initial request. These two effects seem to predict conflicting outcomes under the same scenario. This paper presents two experiments in the online activism domain that suggests issue similarity between the actions can help reconcile these two “competing” theories. When the causes between the two actions are similar, a desire for consistency is displayed and the “Foot-in-the-door” effect is observed. When the causes are not similar, individuals are more likely to behave in-line with the moral balancing effect.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Previous research has shown that the accuracy of these self-report measures can be quite low, and both over- and underreporting of media use is commonplace. This study compares self-reports of internet use with client log files from a large household sample. Results show that the accuracy of self-reported frequency and duration of internet use is quite low, and that survey data are only moderately correlated with log file data. Moreover, there are systematic patterns of misreporting - frequent (according to their log files) internet users tend to underreport while infrequent users report more time spent online than their log files indicate. Self-reports for specific content such as social network sites or video platforms seem to be more accurate and less consistently biased than self-reports of generic frequency or duration of internet use.

In this study, we examine how external communicative elements, namely privacy assurances and website reputation operate in conjunction with sensitivity of information to influence trust between consumers and the online entity. An online experiment was used to understand the interaction effects amongst these antecedents. We find that when highly sensitive information is sought, privacy assurances can make a positive difference in creating trust to both lesser and more reputable websites. In comparison, when a reputable website asks for less sensitive information, the presence of privacy assurances engenders no differences in consumers’ trust. Privacy assurances are thus vital for websites with weak reputation regardless of sensitivity information requested.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Opportunities for capital enhancement afforded those online are also divided. Social networking sites are, arguably, the most important online space, and can be tools for capital enhancement. Of the 31% of Armenian adults on social networking sites (70% of Internet users), there are demographic divides between two sites: Facebook and Odnoklassniki. Our regression results show that Facebook users are more urban, better educated, and have superior foreign language skills than Odnoklassniki users. Facebook users are more likely to get information, while Odnoklassniki users are more likely to game.

Drawing on cultivation theory, social cognitive theory and framing theory, this manuscript proposes a model of persuasive environmental communication that is informed by the O-S-O-R perspective of social psychology and political communication to outline the potential salutary role of strategic messages in climate change communication and the ways in which it represents opportunities to educate and engage lay audiences.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0127,2014,Paper Session,Family Communication and Climate-Friendly Behavior: Intergenerational Influence at Home and on the Road,5,"Environmentally significant behavior is typically studied at the individual level, but occurs within households and requires the cooperation of multiple individuals. To assess the impact of intergenerational influence, we investigate family communication as a mediator between individual beliefs about climate change and climate-friendly behaviors, hypothesizing that open, mutually receptive communication on climate and energy will build family behavioral norms that support climate-friendly behavior. Data are 523 U.S.-representative parent-teen dyads who participated in an online survey. Results show that climate change beliefs are strongly related to the perceived importance of climate-friendly behavior for both parents and teens. In households that perceive climate-friendly behavior as important, and that communicate frequently about it, a stronger conservation norm is found; this norm influences home energy consumption and transportation choices above and beyond what is explained by the parent's or teen's own beliefs. Implications for communication strategies to increase climate-friendly behavior are discussed.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0128,2014,Paper Session,“Wild Flavors” or Wild Animals? The Discursive Warfare Surrounding China’s Endangered Wildlife Trade in the (Looming) Age of Green Consumerism,1,"The Chinese are notorious for their consumption of wild animals. From rabbits and monkeys to shark fins and tiger bones, this omnivorous culture enjoys exotic meats as both delicacies and tonic. As the Western notion of green consumerism enters China, however, the ancient tradition is slowly falling out of favor. International environmental NGOs (e.g. Wild Aid, TRAFFIC of WWF China, etc.) launched advertising campaigns to dissuade the public from eating endangered wildlife. Curiously, their opponents—advocates for exotic meat consumption—also jumped onto the “green wagon” and marketed wild meats as an “ecological diet.” The opposing rhetoric demonstrates the plasticity of “green consumerism”: If you love animals, should you eat them, or protect them? The ambivalence in the human-animal relationship gives birth to two types of desire, which are manifested in advertisements. This paper compares the pro-wildlife-eating ads by restaurants and tonic manufacturers and the environmental NGO-sponsored ads that support the opposite, and analyze the different cultural, ideological, and psychic functions they perform. Questioning the popular fetishization of the “local” or the “indigenous” over the “global” or the “Western” in the (looming) age of green consumerism, I argue that non-Western and indigenous values could also contribute to environmental degradation when coupled with the greed of consumerism.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This meta-analysis aims at identifying important determi-nants of hydrogen acceptance via aggregation of correlation data reported in 19 acceptance studies. Whereas attitude formation seems to be rather based on cognitive aspects, the be-havior is strongly influenced by affective determinants. The perceived risk showed to be less important than perceived benefits or subjective norm indicating that safety criteria are not the most relevant aspects people consider when evaluating hydrogen technologies. Fur-thermore, the results relativize the NIMBY-phenomenon: The closer a person lives to a hy-drogen refueling station, the higher the hydrogen acceptance.

I consider a set of focus groups with black interns from a wide range of agencies and suggest that advertising's race problem presents a unique set of challenges for blacks. Drawing on theories of intersectionality and identity, I argue that supposed race-based affiliations conceal deeper anxieties of cultural belonging marked by fissures of class and language. I conclude that the added psychological burden of stereotype threat makes black interns wary of seeking out help from other more established black employees—for fear of being seen as preferring their own race—thus placing them at a structural career development disadvantage vis-à-vis whites, who have no qualms about affiliating with and mentoring members of their own race.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Sixty-five years have passed since the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Right. However, political and economic systems still deny billions of people their political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights promulgated in the Declaration and its covenants. I probe music's potential to affect this challenge through a methods process of multiple triangulation. Specifically, I research the livid experience within Jamaica's music community through critical ethnography; develop a ""Taxonomy on the Neuroscience of Music and Morality""; and analyze the global music sector through the political economy of human rights lens. Integrating the findings, I conclude that music is not only a tool for realizing human rights, but also that music capability itself is a human right to the extent that it develops cognitive and emotive capacities, serves agency and voice, and supports sociability, participation, and community. Further, I conclude that the music community is uniquely poised and with capacity to play a leadership and facilitate role in the moral, scientific and political discourse that clarifies not only collectively established human rights goals, and but as well the structures of the music sector and the overarching political economy necessary to reach the goals.

This paper critiques this queering’s dimensions of freedom and domination through the lens of critical rhetoric. In terms of freedom, Mulan’s queering represents a progressive step forward for Disney, as the company previously had no LGBT characters. The choice of Mulan is also examined in its dimensions of domination. Disney’s choice of the most masculine princess as a bisexual reinforces harmful stereotypes about LGBT women, while its choice to only permit a LGBT character on a program aimed at adults neglects its role as a moral educator of children. A suggestion of the creation of an original animated lesbian or bisexual princess is offered as a means of overcoming the oppressive nature of Mulan’s queering.","Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies Interactive Paper Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This is a case study of a local media activism organization in Hong Kong - the Hong Kong In-media. Through an analysis of its historical developments, it discusses how a local media activism is situated in and connects with the broader landscape of transnational media activism. The connection between the local and transnational media activisms is shown in the local activists’ appropriation of the ideas and practices from the global exemplars, and in their attempt to mobilize transnational resources by forging tangible co-operations with the counterparts elsewhere. Their contributions to transnational media activism in particular and transnational activism in general will be discussed.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

However, they were detached from many forms of political participation, both online and offline. Facebook, in which young Georgians spent considerable amount of time, emerged as a platform for engagement in a public affairs discourse, such as reading and viewing and occasional commentary/ posting. Those who were active in the public affairs discourse were also highly likely to participate in Facebook’s political activities and in real life activities, although less frequently. Online and offline political participation were strongly and positively interrelated, countering beliefs of some scholars that Facebook-based participation displaces traditional forms of political participation. Young voters’ strong sense of collective efficacy predicted participation in real settings but not in Facebook-based political activities.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This study conducts a panel data analysis on 182 countries observed from 2010 to 2012, to investigate a cross-country difference in the adoption of Facebook. The findings show that, concerning the diffusion of recent ICTs, authoritarian rules have a limited ability to maneuver in obstructing the way to the global social network. Rather, the governments’ suppression promotes the increased use of Facebook in response to the spread of cell phones and the growth of the urban population.

The present study examined how Chinese newspapers cover female smoking by analyzing the published news articles (N = 105) from 2005 to June 2013. Results showed only a small number of news articles, 105 in 8 years, addressed female smoking. These articles were given low prominence in newspapers and tobacco-control services specific to women were rarely mentioned. Only one half of the articles included tobacco-control content from a women’s perspective and these reports tended to adopt a loss frame over a gain frame. In order to slow down the increasing rate of smoking among women, Chinese media should offer more tobacco control information that is relevant to women, such as highlighting unique health risks among women and addressing the misconception that smoking is associated with attractiveness, which is widely promoted by “women’s cigarettes”.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0149,2014,Paper Session,“Bitch is So Bitch”: Making Sense of Audience Responses to Global Counterflow of Chinese TV Series,1,"The subject globalization and its influence on the audience is by no means a new research topic, particularly those that examines the influence of the West or the U.S. on the rest of the world. Not many studies have considered the audiences from the exportation side, and their view on the process of globalization. Thus, this paper asks the fundamental question, “How do audiences feel when their cultural products are exported into another country?” By using the case of memes that circulated in response to the news that a Chinese TV series The Legend of Zhenhuan is going to enter the U.S. market, this paper examines the cultural expectations that Chinese audiences place on their cultural exports. The analysis reveals a complicated case of cultural works that simultaneously arouse anxiety about China’s complicated culture and its impossibility to translate well in the global market, and reliefs them through self-mockery and satire. This paper argues that the process of globalization not only impacts the importing countries but the exporters as well. Through the examination of the audience’s expectations for global cultural expansion, this paper shows that there are many more nuanced cultural undercurrents that motivate or dissuade a country to enter the global market other than the spread of power or ideology.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Unlike the previous work, this data collection took place after health care reform implementation, uses a different sample, and includes new variables of interest (e.g., deviance, knowledge, involvement). Results suggest uncertainty levels have, interestingly, increased post-implementation, and students want to receive health care reform information from friends and family or online, from non-partisan sources, and in varied formats. The data also demonstrate that predicted outcome value of health care reform information, uncertainty tolerance, and involvement significantly predict intentions to seek information about health care reform.

In the first study, participants viewed a mistargeted print D-PSA or a direct D-PSA. In Study 2, participants viewed a mistargeted video D-PSA, a direct D-PSA, or a control ad. In both studies the mistargeted D-PSAs significantly weakened the association between depression and negative help seeking inclinations. Further, among people with heightened levels of depression the mistargeted D-PSA resulted in significantly greater help seeking intentions from close friends and a romantic partner than a direct D-PSA (study 1).

Therefore, there is a need for more research on variables which can increase positivity, willingness, and behavioral intentions in potential donors. The present study applies terror management theory and social identity to the organ donation context. Results indicate that reminders of death through narrative may improve organ donation outcomes as a form of worldview defense, through identification and death thought accessibility as mediators. However, this is only the case when the characters in the narrative are not members of a disliked outgroup. When the character is a member of a disliked outgroup (in this case, Arab ethnicity), organ donation outcomes become more negative.

2014-0154,2014,Paper Session,On a Scale of Health Uncertainty,2,"Uncertainty has been recognized as a fundamental construct in health communication. The conceptualization regarding its definition, attribute and scope, however, is not yet clear. In this article, health uncertainty was explicated as the psychological state in which one is incapable of appraising one’s health status and/or making health-related decisions. It was proposed that health uncertainty comprises four dimensions: information uncertainty, condition uncertainty, efficacy uncertainty, and emotion uncertainty. A 17-item scale was developed as a measurement instrument. Four external variables (i.e. health literacy, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and information management) were used to test the construct validity of the sale. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses of data from college students (N=238) showed that the scale was unidimensional on the second order. The results indicated that the scale exhibited good internal and external consistency, construct validity, as well as good reliability.

2014-0155,2014,Paper Session,Perceptions Regarding Healthy and Unhealthy Families: Formative Research to Inform Health Communication Interventions in Malawi,5,"Background
This qualitative study was conducted to gain insight into Malawian men’s and women’s perceptions of “healthy families” and the “good life” in anticipation of designing effective health communication programs.
Methodology
32 focus group discussions and 49 key informant interviews were conducted in Chitipa, Nsanje, Phalombe and Salima Districts.
Results
Healthy families were identified as those with well-nourished, educated parents, two children, living in a clean environment. The main barriers to the good life were structural -- poverty, food insecurity, and lack of access to hygienic conditions, education, and health services. Several individual-level behaviors were also seen as problematic.

Conclusions
Participants tended to be positive and focus on actions that could be taken at the community, family and individual levels even as they identified many structural factors that impede health and access to the good life. These findings informed the design of communication interventions, as described in this manuscript.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

The study suggests that exposure to the program is positively associated with perceived realism of the program, which in turn is positively associated with developing internal weight locus of control. Meanwhile, internal weight locus of control positively predicts audience members’ exercise behaviors, meaning the higher level of internal weight locus of control the audience members develop, the more likely they are to engage in physical exercise. The study offers evidence that reality TV might be a useful tool to influence audience members’ cognitions on health issues, which could potentially lead to healthier outcomes.

2014-0157,2014,Paper Session,Shame Predicts Sexual Risk-Taking Among MSM,5,"Recently, Christensen et al. (2013) found that shame predicted unprotected anal intercourse

(UAI) with non-primary (casual) partners for young men who have sex with men (MSM). Unknown

is whether some men (i.e., those more insecurely attached) are more susceptible and what mediates this link (e.g. alcohol, drugs) and whether this applies to both insertive, and, more risky, receptive UAI. To examine these links, data from 1196 high-risk young MSM were gathered. Using hierarchical negative binomial regression models and mediation analyses we found that shame (as measured with the PANAS-X) positively and significantly predicted both receptive and insertive UAI. The effect of shame on sexual behavior was mediated by alcohol. Furthermore, avoidant attachment predicted shame, alcohol use, and insertive and receptive UAI -- but only consistently for MSM whose attachment responses indicated that they were paying attention (i.e., those who responded to items and reversed items in a conceptually similar way). Further analyses indicated that avoidant attachment, but not anxious attachment, significantly mediated the shame to alcohol link.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0160,2014,Paper Session,The Health Belief Model as an Explanatory Framework in Communication Research,6,"The health belief model (HBM) posits that messages will achieve optimal behavior change if they successfully target perceived barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, and threat. While the model seems to be an ideal explanatory framework for communication research, theoretical limitations have limited its use in the field. Notably, variable ordering is currently undefined in the HBM. Thus, it is unclear whether constructs mediate relationships comparably (parallel mediation), in sequence (serial mediation), or in tandem with a moderator (moderated mediation). To investigate variable ordering, adults (N = 1,377) completed a survey in the aftermath of an 8 month flu vaccine campaign grounded in the HBM. Exposure to the campaign was positively related to vaccination behavior. Statistical evaluation supported a model where the indirect effect of exposure on behavior through perceived barriers and threat was moderated by self-efficacy (moderated mediation). Perceived barriers and benefits also formed a serial mediation chain. The results indicate that variable ordering in the health belief model may be complex, help to explain conflicting results of the past, and a good focus for future research.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

As Malawians may be influenced by norms transmitted through interpersonal communication within their personal networks to make decisions about their sexual behavior, this study examined the relationship between interpersonal communication, norms and condom use among sexually active Malawians living in the southern region. An egocentric network study (n=1,316) asked participants to name 3 ties they spoke with about health issues. Network descriptive norms (AOR: 2.11; p<0.001), general injunctive norms (AOR: 1.29; p<0.05) and network injunctive norms (AOR: 1.42; p<0.05) were associated with condom use generally. Network descriptive norms were associated with condom use with a primary partner (AOR: 1.58; p<0.01) and non-primary partner (AOR: 2.98; p<0.001). Norms within a personal network may play a role in protective sexual behaviors among Malawians, suggesting that social norm interventions utilizing interpersonal communication may be an innovative approach to increase uptake of protective sexual behaviors.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Undoubtedly, the speech of the Mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella, was the most discussed due to her insecurities in the domain of English language. In this sense, Botella’s speech illustrates the importance of prosody in public speaking since it can affect the speaker’s credibility. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the influence of prosody in listeners’ perceptions of politicians’ credibility. In developing this understanding, we conducted an acoustic analysis to measure the audience’s perception of credibility.

The present study seeks to provide evidence to support the importance of incorporating immediacy into business communication training by exploring the influence of supervisor immediacy on subordinates’ organization citizenship behaviors (loyalty, participation, and obedience). A model was tested in which perceived immediacy was predicted to mediate the relationships between supervisors’ immediate behaviors and subordinates’ organizational citizenship outputs. Although the full model was not supported, the data were consistent with a simple causal string from supervisor immediate behaviors  perceived immediacy  subordinate loyalty.

At the same time, Taiwanese students reported discomfort speaking English. Consequently, opportunities for informal interaction between international and Taiwanese students were minimal. Both groups had low expectations of establishing relationships with each other. In an environment where two dominant languages are in competition, an awareness of linguistic diversity and knowledge of cultural variation can be helpful to resolve the dilemma in multilingual interaction.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0177,2014,Paper Session,"Media Frames of Economic Crisis, Psychological Processes and Collective Action",3,"How media framing of economic crisis affect young people’s intent to resume collective action? A social-psychological model is employed in order to predict various kinds of political action (e.g. strike, protest, petition, syndicalism) or even violent acts (e.g., vandalisms). This model focuses on three main factors: perception of injustice; perception of collective efficacy; and social identity (politicized and national). The relationship between this set of predictive variables and the intention to act is examined within the context of media framing. Based on a content analysis of the Greek press three main frames of what Greece should do in order to deal with the economic crisis (implement the memorandum, defy the memorandum and leave the Eurozone, or negotiate the memorandum within the Eurozone) were developed. The effect of media frames on perceived threat to freedom and the consequent psychological reactance is also examined as a predictive variable. Results suggest that media framing affects a) people’s reaction to their situation (e.g. reactance) and b) the relationship between the predictive variables and their intention to act.",Intergroup Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This study uses confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and discriminant analysis to evaluate Abdulla and colleagues’ (2004) measure of news credibility. Results indicate that although the factor structure of the measure is replicable, the measure exhibits significant concerns related to discriminant validity.

Similar studies also suggest that journalists covering specialty areas such as health are more likely to experiment with and adopt new forms of practice that break with the traditional tenets of journalism. Through interviews with such journalists, this study explores the perceptions, practices and drivers of personal branding among journalists. Findings indicate journalists are squarely focused on branding at the individual level (rather than branding the organizations they work for). Journalists cite technological and cultural changes in the profession as giving rise to personal branding. They also describe the tension they feel between their obligation to uphold the traditional tenets of journalism and their perceived need to incorporate more branding into their practice, especially on social media platforms. The findings also indicate that journalists may be changing the fundamental elements of branding in at least one way, exchanging the differentiation between themselves and their content for the mutual sharing and co-creation of content with their colleagues and audience.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

An analysis of NBC primetime telecasts and sports coverage in The New York Times found that the coverage of foreign nations and their athletes was not significantly affected by any given nation’s performance in the Olympics. Instead, U.S. media emphasized only a few elite countries –such as China, Russia, Britain, and Japan – just as they do in selecting other foreign news. In addition to a few elite countries’ dominance, the military expenditures of a given country, its linguistic proximity to the U.S., and the number of sports celebrities and gold medals won were important predictors of that country’s media visibility.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

However, it remains unclear how specific sports news frames affect a recipient’s quality perception of a journalistic product and if news frames further affect an individual’s post-exposure behavior in social interaction with a person with a disability (PWD). To shed some light on these potential news framing effects, two experimental studies (between-subjects designs) were conducted.
Study_1, revealed systematic news framing effects on recipients’ attitudes toward a depicted AWD and showed effects on a recipient’s perceived quality of a news story.
Study_2, further revealed that specific news frames may (automatically) affect a recipient’s behavior (e.g., verbal communication performance, visual attention/eye contacts) in a subsequent face-to-face social interaction with a PWD.

The current study, using a two-wave national panel survey and a media content analysis, demonstrates how individual exposure to news focusing on unknown consequences impacts changes in consumer confidence. Additionally it shows how this relationship is partially mediated by the sense of economic uncertainty evoked.

2014-0188,2014,Paper Session,The Limits of the Debate: How the Oslo Terror Shook the Norwegian Immigration Debate,2,"It is widely documented that dramatic events and crises have the potential to change how an issue is debated in the media. The lone wolf terrorist of the 2011 Oslo attacks claimed an extremist, contra-jihadist ideology, stating that he carried out the terror attacks to “wake up” and “warn” the political establishment and public of a failed immigration policy. The present paper analyzes how immigration was debated before and after the Oslo terror, and conceptualizes the developments in the polarized, heated immigration debate by employing Hallin’s (1986) influential three-sphere model. The attacks challenged the journalistic balance between newsworthiness and sensitivity covering a polarized issue. Based on analyses of a comprehensive, quantitative data set of Norwegian mainstream media coverage of immigration in 2011, we find that the debate on immigration changed by a decrease in the amount of coverage, a shift in the prioritization of formats, topics and sources, and by including certain viewpoints into the debate that earlier belonged to an online sphere of deviance.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Furthermore it investigates a potential linkage between Web 2.0 affinity and journalistic role perceptions as well as the identification with specific tasks. The findings indicate that Web 2.0 platforms function as an extension of the journalistic source spectrum and offer specific uses for which several other sources are not suitable to the same degree. Beyond that, greater Web 2.0 affinity comes along with greater identification with advice and service-oriented communication purposes, a critical-advocacy role perception and a greater identification with several journalistic tasks which gained in importance in the course of digitization of society.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

After a brief historical overview of the notion of public controversy and its use in empirical research, I propose to adopt a more processual view of public controversy. I theorize the production of controversy as an everyday life rhetorical invention (rather than a phenomenon made visible through documentation of mediated traces of public statements). To support this view of public controversy with empirical data, I conducted a four-month ethnography in a community-based organization that defends the rights of LGBT people. In the analysis, I explain how activists become passionate about an issue and engage in political action; then I details problems of alignment that result from talk about political issues, such as the legal and social recognition of transsexuals and transgender people.","Language and Social Interaction Interactive Paper Session: Constructing Controversy, Help, and Play",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

A large body of research on transportation focuses on written stories; little is known about modality’s effect on transportation. This study examined the effects of modality (text vs. video) in a non-profit narrative on transportation, empathy, attitudes toward organization, and behavioral intentions. Findings show a significant interaction between trait transportability and modality in predicting narrative transportation. Individuals low in transportability are more transported into a video narrative than a text narrative, while individuals high in transportability are equally likely to be transported regardless of modality.

On the other hand, they keep electing politicians that do not address income disparities. To understand this paradox, this study examines how media shape citizens’ perceptions of inequality. Consequently, it shows how these perceptions influence income distribution preferences and participation behaviors. Based on a representative sample of the Colombian adult population (N=1,031), this study illustrates how news exposure reduces perceptions of income inequality, while exposure to entertainment content enhances citizens’ understanding of income gaps. Moreover, this study suggests that more realistic perceptions of inequality lead to more equalitarian preferences for income distribution.

2014-0213,2014,Paper Session,Temporal Challenges Facing Volunteer Recruitment and Retention: Introducing a Model of Membership Transitions for Volunteers,1,"Previous approaches to volunteer work focused on resolving issues of recruitment and retention focus on time as an outcome rather than an undercurrent of volunteer labor. Existing literature demonstrates that several dimensions of time surface as issues inextricably linked to volunteer work - scheduling, pace, urgency, scarcity and future focus. To address these issues, this paper presents a model, membership transitions for volunteers (MTV), that builds upon communicative flows of organizational communication (McPhee & Zaug, 2000) and the typology for nonstandard membership (Ballard & Gossett, 2007). Elaborated through a volunteer case study, the model of MTV demonstrates utility in understanding how a volunteer at a nonprofit organization enters as a contingent member who communicatively negotiated a transition into standard membership through the flows of membership negotiation, activity coordination and temporal self-structuring.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0214,2014,Paper Session,Working Toward a Positive End (of the Good Life): Third Party Resolution of Family Conflict,2,"Processual models of conflict management have been utilized to study all stages of conflict, from the initial cause of conflict all the way through to the final resolution of the conflict. One of the ways that processual models can be applicable is studying how organizational actors employ these methods with individuals who are still important to the function of the organization, but are not familiar with it, such as visitors to a hospital. The focus of this paper is the role of the organizational actors who deal with end-of-life issues on a daily basis, specifically on how they manage conflict between family members of patients. Using qualitative interviews with nurses, patient advocates, social workers, and chaplains (n = 78), many individuals deal with conflict between family members every day. The ways that these organizational actors manage conflict is by reframing, refocusing, referring, and reconciling.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0215,2014,Paper Session,“The Birthing Process is Messy”: Positioning Sustainability “In the Cloud” as an Emerging Profession,2,"We examine how practitioners communicatively position the emerging profession of sustainability, which employs around 3 million people in the United States alone. Despite extant research on emerging fields, this literature mainly focuses on institutional developments and entrepreneurial actions, neglecting the wider subjectivities that develop among “ordinary” practitioners of such nascent fields. In contrast, we adopt a “practice-based” approach, using discursive positioning theory. Drawing on interviews with 45 sustainability practitioners and 35 contributed curriculum vitae, we find that 20 discursive resources are used to construct four broad subject positions for the emerging field—discovery, enlightenment, legitimacy, and consumption. Our data suggests a “cloud” approach to field positioning, whereby positions overlap and practitioners utilize different (re)combinations of the discursive resources, in response to particular tasks, contexts, and stakeholders. Our findings contribute to discursive positioning theory, practice-based perspectives to emerging professions, and the political embeddedness of work.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0216,2014,Paper Session,Transcoding: The Mirroring of the Database Form and Postmodern Culture,1,"This essay explores the rise of database logic that pervades our current culture, specifically how media forms are recontextulaized through the database and human communication is shifting to fit database logic. Building on Lyotard’s narrative disintegration, this account explains altered definitions of truth, creativity, individuality, experience, and art. Drawing broadly, this paper incorporates McLuhan’s insights on electric media, new media theorist Lev Manovich’s metarealism, and technologist Kevin Kelly’s thoughts on the future of the web. These themes are recapitulated by tracing the extension of these cultural logics from older media to cybernetic systems, through Enzensberger, Benjamin and Nichols’ discussions of art, technology, and human subjectivity. Aside from this synthesis, the notion of credibility is contributed to describe fully-functioning database elements.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0217,2014,Paper Session,Intrapersonal Communication: Technologies of the Self in Educational Material & Practice,1,"Following the late work of Michel Foucault, this paper traces the genealogy of the technology of the self represented by intrapersonal communication or “inner dialog” and its relationship to both textual and digital educational media. Today, this type of communication is enacted and studied in educational contexts under rubrics such as “self-talk,” “self-regulation” and “self-explanation.” As Foucault suggests, two important precursors for this specific “technology of the self” go back to the Middle Ages and antiquity, particularly with the emergence of writing and the Christian confessional as means of self-reflection and -examination. However, many variations intervene between ancient and modern practices. The paper plots the oscillation of this intra-personal communication between a ritualized, externalized performance and fully internalized self-examination, from the catechism of Luther to self-regulatory communication studied in today’s cognitive science –concluding with a brief discussion of new, related possibilities offered by many-to-many Internet communication.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0218,2014,Paper Session,"“No Media, Less Life?”: Online Disconnection and Media Participation",2,"In times when media are mundane fellows that are disappearing from our consciousness, when media usage is partly habitualised and therefore invisible, looking at disconnections rather than exclusively connection enables us to develop a deeper understanding of what it means to live in mediatised worlds. Media disconnection beyond digital divide and knowledge gap is, however, rarely addressed in current studies of mediatisation. The following presentation is an attempt to investigate specific forms of disconnection in conjunction with connection enabled by media.
By using disruption of the daily stream of online engagement as a method, the presentation discusses how online disconnection can contribute to understanding of media participation and its role in the everyday lives of young adults.In the analysis, we show how conscious disruptions of habitualised media practices can contribute to an understanding of the role the internet-based media participation plays in the everyday life of young adults. Hence, the presentation provides a theoretical and empirical investigation of forms of connection and disconnection that are persistent in mediatised worlds.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Further the paper examines to what extent political economy integrates with other approaches to the study of media or communication such as cultural studies and development communication. The paper argues that centrality of political economy to media and communication prompts a close assessment of the relationship between state and media.

Responsiveness and Scope Expansion in Television News Reports of Protest Demonstrations,1,"Most of the interaction between movements and elites nowadays takes place in the media arena. This study deals with reactions of political targets (responsiveness) and third parties (scope expansion) in news reports on protest events. It asks whether targets and third parties respond to protest, how they respond, and when they are more likely to respond. Data spanning eight years of protest coverage of both the Belgian public and commercial broadcaster (N=564) is used to test hypotheses drawn from journalism and protest impact literature. Results show that protestor voices dominate protest coverage, that political targets are more prominent than third parties, and that accounts of targets more frequently contain negative elements compared to accounts of third parties. Demonstrations that are large, reactive, not staged by unions and which have a domestic and specific target are more likely to trigger responsiveness. Disruptive demonstrations have no consistent impact on responsiveness whatsoever, yet trigger negative third party reactions.Results are discussed in light of protest impact and political communication literature.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

In this study we offer a conservative test of the political power of fictional television dramas by evaluating whether minor differences in character portrayals and plot details affect viewers’ attitudes and policy preferences. We rely on a variation on the switching replications design in which a representative sample watched one of four versions of an episode of Special Victims’ Unit: Law and Order edited to manipulate the alleged rape victim’s sexual history and the jury verdict regarding the alleged perpetrator. We find that subtle variations in the exemplars and storyline influence viewers’ attitudes towards four issues: standards of evidence in rape cases, confidence in the justice system, and immigration policy and health care system. Our findings suggest that fictional programs need not be explicitly didactic in order to influence viewers’ political views; in fact, exemplars may be more influential when they are only incidental to the plotline.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

With the increasingly important role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) incorporated in different civil and civic behaviors, the interdependent relationships between voluntary associations and communities may change. Building on this inquiry, this study employs social capital theory, the perspective of media multiplexity, and communication public goods theory to examine the relationship between voluntary associations and community involvement through a telephone survey of a randomly selected sample of 400 residents in the Greater Cleveland area (USA). The results showed that being embedded in affiliation networks is significantly correlated with community involvement. Moreover, participation in voluntary associations through multiple means of communication significantly predicted community involvement after controlling for other factors such as local ties, diversity of social ties, and affiliation ties. In other words, for people who are not associated with multiple affiliations, their active involvement in a single voluntary association through multiple technologies facilitates their participation in community activities. Findings of this study present theoretical and practical implications for contemporary forms of voluntary associations in relation to communities.

Specifically, we examine state legislators’ responses to variations in narrative focus (individual vs. community) and a statistical map (presence vs. absence) depicting the prevalence of food deserts across the U.S. Using a web-based randomized experiment (N = 496), we show that narrative focus and the statistical map interact to produce different patterns of cognitive response and support for policies to reduce the prevalence of food deserts. Individual narratives were more effective when paired with a statistical map than in the absence of such an image; the image did not have an impact when combined with a story describing a community at large.

We test this assumption by systematically manipulating the modality (audio vs. audiovisual) of the 2013 German televised debate in a live-experiment. 110 participants either watched or listened to the debate prior to the 2013 national elections. As predicted, viewers of the debate rely on candidates’ personality characteristics while listeners of the debate focus on issue agreement when evaluating the candidates’ debate performance. However, this effect is conditional upon existing levels of political interest, with highly interested subjects being less open to modality effects and basing their evaluation on issue-agreement independent of the experimental condition.

Extant approaches view news media as epiphenomenal to foreign policymaking. Theories such as indexing, hegemony, and cascading activation argue that the political elite make foreign policy choices independently; the media either fail to question these choices on their own or are used to manufacture favorable public opinion. In contrast, this paper argues that the news media are a site where nations construct their identities—shared beliefs about their history, norms, values, and status in the architecture of global relations. These beliefs go on to shape foreign policy by making particular choices appear necessary or natural. The paper also parses out four analytical categories to study this relationship. This theoretical framework connects critical and cultural media theories with the constructivist paradigm in international relations.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0227,2014,Paper Session,The Political Communication of Independent Regulatory Agencies,5,"Following liberalization, regulatory agencies were created all over Europe in order to regulate the newly established competition. Therefore, a significant share of policy-making has been carried out by organizations that are neither democratically elected nor directly accountable to elected politicians. In this respect communication could prove to be highly important by contributing to the accountability of regulatory agencies and thereby helping them to mitigate their inherent deficit in democratic legitimacy. Moreover, regulators might also use communication as a soft tool of governance. However, agencies have so far been neglected by political communication research. To fill this gap, this paper examines the public communication of IRAs in four countries and three sectors based on interviews and content analyses. Results indicate that the organization of the communication function follows a national pattern approach while a policy sector approach is helpful for understanding the use of communication as a soft tool of regulation.

Yet few studies have examined the politically demobilizing role of conflict avoidance in contexts outside of the continental United States. As such, in the present study, data are analyzed from a probability-based mail survey of registered voters (N = 319) in the remote Western Pacific Island of Guam. Findings revealed that conflict avoidance is inversely associated with voters’ political participation, political efficacy, civic engagement, and attention to the Internet and interpersonal sources regarding a political issue. However, conflict avoidance was not associated with neighborliness, arguably, a less confrontational form of engagement.

Yet, political leaders around the world—from Rwanda to Egypt to Venezuela to Hungary—have restricted media freedom, arguing that irresponsible news coverage will incite political violence. Is media freedom a force for democracy or a source of domestic conflict? We hypothesize that the effect of media freedom on domestic conflict is conditioned in part by a country’s level of social tolerance. Specifically, we predict when social tolerance is high, media freedom will discourage domestic conflict because the tone of news coverage will tend to mirror the level of tolerance in society and ameliorate any inflammatory coverage. In contrast, we predict that low levels of social tolerance will fuel and be fueled by inflammatory news coverage if the media are free, and that this combination will promote domestic conflict.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

It was found that each of these films is congruent with Foucault’s ideas about disciplining the body. As people are continually defining themselves by invisible surveillance of social institutions, the tendency for self-medication or self-modification rises. Representations of normalcy are used to prescribe the structure of society. In each film, the protagonists are able to self-regulate their own mental illness with structures that are outside of institutional control. In essence, the mental health of each character resides in an internal panoptical struggle between Obsessive-compulsive disorder and normalcy. Each character “cures” himself without help from any medical or psychological help. Thus, each act as a prisoner with behaviors that are controlled by the unseen definitions of accepted behaviors.

Guided by those feminist theories, I analyzed public relations conducted by coalitions of public and private organizations constituting the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (PPPHW). I found that PPPHW’s localized handwashing campaigns mirrored FST’s activist commitment to social change, lived experience, and indigenous knowledge. Additionally, an ethic of care contributed to their effectiveness in decreasing infant disease, as well as (perceived) ethicalness. Finally, FST values and ethic of care aligned with glocal public relations’ goal of local responsiveness while retaining a global message (in this case, handwashing with soap).",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Hierarchical regressions along with an Aroian test indicated that community identification significantly mediated the relationship between active Facebook engagement and active e-WOM. However, gender did not significantly moderate the relationship between Facebook engagement and e-WOM.

What Digital Natives Think About Engaging With Brands and Organizations,3,"Stakeholder engagement is seen as a central aim for public relations, although few studies ask whether engagement is actually expected by stakeholders. Focusing on digital natives and their social media use, this paper defines “engagement” from several perspectives, distinguishing between positive and negative engagement. Reported results from a recent study differentiate nine types of engagement and show that digital natives often choose not to engage with brands or organizations. This might challenge the ideal of engagement and highlight the importance of careful target-group analysis. In addition, it is necessary to differentiate engagers based on their tone and degree of engagement.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Our interest is in what kinds of messages are posted by the wineries and how Facebook fans and Twitter followers respond to each kind of message. We propose a framework of four message-objective categories: managing reputation, announcing news, engaging customers and prospects, and promoting sales. Using this framework, we are currently analyzing data collected from 20 Oregon wineries over a 6-month span in 2013. A total of 998 separate winery posts and 1248 consumer responses to those posts were collected.

2014-0254,2014,Paper Session,Bridging Disciplines: An Agenda for Health Risk Communication Research and Practice,1,"This review takes a psychological approach to explain why people underestimate health risks despite health communication efforts to inform them about risks to improve their decisions and behaviors. It posits that people are predisposed to automatically underestimate self-relevant risks. Rationale for this proposition is derived from research documenting health risk information is (a) self-relevant, (b) inconsistent with the positivity bias and self-threatening and that (c) self-schema activation is automatic.

Literature on risk perceptions and automatic processing of self-relevant information is reviewed. A theoretical model that describes how people arrive at biased risk perceptions is presented. The model shows routes by which automatic activation of self-schema influences the processing of personal health information and biases risk perceptions. Implications for health risk communication research and practice and limitations of current framework are discussed.",Processes Underlying The Communication of Science and Health Information,Information Systems
2014-0255,2014,Paper Session,Bystanding or Standing by? How the Number of Bystanders Affects the Intention to Intervene in Cyberbullying,3,"The more bystanders are present in a critical situation the less individuals perceive responsibility to react what in turn prevents them from intervening. This “bystander effect” is highly robust in the face-to-face context. In cyberbullying bystanders play an essential role as their behavior can affect the process of such incidents. Although several studies inquire factors influencing bystander behavior in cyberbullying, the bystander effect has not been tested in this context. Thus, this study aims to do so: In a first experiment we find that the presence of bystanders lowers the intention to intervene. This bystander effect is completely mediated by the feeling of responsibility. Moreover, the bullying’s severity has a positive effect on the intention to intervene. Using a different number of bystanders, we cannot replicate the bystander effect in a second experiment. However, bystanders’ reactions reinforce as well as prevent participant’s intention to intervene.",Processes Underlying The Communication of Science and Health Information,Information Systems

Public deliberations are being explored to due claims of positive effects for the citizens who participate. However, there is a need to determine what aspects of the deliberative process actually lead to these beneficial effects. In this study we sought to determine what aspects of participating in a deliberative event are associated with increases in knowledge – specifically, knowledge about nanotechnology. Through implementing experimental design and measures at multiple time points, we sought to understand what aspects of the deliberative process lead to increases in knowledge of the topic and why they do so. Using three longitudinal studies, we determine that participants learn throughout the deliberative event, but the extent of learning differs based on how the information is presented, and the level of cognitive engagement while participating in the event.",Processes Underlying The Communication of Science and Health Information,Information Systems

The 53 participants were instructed to watch each PSA presented in a random order while psychophysiological measures were recorded to index real-time cognitive and emotional processes engaged while viewing the messages along with various self-report items. Results show that viewers allocate the most cognitive resources to gain-framed high empathy messages followed by loss-framed high empathy messages. Loss-framed high empathy messages are the most arousing, while gain-framed high empathy messages are the least arousing suggesting a difference in how these types of messages are processed.

In order to explore how visual representation of hurricane uncertainty affect risk perception, fear, anxiety, and behavioral intentions, a 2 (areas: affected vs. unaffected) × 2 (modality: animation vs. static images) × 2 (uncertainty graphic: cone vs. windfield) between-subjects online experiment (N = 207) was conducted. Results show that the animated windfield graphic raised perceived risk and other outcome variables compared to the static windfield graphic, whereas the pattern was reversed for the cone graphic.

Second, the study compared memory outcomes for news stories and tweets. The study focuses on three memory measures as pointed out above as memory outcomes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. With regard to encoding, and in addition to measuring recognition for news stories and tweets, the study includes two signal detection theory measures of sensitivity and criterion bias (Shapiro, 1994; MacMillan & Creelman, 1991) Based on this, we ask:
How do tweeter’s race, weight status, and the interaction between them affect encoding, storage, and retrieval for news stories and tweets?
How do tweeter’s race, weight status, and the interaction between them affect encoding, storage, and retrieval for tweets?

Task Outcome and Agency Attribution in Human-Technology Collaboration,3,"When humans routinely work and communicate with technology to complete tasks and solve problems, they constantly assess, consciously or non-consciously, the roles that they themselves and the technology play in the interaction. Given the well- known tendencies for fundamental attribution error in teamwork and the application of social rules to technology (Nass, Steuer, & Tauber, 1994), the existing literature in communication and social psychology would suggest a self-serving bias among human users when they collaborate with technologies on tasks: When things go well, the user will take credit for self; but when things go badly, they will blame the technology while distancing themselves from the failure. In this study, we empirically examine whether the fundamental attribution error is applicable in a human-technology collaborations, and whether that would influence users’ attribution of agency, as well as other psychological outcomes such as user experience and perception, in different task outcome scenarios.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems

This study focuses on cardiac activities during emotional video clips by analyzing heart rate variability, in order to examine how individuals’ approach motivational activation interacts with their experiences with violent games on both parasympathetic and sympathetic aspects of information processing. So far the results show some predicted outcomes, such as higher cardiac vagal index (CVI) , an indicator of parasympathetic activity, for participants high in approach system activation (ASA) while watching a violent video clip. On the other hand, Cardiac Sympathetic Index (CSI) which is an indicator of sympathetic activity is turned out to vary as a function of ASA, violent game exposure and video contents.

More specifically, the study focuses on kinesthetic involvement or the player’s sense of involvement related to the control and movement mechanisms in a game. A within-subjects experiment was conducted in which the player’s control over a racing game was varied by manipulating game controller type (symbolic controller versus mimetic controller). Results show that this variation in game controller significantly affected the recall and recognition of the brand placements embedded into the game. This impact was primarily due to differences in controller difficulty and internalization: when game controls are easier to use, they require less conscious attention, freeing attentional resources that can be subsequently spent on other elements of the game such as in-game advertising.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems
2014-0267,2014,Paper Session,"The Thrill is Gone, But You’d Never Know: Habituation and Generalization of Arousal Responses to Video Games",2,"Past research suggests that repeated exposure to video games “desensitizes” players to the arousing effects of game content. Notably, much of this research suffers from a lack of conceptual clarity and fails to systematically incorporate the psychological mechanisms of habituation and generalization. The current paper reports the results of a longitudinal study examining habituation and generalization using physiological data (blood pressure and heart rate) as well as self-report data. Findings of the current study suggest that habituation is experienced similarly with regard to both physiological and self-reported data. However, generalization (i.e., the extension of habituation processes to other similar stimuli) is only evident with regard to the physiological data. Results are discussed in terms of: Implications for game developers and players, implications for game researchers, current conceptual ambiguity between cross-sectional models and the results of longitudinal analyses, and the appropriateness of utilizing self-report measures in longitudinal studies examining arousal.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems

Effects of Perceived Enjoyment and Perceived Output Quality,3,"Human Computation Games (HCGs) are games that harness human intelligence to tackle computational problems. Put differently, HCGs allow individuals to perform computational tasks in an enjoyable manner, and generate useful outputs as byproducts. Hence, enjoyment and usefulness of outputs are recognized as two prominent features of HCGs. These games have proliferated in various problem spaces recently, and have demonstrated their usefulness in tackling computational problems. However, studies on individuals’ attitudes and behaviors related to HCGs have been lacking. This study aims to investigate the effects of perceived enjoyment and perceived output quality on intention to use HCGs within the context of SPLASH, our developed mobile HCG for sharing location-based content. A survey was designed and administered to 205 undergraduate and graduate students from a local university.

While traditional social network analysis approaches capture explicitly declared relationships, they often ignore the implicit relations within sequential interactions such as commits. We propose a method using temporal adjacencies within event log data to produce structural representations of sequence data to identify the trajectories of both users and artifacts as they progress through the system over time. These sociotechnical trajectories reduce large quantities of digital trace data into more parsimonious network graphs. These trajectories reveal the structure of sequences such as regularities in action or anomalies in the behavior of users and artifacts that can motivate follow-on qualitative investigations of social roles, communities of practice, and institutional routines. We evaluate the potential of this approach with case studies of user and project activity on two large and complex sociotechnical systems, GitHub and Wikipedia.",Online Media II: Analyses of Communication Networks,Information Systems

From an economic standpoint SNS rely on advertising based business models offering their services free of charge for users in exchange for attention and personal data in order to provide targeted, personalized advertising. This is in conflict with user’s privacy concerns about their personal data and information disclosed. Given facebook’s recent attempts to install user-sided payment options and to implement modified privacy regulations this paper analyzes how users evaluate and react to (a) a decrease of the platform’s privacy regulations and (b) the installation of different modes of user-sided payment. Empirically, this study is based on a quantitative online survey among facebook users (N=188).

Two experiments employed the original musical stimuli, one used contemporary music; two experiments employed a naïve experimenter team, whereas one – like the original – used hypothesis-aware experimenters. As the original study was criticized for relying on demand artifacts, we incorporated post-experimental inquiries exploring these. Across experiments, great care was taken to reproduce original materials and procedures. Results of the experiments using the original music provided no evidence for musical conditioning, but the experiment using contemporary music fully reproduced original effects.

2014-0282,2014,Paper Session,Story Appraisal Theory: Implications for Understanding Narrative Impact,2,"Story Appraisal Theory (SAT) postulates that input stories represented as story kernels are appraised in a three dimensional space defined by pointedness, plausibility and probative value. Narratives that have a point, are plausible and diagnostic of the prevalence of the phenomena depicted in the story are more likely to provoke implications than are narratives scoring lower on these three dimensions. Stories that provoke implications are more likely to prompt effects than stories provoking few implications. These SAT-derived propositions were tested using implications indicators derived from structured measures. Mediation analysis of computer theft, identity theft and the flu stories revealed that story versions judged to be pointed, plausible and probative provoked more implications than stories scoring low on the dimensions. Implications, in turn, were significantly related to a measure of estimated behavior change, as predicted by SAT.

Television narratives are a compressed form of storytelling. Certain parts are edited out, which greatly reduces the number of discrete chunks in an event, and even the chunks that remain often are not told in chronological order (Lang, 1989). Our ability to chunk, or segment, information into discrete elements, and then reconnect them, plays a primary role in our ability to control attention, allocate processing resources, and provide a means for both storing and retrieving long-term memories. Past research has provided some insight into how viewers process semantically related and unrelated scenes, but often in isolation from the narrative as a whole.

2014-0285,2014,Paper Session,The Influence of Radio Music Programming on Flow Experience During Radio Reception,3,"It is of fundamental importance for radio broadcast companies that their listeners do not turn off the radio or switch to another station. This can be accomplished when the audience enjoys the program – especially the music. The constitution of enjoyment can be explained by the flow concept. Only when the challenge of the content and the skill of the content user are balanced, flow experience and enjoyment arise. In order to create radio music programs compatible with large groups of people, the degree of complexity of radio music must remain rather low because most of the target audience has no skills or/and no motivation to listen to a challenging program with complex or/and unknown songs. To test these assumptions, a 4x1 between-subject experiment was conducted. The 217 participants listened to one of four different radio programs with a music program of twelve songs that varied in terms of complexity (complex vs. not complex) and publicity (unknown vs. well-known) of the songs.",Psychological Processes Underlying Consumption of Narrative and Music,Information Systems
2014-0286,2014,Paper Session,"Transportation, Narrative Engagement, and Storytelling: An Investigation of Time Required to Elicit Effects",2,"Much research has focused upon the elements that are required in order to tell a story. Two theories have emerged that attempt to explain the processing of narratives. The first is a derivative of Flow Theory known as Transportation Theory, the second is Narrative Engagement Theory. Both of these theories have been studied in many contexts however, each study compares a particular treatment against itself in order to determine if a person has been actively engaged in a story (Narrative Engagement) or transported (Transportation theory) into a story. This research study looks at how varying lengths of narratives can lead to varying degrees of transportability. Sixteen stimulus clips taken from cable television shows were used in an experiment. The 16-clips were edited for time in such a way as to keep the narrative virtually identical and modify the amount of time presented including 40 seconds, 50 seconds, and 60 seconds.",Psychological Processes Underlying Consumption of Narrative and Music,Information Systems
2014-0287,2014,Paper Session,Do Dependency Relations Resemble Behavioral Addiction? Exploring Psychophysiological Responses in a Media Systems Dependency Framework Using Multilevel Modeling,1,"In previous research about the emotional underpinnings of individual-level dependency relations, the dominance factor of emotion has become important. A dysfunctional relationship between perceived control and media use emerged. As increased media use for informational goal achievement has increased, perceptions of control have decreased. The proposed study explores whether individuals’ reported feelings of control match their automatic, psychophysiological responses, and to explore whether those responses might resemble psychophysiological responses related to behavioral addiction.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0288,2014,Paper Session,Moderating Effects of Ethnicity on Dynamic Motivational Processing of Antismoking PSAs,1,"Among all racial minority groups in the U.S., African Americans bear the greatest burden of harm resulted in smoking behavior. To better understand effectiveness of health intervention in cigarette smoking, it is important to examine the influence of both message content and individual difference. Built upon the framework of dynamic motivational activation, this ongoing experimental study attempts to test the model in the context of anti-smoking public service announcements (PSAs) viewing, and extend the framework by exploring the potential moderating effect of ethnicity on the process. The model brings together the basic motivational processing research and motivated media processing research, and specifies the dynamic causal relationships between exogenous message content variables and endogenous self-causing cognitive processing system. The experiment employs both physiological and self-report measurement, and incorporates ethnicity of both PSA characters and participants as a potential moderator.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0289,2014,Paper Session,Processing Food Advertisements: Initial Biological Responses Matter,2,"Food is a primary biological motivator and as such elicits automatic approach and consumption responses. How directly food is portrayed may alter these responses and as such alter how the ad, brand and product are evaluated. This study uses continuous response measurement (CRM) regarding how much an individual would like to eat food products across the course of their television advertisements as well as standard ad and brand attitude scales to investigate these evaluations. The ads in this study differed in how they were produced. Some ads initially portrayed food as very appetizing and ready-to-eat while others initially portrayed foods in their packaging and not ready-to-eat. In general, results support that unpackaged food is more directly appetitive showing better appetitive ratings overall.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0290,2014,Paper Session,Representations of Primary Appetitive Stimuli: How Food Advertising and Packaging Alter Cognitive and Motivational Responses,2,"This study examines how the way food is presented, packaged and available to our senses alters the time course of our processing and responses toward it. Participants were asked to categorize images of food that varied in their directness before and after being exposed to a set of advertisements that also varied in the directness of their available food cues. In general, food products that appeared direct and ready-to-eat sped motivational processes but slowed cognitive processes, and food products that had the least direct food cues did the opposite. Exposure to advertisements, overall, did not hasten the motivational processing of branded information. Implications and future research are discussed.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems

The research will investigate how emotional content of the ads, specifically anger and disgust, impact smokers’ appraisal and processing of the content of the messages.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0292,2014,Paper Session,Boost Your Body: Self-Improvement Magazine Headlines Increase Body Satisfaction in Young Adults,3,"The present study investigated how verbal messages moderate media users’ body satisfaction in response to exposure to idealized body imagery. Guided by social comparison theorizing, hypotheses were tested in an experimental design with social comparison motives (self-improvement vs. self-evaluation vs. control) induced through magazine cover headlines and recipient gender as between-subjects factors, and with body satisfaction as within-subjects factor (pre- vs. post-exposure measures; N=150 young adults). Results showed that self-improvement headlines accompanying media models with idealized bodies increased body satisfaction, compared to control headlines and baseline measures. In contrast the self-evaluation headlines did not impact body satisfaction. Results imply that inconsistencies in the extant literature regarding effects from exposure to idealized body imagery are explained by the context in which media images are portrayed, which evoke differential social comparison motives.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0293,2014,Paper Session,Extending the O-S-R-O-R Framework to Healthcare Marketing Communications: How Reasoning Processes Mediated Information Effects,3,"Based on the O-S-R-O-R (orientations-stimuli-reasoning-orientations-responses) model of communication effects, this study investigates the effects of healthcare marketing communications (HMC) on consumption of healthcare products and medicines. More specifically, this research proposes and tests an O-S-R-O-R model to provide a more comprehensive picture of the underlying mechanism of HMC effects on healthcare behaviors. To test the theoretical model, we analyze data from the 2013 Consumer Health MARS (Multimedia Audience Research Systems) survey on a syndicated multimedia and product usage related to health and healthcare. The total sample size is approximately 20,000 with 42.8% response rate, obtained as a representative sample of adults residing in the US. We predict that all hypothesized paths in our model will achieve statistically significance with effects in the expected direction, providing support for our view that HMC translates into healthcare consumption through a reasoning processes reflected in interpersonal communications and additional information seeking behaviors.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0294,2014,Paper Session,Goal Refreshing and Stimulation: Can Media Multitasking Help Keep Focus While Reading Health-Related Information Online?,3,"A 3 (Multitasking: control, serial, parallel) x 2 (Message repetition) experiment is proposed to explore positive effects of media multitasking. The propositions of the current study rest on the assumption that individuals use media for pleasure while performing more difficult and less enjoyable tasks. Based on the reviewed literature, we predicted that pairing pleasant media activities, such as listening to music (parallel) and checking social networking sites (SNS; serial) with the primary task of reading health-related information online, would lead to more favorable attitudes toward tasks and multitasking situations, enhance memory for health-related contents, and lead to greater argument understanding, argument agreement, and intentions to engage in health problem prevention activities. Literature is reviewed, experimental design is described, and the results of a pretest survey are reported in the current extended abstract.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0295,2014,Paper Session,"""This Ad is So You!“: Perception and Effectiveness of Personalized Online Advertisement",1,"Though personalized advertisement is ubiquitous especially in the online environment, it is still unclear whether this type of advertisement really is more and effective than non-personalized ads. Prior studies yield mixed results, some of them even indicating negative effects of personalization. The present paper discusses theoretical assumptions why personalization via consumers’ preferences should be effective and tests these assumptions in an experimental design. Results indicate that only strong personalization leads to better memory and more favorable evaluation for the advertisement, but not for the brand.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0296,2014,Paper Session,Can’t Cut Through the Clutter: Memory Impairment for Brands Advertised in Violent and Congruent Video Game Contexts,2,"The development of Tivo and advertising blockers has led to advertisers demonstrating openness to increasing the level of product placement found in video games. Previous research has found that violent content results in memory impairment for products shown during commercial breaks. We extend this work on violent content into the arena of violent video games. In particular, this study examines how violent game content and advertisement congruency affects memory and brand evaluations for fictional brands. Congruent advertisements depict brands related to the actions completed by the player in the game world. Participants were exposed to interactive advertisements placed on the bumper of the car used during gameplay. We found that violent content and congruent advertisements yield decreased memory for the brands depicted in the game. We discuss the significance of these findings in light of the changes predicted for the field of in-game advertising.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0297,2014,Paper Session,Consumers' Online Brand Endorsements: A Study Into Intentios to Endorse Different Types of Brands,1,"Advertisers increasingly motivate people to endorse brands as a tactic to overcome people’s resistance against traditional persuasion attempts. In the present paper we introduce the concept of consumer endorsement, which we define as people’s intentional public and positive affiliations with brands. Little is known yet about why people are willing to endorse brands. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to examine factors that affect people’s decisions to endorse brands. Suggesting that people strive to express their identities by publicly endorsing brands, we investigated to what extent brand symbolism and the public (vs. private) nature of an endorsement affected people’s intentions to endorse, and explored whether these effects differed between for-profit and nonprofit brands. Results indicate that people prefer to publicly affiliate with nonprofit brands, but prefer private affiliation with for-profit brands. Higher levels of brand symbolism enhanced people’s intention to endorse for-profit brands but not nonprofit brands.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0298,2014,Paper Session,How Advertising Cues in Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns Influence Consumer Responses,1,"The aim of the present experiment was to investigate how communication elements of a cause-related marketing (CRM) campaign influence consumer responses to the advertised product. Specifically, the roles of visual focus (on the company or on the social cause) and textual message (informational or emotional) were studied. The CRM literature provides some suggestions about these communication strategies, but these suggestions are sometimes contradictory, or not based on direct comparisons of the different elements. Moreover, little is known about the effects of different combinations of these visual and textual advertising elements. In sum, the results of this study show that the combination of visual and textual elements is of importance. Congruent advertisements (visual of company with informational message or visual of cause with emotional message) resulted in more positive consumer responses than incongruent advertisements. Furthermore, first indications for a mediating role of CRM skepticism are obtained in this study.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0299,2014,Paper Session,The Effect of Goal Specificity and Self-Referencing Ad on Persuasion,1,"This study sought to examine how motivation to use a website and use of self-referencing tactics in an ad affect persuasion. Although goal specificity and self-referencing are both known to affect elaboration, it is unclear how these two sources of elaboration interact. The results showed that lacking a goal resulted in more attention toward the ad and participants had higher intention to click on it than those with a goal. While exposure to high and low self-referencing ad did not have a varying effect on persuasion, there was an interesting interaction effect of motivation and self-referencing ad on attitude toward the website that call for further research.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0300,2014,Paper Session,The Interaction Effects of Mood and Message Characteristics on Advertising Effectiveness,3,"An experiment was conducted to examine how positive and negative mood and types of ad appeals influence evaluation of ad, product and purchase intention. The findings showed that people in a positive mood were more likely to utilize relational processing, whereas people in a negative mood were more likely to utilize item-specific processing. The results also showed that people in a positive mood evaluated ad and product more positively when they were exposed to ad with a utilitarian appeal, whereas people in a negative mood evaluated ad and product more positively when they were exposed to an ad with an experiential appeal. Also, people in a positive mood were more likely to buy the product regardless of types of ad, whereas people in a negative mood were more likely to buy the product when they were exposed to an ad with an experiential appeal. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems

The Role of Argument Quality in Advertising Warning Effects,3,"We investigated the effects of warnings on message recipient’s responses. It was observed that a warning after a persuasive message (compared to a before or no-warning condition) results in more deliberate decision-making; in the after warning condition, consumers responded more positively towards an ad and the advertised product when the message contained strong vs. weak message arguments.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0302,2014,Paper Session,When Discounting Fails: Initial Beliefs Can Bias Processing of Corrective Advertising Disclosures,1,"This study aimed to examine the impact of disclaimer saliency and content type in correcting false inferences in mutual fund advertisements. Overall, disclaimer saliency and content type had an additive effect. That is, making the mandated (more general) disclaimer salient as well as a stronger worded disclaimer reduced investors’ return expectations and attitudes toward the advertised fund, indicating that systematic processing of disclaimer content attenuated subjects’ beliefs in a “hot hand” effect (i.e., past success predicts future success). More interestingly, disclaimer content interacted with subjects’ prior knowledge. A strong worded disclaimer which explicitly stated not to rely on prior fund performance (which is normatively irrelevant and uninformative) was effective only among low knowledgeable subjects, whereas high knowledgeable subjects failed to discount prior fund performance in their return expectations and attitudes toward the advertised fund. Overall, the results suggest that investors apparently hold strong beliefs in a “hot hand” effect and that these beliefs tend to persevere among high knowledge investors, even when provided with a strong worded disclaimer.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
