2018-0000,2018,Paper Session,"Acceptable Experimentation?: Investigating Women’s Communicative, Relational, and Transgression-Related Responses to a Male Partner’s Same-Sex Infidelity",4,"The present investigation explored women’s responses to a male partner’s imagined same-sex infidelity. Previous work revealed important differences in women’s and men’s responses to same-sex infidelity, but failed to consider the role that motivations for engaging in extradydadic behavior play in predicting outcomes of such acts. Study 1 entailed a qualitative analysis of individuals’ reported reasons for their own or a friend’s same-sex infidelity, revealing that individuals engage in same-sex infidelity for reasons of jealousy, vengefulness, sexual depression, sexual preoccupation, sociosexuality, experimentation, not cheating, and attraction. Study 2 built upon these findings by testing whether these reasons and motivations for infidelity predicted differences in women’s communicative, relational, and transgression-related responses to a male partner’s same-sex infidelity. The findings revealed that women were the least motivated to avoid the situation, most likely to show benevolence, and least likely to respond with silence when experimentation was the underlying reason for the infidelity, and similarly showed less blame for infidelity motivated by experimentation compared to a number of the other motivations. Infidelity motivated by vengefulness was also associated with less partner blame and greater partner intentionality than many of the other motivations. These findings and their implications for understanding same-sex infidelity are discussed.","Transitions, Transgressions, and Relational Uncertainties",Interpersonal Communication
2018-0001,2018,Paper Session,Exploring the Effect of Pillow Talk on Physiological Stress Responses to Couples’ Difficult Conversations,6,"Guided by the tenets of affection exchange theory and the theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL), the present study examined the effects of pillow talk (i.e., communication after sexual activity) on relationship satisfaction and physiological stress responses to difficult conversations between romantic partners. In an experiment, 50 heterosexual couples were randomly assigned to either a pillow talk condition in which they were instructed to double the amount of their pillow talk over a three-week time period, or a control condition. At the end of the three weeks, participants came to the lab to provide saliva samples, engage in a stress/conflict conversation, and complete a post-conversation survey. Saliva samples were assayed for cortisol, a physiological marker of stress reactivity. The results indicated that increased pillow talk produced greater relationship satisfaction and influenced physiological stress responses when discussing a difficult topic, but only for men. More specifically, men in the pillow talk condition reported greater relationship satisfaction and were less stressed after the conflict conversation as compared to those in the control condition. The findings support the central propositions of the TRRL and suggest that pillow talk may have a stress-buffering effect that extends beyond the sexual episode and has positive benefits for romantic relationships, more broadly.","Transitions, Transgressions, and Relational Uncertainties",Interpersonal Communication
2018-0002,2018,Paper Session,Outcomes of Relational Uncertainty and Interference and Facilitation in Marriage: Tests of Relational Turbulence Theory,2,"This study examined associations between relational uncertainty and/or interference and facilitation from a partner and nine measures of cognitive, emotional, and communicative phenomena. Structural equation modeling evaluated predictions deduced from relational turbulence theory (RTT), which links relational uncertainty to more biased cognitions and interference and facilitation from a partner to emotional intensity; a research question focused on associations with indices of communicative engagement. Results provided mixed support for RTT. Relational uncertainty was significantly associated with taking conflict personally and cognitive jealousy as predicted, but it was also associated with emotional jealousy and did not predict communicative engagement. Interference from a partner was significantly and positively associated with negative affect for women, daily hassles, and topic avoidance for men. Facilitation from a partner corresponded significantly with negative affect for men, the directness of communication about hurt, and topic avoidance for men; contrary to expectations, it also predicted cognitive jealousy. The discussion highlights implications for future research on relational turbulence in marriage.","Transitions, Transgressions, and Relational Uncertainties",Interpersonal Communication
2018-0003,2018,Paper Session,Navigating Relational Turbulence in the Wake of Weight Loss Transitions: A Support Marshaling Analysis,5,Two studies were conducted to investigate how individuals optimize their partner’s support during the weight transition to accomplish their weight loss goals. Study 1 collected responses from individuals regarding the way in which they marshal support from their partners. Participant testimonials were coded and eleven support marshaling strategies were identified. The strategies were conceptualized as being either approach or avoidance oriented and could be further characterized as either or both direct and indirect oriented. Study 2 surveyed 292 participants and tested a theoretical model to determine the role of support marshaling in managing the turbulence associated with weight transitions. Structural equation modeling analyses broadly identified that support marshaling is a useful framework from which to consider how the turbulence associated with weight transitions influences health behaviors. Implications for theory are discussed.,"Transitions, Transgressions, and Relational Uncertainties",Interpersonal Communication
2018-0004,2018,Paper Session,The Impact of Generativity Awareness on Mid- to Old-Age Smokers in China,5,"Generativity is based on evaluating the worth of one’s life experience that can be passed on to others. Smokers can have a powerful role in preventing family members from experiencing health challenges related to smoking. This study evaluated whether legacy awareness can have an impact on smoking reduction. 508 Chinese smokers were recruited and demonstrated their strong awareness of generativity. The study showed support for a three-dimensional model for generativity, namely general, health, and smoke-free generativity. When participants were primed to think about smoke free family legacy, they showed more resolve to reduce their own smoking and to encourage their children to quit. The three types of generativity showed differential effects on behavioral intention to reduce smoking and to encourage younger family members not to smoke. Conformity communication pattern, significantly influenced behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Understanding Determinants of Health Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0005,2018,Paper Session,Where is the Party Tonight? The Impact of Fear of Missing Out on Peer Norms and Alcohol Expectancies and Consumption among College Students,2,"Little is known about how the excessive drinking culture entrenched in college social life influences the fear of missing out (FOMO)on the binge drinking experience among college students.
To that end, the objectives of this study were to 1) develop and validate a self-report measure of alcohol-related FOMO, and 2) assess the role of alcohol-related FOMO in increasing binge drinking intentions through mediating the effect of alcohol expectancies and enhancing susceptibility to peer norms. A college student sample (N = 490; 66.3% female) completed a one-shot survey. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported an 18-item multidimensional scale tapping the alcohol-related FOMO (ALFOMO). ALFOMO was a significant focal predictor of binge drinking intentions. It significantly mediated the effect of alcohol positive expectancies and mediated and moderated the positive effect of peer descriptive norms.",Understanding Determinants of Health Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0006,2018,Paper Session,Who Will be a Bystander? First-Person Perception Effects on Bystander Behavior on Campus,4,"A web-based survey was conducted with 379 undergraduate students at XXX University. The survey covered demographics, previous bystander training, self-efficacy to engage in bystander behavior, social desirability of bystander intervention training programs, and third-person perception effects (TPE). Participants also indicated how they would act in six hypothetical bystander scenarios, and how they thought an average student on campus would act. Perceived ambiguity and risk for each of the scenarios were also measured. Results showed that bystander programs are socially desirable and a robust first-person effect existed (e.g., the student perceived themselves being more influenced by bystander interventions training messages than their peers), especially among female students. The magnitude of FPP increased as a function of previous training, self-efficacy, and social desirability of bystander behavior training messages, whereas the magnitude decreased with perceived ambiguity and risk.",Understanding Determinants of Health Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0007,2018,Paper Session,Integrating Mental Contrasting With Implementation Intentions in Persuasive Mediated Health Communication,2,"Theories and research from motivational psychology show, that addressing obstacles and concrete plans, also referred to as Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII), provide efficient means to motivate people to adapt or change a certain behavior. Therefore, it could provide health communication practitioners with guidance, as how to create effective persuasive messages However, research on MCII has so far been neglected within the context of mediated persuasive health communication and models of health behavior. This paper will develop and discuss the potential as well as effects of MCII on individuals’ efficacy perceptions being the key factor triggering danger control processes, eventually leading to adaptive behavior change. Furthermore, it explores the possibilities to apply MCII as a promising strategy for health communication message design. The concept is discussed against the background of current models, in particular the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM).",Understanding Determinants of Health Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0008,2018,Paper Session,The Role of Cognitive Tension in Health Decision-Making: A Preliminary Investigation,3,"In physics, tension is viewed as stress relative to strain. While this is a widely accepted explanation of physical tension, we fail to have an equivalent definition of cognitive tension. As the abundance of conflicting health messages in our environment can lead to mental stress, a measure of cognitive tension could greatly assist in modeling the decision-making process under particularly conflicting conditions. This study therefore built upon prior research examining the role of ambivalence (highly polarized attitudinal beliefs) in models of decision-making. We integrated knowledge regarding tolerance for uncertainty to define cognitive tension in a manner similar to physical tension; stress (ambivalence) in relation to strain (tolerance for ambivalence). Our exploration focused on the decision to try a controversial sunscreen when presented with information that it can both prevent and cause cancer. A structural equation model revealed that cognitive tension does contribute an additional amount of explained variance in behavioral intentions beyond variables traditionally measured. Future research is needed to replicate this finding in other decision-making contexts.",Understanding Determinants of Health Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0009,2018,Paper Session,Benefits and Risks of Personal Health Information Sharing Online: PatientsLikeMe Users’ Privacy Concerns and Self-Protection Strategies,2,"While extensive research has identified motivations and risks of using health social network sites (SNS), less is known on how privacy concerns and practices are related to health information disclosures online. In this paper, we present a mixed-method study drawing on user-generated posts and user attributes (N=329) from the health SNS PatientsLikeMe.com. We first used qualitative content analysis to identify users' privacy concerns, self-protection strategies, and perceived affordances. Further statistical analysis revealed the amount of health data sharing associated with users’ social connectedness and their privacy-related attitudes and behaviors. When users believed they had control over their disclosures and adopted privacy protection strategies, they shared more health data. Furthermore, informed consent on how data will be used correlated with users’ pro-sharing beliefs. We conclude with a discussion of potential challenges and opportunities developing health SNSs for personal health data exchange.","Seeking, Sharing, and Being Persuaded by Health Information Online",Communication and Technology
2018-0010,2018,Paper Session,Health Information Seeking on WeChat: An Examination of the Relationship between Motivations and Active Engagement,2,"Social media not only provide individuals more tailored health information, but also allow creation and exchange of user-generated message with individual’s own healthcare experiences and knowledge. Using the two-step procedure common in Uses and Gratifications research, in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 WeChat users to explore their motivations for health information on the site, which were further rated by 522 WeChat users through a national wide online survey. Exploratory factor analysis identified five motivations: information seeking, building self-agency, social interaction, technological convenience, and self-expression. The analysis of the relationship between motivations and active engagement on WeChat indicates that social interaction is the best predictor of healthcare information engagement, though building self-agency is another strong predictor. Findings from this study contribute to understandings of the psychological antecedents of using mobile social media for health information and the subsequent active behavior responses.","Seeking, Sharing, and Being Persuaded by Health Information Online",Communication and Technology
2018-0011,2018,Paper Session,"From Online to Offline: Exploring the Role of Internet Health Information Seeking, Self-Efficacy in Decision-Making on Patient-centered Communication",2,"More people than ever before turn to the Internet for health information. However, the social mechanism underlying the relationship between online health information seeking and offline patient-provider communication remains unclear. Informed by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction, we proposed and tested a mediation pathway linking Internet health information seeking to patient-centered communication. Our findings showed that one-way Internet health information seeking failed to influence patient-centered communication either directly or indirectly. In contrast, two-way Internet health information seeking exerted a positive and direct effect on patient-centered communication, as well as an indirect effect, mediated by self-efficacy in decision-making. As we embrace the eHealth movement, health care organizations should take into account how online health information seeking can facilitate more patient-centered care in face-to-face interactions and ultimately improve quality health care.","Seeking, Sharing, and Being Persuaded by Health Information Online",Communication and Technology
2018-0012,2018,Paper Session,Two Faces of Interactivity: The Application of the Heuristic-Systematic Model to an Interactive Anti-Smoking Website,3,"Based on the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion, the current paper dissects the mechanism by which interactivity affects smokers’ attitudes and behaviors after browsing an interactive anti-smoking website. An experiment with 112 current smokers (control vs. interactive condition) was conducted to examine the effects of interactivity on message processing and persuasion outcomes. The results demonstrated that three types of indirect effects of interactivity predicted smokers’ attitudes and beliefs. First, smokers selectively scanned the interactive website more than the control website, which diminished change in their message-congruent beliefs after browsing and negatively influenced their attitudes toward the website. Second, as long as smokers perceived the website to be interactive, their perception of interactivity functioned as a heuristic cue that directly led to greater change in anti-smoking beliefs and attitudes. Finally, perceived interactivity also led to positively biased systematic processing, which in turn, led to greater persuasive impact.","Seeking, Sharing, and Being Persuaded by Health Information Online",Communication and Technology
2018-0013,2018,Paper Session,Using Communication Infrastructure Theory to Consider Built Environment Factors within Health Communication Interventions,1,"Persuasion theories fail to account for the structural contexts that may impede performance of health behaviors. The built environment are manmade features of the environment that may impact health behaviors. This paper proposes that communication infrastructure theory offers a way for health communication scholars to consider the role of the built environment within health promotion intervention efforts. The theory suggests that every community has a communication infrastructure that consists of a storytelling system and a communication action context. The built environment is part of the communication action context, affecting not only health outcomes, but individuals’ ability to connect to neighborhood storytelling agents. Considerations for communication infrastructure based interventions are discussed.",Research to Inform the Design of Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2018-0014,2018,Paper Session,Complex Negotiation Plans Predicting Sober Condom Use: A Longitudinal Study on Young African American Women,5,"Communication about condom use is essential for young African American women to protect their sexual health; yet, condom negotiation requires some levels of cognitive preparation (i.e., planning). This study hypothesizes that the complexity of condom negotiation plans, as indicated by plan length and breadth, is positively associated with intentions to talk about condom use, which in turn positively predicts condom use three months later. Also, alcohol use before sex is expected to influence plan implementation. Participants (N = 139) generated plans for condom negotiation at baseline and reported their alcohol consumption, condom negotiation intention, and last sex condom use at baseline and three months later. We found that plan complexity was positively related to condom negotiation intention, but only when people were sober did plan complexity positively predict condom use via intention. The results underline the importance of event-specific variables for sex research and have implications for public health interventions.",Research to Inform the Design of Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2018-0015,2018,Paper Session,Creating Depression Public Service Announcements by Collaborating With People With Heightened Depressive Symptomatology,2,"People with depression are difficult to persuade. This paper provides an example of a mixed methods approach to message development for people with depression. Study 1 participants (N=186) provided reasons to seek help for depression and barriers to seeking help for depression. Qualitative analysis determined 112 reasons to seek help and 124 barriers to seeking help. Study 2 participants (N=214) with heightened levels of depressive symptomatology rated Study 1 reasons and barriers on their attitude function, importance, awareness, and argument strength. These ratings determined the selection of statements used in the creation of depression public service announcements (D-PSAs), which were guided by the functional matching and message-sidedness approaches to message development. Considering the difficulty of persuading people with depression to seek help and the potential for D-PSAs to cause boomerang effects, it is important to develop D-PSAs with careful consideration of how they will be perceived by people with depression.",Research to Inform the Design of Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2018-0016,2018,Paper Session,From Self-Reliers to Expert-Dependents: The Identification of Clusters Based on Health-Related Needs for Autonomy and External Control,2,"Mobile health apps are seen as promising tools to support autonomous consumers in their quest for better health. However, individual differences in the needs for autonomy and external control may impact the degree to which individuals perceive mobile health apps to be useful in their daily life. Using data from a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 1,027), we applied latent class analysis to identify subtypes among mobile users based on their needs for autonomy and external control, and to examine differences among these subtypes. We identified four subgroups: the self-reliers, confirmation-seekers, expert-dependents, and indifferents. Next to demographic differences, self-reliers and confirmation-seekers were generally more e-health literate and expressed more privacy concerns than the expert-dependents and indifferents. Our findings demonstrate that subgroups of people express different degrees of health-related needs for autonomy and external control, which should be taken into account in online and mobile health communication efforts.",Research to Inform the Design of Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2018-0017,2018,Paper Session,Validating the Hornik & Woolf approach to Choosing Media Campaign Themes: Do Promising Beliefs Predict Behavior Change in a Longitudinal Study?,7,"Hornik and Woolf (1999) proposed using cross-sectional survey data to prioritize beliefs to address with communication campaign messages. The empirical component of the approach combines evidence of (1) association of beliefs with intentions and (2) current level of beliefs to calculate a ‘percentage to gain’ as the potential promise of a belief. However the method relies on cross-sectional data; its conclusions are open to challenge. Here, a panel study assesses whether the calculated promise of a belief actually predicts future behavior change. A nationally representative sample of 3,204 U.S. youth and young adults were interviewed twice, six months apart. Sixteen beliefs about the benefits and costs of smoking cigarettes are compared with regard to their percentage to gain (calculated from cross-sectional data) and their ability to account for subsequent cigarette use. A belief’s cross-sectional percentage to gain is substantially associated with its ability to predict subsequent behavior change (r=.53, p<.05).",Research to Inform the Design of Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2018-0018,2018,Paper Session,The Effects of Cognitive and Metacognitive Input in Narrative Persuasion,2,"How does counterarguing affect narrative persuasion? According to the cognitive perspective, the generation of counterarguments is a key obstacle to persuasive efforts. Following the metacognitive view, however, the experience of difficulty that accompanies increased counterarguing, actually, may benefit persuasion. These two contrasting predictions were experimentally evaluated (N = 587) by manipulating the instructions of thought-listing tasks following exposure to a story that advocated for Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS). Results for participants low-in-NfC supported the cognitive prediction, whereby generating many counterarguments (7) led to less favorable attitudes toward PAS, whereas fewer counterarguments (2) engendered more positive attitudes. In contrast, participants high-in-NfC were not only influenced by the thought content, but also by the experience of ease or difficulty that accompanied the generation of counterarguments. Among this group, increased counterarguing (7) resulted in more favorable attitudes toward PAS, while fewer counterarguments (2) were translated into greater opposition.",Narratives,Mass Communication
2018-0019,2018,Paper Session,Which Traits Shape Responses to Thought-Provoking Narrative Forms?,4,"We present five experiments manipulating levels of cognitive conflict elicited by the stimuli to understand which traits shape responses to thought-provoking narratives. The first three experiments show text-based narratives ending clearly and positively (i.e., low cognitive conflict) versus ambiguously and in a mixed-emotional fashion (i.e., high cognitive conflict). The fourth study uses non-narrative stimuli taken from the classic Stroop test. The fifth study uses two feature-length films to represent clear and positive versus ambiguous and mixed-emotional. Our original reasoning, that moral foundations of care and fairness would moderate responses to depictions of saving/killing lives and restoring/thwarting justice, did not pan out in the data. Instead, the pattern of results seems to suggest that greater levels of progressivism (i.e., the relative emphasis of care and fairness over ingroup loyalty, authority, and purity) leads to more fluent processing of cognitive conflict regardless of the specific moral themes present in the stimuli.",Narratives,Mass Communication
2018-0020,2018,Paper Session,Testing an Attribution-Based Adaptation of Affective Disposition Theory on Narratives Featuring Various Character Types,8,"Scholars question ADT’s ability to explain the appeal of protagonists who act immorally, challenging ADT’s claim that audiences are constant moral monitors. A rival hypothesis reasons that initial story cues prime character archetypes that predetermine who audiences root for. This causes audiences to overlook subsequent moral violations by liked characters to enjoy the story. An alternative explanation that is consistent with ADT argues that continuous cues throughout narratives shape viewer attributions about liked characters’ immoral acts. Cues prompting external attributions allow audiences to continue to like characters, while cues prompting internal attributions promote character dislike. Our experiments varied initial character archetypes (imperfect hero, MAC, villain) to see if they predetermined viewer attributions for subsequent behaviors and liking. One of two attempts replicated previous research showing that cues throughout narrative affect attributions and character liking. Archetype primes did not vary this effect.",Narratives,Mass Communication
2018-0021,2018,Paper Session,The Role of Narrative Ending in Restorative Narratives,2,"Restorative narratives are stories that report negative news (e.g., disasters, chronic social issues), but highlight the resilience and meaningful progression of the victim(s). These stories emphasize the process of recovery and may offer a way to communicate negative information without leaving audiences feeling emotionally overwhelmed. The current study examines a key component of restorative narratives: the narrative ending. We randomly assigned participants (N = 409) to read one of three narratives about a homeless man (restorative: progression/positive outcome; negative: no progression/negative outcome; negative-ending: progression/negative outcome). Results indicated that the restorative narrative induced significantly more positive emotions, moral elevation, and a desire to engage with similar stories than both the negative and negative-ending narrative, suggesting that a positive outcome is a necessary component of restorative narratives. We also found significant indirect effects of narrative condition on the willingness to help (donate, volunteer) through emotion and elevation responses.",Narratives,Mass Communication
2018-0022,2018,Paper Session,Deliberating Over Conflicting Interests: Deliberative Participatory Budgeting in Urban China,2,"Conflicting interests are ubiquitous in the political world. Public deliberation over conflicting interests involves the rational pursuit of self-interest, perspective-taking, as well as the weighing of competing needs. While most existing literature focuses on deliberative practices with a clear common objective, our study extends the inquiry into a more difficult and complicated scenario. We conducted a deliberative participatory budgeting project in urban China and offer an empirical examination revealing how self-interest and concerns for others manifest in deliberation over distributive resources. We find that despite the fact that people make decisions to benefit themselves over others, once they deliberate, they prioritize the disadvantaged group and others' needs that are similar to their own. Public deliberation thereby reconciles conflicting interests by facilitating collective decision-making on the basis of information, rationality, and mutual understanding.",Deliberation and Its Effects,Political Communication
2018-0023,2018,Paper Session,"Diversity, Disagreement, and Expression across Liberal, Conservative, and Mixed Groups",1,"The notion that a healthy democracy requires a public who discusses politics is based on the assumption that discussions expose members of the public to the opinions and points of view of others. The contentious nature of politics and that people generally prefer to avoid political disagreements, however, suggest that people may withhold their opinions during such encounters. This work couples survey responses and a content analysis of sixty political discussions from a nationally representative sample to investigate the relationship between political opinion expression, diversity, and disagreement and how those variables function across liberal, conservative, and politically heterogeneous groups.

2018-0024,2018,Paper Session,Does Deliberation Work? Testing the Assumption that Deliberative Discussion Changes Knowledge and Opinion,1,"Over the past few decades, thousands of deliberative forums have been implemented across the globe and had their quality and impact empirically assessed. An essential question, however, remains untested. Do the ideals of deliberation actually lead to the desired outcomes? Or, more precisely, do analytic rigor and democratic discussion predict process satisfaction, knowledge gains, and opinion change? Relying on surveys of twelve Citizens’ Initiative Reviews, this study tests whether these ideal deliberative inputs predict the desired deliberative outputs. The findings show mixed results. Analytic rigor and democratic discussion were predictive of participant satisfaction and having learned enough to reach a good decision but not of opinion change. Further analysis indicates that the issue in question, and not necessarily the deliberative process, is a stronger indicator of the presence or absence of opinion change.",Deliberation and Its Effects,Political Communication
2018-0025,2018,Paper Session,Procedural Justice in Deliberation: Theoretical Explanations and Empirical Findings,2,"This paper reviewed extant conceptualizations of procedural justice and reported results of an empirical study testing the effects of fair procedures on deliberative outcomes. From a communicative action perspective, this paper argued that Habermas’s conceptions of speech conditions and validity conditions can be used to evaluate the discursive and non-discursive dimensions of procedural justice. These communicative measures are compatible with extant justice measures and provide a more communication-centered ground for evaluating the rightfulness of political decision making. The applied setting involved public discussions about the Singapore government’s population policies in an online deliberation setting. Survey data were collected from 456 participants before and after deliberations. Fair procedures were positively associated with participants’ discussion satisfaction and their general support for deliberative decision making. The relationship between procedural justice and specific policy support was mixed. Findings from this study help advance existing knowledge about the normative and practical values of fair deliberation.",Deliberation and Its Effects,Political Communication

This project develops a thick theory of community that spans contexts and accounts for the centrality of community in ethical decision making. It begins with two “macro” theories of community and then outlines two micro and social-science based theories of community—a community continuum tied to specific ethical values. Then project then employs feminist theory, particularly the work of Martha Nussbaum, as a conceptual bridge linking different sorts of communities and the values connected with them. This thick theory of community informs the concept of bounded individual autonomy and an ethic of belongingness to explain how community is central to 21st century media ethics issues.",Understanding Journalism From a Community Perspective,Journalism Studies

This case study of a region within a red state uses a communication infrastructure theory framework to examine how this political context affects residents’ relationships with media and their larger community storytelling networks. Through a series of focus groups, story diaries, and interviews with residents and local journalists, it explores whether shared communication resources remain and the potential for creating spaces for dialogue across political and demographic divides. Findings illustrate how residents negotiate interpersonal relationships, community spaces, and local and national media in a polarized communication context.

2018-0028,2018,Paper Session,"The Relevance of News Within Different Communities: Conversations on Current Affairs in Location, Work, and Leisure-Based Social Media Groups",3,"Social media platforms are an increasingly dominant medium through which people encounter news and journalism in everyday life. Yet while we are learning more-and-more about these practices, the content that circulates, and broader network configurations, the ‘social’ part of news on social media remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap to consider how the relational structures of everyday life in which news is embedded influences its relevance on social media. Specifically, it investigates how different community dynamics impact the inclination to engage with current affairs collectively. It employs six focus groups centering around: 1) location 2) work and 3) leisure-based communities. While interaction on social media in half these groups, who communicate regularly on- and offline, centered around news, in the others such communication remained mostly absent. This paper argues perceived tie strength and group dynamics influence and differentiate the forms, engagement, motivations, and significance of news circulation on social media.",Understanding Journalism From a Community Perspective,Journalism Studies

This paper applies sociological concepts of deviance and social control to categorize efforts to moderate online news comments. Particular focus is on informal social control (i.e., rating and reporting of news comments) in order to answer the above question. A survey of online news users found that demographics play an important role—younger, wealthier, White, males are most likely to report abusive comments—though self-efficacy, trust in the news media, and authoritarian personality traits also were significant predictors of bystander intervention. Theoretical implications for the role of social control in enforcing societal and journalistic norms in online news comment sections, as well as practical implications for professional comment moderators, are discussed.",Understanding Journalism From a Community Perspective,Journalism Studies
2018-0030,2018,Paper Session,Picture Power? The Contribution of News Visuals to Politically Motivated Selective Exposure,3,"Today’s fragmented and high-choice media environment allows citizens to select news congenial to their political preferences. So far, however, selective exposure research has exclusively studied news selection based on textual cues, ignoring the recent proliferation of visual news media. This study aimed to identify the contribution of visuals alongside text in selective exposure to pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal and balanced content. Using two experiments (N = 1068) we created a social media-style timeline with news items comprising matching and non-matching images and headlines about the contested issues of immigration and gun control in the U.S. By comparing selection behaviour of participants with opposing prior attitudes on these topics, we pulled apart the contribution of images and headlines to selective exposure. Findings show that headlines play a far greater role in guiding selection, with the influence of images being minimal. The additional influence of balanced content and partisan source cues are also considered.",Selective Exposure and Its Influences,Political Communication
2018-0031,2018,Paper Session,Switching On and Off: Rethinking Partisan Selective Exposure,2,"Despite concern that selective exposure to congenial sources drives partisans to disagree about even purely factual matters, existing empirical research finds little to mixed evidence that most Americans seek out like-minded sources. In this paper, we suggest an alternative conceptualization of selective exposure; people choose when to pay attention to politics, instead of which ideological sources to follow, such that they avoid politics in the times when they anticipate unpleasant information. We argue that presidential performance shapes such expectations, which would, in turn, create divergent overtime ebbs and flows in the levels of political engagement across partisan groups. Drawing on two multi-wave survey datasets, we find partisans display a lower level of political interest and media consumption during a politically disappointing period. Our findings suggest that that the stream of information that Democrats receive in the long run can be different from Republicans, even if partisans follow mostly central news sources.",Selective Exposure and Its Influences,Political Communication
2018-0032,2018,Paper Session,To Seek or Not to Seek? An Assessment of Partisan Media Avoidance and its Correlates,4,"Scholars have noted the importance of examining active information avoidance of partisan media in addition to seeking out these sources of information. However, one weakness with this extant line of research is how scholars have assessed active avoidance. In particular, the research utilizing survey data has generally measured information avoidance by applying bi-polar scales that assess use or lack of use of partisan media. The issue is that this assessment of avoidance could conflate those individuals who actively avoid partisan media and those who do not use news content. In this paper, we assess whether our measures of active partisan avoidance are separate concepts from use of these same outlets. We also evaluate the validity of these measures. In general, our results show that measuring avoidance as a distinct concept could be a better assessment of this concept than simply considering use of these outlets.",Selective Exposure and Its Influences,Political Communication
2018-0033,2018,Paper Session,"What Predicts Selective Exposure: Testing Attitudes, Credibility and Social Identity",1,"This paper offers a critical test of three factors predicting selective exposure to news articles about sociopolitical issues. Two original selection studies on systematic samples of adult Americans examined whether prior attitudes, source credibility, and/or individual social identity drive the selection of political content. Both studies offered articles that were (1) pro- or counter-attitudinal with regard to individual prior attitudes on two political issues, and from (2) high versus low credibility sources conceptualized in two different ways, and (3) featuring participants’ social ingroup or outgroup, based on two different social groups. Unobtrusively logged behavioral selection data suggest that prior attitudes, and their strength and importance in Study 1, more strongly predict pro-attitudinal exposure than both source credibility and social identity.",Selective Exposure and Its Influences,Political Communication
2018-0034,2018,Paper Session,Exploring the Association Between Empathy and Congruent Selective Exposure,1,"The current investigation explores the association between empathy and selective exposure. It is argued that people anticipate that if they read or see messages that do not accord with their ideology, they will be exposed to depictions of suffering of the other political side. Those who tend to be empathetic will expect to feel dissonance as a result. Given the fact that people try to avoid dissonance, it is hypothesized that more empathetic audiences will be more likely to expose themselves to congruent news sources. This hypothesis is tested in two studies (Study 1, N= 213; Study 2, N = 787), both utilized two measures of exposure and two measures of empathy. The results provide partial support for the hypothesis.",Selective Exposure and Its Influences,Political Communication
2018-0035,2018,Paper Session,A Matter for the Boss? How Personalized Communication Affects Recipients’ Perceptions of a Company During Corporate Crises,3,"A crisis can pose a serious threat to a company’s reputation. When choosing an adequate crisis communication strategy, organizations must also decide who should communicate with the public. Although many organizations put high-level executives such as the CEO up front, few studies have analyzed the effects of personalized communication in times of crisis. The present study therefore investigates the effects of personalized crisis communication statements using the example of an ineffective vaccine, while varying the type of crisis and the level of personalization. Our findings show that personalized statements have a more favorable impact on an organization’s image than non-personalized statements. Furthermore, statements from the CEO are perceived as most appropriate, followed by those from the spokesperson and non-personalized statements.",Voices From Corporations and Stakeholders in Crisis Communication,Public Relations

In the context of the United Airlines crisis in 2017, the SOCC model investigated the relationships among stakeholders’ rational evaluation, negative emotions, trust and distrust towards the organization, and their crisis response strategies. Results from an online survey (N = 579) identified six stakeholder crisis response strategies, including persuasion, information seeking, consulting, threat, mobilizing, and partnering strategy. Findings also demonstrated that rational evaluation was a more significant driver of stakeholders’ perceptions of trust and distrust, than negative emotions. Distrust has a bigger impact on stakeholder crisis response strategies than trust. These findings well demonstrated the important role of stakeholders in a corporate crisis. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Voices From Corporations and Stakeholders in Crisis Communication,Public Relations
2018-0037,2018,Paper Session,Through the Lens of Ethnicity and Nationalism: A Semantic Network Analysis of United Airlines’ Dragging Crisis,3,"On April 9, 2017, a passenger was forcibly dragged off a flight of United Airlines. The news has received extensive attentions from a specific ethnic group of public, Asians, more specifically Chinese, as the passenger claimed that he was purposively selected for being Chinese (Chang, 2017). The research applied the method of semantic network analysis and examined how the English language users and the Chinese language users discussed the United Airlines’ dragging crisis regarding ethnicity and nationalism. The results showed that compared to the English language users, the Chinese language users focused on the topics of ethnicity (e.g., Asian, racial discrimination, China, and ethnic Chinese) and the topics of nationalism (e.g., party-state and nationalism), which revealed the ethnicity identity of the Asian group. The research provides both theoretical and practical implications for crises involving in the issue of ethnicity.",Voices From Corporations and Stakeholders in Crisis Communication,Public Relations

Although crisis communication theory and models emphasize assisting and communicating with victims, little research on engaging and connecting with them during a crisis exists. The proposed framework includes two initial steps—mapping the crisis context and identifying crisis victims—followed by specific recommendations for individual, group, and community crisis intervention, respectively. These recommendations integrate theory, practice, and principles developed in the crisis intervention field, where a crisis is understood as a personal response to a critical incident. By voicing their experiences and processing associated thoughts and feelings, victims are able to re-establish equilibrium and eventually gain closure. The paper addresses the importance of understanding primary, secondary, and tertiary victims; discusses opportunities for organizations’ voices to be heard along with victims’; and provides directions for further research.",Voices From Corporations and Stakeholders in Crisis Communication,Public Relations

The arrest of several hundred Chinese weiquan lawyers has been widely reported since 2015. Here, I propose a critical discussion of the figure of the weiquan lawyers as both the symbol of popular struggles in China today, and interestingly, also as members of the legally educated class groomed by the state as a constitutive part of its post-Mao modern legal reform. In offering a reading of the dynamic meanings of weiquan as an emerging discursive and political construct, I hope to provide a necessary basis for a critical engagement with a highly particularistic and expansive human rights polity under a framework of “Chinese exceptionalism.”",International Communication and Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The new version of this approach is applied to the field of communication to explain the effect of institutional structural variables on the communication process. Based on those variables a set of recommendations and guidelines is offered to address the structural problems in communication. The new model can be used in such areas as international communication, corporate and organizational communication, public relations (employee relations, community relations, etc.) in such situations as mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, labor negotiations, and for other types of business decision-making processes.

Yet, while this systemic approach is important, it offers it offers only a partial insight into diversity of global media landscapes and, more generally, into the social implications of mass communication. To gain a fuller grasp of these implications, we need to start from the premise that socially significant communication extends well beyond the traditional domains of politics, and encompasses the mediation of basic cultural ideals and narratives, as well as the structuring of everyday practices and routines. To investigate these dimensions, this paper develops a conceptual and analytical framework that conceives of media cultures as patterns of ideas and practices that enable mass mediated meaning formation, and that have distinct spatial and temporal characteristics.",International Communication and Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2018-0042,2018,Paper Session,The Ethics Issue in International Communication: A Critical Theoretical Examination of an Enduring Philosophical Debate,1,This paper makes an attempt at conceptualizing and contemplating the role of ethics in the contemporary fields of communication and media. Especially the problem becomes acute when we try to act at the international level. This is where the so called “clash of civilizations” occurs. The main problem that underlies ethical issues in international communication is that the very notion of ethics is closely related to the concept of culture. And the interrelationship between cultures is an emotional and complex problem. This paper closely examines the arguments of both – the universalists and the internationalists – in this long-standing debate and offers new approaches to the whole issue. One of them is called Robust Relativism (by Joseph Margolis) while the other one (by Sablina and Struminskaya) suggests that the ethical codes that communicators use to regulate their communication procedures are not given by any culture but created by communicators in the process.,International Communication and Media Theory,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Under the theoretical framework of social identity theory, this study predicted inclusive advertisements could create a perceptual social categorization that includes both homosexual and heterosexual identities and reduces inter-group competitions between homosexual and heterosexual viewers. Results from an experiment indicated inclusive advertisements elicited better ad evaluation than strictly homosexual-themed advertisements when evaluated by a mix of homosexual and heterosexual participants.

2018-0044,2018,Paper Session,Advertising as a Signal of Brand Popularity: The Mediating Role of Perceived Brand Popularity in Advertising Effectiveness,1,"Considerable research has explored the influence of advertising, focusing on changes in consumers’ own attitudes and behavioral intentions toward the brand. However, little is known about whether advertising can impact consumers’ perceptions of how other people like the brand, or perceptions of brand popularity, and, if so, how that may influence the effects of advertising. Drawing from social influence theory, this study examines whether the effects of advertising are mediated by the extent to which consumers think the product/brand is popular among others. Using national survey data of American adults, this study demonstrates that when advertising induces the perception of brand popularity, this perception enhances consumers’ behavioral intentions by positively influencing their attitudes toward the brand. Additional analyses indicated that advertising’s influence is farther reaching than previously assumed. The implications of these findings are discussed regarding the critical role of perceptions of others’ attitudes in advertising effectiveness and the importance of measurement in examining the whole effects of advertising.",Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Mass Communication

Findings indicate that food ads within the sample of magazines promote thinness, decorative roles and passivity for women, objectify both men’s and women’s bodies, and under-represent women of color in advertising content. Women are most often represented within health-oriented magazines and bodies are most often referenced in ads for supplement products.

By using unique tactics to embed unidentified messages, they exploit open and closed Facebook groups under the disguise of organic users. This study evaluates the entrance of small domestic tourism business owners into Israeli Facebook groups, analyzing their consumer engagement tactics by using two research methods: case study and virtual ethnography (Netnography). Key findings indicate that virtual characteristics on Facebook groups (e.g., a sense of community, belonging, and trust) mimic the real world. Another notable phenomenon is the undisclosed marketing toolkit employed to transmit messages. It includes tactics such as separation of private and business profiles, exploitation of family relations, and repeat recommendations.",Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Mass Communication

considered within jurisdictions of media outlets, such as distribution, advertising, or editorial judgment. This essay proposes the concept of sociomateriality, rooted in organization studies and science and technology studies, to dissect human and material agency on platforms. By suggesting disentangling the interplay of human and algorithmic, we illuminate one seminal similarity between media outlets and platforms: editorial judgment. Critiques of platforms which center around the dimension of bias or partisanship point to the importance of editorial judgment. Criticism of human, as well as of algorithmic bias then leads to the assumption that platforms’ roles in online news environments increasingly matter to the public, and that people approach platforms with criteria commensurable to those that would be applied to media outlets. Via the proxy of editorial judgment, platforms are increasingly being conceptualized and understood as media outlets.",Editorial Judgment in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

Analysing data from a survey of online news audiences in 26 countries (N=53,314), we reveal the extent to which audiences believe story selection by editors and by algorithms are good ways to get news and, using a multi-level model, explore the correlations that exist between individual’s characteristics and their beliefs. Although the top-line results make discouraging reading for editors and journalists, our findings should also encourage publishers to challenge audiences’ belief in the neutrality of algorithmically-driven platforms and aggregators, to stand apart in their commitment to readers’ privacy, and to emphasize the value of their curated content and the communities of readers they cultivate.",Editorial Judgment in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

This paper aims to understand what the role of the engagement editor is and to what extent does audience advocacy figure in the editorial choices. This paper draws from a set of 15 in-depth interviews with various engagement editors, social media editors and analytics specialists from different media systems around the world. Two major findings emerge: First, the definition of engagement is almost entirely centered on different types of metrics. Second, while the engagement editor takes part in the editorial process, its role is to help journalists negotiate between the information obtained by their metrics and their journalistic intuition to make editorial decisions. The paper contributes to a growing literature that concerns itself with the pervasiveness of metrics and quantification of journalistic processes, by offering a more nuanced understanding of a new journalistic role.",Editorial Judgment in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

This study tries to demythify this claim by scrutinizing the autonomy China correspondents enjoy in organizational context, i.e. the organizational constraints from bureaucratic and editorial control in the news organizations correspondents work for. Newsroom socialization, resource allocation, and reporter-editor covenant are identified as main means for organizational control in most news organizations, especially with the increasing complexity of media conglomerates.

Influences of Hostile News Commentary on Journalists’ Editorial Decisions,2,"Many journalists experience hostile audience reactions to their work. Existing research indicates that journalists suffer from this and might self-censor their editorial works to avoid audience hostility. Yet some findings also suggest that journalists might find pleasure in hostile audience reactions because they can increase click rates and thus promote their careers. Based on a survey of German print journalists who experienced publicly visible hostile audience reactions (n = 323), we investigated how their experiences of past audience hostility influence the ways they cope with anticipations of audience hostility during their editorial work. Results show that some journalists suffered from past incidents of audience hostility with negative emotions. The more this was the case the more they comply with anticipated audience hostility during their editorial work. Some journalists also took pleasure in past experiences of audience hostility. The more this was the case the more they defy anticipated audience hostility.",Editorial Judgment in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

Guided by exemplification theory and risk communication research, a virtual exemplar was developed to allow users to feel the weight of the caloric density of unhealthy snacks (e.g., potato chips) to heighten the risk perception on snack choices. A 3 (base-rate statistics, print exemplar, virtual exemplar) × 3 (Time 1, Time 2, Time 3) mixed design experiment (N = 152) compared the effect of three modes of delivering health information on risk perception at baseline, immediately after, and one week after treatments. Virtual exemplars led to higher presence, issue involvement, and health behavior than base-rate statistics or print exemplars, but had no effect on perceived vividness. Heightened perceived susceptibility following virtual exemplars persisted for one week. Virtual exemplars may serve as a powerfully engaging health promotion tool in the ongoing battle against obesity.","Feeling(s) and Presence in New Environments: Smarthome Devices, Avatars, and Augmented/Virtual Reality",Communication and Technology

We examined sense of responsibility during robot avatar embodiment. In particular, we analyzed what happens when a robot avatar spontaneously verbally abuses someone during a conversation using the participant’s voice, without this being the intention of the participant. We found that participants in an experimental condition in which the robot included offensive words during a conversation with a confederate experienced more guilt and shame and apologized more for the bad actions of the robot than when the words were neutral. The illusion of ownership over the robot body movements did not significantly increase guilt and apologies. The results suggest that people feel responsible for the actions of their robot avatars even if they are not the real agents of these actions. The work highlights the importance of examining the moral and legal aspects related to embodiment technologies.","Feeling(s) and Presence in New Environments: Smarthome Devices, Avatars, and Augmented/Virtual Reality",Communication and Technology

One technique for reaching consumers has been to deploy advertisements resembling posts one’s friends might make. These advertorials use of the conventions of Instagram, and are likely to be unrecognized as sponsored messages at first. A within-subjects experiment (N = 482) tested these advertorials against both user-generated posts and traditional advertisements. Posts were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three well-known brands, and disguised with distractor posts. Results indicated that all three message types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and purchase intention. However, social posts were more credible and produced more social comparison than advertorials, which produced more credibility and social comparison than advertisements. This yielded mediating effects on the DVs of interest, despite the lack of total effects.

The Effect of Self-Monitoring, Perceived Attractiveness and Gender Difference on Advertising Responses",1,"Considering the growing popularity of online video advertising, this research investigates whether individuals’ self-monitoring levels influence the effectiveness of online video ads, especially in the presence of a physically attractive endorser, and how gender moderates the results. The findings of Study 1 suggest that high self-monitors are more likely to exhibit positive attitudes and sharing intention toward online video ads with an attractive endorser than ads with a less attractive endorser. In contrast, low self-monitors do not differ in their advertising responses. In addition, the moderating effect of gender is only significant on high self-monitoring females’ attitude toward the ad. Study 2 further examines how provocative advertising content (e.g., nudity and sexuality) may limit the effects observed in Study 1. The findings reveal that high self-monitoring males are hostile toward the ads featured endorsers with sexual images. They are reluctant to share the ads with others. For women, including provocative content in online video ads are likely to decrease advertising effectiveness, regardless of their levels of self-monitoring.

This study explores, through an experiment, the influence of parasocial interaction (PSI), brand credibility and product involvement on celebrity endorsement within the context of social media. The findings show that brand credibility has a positive effect on fans’ attitudes toward advertising and products and that its influence is moderated by product involvement. PSI is found to have salient positive effects on fans' attitudes and behavioral intentions, regardless of high/low brand credibility and product involvement. This study also provides empirical evidence for the causality relationships of attitudes and microblogging behavioral intentions including that attitudes toward advertising have a positive effect on retweet intention (RI), and that attitudes toward the product have a positive effect on purchase intention (PI).",Online Influence: Paying Attention to Ads and Brands Online,Communication and Technology

While research has addressed influences on people´s memory, effects on enjoyment have not been analyzed in depth. In a 4-group between-subjects design 80 participants were instructed to recall emotional episodes with four different tasks: a) note the event for themselves, b) take a photo for themselves, c) take a photo and share it online with a few close friends and d) take a photo and share it online with many. Analyses demonstrate that taking photos leads to lower levels of eudaimonic emotions compared to not photographing. Also, negative emotions are more pronounced when sharing with many instead of a few friends.

This study measures the chronemic agency 635 participants assign to their communication media, and explores some of the attributes of chronemic agency. It demonstrates that high chronemic agency media such as texting and calling are checked more frequently, are more likely to be used for urgent communication, and messages that arrive via those media are more likely to lead to a quick response. The findings demonstrate the power of urgency in everyday digital communication, enrich our understanding of social entrainment in the digital age, enhance media choice theory, contribute to communication overload research, and have applied implications in areas where the strong ""pull"" of high chronemic agency media can have devastating effects, such as the case of distracted driving.",No Filter?: The Powerful Role of Media in Everyday Life,Communication and Technology
2018-0062,2018,Paper Session,The Effect of Smartphone Vigilance on Inhibition,1,"Because more and more young people are constantly presented with the opportunity to access information and connect to others via their smartphones, they report to be in a state of permanent alertness. In the current study, we define such a state as smartphone vigilance, an awareness that one can always get connected to others in combination with a permanent readiness to respond to incoming smartphone notifications. We hypothesized that constantly resisting the urge to interact with their phones draws on response inhibition, and hence interferes with students’ ability to inhibit prepotent responses in a concurrent task. To test this, we conducted a preregistered experiment, employing a Bayesian sequential sampling design, where we manipulated smartphone visibility and smartphone notifications during a stop-signal task that measures the ability to inhibit prepotent responses. The task was constructed such that we could disentangle response inhibition from action selection. Results show that the mere visibility of a smartphone is sufficient to experience vigilance and distraction, and that this is enhanced when students receive notifications. Curiously enough, these strong experiences were unrelated to stop-signal task performance. These findings raise new questions about when and how the smartphones can impact performance.",No Filter?: The Powerful Role of Media in Everyday Life,Communication and Technology

This paper introduces the Extended Mind Questionnaire (XMQ), a new instrument for measuring the degree to which digital technology is becoming an extension of our cognitive and social selves. In study 1 (N=63), twelve questionnaire items were selected to form a highly reliable scale. study 2 (N=947) demonstrates the validity of the XMQ. We establish that XMQ is conceptually different from screen time, a measure currently used in digital media research, by showing that (a) XMQ scores and screen time are positively but weakly correlated, (b) XMQ scores and screen time differentially predict cognitive and behavioral effects (e.g., academic performance and problematic Internet use), and (c) relationships between XMQ and these variables are theoretically plausible.",No Filter?: The Powerful Role of Media in Everyday Life,Communication and Technology

One that tends to ignore important social dynamics that surround the emergence and consolidation of this notion as a universal and core value among prevalent news cultures. This piece intends to offer an alternative interpretation, one that argues how worker’s struggles during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly those that took place in the aftermath of the Civil War in the United States and of the Soviet Revolution of 1917, played a key role in shaping and defining journalistic objectivity as way of subduing the role of the media in relation to political mobilization. This thesis presented here aims at challenging current assumptions around journalism objectivity that argue that these debates happen only in the West -or the United States for that matter- and that later went to shape the values and cultures of journalism around the world. Instead, this piece suggests that there were dynamics and fluid conversations that flow in several directions across the globe.","Mediating Identities: Race, Class, and Gender",Communication History

Particularly, it analyzes the key role local and university-based media played in promoting eugenics as a form of science in Columbia, Missouri, an academic space that cultivated science-based discourse that elevated eugenics to a national and global phenomenon. By analyzing the University of Missouri Journalism School’s newspaper and the city’s news publication, the authors discuss how media discourse of science and eugenics focused on three themes: 1) bridging agricultural science with larger cultural ideals of breeding; 2) promotions of the superior and “normed” body; and 3) elevating ideas of morality and respectability using eugenics-inspired “science.” Feminist scholars have discussed how the body, science and culture determine a person’s social value and humanity. The social value of “fit” bodies played a key component of news coverage, thus helping elevate eugenics as a legitimate form of science.","Mediating Identities: Race, Class, and Gender",Communication History

When Moral Violations Lead to Unfriending Behavior on Social Media,3,"People’s unfriending behavior on social networking sites (SNS) is becoming increasingly relevant because the dissolution of digital connections has consequences not only on an interpersonal but also on a political level. If users tend to unfriend people when encountering political disagreements, there is a risk that their networks becomes ideologically homogenous, which – in the long run – could lead to the formation of echo chambers. To address the complexity of political disagreements and its interpersonal consequences, the present study argues that – in many cases – political disagreements are rooted in moral disagreements, manifesting themselves in (subjectively perceived) discrepancies of the fundamental moral domains. A survey study (N = 721) offers preliminary findings on how violations in different moral domains lead SNS users to judge and unfriend someone from their online network.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0070,2018,Paper Session,Invasive or Persuasive?: How Frequency of Brand Mentioning in Native Ads Influences Brand Attitudes,3,"Native Advertising is widely regarded as effective competitor to ad avoidance strategies in online marketing contexts, such as banner-blindness or ad-blocker usage; yet, there are ethical objections considering to some extent questionable disclosure practices, which may lead to consumer deception. The present research demonstrates the crucial role of persuasion knowledge and reactance in the developing process of brand attitudes, thus offering both theoretical and practical implications for further handling of native advertising practices. It appears that a shift of attitudes due to a variation of message type or brand presence depends on the activation of persuasion knowledge – and consecutively a sense of reactance. The most surprising finding is that making participants aware of the message source (i.e. by disclosing an article as sponsored and even giving an additional notice about the message type) does not automatically lead to negative brand evaluations. Further evidence on implicit attitudes, as well as possible explanations for difficulties concerning model formation are to be discussed at the conference.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems

A persuasive message was designed to stimulate a goal congruent perception. The results show that in the goal congruence domain, BAS was more potent in persuading people. The persuasion process analysis through structural equation modeling indicates that, consistent with previous research, gain framing was more effective.

The APCO macro model introduced by Smith et al (2011) is applied, and the identified antecedents to
privacy concerns in preceding studies are; trust beliefs, previous privacy invasion, perceived privacy
control and privacy risks. This paper considers perceived regulatory protection as well. The research
model accounts for the effect of contextual domains (finance, health, and e-commerce) on the antecedents
to privacy concerns. Participants were recruited from the Netherlands and the United States to enhance
the generalizability of results. In comparison to the e-commerce domain, the finance domain influences
trust beliefs negatively. The health domain positively affects the perceived regulatory protection

More research is needed, though, that examines individual differences and whether these influences of negative and uncivil comments are unique to specific types of readers. This study will use news media literacy to consider whether certain readers are more adept at differentiating commenter and journalistic content. This experiment will test how uncivil comments and the individual’s news media literacy level affect the perceived credibility of the news story and how both variables affect the difference between perceived news story credibility and comment credibility (source credibility effects).

2018-0076,2018,Paper Session,News Literacy Lessons for Children at Elementary School Level,1,"By age nine, most children distinguish fact from fiction; they are moving on from the “developing skepticism” stage (Potter, 2011). At that time, children are more aware about program’s intentions and they want to learn how programs are made (Buckingham, 2003). However, most of the scholarly literature about news literacy has aimed a teenage and college student population. Less is known about what is adequate to teach about the news to young children, and how can we do it. In this paper, we propose to fill that gap, following three methodological approaches. First, we seek the lessons taught at schools, by reviewing the literature; second, we analyze the lessons offered in children’s books; and third, we examine the lessons in digital platforms. Our paper contributes to advance the knowledge about media literacy by proposing a new taxonomy of the news literacy lessons for children between seven and nine years old.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media

Parents may be important for promoting children’s learning from touchscreens, as parents can help children learn from other media (e.g., Lauricella, Barr, & Calvert, 2014). The on-going work in this research escalator examines 1) how parents’ and their 4.5- to 5-year-olds’ use of an app that utilizes coding blocks compares to their traditional block play, and 2) whether the quality of their interactions affects children’s learning of coding. Parent-child dyads play with magnetic-tiles for 10 minutes and then use the coding app for 10 minutes. Conversations are being coded for spatial language, question-asking, and task-relevancy, and children’s learning of coding is measured. We are seeking input on other parent-child interactions to measure. We hope to shed light on the challenges and strengths of parent-child co-using touchscreens for learning.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0078,2018,Paper Session,Bigger Than Hip-Hop”: The Socio-Emotional Effect of Recording-Based Music Education on Black Youth,1,"Hip Hop Based Education , the usage of hip-hop practices and pedagogy in urban classrooms, has been argued to be very beneficial to understanding how to improve the academic performance of Black youth in low income environments. However, scholars have failed to explore the pro-social benefits to these programs. As a case study, this qualitative investigation considers the program outcomes of Foundations of Music Songwriting and Music Production program. Through the personal narratives of teaching artists and participants in the program, I argue that the unique classroom environment provided by this program leveraged urban youth’s “Hip-Hop identities” and situated learning activities to invoke essential self-reflection about their personal lives, their culture, peers and community. These findings indicates creating digitally produced music in the classroom is as much a means of promoting digital literacy and music skills as it is a socio-emotional intervention for Black youth.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media

Since social media plays mainly for adolescents an important part, they are highly exposed to fake news. To encounter these challenges, media literacy features as a vital concept. Yet, one skill is needed to prevent fake news from spreading: the skill to detect false news, and to differ between good and bad sources. This concept is described as information literacy, which originates from Library Sciences. In contrast to media literacy, it offers a clear definition focusing on how people search for information. In this presentation, information literacy will be linked with adolescents’ usage of social media. The research question is thus defined as follows: Which relevance does information literacy have in helping adolescents understand and detect false news in social media?","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0080,2018,Paper Session,Parent Attitudes Towards Coding and Programming in Early Childhood,1,"The United States consistently falls behind its global peers in the number of people entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers (PISA, 2015). For this reason, there has been an increased emphasis on STEM curriculum in early education settings (see U.S. Department of Education, 2016 for more information). Computer science, in particular, has been a top priority for STEM education as many believe today’s students will need to be fluent in programming languages in order to be successful in this technologically advanced world (Bers, 2017; O'Dell, 2013; Prensky, 2008). Scholars propose that one way to teach foundational coding and programming concepts is through the use of digital games and applications (apps) as well as tangible robotics (e.g. Bers, 2010; Fessakis, Gouli, & Mavroudi, 2012; Flannery et al., 2013). While these coding games present an exciting way to boost interest and participation in the STEM pipeline, very little is known about how often children actually play these games. Additionally, there is a lack of current research on what parent and child factors might contribute to frequency of coding game play. This research stands to add to the literature on preschoolers use of serious games designed to teach complex concepts via interactive technologies and how parents may be implicated in such play.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media

A survey by Common Sense Media (2017) revealed that most (98%) children in the United States live in a home with a mobile device. A common feature in these devices, also present in computers and home speakers, is the ability to respond to spoken words. The present study seeks to understand children’s conceptions of voice interfaces and the role they play in children’s information-seeking practices. As they become familiar with the conversational features available on these technologies, do children attempt to ask them questions? As the Internet becomes more accessible to children through voice interfaces, are children becoming more independent at seeking answers to their own questions? Understanding how children use conversational agents is important because it can guide future product development to support children’s learning, as well as media education efforts in schools and in homes.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media

2018-0085,2018,Paper Session,Smartphone Overuse as a New Form of Digital Inequality: A Mediation Analysis on High School Students,2,"In recent years, smartphones have become the most popular and ubiquitous tool for adolescents to access the Internet. On the one hand, smartphones diffusion has contributed to the closing of the so-called “digital divide”. However, the pervasiveness of this device even in the most socially and physiologically relevant moments of the day, such as family dinner or sleeping hours, has raised some concerns about the confinement and addressing capabilities of this tool. An extensive literature exists on smartphone overconsumption, which has highlighted the negative consequences of an excessive use of this tool especially among adolescents. It is therefore possible that a new form of social inequality between the so-called digital natives is attributable to their different ability to protect themselves from the risks of smartphone overuse. We test this hypothesis with unique data coming from a survey carried out by the authors in 2015 on the entire high-school population of Valle D’Aosta region (northern Italy). The survey involved more than 4,600 participants, collecting information about students’ smartphone use habits, socio-demographic characteristics, their final middle school grade and current school marks. By means of a mediation analysis, we show how the negative impact of smartphone overuse mediates the relationship between family educational background and school performances, so contributing to deepen the academic polarization between high and low performing students. We discuss the relevance of these results in relation to a new domain in digital inequality research, which is not anymore linked to the scarcity of access opportunities but to the management of their overabundance. From a policy perspective, these results highlight the relevance of education interventions focused on a proper use of smartphones in daily life, both for school learning improvement and for reducing social inequality.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0086,2018,Paper Session,Disclosing Product Placements to Children: How Do EU Countries Apply Product Placements Disclosures in Audiovisual Media Targeted at Children?,1,"An increasing number of commercial content is communicated through non-traditional embedded advertising formats, so called product placements (van Reijmersdal, Neijens, & Smit, 2009). And even though EU’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD, 2010) prohibits product placements in specifically rated children programs, children are still exposed to non-regulated foreign media productions. Additionally, children do not only watch content specifically targeted at them, but also consume mainstream media content (Speers, Harris, & Schwartz, 2011).
There is empirical evidence that even adults have problems to recognize, and critically reflect the intention of embedded persuasive messages (e.g., Matthes, Schemer, & Wirth, 2007). In this light, children are especially vulnerable based on their cognitive abilities and advanced advertising knowledge (Buijzen, van Reijmersdal, & Owen, 2010; John, 1999). Confronting children with persuasive messages which they are not able to reflect critically has continuously been connected to several negative outcomes for their wellbeing such as unhealthy eating behavior (e.g., Matthes & Naderer, 2015). I thus argue there is a strong need to disclose product placements to children (Hudders, et al., 2017). However, it is assumed that the currently used disclosures are not suitable to adequately inform children about the intent of product placements (Hudders et al., 2017). EU’s AVMSD (2010) moreover does only provide a guideline for the application of placement disclosures, which leaves the actual implementation to the individual member states (Tessitore & Geuens, 2013).
A great part of research with adults indicates that disclosure characteristics are very important regarding how effectively they inform consumers about the persuasive intent (e.g., Boerman, van Reijmersdal, & Neijens, 2012, 2015). De Pauw and colleagues (2017) are the first to demonstrate the importance of disclosure implementation for children by showing that disclosure modality has an influence on whether advertising literacy gets activated. Yet, still no systematic investigation exists that summarizes the application of placement disclosures in audiovisual media regarding differences between EU countries. Because of this gap in research, I pose the following research question: How can existing placements disclosures in EU countries be classified?
As one part of my dissertation project, a qualitative content analysis of placement disclosures in audiovisual media of all EU countries will be conducted. Object of investigation are the application forms of disclosures in programs of the dual broadcasting systems of all EU countries, i.e., from each EU country, one program from both public-service and private broadcasting systems are examined. Analysis unit represents entertainment programs targeted at children. In order to make a temporal selection, I consider transnational differences with respect to the highest time of children’s television consumption. For instance, Austrian children use the television intensively on weekend afternoon (ORF media research, 2016). I first examine the program on its suitability for children and its clear content of product placements (Naderer, Matthes, & Spielvogel, accepted). Then I investigate the disclosure for each country and program. The exact categories are determined after the inspection of the material. The sample also includes video-on-demand providers (i.e., Netflix), since a proposal for a revision of the EU’s AVMSD is already published (European Commission, 2016).
This qualitative content analysis allows statements about visual preparation (e.g., size within the screen, color, font), informational extent, and modality (e.g., dual-modality cue) of applied disclosures (Tessitore & Geuens, 2013). Therefore, this study assesses how placement disclosures in audiovisual media targeted at children can be classified. This is an important basis for effect studies to create effective disclosures for children.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media

2018-0088,2018,Paper Session,Word Categorization: An Indirect Measure of Advertising Literacy Activation?,1,"To help children become more resilient to advertising, many scholars and policy makers argue that children’s advertising literacy (knowledge of and critical attitudes toward advertising) needs to be increased. However, it remains unclear if children are able to activate their advertising literacy when they are confronted with advertising, because there is no measurement tool available to assess this ability. The aim of this study was to develop such a measurement tool. We conducted two experiments with a 2x3 (activation material: advertising vs news/words: advertising vs news vs attitudinal) repeated measures design. In order to assess children’s advertising literacy activation, we developed a word categorization task. Based on information processing theory and schema theories we had several expectations, which were only partly supported. This suggests that this task may be suitable to assess the activation of attitudinal advertising literacy, but not the activation of conceptual advertising literacy.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Research Escalator Session",Children Adolescents and the Media

Mobile technologies offer a contradictory space which on one hand, bring together the work and family in a continual interplay, and on the other hand, bring about tensions in the performance of the roles of work and family. Working mothers negotiate the space itself through an everyday sense making process, where the mobile phone technology not only is the medium, but also is the artifact of identity negotiation. These identities are influenced by and negotiated across space-time flows. Mobile phone technology not only serves as the medium though which the identities are organized but also as the material resource, which when appropriated or marginalized, produces desired identities/practices for the working mothers.

The official goal of this media practice is to “spread China’s voices” and to “tell China’s stories”. As China’s media outlets surge on a global platform that Chinese citizens are banned from accessing, how might this case reshape our understanding of public diplomacy and global communication? Using automated content analysis, this study examines 254,014 news posts circulated by seven China’s state-led media on Facebook. The results indicate that: 1) these official media build different international agendas for China and other nations; 2) while China-related stories contain more positive sentiment, others’ news coverage has significantly less positive sentiment, and 3) China’s stories are more likely to receive audience attentiveness on Facebook.

Second, differences in digital savviness between digital immigrants and natives may also hinder an MFA’s ability to practice dialogic digital diplomacy. Third, such differences between natives and immigrants may have practical implications for the process of training diplomats to best utilize digital platforms in the practice of public diplomacy.

2018-0097,2018,Paper Session,Public Diplomacy's Digital Turn,1,"After 9/11 U.S. public diplomacy shifted from post-cold war, uni-directional messaging to leveraging technologies for two-way interaction. This shift was facilitated by other trends like globalization, rapid advancements in digital technology, increased access to and use of the Internet. Contemporaneously there emerged transnational challenges like climate change, cyber- terrorism, and health pandemics. These macro drivers blurred the lines between global actors, domestic and foreign audiences, and how digital information was produced and consumed.
Public diplomacy at the time also utilized the public relations frameworks to build relationships with stakeholders to meet organizational goals. The period also witnessed the strategic use of digital platforms like embassy websites, Facebook, and Twitter to reach audiences directly, bypassing the gatekeeping role of traditional media, and gave birth to the term digital diplomacy.

Social media platforms offer governmental and other response agencies a new alternative to communicate not only with the public, but internally. While all cultures are inherently diverse, few recent terrorist attack displayed more cultural and governmental diversity than Belgium’s capital of Brussels, playing host to a dichotomous national personality, along with four unique levels of government oversight.

2018-0100,2018,Paper Session,Does the Internet Help Health Campaigns? A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Internet Supplemented Health Campaigns on Behavior Change in the United States,2,"This meta-analysis examines the overall effectiveness of Internet supplemented health campaigns on behavior change in the United States. Results show that Internet supplemented health campaigns have significant but relatively small effects (d = 0.23) on behavior change. Moreover, further meta-regression analysis shows that campaign effect size was moderated by campaign topic, presence of audience segmentation, target behavior, behavior type, presence of theoretical foundation, and delivery channel. Aligns with the findings of previous meta-analyses, theory-grounded health campaigns were more effective (d = 0.30) than campaigns with no theoretical foundation (d = 0.16). Campaigns targeting adoption of new behaviors (d = 0.26) were more effective than those targeting cessation of undesirable behaviors (d = 0.10), while campaigns targeting addictive behaviors (d = 0.13) were less effective than those targeting non-addictive ones (d = 0.27). More importantly, the results of the meta-regression analysis shows supplementing the Internet as a delivery channel improves health campaign effectiveness. The results show empirical evidences that Internet can be an effective and cost-effective tool for health communication campaigns, and should be considered as an important supplement for campaigns in the digital era.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication
2018-0101,2018,Paper Session,Cultivating Campaign Outcomes Through a Cooperative Media Environment: Increasing Issue Salience to Improve Perceptions of Campaigns to Prevent Sexual Violence,2,"A two-part study was used to test the Societal Risk Reduction Model prediction that the broader media environment increases the effectiveness of mass-media campaigns through mobilizing audiences to address a salient problem. Study one (N = 333) provides cross-sectional evidence that the issue salience of sexual violence mediates the ability of a popular television program (Law and Order Special Victims Unit) to reduce rape myth acceptance (i.e. denial of sexual violence). Part two (N = 89) then manipulates the salience of sexual violence through exposure to SVU or a control episode. We then tested a serial mediation model revealing that exposure to SVU increased the salience of sexual violence, leading to more systematic processing of a subsequent rape prevention campaign, and greater perceived effectiveness of the campaign message. Implications for the media environment’s role in increasing the issue salience of campaign topics to increase message effectiveness are discussed.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication

Exogenous measures of exposure, assessed independently of outcomes, support stronger causal inferences. In this study, we examined the relationship between Target Rating Points (TRPs) for specific ads available over four-week periods and anti-smoking beliefs in a national sample of adolescent nonsmokers/experimenters (n=4,780). Results demonstrate positive relationships between TRPs for ads targeting two of four belief categories tested (Control and Chemical; p<.05) and targeted-belief endorsement. Furthermore, two-sided sign tests indicate that TRP/targeted-belief associations for Control- and Chemical-targeted ads are stronger than TRP/non-targeted belief associations for all comparisons (p=.004). Findings support a claim of campaign effects while reducing concerns about reverse causal direction and the influence of unmeasured confounders.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication

This within-subjects experiment, examines reactions to the campaign among a key secondary audience of young adult (ages 18-29) smokers (n=225) and susceptible non-smokers (n=339). Participants viewed three The Real Cost campaign television ads and reported their past exposure to, conversations about, and reactions to the ads. We examined message-level and person-level predictors of perceived message effectiveness (PME) using multilevel modeling. Susceptible non-smokers rated the ads higher on PME than smokers (mean: 3.6 vs. 3.3 out of 5, p<.01), but lower on message relevance and negative affective reactions to the ads (both p<.05). In both samples, ads that elicited higher negative affective reactions and message relevance and lower message reactance (i.e., resistance) received higher PME ratings (all p<.05). This indicates that the campaign may have beneficial spillover effects on non-targeted audiences.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication

A follow-up study that assessed the impact of Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW), a communication theory-based workplace sun safety program, that promoted policy adoption and education in a randomized controlled trial, on employee sun safety behavior was conducted. Sixty-one of 98 public employers from the original study participated. Managers and line supervisors reported program implementation; 1784 outdoor workers (n=913 [intervention], n= 871 [control]) completed surveys on personal sun protection practices. Employees’ sun protection improved statistically significantly in the intervention group receiving the SSW program. SSW’s effect on employee sun protection was mediated by the number of workplace actions to implement elements of sun safety policy including sun protection messages and equipment in the workplace and employee reports of training in sun safety.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication

This study tests the efficacy of the Mother-Son Health Promotion Project at increasing mother-son communication about sexual risk reduction. African American mothers with their sons ages 10 to 15 years residing in public housing in Philadelphia, PA were randomized into a HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention an attention-matched health-promotion control intervention. Mothers and sons completed surveys pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months post-intervention. Of 525 mother-son dyads, 366 (69.7%) completed the 24-months post-intervention survey. Generalized-estimating-equations models revealed that over 24 months, mothers and sons in the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention were more likely to communicate about sexual health, including sexual intercourse, birth control, HIV/AIDS prevention, and condoms. Intervention efficacy was found to weaken over time. This theory-based intervention was efficacious in increasing mother-son communication about sexual risk reduction.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is a daily pill that can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 92%, but few women know about it. This study tests the effectiveness of the #LetsTalkAboutPrep campaign to promote PrEP awareness among Black women in D.C. HIV-negative Black women (N = 192) with high HIV risk, were surveyed about exposure to #LTAP, knowledge of PrEP and uptake behaviors. We hypothesized a dose-response in which exposure to more ads is associated with more engagement in PrEP uptake-related behaviors. Results of multivariate regression analyses show that with each additional campaign ad exposure, there is a B = 0.51 unit increase in the number of PrEP uptake-related behaviors, controlling for demographics (p<0.05). Exposure to the #LetsTalkAboutPrep campaign is associated with Black women’s increased engagement in PrEP uptake-related behaviors.",HIGH-DENSITY: Evaluating Communication Campaigns and Mechanisms of Effects,Health Communication

Based mainly on the theories of narrative transportation and limited cognitive capacity, two competing hypotheses were posited: the addition of open captions would impede (vs. promote) information acquisition. A two-group, between-subjects experimental design (no open captions vs. open captions) was used to test the hypotheses with 150 adult participants. The results showed that the open captions for medical terms facilitated retention of those terms without cognitive overload or interruption of transportation, presumably because the additional information was relevant to the content presented in the episode. Overall, the findings have important theoretical and practical implications for designing E-E content to improve health literacy among the public.",Media Effects on Health Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

Building on the concept of social capital, this study highlights the communicative dynamics undergirding such capital. It deploys Communication Infrastructure Theory to investigate if and how local communication resources work with mass media in influencing health, specifically outcomes related to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Data collected from 715 Latina mothers in Los Angeles revealed that local communication resources – operationalized as an individual’s connection with neighbors, communication organizations and local media – had a direct and positive effect on Latinas’ self-efficacy to vaccinate their child against HPV, whereas mass media influenced immunization knowledge. Mass media also mediated the relationship between local communication resources and knowledge. The implications of the distinct and combined effects of mass media and local communication resources for improving HPV vaccination coverage and advancing multilevel health communication theory are subsequently discussed.",Media Effects on Health Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

The current study examines temporal dynamics of real-world television viewing and wellbeing among a national sample of US adults aged 60 and over from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Disability and Use of Time Study. We examine whether lower levels of experienced wellbeing predict increased use of television, and whether this use leads to increases in wellbeing during and after watching. Results find no impact of mood on the decision to watch television, but an increase in the likelihood of a positive change in mood during and after television viewing. These changes in wellbeing over time as a function of real-world TV use clarify how media may be used (mal)adaptively in the daily lives of older adults in the US.",Media Effects on Health Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

This study examines the relationship between information exposure, information appraisals, information behaviors, and unconditional acceptance of health information. Results from a survey of 588 women in South Korean indicate that an individual’s appraisal of information as being appropriate or incoherent influences unconditional acceptance of health information. Both types of information appraisals are positively associated with information seeking, which is negatively associated with unconditional acceptance of information. In contrast, neither of these appraisals have an impact on unconditional acceptance via information sharing. Notably, when information appraisals are not considered, information exposure is positively associated with information sharing, which is then positively associated with unconditional acceptance. Implications for health information consumers and practitioners are discussed.",Media Effects on Health Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

A key factor in STI prevention is partner communication about STIs (Clearly, et al., 2002). Because entertainment narratives are shown to positively impact knowledge acquisition (Shen & Han, 2014) and behavior change (Papas, et al., 2008), the current study examined whether exposure to romance novel excerpt with successful STI communication modeled (versus an excerpt without) was associated with increased STI communication intentions. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior we also explored potential cognitive mechanisms of narrative exposure (i.e., self-efficacy, attitudes, normative beliefs) on behavioral intentions. Results of an experimental study with single, college aged females, who are engaged in casual sexual relations (N = 119), showed narrative exposure including behavioral modeling impacted STI communication via increased injunctive norms.",Media Effects on Health Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication
2018-0112,2018,Paper Session,The Shifting Meanings of Sexual Consent: Male College Students’ Interpretive Framing of Consent,4,"Rape and sexual assault are increasing on college campuses across the United States (U.S.), but little research has evaluated how sexual consent prior to these occurrences is communicated and understood by young adults. Conveying consent or nonconsent prior to sex is accomplished through communicative messages; however, there is limited research on how consent is interpreted. This study investigates the perceptions of consent articulated by college men through online focus groups. Results revealed that undergraduate males interpret consent messages in three primary ways: through communicating clarity, communicating confusion, and communicating distortion. The results indicate problems surrounding the communication of consent and nonconsent, particularly the expectations, assumptions, and confusion that college men perceive in their interactions with college women. Through these findings, it is clear that media messages, college educational programs, and the college sexual culture do not go far enough in resisting stereotypes and developing strategies for more well-rounded understandings of consent for college-aged young adults.",Difficult Topics in Health Communication,Health Communication

We examine the role of play as terminal children on a palliative care ward live out the remainder of their lives. We question the function that play has, if any, in mitigating the fear of death among dying children and their caregivers. We explore formal and informal manners of therapeutic play among children and adults occurring in moments of terrible stress, pain and the looming threat of extinction. We draw on playful representations of death from popular culture and from extended field research conducted on a Pediatric Palliative Care ward as patients, families and caretakers struggle to make sense of their suffering, fear and loss.",Difficult Topics in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-0114,2018,Paper Session,Exploring the Implications of a Genderized Vaccination,2,"Health communication in the United States is a mainly commercial enterprise, with many Americans learning about important health issues through paid pharmaceutical advertisements. The system encourages intense competition among pharmaceutical companies to bring drugs to market quickly with the most effective marketing communication plans. However, do successful paid media campaigns bring about effective health communication? What happens when pharmaceutical companies choose to target only women for the treatment of a sexually transmitted infection? This study examines one particular case in which a pharmaceutical company seemingly manufactured the reality of a relatively unknown health threat, as well as the recommended product solution. Specifically, we address the genderization of Merck Pharmaceuticals’ Gardasil vaccination and the human papillomavirus (HPV). Focus group feedback, combined with U.S. media reports, present preliminary indications that Merck's initial female-centric messaging strategy may have ultimately led to an ineffective prevention program.",Difficult Topics in Health Communication,Health Communication

An online survey and multiple regressions were conducted to test the hypotheses. The results revealed that more instrumental cyberbullying motives can be gratified by both the Internet’s anonymity and wider audience characteristics. Further, online Q&A platforms are strongly related to both anonymity and wider audience gratifications of the Internet, which indicated that more cyberbullies will be appealed to visit the Q&A platform, and may cause more cyberbullying. The results contribute to both cyberbullying research and U&G theory with problem behavior research. Practical applications of anti-cyberbullying campaigns via the Internet regulations are discussed.",Difficult Topics in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-0116,2018,Paper Session,"The Neoliberal Subject, Reality TV Audiences and Free Association: A Freudian Audience Study of Embarrassing Bodies",1,"This paper presents results from an audience study with viewers of the British reality show Embarrassing Bodies (Channel 4). A methodology based on the Freudian technique of free association was used to research viewers’ narratives about the programme. Many spoke about the show in terms that make use of internalised neoliberal discourses about the limits to entitlement to public healthcare as well as self-responsibility for staying healthy. Many also reflected on the treatment of the patients and expressed they were not being exploited for economic purposes. The narratives that reflected such discourses were of an ambiguous nature and the respondents produced contradicting views in the course of each interview. The data discussed may account for associative-discursive shifting in the respondents that is located at the intersection of consciousness and the unconscious. I theorise such shifting with Sigmund Freud’s concept of ‘negation’ whereby an idea is rejected by the subject in order to avoid further engagement with it. Rather than accusing the viewers of lying or having false consciousness, psychoanalysis as a mode of attention opens up nuanced ways of interpreting the data. As both a theoretical and methodological framework, Freudian psychoanalysis helps us to understand how individuals are (un)consciously positioned in contemporary austerity and crises discourses around healthcare. Given their ambiguous narratives, I conclude that the current economic climate in the UK, and its media representation, has resulted in subjectivities who struggle to makes sense of it as they simultaneously resist and embrace it.",Difficult Topics in Health Communication,Health Communication

Using the data from the World Values Survey, this paper carried out multilevel analyses with 48,546 respondents in 34 countries. The results illustrate three paradoxical impacts. First, the Internet penetration improves media trust, but generates more Internet users, impairing their trust in media. Second, the Internet penetration credits media in general but discredits media when they are actually used, while the Internet freedom discredits media in general but credits media when they are actually used. Third, the Internet penetration and the Internet freedom work against each other, revealing a negotiation process, in which informational distribution is neutralized by cultural distribution.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication

Research on new media’s impact on journalism crisis perceptions, however, tends to be set in the Anglo-American context that venerates liberal democracy; little is known about societies susceptible to Western liberal influence but continue to experience some form of authoritarian control. This study focuses on two Asian “global cities” in transition, Singapore and Hong Kong. Through a critical discourse analysis of responses from 160 journalists, this study identifies the need for a three-dimensional investigation – at the material, discursive, and ideological levels – to examine new media’s impact on journalism crisis perceptions in such hybrid societies. Results reveal stark contrasts in perceptions between these two cities, prompting alternative ways to understand state mediation of the press in the digital age.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication

It hypothesizes that, in a developing country where economic resources are scarce, media owners, advertisers, and public relations practitioners would like to have their voices heard in the news and therefore alter the objectivity and credibility of the journalists. The study used a quantitative method in the form of survey distributed to active journalists in the country. The findings indicate that advertisers and public relations practitioners’ pressures are more severe in private media compared to public media. It also appears that public and private television networks in Senegal are tightly controlled by media owners and managers who want to use them as their “sounding boards”. However, in public and private media, journalists perceive the pressures but they declare to be able to resist.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication
2018-0121,2018,Paper Session,An Entrance for the Uninterested: Watching Soft News and Participating in Politics,1,"As soft news programs present politics in an entertaining format, they are likely to attract and grab the attention of people who are not in general interested in politics. Consequently, soft news programs might mobilize these less-motivated citizens to engage in politics. In this study, I test this potential using a two-wave panel survey among sample of voters (N=2,680) in Denmark. The results show that people with lower political interest were indeed more likely to increase their use of soft news during the election campaign, and that these low-motivated people also increased their passive participation as a consequence of watching soft news. Further, the results show that this passive participation is likely to function as a stepping-stone to active participation. Thereby the study supports the idea of soft news as an alternative information source, where people with a low political interest can be mobilized as a by-product of being entertained.","Media Use, Interest and Participation",Political Communication
2018-0122,2018,Paper Session,Digital Political Talk and Political Participation: Comparing Established and Third Wave Democracies,2,"We investigate whether and how informal political talk on digital media contributes to citizens’ political participation with unique surveys based on samples representative of internet users in seven Western democracies. We show that political talk on both social networking sites and mobile instant messaging platforms is positively associated with institutional and extra-institutional participation in all seven countries. However, the relationship between talk on social networking sites and both types of participation is significantly stronger in established democracies (Denmark, France, United Kingdom, and United States) than in “third wave” democracies (Greece, Poland, and Spain). By contrast, the strength of the relationship between political talk on mobile instant messaging platforms and participation is not significantly different when comparing established and more recent democracies. These findings suggest that informal political talk on digital platforms can contribute to citizens’ participatory repertoires and that different institutional settings, in combination with different technological affordances, play an important role in shaping these patterns.","Media Use, Interest and Participation",Political Communication

We use survey data (N=583) and interviews with students from Norway and the UK to discuss how media system and levels of trust is of importance. The Norwegian students have much higher trust in their traditional media and in institutions. The high trust-Norwegians and the low-trust-British students’ relate to news media, and are political engaged in different ways. For the Norwegian students, the traditional news media offer relevant information as a source to ‘bridging capital’ and they appear to be closer to the DC-model, while the UK sample is skeptical of the news from traditional news media, but more politically engaged online and closer to the AC-model. We will argue that these models do not describe generational differences in citizenship, nor are they completely distinct typologies.","Media Use, Interest and Participation",Political Communication

Although a rich literature shows that members of the media can selectively report and frame the stories that they write, researchers typically assume that journalists do not affect the underlying process through which newsworthy content is actually generated. In contrast, we analyze situations in which members of the press directly influence the stories they report. This is particularly acute in the context of interviews with prominent politicians, where minor changes in question tone and content can dramatically alter public perception of the interview subject. Using an original dataset of more than 250,000 questions posed to American presidents, White House press secretaries, and other administration officials, we find evidence that reporters systematically change the tone of their questions based on the party affiliation and personal characteristics of the respondent.",Covering Politics: New Political Journalism Research,Political Communication
2018-0127,2018,Paper Session,New Rules for an Old Game: How the 2016 U.S. Election Caught the Press Off Guard,2,"In Western democracies news coverage is often homogeneous because of the working routines and news values that constitute a set of “rules” that are shared by journalists across the board. Also during the 2016 US presidential campaign, the news media followed this standard set of rules that had proved more or less successful in covering previous campaigns. Yet these rules, we argue, proved inadequate to the task of covering the 2016 campaign. Based on interviews with 24 journalists and political consultants involved in covering the 2016 campaign, we show that journalists felt ill prepared for the particular phenomenon that was the 2016 election. In short, they were caught off guard. Our conclusion is not that the old rules did not apply, but rather that the campaign context was so exceptional that it pushed some of these old rules to the extreme, leaving the press scrambling to adapt.",Covering Politics: New Political Journalism Research,Political Communication

We first show that this ``probabilistic horeserace'' is now an important part of the national conversation in the U.S., and appears more often on media outlets with liberal-leaning audiences. We then show that the public incorrectly interprets estimates of win probabilities and more generally has difficulty assessing the probability a candidate will win. When the favored candidate is ahead, win-probabilities convey the impression that the race is less competitive compared to vote share estimates. More importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game. The strength of these findings suggests that even in close races, probabilistic horserace coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.",Covering Politics: New Political Journalism Research,Political Communication
2018-0129,2018,Paper Session,Strategic News Coverage and its Effects on Political Cynicism: A Meta-Analysis,1,"The journalistic coverage of politics usually focuses on the competition between political actors, their strategies for gaining public support and their positions at the polls. The conventional wisdom is that this tendency – usually referred to as strategic, horse race or game coverage – has a negative impact on the electorate, specifically by increasing political cynicism among citizens. While many studies examined this question in varying countries and periods and while using different operationalizations, it remains unclear whether the effect holds across different contexts and under what conditions. The current study investigates these questions by conducting a meta-analysis on 24 effect sizes from 17 studies. Results show that strategic news coverage significantly increases political cynicism across studies and contexts. There was no evidence that this effect is moderated by system-level, media-level, context-level and measurement-level variables.

Media play a central role in that imagining process and this research extends Anderson’s conception to the analysis of the punditry sphere in Portugal. The study draws on data gathered from interviews with pundits, journalists, and news editors. Findings suggest that pundits and news media construct symbolic borders around the reflexive imagining of the political nation, one that presents a very clear dynamic of exclusionary practices. The circles of power are constructed as members of the political nation, whereas the general public as outsiders and are imagined as quiet listeners to pundits’ monologues. News media use the punditry sphere as a front for business diplomacy and political alliances while pundits use it primarily as a stage for self-serving performances, illustrating well the circularity between spectacle and narcissism argued by Abercombie and Longhurst (1998).",Covering Politics: New Political Journalism Research,Political Communication

2018-0132,2018,Paper Session,Moving Narrative Ads: Hedonic and Eudaimonic Experiences in Advertising,2,"Narrative ads have been shown to influence consumers’ attitudes through evoking pleasant feelings by telling amusing stories. Some ads, however, tell more meaningful stories, for instance about the value of relationships or the death of loved ones. In two studies, the questions are addressed to what extent such ads evoke a richer blend of feelings and what the impact is on the attitude toward the ad. The results of both studies reveal that the meaningful narrative ads evoke a broader range of emotions, including negative ones without this leading to more negative attitudes toward the ad. Whereas humorous ads provide hedonic entertainment, the more meaningful ones provide eudaimonic entertainment as well. The extent to which these ads are successful in providing a satisfying hedonic and/or eudaimonic entertainment experience appears to be more important for the attitude toward the ad than the individual emotions.","Advertising, Narratives, and Message Framing",Mass Communication

A study with 40 commercials and 421 participants confirmed that advertising persuasiveness could be enhanced when narratives elicit more self-relevance and produce more vividnessvivid details. Specifically, narrative ads that elicit higher self-relevance and more vividness produced greater goal and emotional engagement, more emotional engagement, and higher likelihood of decreased ad skepticism, resulting in more positive ad and brand attitudes. Further, the results also supported moderated mediation processes, with ad message explicitness as an important moderator. This research not only enhances our theoretical understanding of how narrative advertising works, but also provides specific guidance for advertising practitioners on which creative components can help elevate narrative persuasion.","Advertising, Narratives, and Message Framing",Mass Communication

Using a survey with student samples from the U.S. and China, study 1 demonstrated that self-construal affected reactance, such that independent self-construal was more associated with reactance. Further, it outperformed cultural background in predicting reactance. People with predominantly interdependent self-construals showed higher intention to purchase a product with social causes. Study 2 was a 2 (framing: gain vs. loss) x 2 (self-construal: independent vs. interdependent) between-subjects experiment using a non-student sample in the U.S. Results on the associations between self-construal and reactance and the intent to donate were consistent with findings of Study 1. Study 2 also indicated that employing loss-framed appeals in charity advertising was counterproductive to individuals, particularly among those with higher interdependent self-construals. This project offers important theoretical and applied implications and provides a robust avenue for future research. Limitations were also outlined.","Advertising, Narratives, and Message Framing",Mass Communication
2018-0135,2018,Paper Session,Journalistic Homophily on Social Media: Exploring Journalists' Interactions With Each Other on Twitter,2,"Journalists are often criticized for living in their own bubbles, a phenomenon industry commentators have referred to as groupthink, while in scholarship the tendency of individuals to connect with people who are like them is termed homophily. This age-old process has come under scrutiny in recent times due to the arrival of social network sites, which have been viewed as both working against but also leading to more homophily. In journalism scholarship, these processes are still little understood, however. Focusing on the social network site Twitter and drawing on a large-scale analysis of more than 660,000 tweets sent by 2908 Australian journalists during one year, this study shows that journalists continue to live, with only a few exceptions, in bubbles in their online interactions with each other along parameters such as gender, organizational affiliation, beat and location.

2018-0136,2018,Paper Session,The Private Side of Journalists: Changing Practices in Journalists’ Self-Branding on Twitter Over Time,1,"Journalists have been among the most active of Twitter’s users since the launch of the platform, making use of Twitter for professional tasks such as research, networking, content distribution, and branding. Research on journalists’ self-branding on Twitter has found that most journalists have adapted the style of mixing professional and personal (and sometimes even private) content in their profiles and updates, despite that this adaption to social media logic can be seen as contradicting professional norms and ideals. Based on a quantitative content analysis of a sample of Swedish journalists’ Twitter profiles in 2014 and 2017 (N=2,543 and 2,161), this study shows that over time, Swedish journalists are removing private attributes from their Twitter presentation, and that only a minority chose to include private attributes.

The paper also argues that Twitter has become the space in which Saudis voice their concerns and articulate the changes they wish to see; and that citizen journalism (CJ) on platforms such as Twitter has grown since the economic crisis of 2014 following the collapse in oil prices, as it provides a space for breaking news and discussion which avoids the censorship that official media is subject to (Altuwarjiri, 2013). There is evidence of a growing freedom of opinion and expression within Saudi society and enhanced popular participation in the movement for economic reform. Social media (SM) networks have played a key role in this process, with SM accounts belonging to both mainstream media outlets and Saudi citizen journalists helping to facilitate massive public debate in this area (Roubean, 2014).",@Journalists on #Twitter,Journalism Studies

Data regarding Twitter use was collected from 205 politicians in the three months prior to the Dutch 2017 national elections. The content of tweets and newspapers was examined through automated content analysis based on search queries.. Varying slopes regression models with random effects for time (weekly) and candidate were used to assess influence. The results show that popular tweets increase a candidate’s number of preferential votes, and that this relationship is mediated by newspaper coverage indeed. Popular tweets may help a candidate receive more preferential votes because they have a higher chance of getting covered in the news media.

This study focuses on two sociological forces — normalization and fragmentation — by observing them at work on Twitter. We analyzed content and interactions from mainstream and non-mainstream (“fake news”) political journalists covering a 2016 U.S. presidential debate. Forces of normalization would draw these two groups of reporters to established norms of objectivity, gatekeeping and familiar forms of campaign reporting, while forces of fragmentation would lead to partisanship, audience interaction and other interpretive practices. Findings suggest divergence in objectivity and gatekeeping, and convergence in campaign coverage practices such as emphasis on candidate characteristics and policy issues. Mainstream reporters insulate themselves and hold to traditional norms, while non-mainstream journalists offer openly partisan interpretations and seek out participation and engagement, often from people sharing their viewpoints.",@Journalists on #Twitter,Journalism Studies

Through computational approaches, over one million Facebook posts and user comments were mined from the top 100 NPOs in the United States. The NPOs’ emotion-carrying status, valence, and strength were analyzed with computer-assisted analysis. Drawing on interdisciplinary theories, results confirmed that emotion-carrying posts, posts with negative emotion valence, and posts with strong emotion all led to increased stakeholder engagement as indexed by the numbers of likes, shares, and comments. These three aspects of emotion as detected in organizational posts were also found to have a “contagion effect” on stakeholders’ comment. The findings fill critical gaps in the literature regarding nonprofit public relations and stakeholder engagement on social media.

We propose that interactants engage in a “bemoaning” speech act that draws on a rich range of resources around communication ideologies about technologized contexts to manage competing affiliation demands and disagreements with one another, and to construct moral identities in the situated interaction. By engaging in specific micro-level discursive practices moment-to-moment in interaction, participants produce and reproduce what new technologies “mean” to them. This has implications not just for understanding people’s attitudes toward new technologies and how they are negotiated and formulated, but also shows how our interpretations of “opinions” about new technologies must be grounded in the nuances of why people deliver particular opinions in certain ways to attend to interactional and cultural norms.",New Theories and New Models for Thinking About Technology,Communication and Technology

We focus on a category of (non-)users that has not received any attention in research: users-by-proxy. Users-by-proxy make use of sharing services but they are not themselves part of the sharing transaction. Platforms cannot analyze their behavior to tailor services or allocate labor most effectively. Users-by-proxy also have significant implications for trust and reputation mechanisms. In this conceptual contribution, we provide a definition of users-by-proxy as a third category between users and non-users, developing a typology of users-by-proxy based on motives of non-/use.

Through a historicization of the Spectacle via the Autonomist Marxism of Antonio Negri—which treats the (new) Spectacle as highly interactive and the previously considered passive spectator as a fairly dynamic prod-user— I advance the theory of the Socialized Spectacle. Using the example of Snapchat, and by examining the tensions of autonomy/heteronomy, sociability/alienation, and display/concealment, I will show how the current Spectacle operates continually through a dialectics of socialization.",New Theories and New Models for Thinking About Technology,Communication and Technology

This research investigates the relationship between interpersonal evaluations (i.e., perceived similarity, liking, and closeness) and political disagreement in social media versus face-to-face settings. Relying on a representative survey of adult Internet users in the United States (N = 489), the study first examines the differences between social media and face-to-face settings in terms of interpersonal evaluations. It then uses the estimated differences (observed and predicted) as a predictor of parallel differences in political disagreement.

The present study compared two types of audience value --- social value and economic value --- among family, casual friends, and work relations, and examined how these two types of audience value translate to self-presentational concern and performing self-censorship when engaging in political discussions on Facebook. Results of a between-subjects experiment (N = 360) revealed that work relations exhibit more economic value, which heightens Facebook users’ self-presentational concern and motivates more political self-censorship. In addition, social value predicted more self-presentational concern, which motivated more political self-censorship. This study provides important implications to the scholarship on political expression and self-presentation on SNSs, and extends previous research on context collapse.",Political Expression and Discussion on Social Media,Communication and Technology
2018-0151,2018,Paper Session,Surveil and Polarize: Delegitimizing Political Rivals on Israeli Facebook,1,"Current discussions on the political significance of social media normally revolve around one of two spatial metaphors: some approach social media platforms as open and inclusive online public spheres, while others view them as segregated environments that are broken up into closed-off echo chambers. Each of these spatial models offers a different understanding of how information circulates online, and by extension, a distinct viewpoint regarding the political effects we could expect in light of the increasingly central role social media plays in people’s everyday lives. Taking Israeli Facebook as a case-study, this paper seeks to advance an alternative articulation of the spatial logic that undergirds political interactions and the dissemination of political content via social media. In so doing, it sheds light on a set of divisive representational practices and online polarizing mechanisms which, although common in various national contexts, have hitherto received little scholarly attention.",Political Expression and Discussion on Social Media,Communication and Technology

This has not stopped theorists from promoting deliberative ideals in informal conversation spaces. In online settings, where the standards of deliberative theory are difficult to apply, other forms of measurement are required. To measure disception, a term derived from the Latin disceptāre and here means debate that fails to foster democracy, a measurement instrument is presented and tested. The Digital Disception Evaluation Scale (DDES) is a tool, grounded in theory, for future researchers to use in measuring quality of online discussion. Disception is operationalized by three factors, sparse evidence in discussion, emotionality, and partisan polarization. This instrument is stable across four tested applications, allows discussants to rate quality of conversation, and correlates predictably with other variables often measured in political communication research.",Political Expression and Discussion on Social Media,Communication and Technology

An affordance framework is especially useful for research unpacking the relationship between actors (the users), objects (features), and outcomes of use. In this paper, we extend research on visibility—a root affordance—to account for the unique aspects of social media and masspersonal communication, as well as research being conducted in disciplines outside communication. We synthesize the conceptual trajectory of visibility, then introduce a more focused conceptualization to describe socially mediated visibility (SMV), which we define according to the exposure content receives, the lack of spatiotemporal constraints, and facilitation via masspersonal ties. We conclude by applying three dimensions of visibility (relational, strategic, outcome-based) to SMV and compare SMV to unmediated and mediated conceptualizations of visibility. As explicated, socially mediated visibility can be a useful construct in several domains.",Social Media Scholarship and the Affordances Approach,Communication and Technology
2018-0154,2018,Paper Session,Out of Control: Privacy and Communication in the Light of Social Media Affordances,1,"Privacy has been defined as the selective control of information sharing, where control is key. For social media, however, an individual user’s informational control has become more difficult or even impossible. If privacy is defined by control, and social media information is not under the individual user’s control—does this mean that in social media, there is no privacy? In this theoretical paper, we suggest that social media users have a sense of privacy, even without informational control. Further, the affordances of persistence and association may challenge control, but affordances such as editability or anonymity enhance the individual’s informational control. Thus, we redefine privacy and argue that trust, norms, and communication are increasingly important for social media privacy. We examine how a lack of control and emerging requirements for trust and communication shift the privacy agency and power hierarchies of users and other social media agents such as individuals, institutions, and organizations.",Social Media Scholarship and the Affordances Approach,Communication and Technology

Thus, the decision to “friend” different types of social ties through SNS can involve complex deliberations that involves the sites’ perceived affordances, the type of relationship ties, and expected responses. This study uses an affordance approach to investigate the dynamic interaction between users’ perceived social affordances of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn and their friending behaviors with respect to strong ties, weak ties (maintenance tie, network ties, and professional ties), and parasocial ties. Our results from an online survey (N=630) found that people’s friending decisions not only involves considering the affordances of the SNSs and the type of social ties, but also network accessibility and cost of managing multiple networks.

An affordances framework allows for a non-deterministic consideration of the relationships between actors, technology, and varied outcomes. Visibility is especially worthy of study in socially mediated environments, where a primary goal is to make one’s self and content visible to other users. Stigma is an excellent context for visibility, as it exemplifies visibilities’ dimensions of relational, strategic, and outcome-driven. Through an examination of 29 interviews with young Azerbaijani activists, we explore the strategies they employ to manage their stigmatized identities and the factors specific to this context that lead to a heavy focus on concealment strategies. We conclude by discussing how socially mediated visibility can help understand the disclosure decision-making process through socially mediated communication channels.",Social Media Scholarship and the Affordances Approach,Communication and Technology

The nature of the news agency made AP photographers an important interpretive community, with front-row access to news scenes like the ones at the heart of this study: the Vietnam War and the White House. The photojournalists stood out for their blue-collar backgrounds and culture, which can be traced back to their roots as messengers and other non-reporting staffers. But the same working-class ethos manifested very differently in two very different beats. At the White House, the photographers were much more deferential to power, falling back on their “everyman” self-image to justify their intimate relationships with presidents. In contrast, photographers in Vietnam actively used their blue-collar credentials to expand boundaries of photographic coverage, producing pictures that are among the most iconic of the 20th century. While the difference in physical and organizational settings of Vietnam and White House was significant, both cases demonstrate how the blue-collar culture of the photographers impacted their work routines and coverage.",Modern Visual Cultures,Communication History

However, the early film exhibition in the rural area revealed that Maoist propaganda was in fact welcomed by peasants’ “deviant” responses. Focusing on the period of the 1950s that contextualized the rural viewer’s initial encounter with cinema, I intend to discuss how rural audiences’ “incomprehension” of film led to their diverse interactions with this novel modern medium. Such kind of film reception greatly challenged the ideal audienceship propagated by the Chinese Communist Party.

2018-0162,2018,Paper Session,What’s in a Name? The Impact of Reviewer Identification on Language and Helpfulness of Reviews,3,"For online reviews to serve as decision-making aids, users have to first perceive reviews to be helpful. However, unlike face-to-face communication, where people are identifiable, consumers in the online shopping context have to rely on reviews that are not always accompanied of personal profile information. Before posting reviews, reviewers could identify themselves by disclosing profile information. The impact of this disclosure on review readers has been demonstrated, but little attention has been given to the impact on review writers. Two experiments (N=89 and N=144) examined how disclosure of review identification elements influences language abstraction in reviews. Moreover, building on literature about self-presentation and construal level theory, we show that the relation between reviewer identification and perceived helpfulness of reviews is mediated by language abstraction. When reviewers disclose personal profile information, they will use more concrete language (i.e. words that refer to specific product features), which is then perceived as helpful.","HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive Processing, Social Influence, and Social Networks",Information Systems

Drawing from contagion theory, eigenvector centralities were measured to assess the level of influence people had within a social network. A social network was created to illuminate how elite and non-elite status contributed to how central users were in the network. Through negative bi-nominal regression, results indicate lower numbers of reviews a user gave within the network predicted their eigenvector centrality. Furthermore, depending on location and market size of a business, elite status, and critical reviews were significant predictors for eigenvector centrality in smaller, localized cities. These findings highlight how specific node attributes can predict social influence within the network. This study details how users on Yelp prefer the quality of reviews over the quantity of them.

SNS Use and Perceived Congruency Between Own Opinion and Online Opinion Climate as Predictors of Voicing Alternative Positions Online,7,"In contrast to traditional media coverage, the internet provides a myriad of different perspectives on political and social issues. As such, users may adopt positions which are not represented or even opposed to those presented in the mainstream media. Relying on theoretical approaches on online opinion formation and public outspokenness of opinions, we seek to investigate the impact of SNS use on the willingness to publicly voice such alternative positions, which are in contrast to mainstream media reality, via user comments on SNS. A mediation analysis of survey data, which is representative for the German adult population, reveals the following dynamic: Recipients who use SNS frequently are more prone to perceive their surrounding online climate as congruent with their own position, which in turn boosts their willingness to share their oppositional views via commenting on SNS. These findings suggest a spiral of consolidation of alternative positions and opinions.","HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive Processing, Social Influence, and Social Networks",Information Systems
2018-0166,2018,Paper Session,Effects of Online Physician Reviews and Physician Gender on Perceptions of Physician Skills and Primary Care Physician (PCP) Selection,3,"Physician review websites have become more relevant and important in people’s selection of physicians. The current study experimentally examined how online physician reviews about a primary care physician’s (PCP) technical or interpersonal skills, along with a physician’s gender, may influence people’s perceptions of the physician’s skills and their willingness to choose the physician. The results suggested that people’s willingness to choose a PCP was affected by physician reviews through their influence on people’s perceptions of a PCP’s technical and interpersonal skills. More importantly, this study found that if physician reviews endorsed a PCP’s technical skills, people perceived a female PCP to be more interpersonally competent than a male PCP and thus were more likely to choose the female PCP. The gender bias, however, was not extended to perceptions of a PCP’s technical skills. Practical implications for health providers and consumers were discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive Processing, Social Influence, and Social Networks",Information Systems
2018-0167,2018,Paper Session,Eye-Tracking eWOM: How Consumers Use Reviews in Their Purchase Decisions,3,"Online consumer reviews play an important role in consumer decision-making processes. While there has been a plethora of research studying the effects of different elements of reviews, such as valence or volume, on sales rank and perceived helpfulness, we still do not understand how consumers actually use reviews in the decision-making process, meaning how they attend to reviews and which elements of reviews they take into account while constructing decisions. According to drift diffusion models, attention plays an active role in making the decision, but—since it is not observable from the outside—it is difficult to investigate. This study uses eye-tracking technology to understand how consumers attend to and process online reviews. The results will provide insights into how consumers use reviews in their decision-making process, which can be translated into practical implications for online-review platforms and stores on how to design the review environments.","HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive Processing, Social Influence, and Social Networks",Information Systems

We propose that group-based social network norms can change value related processing in brain during exposure to persuasive messages. Sedentary adults provided information about the physical activity levels in their social network, and neural responses to health messages promoting physical activity in an fMRI scanner. We then objectively logged their physical activity for a month using accelerometers. We found that perceived levels of physical activity within individual's social network were significantly related to the brain's value network activations (within ventromedial-prefrontal cortex). Further, vmPFC activity was related to later behavior change. We found a marginally significant indirect effect, via vmPFC, of social network norms on decreasing sedentary behavior. These results provide new links between group-based behavioral metrics and neural receptivity to messaging and behavior change.","HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive Processing, Social Influence, and Social Networks",Information Systems
2018-0169,2018,Paper Session,Psychosocial Well-Being and Social Media Engagement: The Mediating Roles of Social Comparison Orientation and Fear of Missing Out,3,"Based on a large representative sample of German Internet users aged 14 to 39 years, the current survey study investigates how four indicators of well-being (self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety, and depression) are connected to social media engagement. To provide a deeper understanding of this relationship, not only direct links are inspected, but fear of missing out (FoMO) and social comparison orientation (SCO) are considered as possible mediators. The results show that loneliness, depression and anxiety are positively correlated with social media engagement. FoMO and SCO jointly mediate the connection between well-being and social media engagement, i.e.: decreases in well-being are connected with increases in FoMO and SCO, which in turn positively predict social media engagement. Further, SCO and FoMO are found to be positively related to each other, suggesting that those with a high SCO might form a particular at-risk group for the development of FoMO.","HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive Processing, Social Influence, and Social Networks",Information Systems
2018-0170,2018,Paper Session,Mobile Phone Use of Chinese Rural-Urban Female Migrant Workers in the Informal and Formal Sectors,3,"Grounded in the theory of “bargaining with patriarchy” (Agarwal, 1997; Kandiyoti, 1988), this study aims to examine how socioeconomically challenged women display agency to negotiate gender power relationships in their patriarchal workplaces through mobile phone use. Specifically, this study differentiates two types of patriarchal work contexts – the one where men usually dominate the economic resources of women and the other one where men and women share almost equal professional status. Differentiating the two types of work contexts enables this study to take a nuanced look at how adoption and operation of mobile phones by women to act upon gender-based inequalities may vary according to their situated professional patriarchal systems. This study is based on a fieldwork in an informal labour market and a fruit can factory as a registered private enterprise under governmental regulation, of Dalian city, China, with in-depth interview and observation adopted as two major research methods.",Mobility and Migration,Mobile Communication
2018-0171,2018,Paper Session,Chinese Migrant Workers' Sexual and Reproductive Health Information Seeking via Mobile Phones,1,"Aim/objectives—There are an estimated 277 million rural-to-urban migrant workers in China. Smartphones are widely used among this group. Mobile environments begin to serve the needs of Chinese migrant workers for sexual and reproductive health information. Thus, there is a need to understand the determinants of migrant worker intentions to search such information through mobile handsets. This study therefore further explores the utility of the Theory of Planned Behavior by adding three antecedents, which include perceived benefits, self-identity and external factors (i.e. workload and insurance status).
Design and Methods—343 migrant workers either completed an online or offline survey. The respondents were recruited by snowball and convenience samplings. This study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to investigate the extended research model.
Conclusion—The results suggest the possibility of new but powerful determinants of information searcher intention, also with practical implications.",Mobility and Migration,Mobile Communication

We examine how mobile telephony plays into their transition from the world’s most digitally-disconnected country to one of the most digitally-oriented societies. Based on the interviews with 20 North Korean women living in South Korea, we examine their use of mobile communication in North Korea and during their journey where it was extremely restricted, clandestine and fraught. Nonetheless, the phone was often instrumental in their escape/journey. By contrast, upon entering the South, their use of the mobile phone is structured into everyday life. In this case, not to have a phone is problematic. Thus, the mobile phone becomes a lens with which to understand power relationships and the shifting positions of these migrants vis-à-vis different power structures.",Mobility and Migration,Mobile Communication

From planning the journey, to navigating border crossings and unknown territories, keeping in touch with friends and family on the way, arriving in their host countries, working through the asylum process, and settling in, a plethora of smartphone applications have been developed in recent years that serve the different needs of refugees and migrants. The German government has tapped into these needs by developing a smartphone app for refugees, called Ankommen, which is supposed to aid them in getting settled into Germany. It is also an interesting reflection of Germany’s self-conception as a “national culture,” and the way this official government app positions the idea of refugee identity against native Germans, inadvertently showing unwarranted fears against an alien other that projects like the app seek to alleviate.",Mobility and Migration,Mobile Communication

Using survey methodology (n=716), the study applies co-cultural theory to evaluate how they respond to discrimination. The findings of this study indicate that non-monosexuals are heavy users of social media and that it plays a significant role in their perceptions of their environment.

2018-0175,2018,Paper Session,“An Army of Lovers”: Fag Rag and the Proto-Queer Print Counterpublic,1,"Fag Rag, a publication that circulated for over two decades, is often left out of mainstream histories of queer community formation. Arising in lock step with the underground media of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fag Rag is an epitomical example of the militant discursive imaginings of the post-Stonewall generation. In this paper I excavate its history and attempt a historical ethnography of the newspaper's producers, language and ethos. In particular, I examine the ways in which the newspaper manifested what Bronski (1982) refers to as “an editorial policy oriented toward sex radicalism” (151). Drawing from Fraser (1992) and Warner (2002) among others, I theorize this discursive environment as indicative of a nascent subaltern counterpublic which utilized circulating print media as a way to forge in-group ties and contest the dearth of gay visibility in the dominant public sphere.",Queer Alternative Media as Counterpublics and Safe Spaces,"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"
2018-0176,2018,Paper Session,Reportage About Craigslist Sex Forums in Mainstream Newspapers and LGBTQ and Feminist Magazines,1,"This study compares journalistic representations of Craigslist sex forums in mainstream U.S. newspapers and LGBTQ and feminist online magazines. In this critical discourse analysis, I trace the development of reporting about Craigslist and sexual deviance, focusing on the role the press plays in determining what is normalized vs. stigmatized in culture. I identified seven dominant themes present in a sample of 280 U.S. newspaper stories and 130 LGBTQ and feminist magazine articles: Sex Crimes and Sex Work, Law and Regulation, Scandal, Online Dating Culture, Business & Economy, Public Health, and Related Media. Newspapers called on bureaucratic sources to police online sex work, while alternative magazines used first-person stories to snub the seedy world of online hookups. This study interrogates the counter-hegemonic function of the alternative press by drawing on theories of media ideology and vernacular media. Although advocates of self-representation may want us to believe that minority media produce more nuanced stories, this research illustrates the pervasiveness of normalizing judgment about sex. Reporting routines and sourcing practices contribute to the deviance defining paradigm present in both mainstream and alternative Craigslist coverage.",Queer Alternative Media as Counterpublics and Safe Spaces,"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

In this tense dilemma between visibility and stereotyping emerges the ‘Dead Lesbian Syndrome’: a television trope where lesbian characters are recurrently “punished” in fictional narratives for openly showing their (homo)sexuality. This paper aims to analyse nonviolent protest strategies applied by lesbian and bisexual fan activists on social media with the goal to persuade, influence and attract public attention to raise awareness on the stereotyped portrayals of female LGBTQ characters in the television industry, and thus achieve a change. The preliminary results show an overall increase in the awareness of the problem among lesbian and bisexual fans who, at the same time, go through a process of self-regulation to neutralising possible forms of violent resistance within their campaigns.",Queer Alternative Media as Counterpublics and Safe Spaces,"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"
2018-0178,2018,Paper Session,How Right-Wing Populist Communication Influences Cognitions and Emotions Towards Immigrants: Evidence From a Cross-National Panel-Survey,7,"The success of populist parties is not only attributed to the programs they promote, but also to how they communicate. Populist communication is composed of different elements reflecting the populist ideology and can refer to the content as well as to the form of a message. The present study explores the effects of both of these components of populist communication on attitudes towards migrants. By combining a media content analysis (N=2387 articles) with a panel survey (N=2278) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (FR, DE, CH and UK), it is analyzed how citizens’ attitudes toward migrants are influenced by the right-wing populist messages they are confronted with in their individual media diet. It is assumed that the content of right-wing populist messages will primarily affect the cognitive attitude component, while the populist style will predominantly influence the affective component. The results provide evidence for both assumptions, however, they vary between countries.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Communication,Political Communication
2018-0179,2018,Paper Session,Start Spreading the News: A Comparative Experiment on the Effects of Populist Communication on Political Participation in 16 European Countries,27,"Populism has become highly pervasive and persuasive throughout Europe. Despite growing scholarly interest in populism’s content, causes and consequences, many important questions remain unanswered. First, previous research has neglected the differential effects of populist communication on the left and right. Second, internationally comparative studies are missing. Finally, previous research studied attitudinal outcomes, neglecting behavioral effects. To address these key issues, this paper draws on an extensive comparative experiment in 16 European countries (N = 16,386) to explore the effects of populist communication on political engagement. The findings illustrate that anti-elitist populism has the strongest effect on political engagement. The impact of a complete right-wing populist message is higher in countries with higher levels of unemployment, and anti-immigrant messages have a stronger impact when they resonate with the political success of populist parties on the right. These findings provide important insights into the persuasiveness of populist communication throughout the European continent.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Communication,Political Communication

Investigating the Relationship Between Citizens’ Populist Predispositions and Their Connections to Right-Wing Populists on Facebook Using Panel Data,1,"Right-wing populists (RWP) are highly active on social media and use them to deliver their messages directly and unfiltered to their target groups. Yet little is known on what groups of citizens follow RWP on Facebook and how such following in turn affects their attitudes and emotional predispositions. To answer these questions, we have conducted a two-wave panel study (N = 559) in the context of the Austrian national election 2017 and analyze the role of anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-elitist attitudes as well as feelings of political anger and anxiety. Findings reveal that only anti-immigrant attitudes significantly affected following RWP. Following in turn fueled anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-elitist attitudes, and feelings of political anxiety. Additional analyses revealed that all these variables significantly increased RWP voting intention and that anti-immigrant attitudes exerted the most robust effect. In the light of these results, the role of social media in RWP voter mobilization is discussed.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Communication,Political Communication
2018-0181,2018,Paper Session,The Persuasive Power of Right-Wing Populist Rhetoric: How Figuratively Framed Populist Statements Affect Political Opinion,3,"The typically intense and emotive rhetoric employed by populist politicians is generally seen as an important factor for their political success. Such populist rhetoric is commonly framed with metaphor and hyperbole. In two experiments, we tested how metaphor and hyperbole add to the intense and emotive character of populist statements and to their persuasiveness. Results showed that different voters respond differently to figuratively framed right-wing populist rhetoric. The general voter perceived populist statements framed with metaphor and/or hyperbole as more intense and emotive than non-figurative statements. For these voters, figuratively framed populist statements caused boomerang effects. In contrast, right-wing populist voters were not affected by the populist rhetoric in the current study. This can be explained by perceptions of appropriateness and previous exposure, further elaborated in the Discussion section. Our findings underscore that populist metaphors and hyperboles can further divide society and thereby, indirectly, increase support for right-wing populist parties.",Understanding the Effects of Populist Communication,Political Communication

This paper tests how emotional states (i.e., fear, anger, and sadness) tagged with pictorial tobacco warnings could affect health-related cognition variables (i.e., efficacy, self-stigma, and threat appraisal), and furthermore smoking cessation intention, and whether a fear appeal video of smoking could moderate these relationships. The overall results of an online experiment with survey among 270 South Korean smokers highlight the distinct roles of different emotions in fear appeal literature, based on the significant influence of fear, but not anger and sadness, on health cognition and smoking cessation intention. Specifically, a fear appeal video only moderated the causal path from a) fear  efficacy on pictorial tobacco warnings  smoking cessation intention and b) fear  stigma on smoking  smoking cessation intention.

We travelled with a mobile lab to recruit adult smokers (study 1: N= 245) and middle school youth (study 2: N= 242) from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to view 9 FDA-proposed graphic warning labels with or without identified sponsors. We randomly assigned respondents into one of three conditions: (1) FDA as the sponsor of warning label messages, (2) sponsorship by a well-known, non-governmental organization (the American Cancer Society), or (3) a non-sponsored condition. We gauged the impact of sponsorship on source attributions, credibility perceptions, intentions to quit (among adult smokers) and reduced smoking susceptibility (among youth). Exposure to an explicitly identified sponsor (FDA or ACS) did not increase credibility judgments about the source of the message. However, believing that a tobacco company was the source of the warnings (regardless of condition) was associated with reduced credibility, which in turn predicted increased smoking susceptibility among youth. Future research should identify strategies to minimize (false) sponsor attributions. Attributing warning label messages to the FDA, however, is unlikely to increase their credibility.",HIGH-DENSITY: Tobacco Warning Label Mechanisms and Effects,Health Communication

A test of FDA-proposed GWLs among regular smokers (N=251) showed that although neither of the two responses to health messages had a negative association with intention to quit, they both were positively associated with unintended outcomes. When modeled as parallel mediators alongside negative affect, thus accounting for the confounding effect of negative emotions, both anticipated avoidance and perceived threat to freedom were positively associated with risk-justifying, worth-it beliefs. Contrary to expectations, a positive association between anticipated avoidance and worth-it beliefs emerged only for smokers with high confidence in their ability to quit. Freedom threat perceptions were related to increased desire to smoke.

2018-0185,2018,Paper Session,Testing Messages About Comparative Harm of Electronic Cigarettes and Combustible Cigarettes,3,"Health agencies are grappling with challenges of communicating the risks of e-cigarettes to cigarettes. While e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustible cigarettes, they are not harmless. Messages that frame e-cigarettes as a less harmful option could be beneficial if smokers who were otherwise unwilling to quit switched to e-cigarettes completely. However, these messages might have unintended effects, such as increased dual use. We hypothesized that in order to minimize the unintended consequences, messages communicating reduced risk of e-cigarettes should have a strong anti-smoking component. Through an online experiment, we examined smokers’ responses to messages communicating only less risks of e-cigarettes to cigarettes and to messages communicating both less risks of e-cigarettes and negative consequences of smoking. We found both messages fostered correct relative risk perceptions about e-cigarettes and neither tended to have unintended consequences. The two messages differed in message evaluations and perceived effectiveness.

2018-0186,2018,Paper Session,Gruesomeness and Recall in Graphic Warning Labels: Does Length of Visual Attention Matter?,5,"Graphic warning labels on cigarette packages are expected to make warnings more memorable to viewers. The more vivid the image, the more memorable the warning should be. We conducted a within-subjects experiment to test whether this hypothesis holds for gruesome, disgust-eliciting images, such as those depicting diseased lungs, compared to warnings without such images. Using eye tracking, we examined the relationship between youth and adult participants’ attention to both types of warnings and their recall of each. Participants’ mean probability of recall was greater for the gruesome warnings as hypothesized. However, youth looked at the gruesome warnings for less time than the non-gruesome warnings. There was no difference in the length of time adults looked at the gruesome and non-gruesome warnings. Recall was not predicted by attention for either group. One possible explanation for these findings is that gruesome images are memorable regardless of how long participants look at them.",HIGH-DENSITY: Tobacco Warning Label Mechanisms and Effects,Health Communication

However, little is known about the image features that are most effective. Past research on tobacco warning labels (TWLs) has examined the effects of small sets of labels which do not provide insight into the features that may be responsible for these effects.
Objective: This study identified features in a large set of TWLs and then examined their effectiveness across four outcome measures.
Method: A set of TWLs (N=319) underwent content analysis for over 60 features. Current smokers (N= 1378) then rated a random 6 TWLs on four outcome measures.
Results: TWLs with testimonial appeals increased emotional engagement and perceived effectiveness. This effect differed by stage of change. Additionally, depictions of diseased or damaged body parts were effective.

We sought to establish whether and how smokers’ conversations explain the effect of pictorial warnings on quit attempts.
Methods: US adult smokers (n=2,149) participated in a controlled trial that randomly assigned them to have cigarette packs labeled with pictorial or text-only warnings. Surveys assessed the number of conversations sparked by pictorial warnings, theoretical mechanisms, and conversational content. Analyses used structural equation modeling.
Results: The number of conversations about the warnings mediated the relationship between exposure to pictorial warnings and quit attempts (p<.001). The number of conversations was associated with greater cognitive elaboration, which in turn was associated with more quit attempts (p<.05). Conversations about negative emotional reactions to the warnings mediated the path from warnings to quit attempts (p<.05).

My analysis is grounded in three sources: three years of ethnographic observations as an organizer of and participant in the March to End Rape Culture, the March’s digital and print media, and archival research on the history of the term “rape culture.” Drawing on these data, I trace the rise of rape culture as an organizing principle for contemporary feminism, the visions of domination and resistance it enables, and the political work it performs. Then, drawing on the digital and material lives of the March, I highlight the transgressive practices the March fosters in response to rape culture. Together, these two elements – theory and practice – constitute a contemporary feminist praxis that situates the individual body as a point of mediation between oppression at the macro-level and everyday life at the micro-level.",Contesting Rape Culture: Feminist Explorations of Violence Against Women,Feminist Scholarship

Survivors of sexual misconduct are often silenced with fear; however, media attention in this case did serve as a platform for many women to publicly accuse Trump. Despite this, content and textual analyses of print, TV cable, and online news sources (N = 847) showed continued emphasis on negative comments towards accusers, threats from Trump and others, and dismissal of accusations. News media do not only reflect public opinion, but also reinforce threats of isolation to minorities by heavily focusing on majority threats. This was found especially for TV cable and conservative media. Overall, survivors still face isolation, retaliation, and poor treatment by formal systems for speaking out.

2018-0191,2018,Paper Session,Backlash Against Globalization: Implications of Globalization and Its Impact on Gender-based Violence and Gang Rape Within the Context of India,1,"While individual rape is commonly addressed by academics, gang rape is under-researched. The 2012 incident during which 23-year-old medical student Jyoti Singh was gang raped on a Delhi bus sparked domestic outrage and international media coverage, giving voice to Jyoti and her family where they may otherwise have had none. Through the lens of feminist theory and an inductive approach, this analysis of gender inequality considers the possibility of a backlash against globalization, where educated, upwardly-mobile women are targeted by lower-economic status men. This case sheds light on implications for India’s emerging economy, the feminization of India’s labor market, and the role of media pertaining to the roles of women and men in society. This is not to say globalization is to blame. It is to argue, while the patriarchal construct of society is at risk of breaking down, globalization and the upward mobilization of women are playing a role.",Contesting Rape Culture: Feminist Explorations of Violence Against Women,Feminist Scholarship

This study analyzed 236 photographs of “The Kiss” statue posted on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram and tagged with #kissandtell5, #embracingpeace, or #unconditionalsurrender. Comments on “kiss” photos primarily focused on themes of romance, humor, patriotism, although some included comments regarding rape culture and non-consensual contact. When individuals reenacted the kiss in the photo, they were largely found to be heteronormative, with a man dipping a woman backwards. However, some kiss reenactments included women dipping men backwards, women kissing women, and men kissing men.

During these years, family rules around technology—especially what technologies can be used and when teens can use them—are a major source of tension between parents and their children. In this paper, we use Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory to explore factors leading to familial turbulence around technology use. Using paired surveys of parents and teen children (N=96), we build novel measure the likelihood of privacy turbulence emerging in a family. We then identify factors associated with a higher likelihood of privacy turbulence, with a significant interaction effect indicating older teens who perceive their parents to be overly restrictive have the highest likelihood of familial turbulence. We discuss findings in light of CPM and offer suggestions for families to change their communication structure to encourage openness and reduce turbulence.",Theorizing Privacy Behaviors in Online Spaces,Communication and Technology

The study (1) identifies and (2) estimates the occurrence of subgroups that differ in the extent to which they perceive the ‘social contract’ as reliable (based on privacy concerns, and trust and risk perceptions), and (3) measures to what extent this perception of a social contract affects individuals’ adaptive online behavior. Using a representative two-wave panel survey (N = 1,222), we distinguished five subgroups of internet users; the highly-concerned, wary, ambivalent, neutral (the largest group), and carefree internet users. The highly-concerned, ambivalent, and wary users were more likely to adapt their behavior online than the neutral and carefree users.

Despite that online companies progressively collect and use our personal information to offer personalized communications, the role of personalization in such tradeoffs has remained understudied. This study tests a model of online self-disclosure using privacy calculus theory. The model presents how relationships between personalization and self-disclosure are based on a cost-benefits tradeoff (i.e., balancing perceived benefits, perceived privacy costs, and trust in online companies), and analyzes the moderating role of the context in which one self-discloses (i.e., disclosing to health, news, or commercial websites). Results from a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 1,132) showed that personalization decreased perceived benefits and trust in online companies, resulting in lower willingness to self-disclose.

Using a representative sample of the German population (_N_ = 1384) with three waves separated by 6 months each, this study is the first to investigate the privacy paradox from a longitudinal perspective. The data are analyzed using a traditional cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) and a further developed version that implements random intercepts (RI-CLPM). The latter hence allows to disaggregate between-person from within-person variance. Several cross-sectional between-person and longitudinal within-person effects were found.

The factors influencing obesity are complex and multifaceted, indicating a critical need to understand the determinants of obesity from a social ecological perspective, which acknowledges multiple levels of influence rather than simply focusing on individual-level factors (Sallis, Owen, & Fisher, 2008). This study uses communication infrastructure theory (CIT) to understand providers’ individual communication behavior by analyzing the communication ecology in which they are situated (Ball-Rokeach, Kim, & Matei, 2001). Providers (n = 9) who routinely referred overweight and obese adolescents to a Pediatric High BMI Diagnostic Clinic were recruited for one-on-one interviews to explore their perceptions of their patients’ relationships with food and barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle. Data from the interviews were analyzed using a framework analysis methodology, which is a qualitative method of successive, inductive inquiry (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). Findings from this study offer new insights into factors influencing childhood obesity and provide a clear focus for subsequent studies to contribute to the development of multi-level interventions and novel policies designed to curb obesity among this population.",Improving Healthcare Provider Communication,Health Communication
2018-0198,2018,Paper Session,Communication and Discourse in Knowledge Production of Clinical Genomics: Examining Genomic Literacy of Medical Oncologists,1,"This paper explores genomic literacy among oncologists in the Personalized Onco-Genomics (POG) cancer clinical trial. POG represents spaces of convergence between medical and computing sciences, as well as doctors and data scientists. The paper gathers data from a survey and semi-structured interviews with medical oncologists and other scientists at POG. Using this data I identified two challenges in applying genomics in clinical practice including lack of knowledge equivalence among different medical stakeholders and diagnostic uncertainty of genomic information. POG makes it possible to bridge these gaps. POG instantiates a pedagogical space where different medical stakeholders come together to co-construct and translate genomic data into clinical information through their communicative and discursive processes, as they learn more about genomics. As such, communication and discourse play an important role in improving genomic literacy among physicians and facilitating knowledge translation of genomics. Higher genomic literacy can influence clinical treatments for cancer patients.",Improving Healthcare Provider Communication,Health Communication
2018-0199,2018,Paper Session,Evaluation of the Implementation of a Multi-Component Intervention to Improve Healthcare Provider Communication About HPV Vaccination,6,"There is a critical need for campaigns and interventions to increase rates of HPV vaccination among U.S. adolescents. Healthcare providers are key stakeholders in parents’ decision-making about vaccination. The current study presents the evaluation of efforts to implement a multi-component communication-based intervention to improve healthcare providers communication about HPV vaccination. Both process and outcome evaluation were conducted via surveys of providers participating in a 10-month randomized controlled trial. Findings suggest successful implementation of the intervention with key differences in the use of intervention components (i.e., communication toolkit items). Perceptions of toolkit items’ usefulness and barriers to use are identified and limitations are discussed.",Improving Healthcare Provider Communication,Health Communication
2018-0200,2018,Paper Session,Examining the Impact of Self-Efficacy and Training Duration in Smith's Patient-Centered Interview,1,"Smith’s Patient-Centered Interview (PCI) is a methodology for healthcare providers to train residents in the communication skills necessary for obtaining information from patients. Research has demonstrated that providers who use patient-centered communication skills have higher patient satisfaction ratings, and their patients show improved physical and psychological health outcomes. Additionally, previous research has found that residents trained in the PCI show improved communication outcomes over untrained residents. However, in previous studies, no significant relationship was found linking levels of provider self-efficacy to subsequent demonstrations of skill, as would be expected from social learning theory and self-efficacy literature. Research questions are presented regarding the effect of the questionnaire timing and training duration and the resulting levels of provider self-efficacy and demonstrated PCI skills. The findings suggest that the timing of self-efficacy questionnaires does not impact subsequent demonstrations of skill and that both self-efficacy and demonstrated skills increase with training duration.",Improving Healthcare Provider Communication,Health Communication

This study pilot tested an integrative (Chinese Medicine + Biomedicine) nutritional counseling (INC) intervention for feasibility and acceptability. Fifteen Cantonese Chinese Americans with T2DM received INC: a diagnostic interview with a licensed acupuncturist, a 2-hour nutrition class with a registered dietitian, and a booklet of dietary recommendations based on biomedical nutrition and Chinese medical concepts. Participants completed surveys/interviews prior to and four weeks after the intervention. Participants reported high satisfaction with the INC class and new positive attitudes and diet changes that aligned directly with the class. Participants reported signs of improvement from biomedicine (lower blood sugar numbers) and from Chinese medicine (better elimination). Challenges included confusion with some INC information, structural barriers and comorbidities. This study supports the acceptability and feasibility of the integrative nutrition approach. More research is necessary to determine what parts of INC are most effective, optimal delivery of INC, and whether behavioral changes are significant. Integrative nutritional counseling may be included in current diabetes self-management education to be more culturally sensitive to the needs of Chinese Americans.",Improving Healthcare Provider Communication,Health Communication

This is remarkable because - from theoretical considerations as well as numerous best practice cases from the field - social media communication for company founding could have an extensive potential. In our paper we conceptualize communication of start-ups in social networks within the framework of communication management theory. We use data of a start-up panel in Germany (n = 442) and examine whether communication management in social media contributes to start-up performance, and which strategies entrepreneurs use in their social media communication. We refer in this context to understanding-oriented communication and strategies of personalization and analyze their impact on start-up success.",Public Relations: Engaging via Social Media,Public Relations
2018-0203,2018,Paper Session,Online Media Crisis Response Framework: Mapping Crisis Response Strategies to Curated Flow of Online Information,1,"This study examined whether online information flow about an organizational crisis can be organized into distinct phases. Findings from this study suggest that online information flows during a crisis presents a series of themes that can be organized into distinct stages. The focus is on online media content because unlike, mass media era, in which communication could be conceptualized as largely being controlled by political elites and media actors, in the online media environment, information processes are also undertaken by actors such as the individual users themselves, their friends and their social networks. The availability to easily and quickly access digital data from an individual’s online media interactions and to be able to build exponentially on the countless individuals’ networked information world directly provides possibilities that have not been available earlier. It was within this context, this research examined the crisis at Susan G. Komen and its decision to defund Planned Parenthood. It proposes a framework that identifies the nature of online media content flow and recommends media strategies to counter the negative coverage of the organization.",Public Relations: Engaging via Social Media,Public Relations

We build on the socio-cognitive approach to uses and gratifications research (LaRose & Eastin, 2004) to study the incentives why individuals turn to brand pages, what moti-vates them to “like” such a page, as well as the reasons which lead them to publicly express them-selves on a corporate brand page. Three models of user engagement with brand pages ranging from low to high interaction are tested on the basis of extensive survey data (N=1294). Results suggest that most people look at the information available on a page, whereas participation and production numbers are lower. Novel and self-reactive motivations provide key drivers for users to turn to brand pages overall, with further unique incentive dimensions applying with increasing user en-gagement. In addition, cultural differences between two user groups were found with special regard to monetary incentives.",Public Relations: Engaging via Social Media,Public Relations

However, their empirical assessment has not yet been approached in a systematic way. This study aims at further theoretically and analytically refining the academic debate on issue arenas. We focus on Twitter as social media forum that plays an important role for issue arenas. Our focus is on the actors who participate in issue arenas and their interactions with topics. Two food quality debates in the Netherlands are studied for a two-year period: First, the debate on over-fed chickens and, second, the debate on kilo stunners. Both are prominent examples of social counter marketing in the Netherlands. Combining data on the involvement of actors, hashtag networks and username networks as well as the frequencies of the most prominent hashtags provides a comprehensive account on how issue arenas can be studied.",Public Relations: Engaging via Social Media,Public Relations

Specifically, we tested two competing hypotheses. One posited that people would process comments centrally with high elaboration and, as a result, comments would produce a primacy effect. In this effect, a comment stream would have the greatest negative effect on the audience if uncivil comments were read first. The counter hypothesis predicted the opposite – people would employ peripheral processing with low elaboration that resulted in a recency effect, where the most recently read comments would produce the greater effect. Results showed clear support for a recency effect. Those exposed to a comment stream with 75% uncivil comments had an increased negative view toward the news site and a diminished sense of community with other commenters, even though the stream began with civil comments.",Comment Section: Public Deliberation?,Mass Communication

While the notion of the public sphere is conceptually rich, research about comments often ignores power dynamics and political economy perspectives. This paper critiques the Habermasian public sphere, and proposes new trajectories for comments research that employ the Foucauldian concept of governmentality, incorporating a power and governance dimension. Following Andrejevic and Fuchs, it then puts forward a political economy perspective, based on the conceptualization of a commercial digital enclosure of information. Without decrying the usefulness of the public sphere concept, the article cautions Neo-Habermasians to remain conscious of the dimensions of these realms of online comments beyond the public sphere. It pinpoints the need to expand anticipations of a deliberative utopia by considering the realities of control, governance and ownership in online comments contexts.",Comment Section: Public Deliberation?,Mass Communication
2018-0209,2018,Paper Session,The Role of News Coverage for the Willingness to Speak Out Publicly in Comment Sections,2,"In this paper, we ask whether the climate of opinion depicted in an online news article on policy issues influences the amount of user participation and interactivity on news web sites. From the perspective of the Spiral of Silence Theory, we argue that articles containing statements of representatives of the government or the opposition will attract more users to post a comment and to do so more frequently. In comparison, we expect balanced articles to have a bigger effect than one-sided articles. Additionally, we also expect justified statements to increase user participation and interactivity. We conducted a content analysis of 400 online newspaper articles. Results show that statements, especially when representing different views, have a positive impact on participation and interactivity, while the presence of justifications does not make a difference. However, the study shows that the climate of opinion depicted in an article adds an important aspect to explaining user behavior in comment sections and the formation of public opinion in the online sphere.",Comment Section: Public Deliberation?,Mass Communication

To provide an alternative perspective in judging the value of online commentary, this study evaluated comments’ qualification as public deliberation and explored the formation process of public discourse on the comment boards of news sites. Results showed online commentary qualifies as public deliberation and the comment boards are public sphere where various arguments compete against each other for attention, repetition and resonance. Early comments were more influential than those posted late. Early comments gained more responses from other readers, and the arguments made in early comments were more likely to be adopted by later commenters and thus become prominent in the public discourse overall. What affects an argument’s prevalence the most is still the its intrinsic quality as some arguments are consistently more prevalent than others regardless of where they first appeared.",Comment Section: Public Deliberation?,Mass Communication

Study 1 focused on message content in terms of type of utterance (e.g., laughter, applause-cheering, booing) when it occurred, and intensity, in response to each candidate, providing the baseline for the following studies. Study 2a used observational analysis of 362 undergraduates watching the first debate on seven different networks in separate rooms. Findings reveal laughter is strongly associated with greater shared response when compared with applause-cheering. Intensity of studio response has a small-to-moderate association with observed field audience response. Study 2b suggests that the candidate influenced observed cumulative strength of applause, yet not laughter. Study 3 suggests applause-cheering significantly influenced response, whereas laughter did not. Overall, laughter is more likely to be a mimicked whereas applause may be a more emotionally contagious during the political debate.",Potpourri of Research on Campaign Communication,Political Communication

This conclusion does not consider, however, how female candidates adopt campaign strategies that limit the potential for such bias to occur. I fill this empirical and theoretical gap by identifying how female candidates limit bias through campaign strategies. I use an original data set that merges information on candidate trait strategies with candidate characteristics and campaign dynamics across three election cycles. I show that female candidates only emphasize feminine traits when they can gain an electoral advantage.",Potpourri of Research on Campaign Communication,Political Communication

Using mixed methods that combine network analysis of Twitter data and in-depth interviews, our analysis demonstrates that, despite the pervasiveness and increasing strategic importance of DCTs, radical organisational or strategic change is not inevitable, nor is there a one-size-fits-all approach. Some campaigns selectively adopt a narrow use of digital tools that fit with the command and control model, enhancing their preferred top-down approach. In other cases the application of DCTs and the dynamics created by linking to other grassroots organisations can have more transformative effects . Our findings have important implications for our understanding of contemporary electoral campaigns, the use of digital technologies in politics and how this impacts on power dynamics between different actors.",Potpourri of Research on Campaign Communication,Political Communication

In this study, we argue that partisan motivated reasoning can enhance some persuasive outcomes and that some debates result in persuasive outcomes that challenge the motivated reasoning hypothesis. In support of this, we present quasi-experimental data from 15 U.S. presidential and vice-presidential debates drawn from samples of 22 states over the course of 12 years. Findings are generally consistent with a view that persuasion is both constrained and enhanced by motivated reasoning but that, on some occasions, a debate performance will break through partisan filters and result in out-party gains or in-party losses for one or both candidates.",Potpourri of Research on Campaign Communication,Political Communication

2018-0216,2018,Paper Session,Rethinking Journalist-Politician Relations in the Age of Post-Truth Politics. How Outsider Politicians De-Legitimize Mainstream Journalists,1,"The relation between journalists and politicians in liberal democracy is traditionally conceptualized as highly institutionalized, based on mutual dependence, and grounded in a shared culture of clearly defined role relations. While this conceptualization provided a fruitful framework to understand the relation between mainstream journalists and politicians, it falls short to explain the way outsider politicians such as Beppe Grillo, Donald Trump, Nigel Farage or Thierry Baudet address the mainstream media. Thus, this paper presents an expanded conceptual framework to understand the relation between outsider politicians and mainstream journalists. In this framework, the interaction between journalists and politicians is seen as an ongoing negotiation over the legitimacy of mainstreamers and outsiders. Central in the framework is a classification of strategies which outsider politicians use to de-legitimize mainstream journalists. Based on this framework, a research agenda is proposed to study the characteristics, antecedents and consequences of the changing relations between journalists and politicians.",Journalism Under Attack,Journalism Studies

In 2015 reports of verbal and physical attacks on German journalists and news organizations by individuals calling them Lügenpresse, had significantly increased. While the term “fake news” is being used to similar intent in the United States, Lügenpresse is a historically and politically charged expression of the lack of trust in news media on an institutional level. In this paper we examine the responses and institutional strategies of 25 news editors and executive editors in Germany’s leading news organizations to the accusations that they are lying to their audiences. Findings indicate that the reemergence of the term Lügenpresse has led to considerable self-reflection and bolstering of the institutional myth of journalism to counter the lack of trust.",Journalism Under Attack,Journalism Studies

More precisely, given the diverging interests confronting the Berlinale as a platform for the global film community, a quantitative program analysis of the festival’s most significant sections (Competition, Panorama, Forum, Generation, Perspective German Cinema, Lola@Berlinale) from 1980 to 2016 was conducted. The findings demonstrate that even good-faith efforts to strengthen domestic filmmaking in terms of weight and diversity hardly changed the power structures, which underlie the curatorial decisions.

I argue that journalists’ practice of listening is central to how they interpret and, in turn, represent American confederate Flag activists as political actors. I develop the concept of paraxaeological regimentation to more closely engage the ways that recording technologies structure how journalists and activists alike listen through – rather than to – people and events. Journalists’ listening practices, foreclosed by political economic and technological constraints, become lodged in the sensorial experiences of activists protesting at the nexus of race, nation, and the senses. Ultimately, journalists’ and activists’ concern with a multimodality dominated by the visual displaces the sensorial work of political change, resulting in an objectification of the field of political action.",Visual and Immersive Technologies in the News: Potentials and Perils,Journalism Studies

In order to reconstruct this metadiscourse, we conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 11 editors (who self-described as editor-in-chief, photo/video editor-in-chief, or online editor in-chief) holding leading positions at major news organizations in Flanders, Belgium (both broadcast, print, and online). Findings were integrated with those of a qualitative content analysis of a purposive sample of op-eds, columns, commentaries, etc. appearing across different media types and platforms. Located at the intersection of academic perspectives on media and terrorism, professional journalistic identity and journalistic cultures, and photojournalism and graphicness, the present study aims to demonstrate how the case of Islamic State visual propaganda sets off a complex and at times ambiguous negotiation of different considerations and (self-)conceptions, in the process exemplifying journalism relational nature, problematizing the idea of a ‘symbiotic’ relationship between news media and terrorists, and contributing to understanding the workings of journalistic ideology and metajournalism. The paper distinguishes between three positions, described as 'containment', 'confrontation', and 'constructiveness', which are elaborated and connected to journalistic ideology/values, and metajournalistic discursive repertoires identified in earlier research on UGC.",Visual and Immersive Technologies in the News: Potentials and Perils,Journalism Studies

We investigated visibility in a Finnish organization following a transition to open workspace and workers’ perceptions of their organizational identity and organizational identification. Drawing on interview and open-ended survey data, we found that the increased exposure to others and company branding found in open workspaces made workers’ organizational identity salient and enhanced their attachment to the organization. Visibility afforded workers to feel equal as the open workspaces highlighted the similarities between workers’ facilities, which in turn increased their organizational identification. However, visibility was also a constraint as it exposed how some workers’ roles tethered them to their desks, limiting their use of space and diminishing their feelings of value and organizational identity.

However, this community experienced a rupture, rendering it suddenly visible to the very people from whom it was trying to hide. Findings from community posts in reaction to this rupture suggest that organizations first engage in a process of sensemaking, then attempt to manage hiddenness through both individual and collective actions. As hiddenness was threatened at multiple levels, hiddenness was in turn managed at multiple levels.

Typically, we assume that increased information visibility will translate into high levels of organizational transparency, but as a field we lack empirical evidence to support this assumption. Our ability to gather data on this important topic is limited because there have been few reliable ways to assess visibility. To remedy this problem, we develop and validate The Attributes of Visibility Scale to measure the core aspects of visibility. We then employ the scale to test the relationship between visibility and transparency. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the scale and consider the limitations and further research possibilities that the scale construction and validation suggest.",Visibility and Hiddenness in Organizing Contexts,Organizational Communication
2018-0232,2018,Paper Session,"Dark Communication and Shadowy Places: Bullying, Abuse, and Harassment as Linked in Four Key Ways to Hidden Organizations",1,"This paper examines bullying, abuse, and harassment as they relate in four key ways to what are called hidden organizations—those where the identity of the collective and/or its members is communicatively concealed from key audiences. These four linkages include two where the hidden organization is the perpetrator of these destructive communication behaviors, either internally to its own members or externally to various other individuals and organizations. The third linkage suggests hidden organizations may be targets of bullying, abuse, or harassment because of their practices. Finally, some hidden organizations may provide refuge to members escaping these destructive communication practices in other aspects of their lives. Research supporting these different linkages comes from several types of hidden organizations: secret societies, cults, hate groups, organized crime (including gangs), terrorist and counter-terrorist groups, organizations engaged in dirty work, anonymous support groups, hacktivist organizations, and the informal economy.",Visibility and Hiddenness in Organizing Contexts,Organizational Communication

Taking the perspective of media ecology, this paper saw the Internet as a context and explored its impacts on social context in which national identity is formed. Using the data from the World Values Survey, this paper carried out multilevel analyses with 47,078 respondents in 33 countries. The results illustrate how online distribution of information, power, and freedom affect cognition, affection, and action of national identity. National identity is eroded by information distribution and freedom distribution but is restored by power distribution. Power distribution and freedom distribution work together to neutralize and regulate the moderating effects of information distribution.",The Power of Culture: Differences Across Countries and Similarities Over Time in Internet Practices and Perceptions,Communication and Technology

However, empirical evidence to test the actual preference of users is lacking. In this paper, we test this hypothesis through an online experiment comparing three websites: two discussion forums featuring responses either by other users or by the site administrator, and a frequently asked question site that served as a control condition. Our findings indicate collectivism does not moderate the relationship between website format and user preference. We also found evidence of a main effect of website format where users prefer peer-to-peer sharing on discussion forums over expert opinion. Nevertheless, users still prefer a more traditional website for information acquisition.",The Power of Culture: Differences Across Countries and Similarities Over Time in Internet Practices and Perceptions,Communication and Technology

App-usage similarity (AUS) evaluates the commonality of digital media consumption between two regional app markets. Built on network analysis techniques, the final sample consists of 93 countries across the world and the 2000 most frequently used apps in each country. Four AUS networks are created: iOS free apps, iOS paid apps, Android free apps, and Android paid apps. Further statistical analyses have been done according to the generated matrices of geo-linguistic cultural distances and AUS networks. The results show that linguistic barrier is the most prominent predictor of the app-usage similarity between countries.

2018-0238,2018,Paper Session,"Making Sense of Credibility in Complex Information Environments: The Role of Message Sidedness, Information Source, and Thinking Styles",3,"Online sources now routinely vary with regard to the degree to which information originates from expert-generated, user-generated, or hybrid sources. Moreover, although two-sided messages may provide a more comprehensive overview on debated issues, the conditions under which people favor two-sided over one-sided content are not well understood. An experiment conducted on a random sample of U.S. Internet users in the context of online information repositories—specifically online encyclopedias—is designed to understand how message sidedness and type of information source (i.e., whether information is expert-generated, user-generated, or a combination of these) affect perceived credibility of the information, and how individuals’ levels of need for cognition and flexible thinking moderate these relationships. Results show that expert-generated and two-sided entries are regarded as more credible and that message sidedness is particularly influential when information comes from hybrid sources and among readers with high levels of flexible thinking.",Credibility Assessments in Online Environments,Communication and Technology

To address this question, an experiment (N = 504) compared how user comments and direct quotes in the news article affect perceived public opinion and news evaluation. Although the content was identical, participants were more likely to infer the internet users’ opinion from the user comments than the direct quotes, which subsequently shaped their perception of public opinion. Such effects were, in part, due to better recognition of the user comments. On the other hand, those who read the news article containing direct quotes judged it to be more representative of public opinion, and thereby, of higher quality, but such effects were limited to those with greater self-assessed issue knowledge.",Credibility Assessments in Online Environments,Communication and Technology

Yet few studies have examined how people evaluate image credibility. This paper details a large-scale online experiment using Amazon Mechanical Turk that probes how people react to and evaluate image credibility in various online platforms. We ran a series of six between-subjects experiments, each of which randomly assigned participants one of 28 news-source mockups featuring a fake image, and asked participants to evaluate its credibility based on various features. We found most social and heuristic cues of online credibility, such as source trustworthiness, bandwagon, and intermediary trustworthiness had no significant impact on evaluation. Viewers’ Internet skills, photo editing experience, and social media use were significant predictors of image credibility evaluation. Viewers’ favorable attitude towards the issue depicted in the image also positively predicts their credibility rating.",Credibility Assessments in Online Environments,Communication and Technology

It allows to discover groups of closely connected actors in large networks and therefore to identify similarities or even areas of cooperation. Although ever more communication scientists study hyperlink networks to learn about the connections between civil society actors online, there is a lack of consensus on how to handle this task in a theoretically appropriate manner. We develop a typology of the social phenomena communities of hyperlinked actors are taken to signify – topical similarities, ideological associations, strategic alliances, and potential user traffic – and offer recommendations for community detection grounded in these concepts. Testing procedures on a real-world hyperlink network of the food safety movement, we show that the handling of tie directions and weights as well as the choice of algorithm have a major influence on the communities ultimately detected in such a network.",Network Analysis,Computational Methods

Network Analyses of Two Counter-Message Campaigns on YouTube,4,"By personalized recommendations, algorithms influence the selection—and recep-tion—of content on YouTube. That is, for instance, through mutual tags or topics, harm-ful/violent/problematic content can be recommended together with harmless content and thereby dilute boundaries between distinct or even contradictory categories of videos. In par-ticular, in the realm of extremism and countering attempts, it seems necessary to ask to what extent these algorithms have an impact on the interrelatedness of counter-message and propa-ganda videos, and how they affect the likelihood for users of counter-message videos to come across videos with problematic content. By means of two exemplary information network analyses based on videos of two counter-message campaigns we demonstrated that that ex-tremist content may be closely—or even directly—connected with these videos. The results hint at the challenges of YouTube’s recommendation system for users and, therefore, the problematic role of automated algorithms in the context of counter-message campaigns.",Network Analysis,Computational Methods
2018-0245,2018,Paper Session,Higher-Order Communication Processes on Social Media: A Case Study of Australian Politics on Twitter (#auspol),2,"Network analysis of Twitter often involves conceptualising Twitter users as network nodes and actions such as reply, mention, retweet or follow as network edges. Networks involving hashtags can also be constructed, for example, two-mode networks with directed edges from Twitter users to the hashtags they have used in tweets, or semantic networks showing links between hashtags based on co-occurrence in tweets. In this paper we adapt recent methods in higher-order networks to the study of communication processes on Twitter in the context of Australian politics, using a dataset of #auspol Tweets collected over a period of one year. We show that the implicit Markov assumption of conventional first-order networks does not adequately represent the higher-order dependencies that underpin hashtags as a complex system of communication. In other words, representing higher-order dependencies between hashtags significantly reconfigures our understanding of the communication process as a complex network.",Network Analysis,Computational Methods

Informed by several theoretical frameworks on cultural consumption, this study examines the co-consumption network formed by animation’s protagonists, such that an edge is established between two protagonists if they are consumed by the same audience. This network, including 169 nodes and 837 edges, was derived from a nationally representative survey implemented in mainland China in 2016. Social network analysis revealed that the important positions of the co-consumption network—those with high degree centrality and betweenness centrality—were overwhelmingly male protagonists in animations adapted from ancient Chinese fairy tales and produced domestically, along with Japanese animations and classic American animations. An exponential random graph model revealed that the year of production was the only mechanism of co-consumption, compared with other node-level characteristics.",Network Analysis,Computational Methods
2018-0247,2018,Paper Session,What Counts as a Weak Tie? A Comparison of Thresholding Techniques to Analyze Weighted Networks,2,"Networks helps us map patterns of communication. The nodes in social networks often represent social actors, and the ties represent interactions or relationships between them. The weight of the ties can give us further information about the strength of the communication exchange between two nodes. Analysis of these weighted networks can help us differentiate between strong and weak ties, and the different roles they play in processes like the diffusion of information. And yet, what counts as a weak tie? How do we define the weight threshold that allows us to distinguish ties in terms of their relative strength? This paper examines three approaches previously used in literature that have, so far, never been compared in a systematic manner. Our goal is to assess the impact that different thresholding rules have on network topology – and to determine which method offers the most appropriate filtering mechanism in different substantive contexts.",Network Analysis,Computational Methods

This paper uses rare recordings of the series to explore the program’s topical and ideological concerns and examines the unexpected queer, lavender-tinged quality that male participation and vocal performances sometimes gave to an instrument of Cold War geopolitics dedicated to fostering transatlantic cultural solidarities between Americans and the French.","Radio Voices: Cultures, Networks, and Ideologies",Communication History

By establishing “a composite system” to counter the Marconi Company’s drive toward an integrated global radio network and erecting stations to connect the mainland to U.S. territories, the Navy Department was on its way to establishing autonomy of communications.

The present research examined the role of personality factors with regard to players’ preference for violent video games using a novel brief and uni-dimensional self-report measure. A scale of five items was administrated in two studies that involved 292 and 180 respondents, respectively. The same scale with two additional items was presented to 190 respondents in the third study, which included measures revealed by prior research to be relevant for understanding violent video game motivation and preference. More specifically, we measured participants’ trait aggression, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and empathy. In line with other findings in the literature, results obtained with our self-report measure indicated that players with a propensity for games featuring violent themes show callous, impulsive, and exploitive attributes. The findings are important with regard to future research on video games that should focus more on the players and their gaming motivation than on the effects of playing alone.","Anti-Social Scientists, on Some Dark-Side Topics",Game Studies

We describe a novel exploratory study investigating the use of longitudinal diary methods for understanding the everyday experiences of new and experienced players within a massively multiplayer online game, Team Fortress 2. Participants (N = 38) completed diaries about their gameplay and negative social interactions in the environment such as trash talking and harassment. Several prominent themes emerged: frustrating play, performance as motivator, and four subsets of negative interaction: skill disparagement, reporting differences, toxic masculinity, and vicious cycles. Some findings supported previous research but provide additional insights on potential mechanisms or boundary conditions, such as players’ skill and previous experience. Other findings question the generalizability of previous research conducted in settings with low ecological validity. We discuss the use of diary methods for researching video games.","Anti-Social Scientists, on Some Dark-Side Topics",Game Studies

We argue that the opponent’s formidability can affect how players interpret violent encounters and their experience of performing violence. A 2 (opponent size) x 2 (opponent strength) x 2(games) experiment was conducted to examine the effects of opponent formidability on player competence, guilt, and post-game affect. The results showed that there was an interaction effect between size and strength on competence and guilt. Players experienced more competence and less guilt when encountering big and strong opponents, or small and weak opponents. Guilt mediated formidability and post-game affect while competence did not. The effects of formidability on competence and guilt diminished with repeated exposure to video game violence. The finds have theoretical implications for understanding how players perceive and experience violent actions in video games.","Anti-Social Scientists, on Some Dark-Side Topics",Game Studies

They use this space to form communities, relationships and identities. However, online sexual harassment is a serious issue besetting the gaming community that has kept many women away from such hostile environment. We conducted a replication and extension of a previous study that found that hostile sexism and social dominance orientation were predictors of sexual harassment perpetration in online video games. A nationally representative sample of 856 Germans who play video games participated in an anonymous online survey. In addition to replicating the past findings, we have found additional predictors, machiavellianism, psychopathy, and gamer identification predicted higher sexual harassment perpetration. These results have important implications for the gaming community’s role in curtailing sexual harassment and making itself a more welcoming and inclusive community.","Anti-Social Scientists, on Some Dark-Side Topics",Game Studies

These two frameworks can give wearers and scholars alike ways of thinking beyond the value of wearing as an activity that tracks “objective” data about bodies or helps wearers conform to fixed categories and methods of identification. A rhetorical understanding of wearing ought, we argue, to look beyond this reductive calculus. By naming and defining the logics and practices of screened and diffractive wearing, we aim to energize a conversation about wearable rhetorics that is capable of extending prior discussions of our interactions with wearable devices by enabling an understanding of the limitations of the preset identifications made available by the logic of what we term screened wearing as well as the inventional opportunities of wearables in particular rhetorical situations enabled by diffractive wearing.",Mobile Innovation and Advertising,Mobile Communication

It included the motivations for news consumption, varied uses of news, and perceptions toward news in order to look at individuals’ willingness to accept news as a paid service. Using data from a national sample in South Korea (N = 706), the study found that the motivation of surveillance was negatively associated with the perception toward paid news and intention to purchase paid news service.

To test the hypotheses, 985,042 customer-store purchase transactions were obtained from a large shopping mall operator in East Asia. The study uses an instrumental variable technique to develop a causal research design.

Building on 17 months of fieldwork with the parade organizing board, this paper asks what affects SP parade organizers circulate in interaction with varied actors including anti-gay protestors, supportive Euro-American embassies, LGBTQ participants critical of the KQCF, and a Korean government hesitant to support LGBTQ rights. This paper investigates how affects enact in organizers’ sense-making of themselves and other actors, disrupting senses of belonging to the SP organizing board, queer community, and the nation-state. The ethnographic analysis of affective labor closely navigates queer people’s collective sense-making in their everyday practices that neither conform to, nor refuse, political power. By complicating affective labor with a special attention to the bad feelings produced in such labor practices, this paper provides intersectional understandings of affective labor and queer collectivity.","Suppression and Empowerment: Media, LGBTQ Rights, and Activism","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Through an analysis of a sample of underground newspapers, it highlights how the American counterculture thought of technology in a prevalently negative way. It identifies three negative discourses: technology of war, technology of capitalism, technology of repression. These three views are effectively condensed into the famous expression attributed to Huey P. Newton: “the spirit of the people is greater than the Man’s technology”, whose meaning and diffusion is traced throughout the sample. Two, more marginal, views – technology for abundance and technology for revolution – are also analyzed.

2018-0268,2018,Paper Session,A Tocquevillian Assessment of a Tool to Promote Monitorial Citizenship in Brazil,1,"The MIT Center for Civic Media (civic.mit.edu) has developed a system called Promise Tracker (www.promisetracker.org) comprised by a Web platform and a mobile app that help citizens to keep track of promises made by government officials during campaign season in order to hold them accountable for their commitments. The system has been tested in different cities of Brazil. The stated goal of this social technology is to promote the engagement of ordinary citizens in the political life of their communities between election cycles.
This paper reflects on the premises and preliminary results of this experience using Alexis de Tocqueville’s insights about the early development of democracy in America. For him, democracy was not a mere political system, but first and foremost a social state that stemmed from the egalitarian trend in Modernity and that encompassed all dimensions of communal life. His rich view of democracy is used here to explain and evaluate the aforementioned experience to engage civil society and broaden the public dialogue in Brazilian cities with the aid of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).",Civic Tech and the Politics of Technology,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

It illustrates how youthful online practices of sharing personal stories, news coverage, links, photos, memes, videos and other artifacts of political engagement that constitute ""connective journalism"" can help young people create and share narratives about their personal experiences and concerns which, in turn, allow them to see themselves as members of larger publics and counterpublics of people facing similar experiences and grievances.

A Case Study of Journalists’ Discursive Strategies for Rationalizing ‘Brand Propaganda’ Within the Chinese Local Press Industry,2,"The failure of China’s local press industry in increasing market profits and re-seizing advantages within the domain of information communication has rendered it more dependent on the local government’s financial support. A major form of this support is called ‘brand propaganda’. This study adopts a bottom-up perspective, exploring the local journalists’ reaction to ‘brand propaganda’, typically how they engage in such activities and rationalize their behaviors discursively so as to attain a better understanding of the effect of professionalism on China’s journalistic reform. In-depth interviews are adopted with the press industry of Fujian Province as the case of analysis to answer the questions of how the local journalists respond to and think of the administrative order of ‘brand propaganda’.","Power, Resistance, Professonalism, and Internationalization in China's Media Industries",Media Industry Studies
2018-0272,2018,Paper Session,Discursive Activism: How Independent Booksellers in China Resist and Exercise Independence,1,"Even in the digital age, institutions like bookshops still play a significant role in the intellectual, public and political life of society. The rise of online booksellers like Amazon may have changed the ways in which physical booksellers play such role, bookshops as important social and public institutions, however, remain pertinent to social progress and public good. Researchers have found that independent booksellers in Western liberal democracies have a long history of participating in and promoting progressive social, literary or political movements and collective action of various kinds. Little, however, is known about the relationship between booksellers and activism in societies of an authoritarian nature. This paper fills this gap by examining how independent booksellers in China engage in 'activism'. It argues that while the government's surveillance and control in the book industry prevents the independents from performing action-based activism, through the activities of selecting books and decorating stores, independent booksellers can exercise text-based, or discursive, resistance/activism on a day-to-day basis.","Power, Resistance, Professonalism, and Internationalization in China's Media Industries",Media Industry Studies

The “Internationalization” of Alibaba,1,"This paper studies the “internationalization” of Alibaba as a case to illuminate the complex state-capital interactions that have structured the development of China’s web industry. Drawing on the digital capitalism literature, it takes a comprehensive approach to conceptualize the “internationalization” of Chinese web companies, which includes not only physical expansion beyond home base, but also various complex forms of interactions with transnational capital within the Chinese border. By delineating, documenting and assessing Alibaba’s evolution in the past 15 years, it argues that instead of being confined to a repressive inward-looking national “intranet,” China in fact has actively engaged with the global Internet since the early development of its web economy – and is now increasingly projecting power outward. As a China-based Internet company enmeshed deeply in global digital capitalism, Alibaba’s intricate global trajectory embodies a battlefield where the state and transnational capital have wrestled for the mastery of China’s digital economy.","Power, Resistance, Professonalism, and Internationalization in China's Media Industries",Media Industry Studies
2018-0275,2018,Paper Session,Fertility-Related Couple Communication and Shared Decision-Making Among Couples in Nepal: Qualitative and Quantitative Findings,3,"Couple communication and joint decision-making are widely recommended in the reproductive health literature as vital aspects of fertility management. Yet, most studies rely on women’s reports to measure couple concordance. Moreover, the association between communication and decision-making is often assumed yet rarely studied. Arguably, associations between dyadic communication and shared decision-making constitute a missing link in our understanding of how communication affects fertility-related practices. Informed by Carey’s theory of transmission and ritual communication, this study sought to address those gaps. Survey results from 809 couples demonstrated statistically significant correlations between concordant communication and concordant decision-making. Sixty in-depth interviews provided insight into both discordant and concordant interactions, revealing that decision-making, even if concordant, is not necessarily linear and is often complex.",Health Communication in Familial Relationships,Health Communication

In contrast, the theory of planned behavior has often been criticized as lacking in utility. To address these gaps, we integrated interpersonal constructs – the concepts of active parental guidance (e.g. nutrition education) and restrictive parental guidance (e.g. rule-setting) – as antecedents to the original theory of planned behavior (TPB) variables in predicting child fruits and vegetables (FV) consumption. We surveyed 210 child/adolescent participants, aged between 10 and 16 in Singapore. Results from structural equation modelling showed that the extended TPB model displayed acceptable fit. Parental active guidance was found to be associated with all three TPB variables, while restrictive guidance was found to be associated with intention to consume FV. Our results suggest that there are promising contributions to the theory of planned behavior by extending it with interpersonal antecedents.",Health Communication in Familial Relationships,Health Communication

2018-0278,2018,Paper Session,A Multiple Goals Perspective on Motivating Weight Management Messages in Interpersonal Relationships,2,"A model of motivational support, consisting of expressing person-centered messages, dissolving misconceptions, affirming self-efficacy, and inviting action has been validated within the weight management context for middle-aged and older adults. This study examines if motivational support messages are effective in weight management because they address multiple communication goals. Using multiple goals theory, motivational support messages that were person-centered, self-affirming, focused on handling misconceptions or that called the other to act, were each theorized to best satisfy a message recipient’s instrumental, relational, and identity goals. Employing a message perception paradigm, participants evaluated weight management messages. Initial tests confirmed a multiple goals account for motivational messages high in person-centeredness, self-affirmation, or that combined message dimensions. Dissolving misconceptions were associated with relational goals, but not instrumental or identity goals; call to action messages did not function as expected. Implications of the findings are discussed with reference to motivational support in weight management.",Health Communication in Familial Relationships,Health Communication
2018-0279,2018,Paper Session,Assessment of Parental Responsiveness Under Chinese Culture,2,"Parental responsiveness is a core construct that will influence the parent-child interaction and children’s socialization. However, the existing instruments of parental responsiveness tend to mix the construct with other relevant concepts and ignore the communication nature of parental responsiveness. Meanwhile, the instruments are established mainly based on the Western population. How it works for the Chinese cultural context remains unclear. Filling these gaps, this study intends to propose a reliable parental responsiveness instrument, which is not only based on a China-specific conceptualization process but also explain the cultural differences via observable parenting behaviors. Total 296 parents and 226 children from mainland China were enrolled in. Factor analysis was conducted to test the instrument validation and reliability. The findings highlighted how communication pattern could influence responsive parenting behaviors.

2018-0280,2018,Paper Session,Social Drinking on Social Media: A Content Analysis of the Social Aspects of Alcohol-Related Posts on Facebook and Instagram,4,"Alcohol is often consumed in social contexts. An emerging social context in which alcohol is becoming increasingly apparent is social media. Young people increasingly display alcohol-related posts (“alcoholposts”) on social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Considering the importance of social aspects for both alcohol consumption as well as social media use, the current study investigated (1) the social content of alcoholposts (i.e., the evaluative social context and presence of people) and (2) social processes (i.e., the posting of and reactions to posts) involved with alcoholposts on social networking sites. An extensive content analysis of Facebook and Instagram-profiles (N = 192) showed that the alcoholposts of youth frequently depicted alcohol in a positive social context and displayed people holding drinks. In addition, alcoholposts were more often placed on participants’ timelines by others (i.e., by tagging) than they were posted by participants themselves. Furthermore, it was revealed that such social posts received more likes and comments than non-social posts (e.g., in which no people were visible). Thus, both in terms of content as well as processes, alcoholposts on social media are social in nature, and a part of young people’s everyday social lives. Interventions aiming to decrease alcoholposts should therefore focus on the broad social context of individuals in which posting about alcohol takes place.",Media and Social Factors in Shaping Alcohol-Related Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication
2018-0281,2018,Paper Session,The Impact of Alcohol Brand Appearances on Facebook on Purchase Intention,4,"Numerous studies indicate that portrayals of alcohol consumption on social media impact viewers’ alcohol behaviors. However, to date, no study has taken into consideration that alcohol posts can be delivered in different forms, i.e., as paid advertisements, brand posts, or user-generated content. We conducted an experimental study presenting different Facebook posts, manipulating the source of embedded alcohol brand posts. Furthermore, we manipulated participants’ involvement level for viewing the Facebook posts. In line with the Persuasion Knowledge Model, we found that user-generated content did not trigger persuasion knowledge and consequently a negative affective reaction to the persuasive intent. Thus, user-generated content led to higher purchasing intention than paid advertisements or brand posts. Surprisingly, involvement did not significantly moderate this effect. These results suggest that policy makers should consider educating consumers about the effects of user-generated alcohol posts encouraged by alcohol companies.",Media and Social Factors in Shaping Alcohol-Related Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

The present study implemented an alcohol-prevention program via a naturalistic pretest-posttest experiment with college freshman in a classroom setting (N = 231 matched cases). This study’s conceptual framework is guided by the constructs of theory of planned behavior, outcome expectancies, and social norms in relation to the context of the college effect and developmental alcoholism. Results show that social drinking attitudes, proximal drinking norm and drinking outcome expectancies are significant predictors of pre- and post-intervention episodic drinking frequency. The intervention was successful in reducing episodic drinking frequency as well as perceived distal and proximal drinking norms. It did not change drinking attitudes, perceived efficacy or outcome expectancies as expected.",Media and Social Factors in Shaping Alcohol-Related Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

Intervention opportunities can be more successful with an understanding of the factors that lead to alcohol consumption at specific times on particular celebrations. This study investigated the factors that led to celebration drinking at 2 PM, 6 PM, and 10 PM on St. Patrick’s Day (SPD). Those factors included perceived descriptive and injunctive norms, the numbers of close friends and acquaintances present, social media relationships, demographic variables, and past drinking behavior and intent to drink on SPD at the three time points of interest. Findings show that different patterns of variables predict drinking at the different time points, and intervention suggestions are offered.",Media and Social Factors in Shaping Alcohol-Related Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication

The present study examined factors that contribute to college students’ intentions to sexually coerce. An online experiment was conducted with 1208 students from a large Northwestern university. In the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to two conditions in which they were exposed to alcohol advertisements that included either objectified images of women or non-objectified images of women. In addition to examining the effects of exposure to objectified women in alcohol advertisements, this study also investigated the potential effects of gender stereotypes, wishful identification of alcohol ads, perceived realism of alcohol ads, and sex-related alcohol expectancies on students’ intentions to coerce. The regression analyses suggest that gender stereotypes, exposure to alcohol advertisements, wishful identification with models in alcohol advertisements, and perceived realism of alcohol advertisements are associated with intentions to coerce. Implications of these findings are also discussed.",Media and Social Factors in Shaping Alcohol-Related Attitudes and Behaviors,Health Communication
2018-0285,2018,Paper Session,Conflict Framing in the News Media and Informal Political Discussion,2,"Considering that citizens discussing politics is a fundamental part of democratic life, we know surprisingly little about what triggers informal political discussions. We posit that exposure to conflict news framing increases political discussion frequency, as it provides reasons for citizens to discuss politics. We further posit that this effect is moderated by citizens’ orientation toward conflicts. This especially counts in public and social media settings, where reactions of themselves and others are less predictable than in private settings. We study this based on a news content analysis and a longitudinal five-wave panel survey (n=2,061) capturing informal political discussions in public, social media, and private settings. Generally, the results support our expectation that exposure to conflict framing increase political discussions frequency conditioned by conflict avoidance and the specific settings. Thus understanding the triggers of informal political discussions call for attention towards specific media content, individual motivational characteristics, and the social setting.",The Effects of Incivility and Conflict Framing,Political Communication

Conceptualizing Uncivil and Intolerant Discourse in Online Political Talk,1,"This paper takes up the popular argument that much online discussion is toxic and hence harmful to democracy. I offer a more nuanced theory by arguing that uncivil discourse, where people express their perspectives with foul language and antinormative intensity, should be understood as a rhetorical act. The true threat to democracy is intolerant discourse where groups of people or individuals are attacked in ways that threaten democratic pluralism. The validity of this theoretical model is demonstrated in the context of public comments in a wide range of political news in two different platforms – news websites and social media. Results demonstrate that incivility and intolerance can be meaningfully distinguished. While incivility is associated with desirable discussion features, such as justified opinion expression and engagement with disagreement, intolerance is likely to occur in discussions about minorities and civil society – exactly when it can hurt democracy the most.",The Effects of Incivility and Conflict Framing,Political Communication

In this study, we proposed a ""echoslamming"" mechanism to illustrate the way in which online incivility is the missing link. From a Hong Kong-based Facebook Pages post-sharing network within which politically-organized communities were gathered, a random sample of 1,200 posts shared between and with-in those like-minded communities were manually coded their incivility. The targets of offense in the uncivil contents were also extracted. The results found that contents shared within like-minded communities were more likely to be uncivil than cross-communities messages. The targets of attack were usually political opponents who were excluded from within-community discussions. Based on our findings, we suggest ""echoslamming"" is an online activity in which uncivil contents were distributed exclusively among like-minded information sources to attack political opponents and as a result reinforces in-group members’ predilection or prejudice.",The Effects of Incivility and Conflict Framing,Political Communication
2018-0288,2018,Paper Session,The Effects of Political Incivility in News Coverage on Citizens’ Political Engagement via Cognitive and Affective Responses,2,"Prior research has found that exposure to uncivil negative media content can cause both mobilizing and demobilizing effects. Yet, it is unclear if other negative features of media content (e.g., disagreement and conflict) yield different results and what the underlying affective and cognitive processes are. This study, based on an experiment (N= 392), provides empirical evidence that disagreement, conflict and incivility are three unique features of media content and can be theoretically - and empirically - distinguished. The findings show that uncivil media content has the strongest demobilizing effects on political engagement (i.e., political efficacy, cynicism, behavioral intention) compared to conflict and disagreement. These effects are mediated by both affective (i.e., emotions and arousal) and cognitive responses (i.e., message processing and recall). Citizens exposed to uncivil news perceived less sense of competence and influence in politics, were more cynical and had less intentions to participate in politics.",The Effects of Incivility and Conflict Framing,Political Communication

How Conflict Framing Mobilizes Citizens to Participate Politically,2,"The news media’s ability to mobilize citizens to participate politically by emphasizing elite disagreement over politics is not well understood. We posit that when politics is framed along the lines of a conflict between different opinions, citizens may gain knowledge about politics. We further posit that whether they translate this knowledge into political participation is conditioned by their orientation towards conflicts. Politics involves conflictual elements; when you engage in politics there is always someone fighting for another stand than yours. Thus, less conflict avoidant individuals more frequently participate politically than those highly conflict avoidant individuals. To test our argument, a content analysis of news media coverage and a three-wave panel survey were conducted (n=2,061). Generally, results show support for our expectation about the effect of exposure to conflict framing on (changes in) political participation is positively mediated by knowledge and that this effect is further moderated by conflict avoidance.",The Effects of Incivility and Conflict Framing,Political Communication
2018-0290,2018,Paper Session,"Digital Media Experiments in China: ""Revolutionizing Persuasion Under Xi",2,"This article engages with transformations in media politics under Xi Jinping through the lens of digital propaganda. While recent studies underscore media crackdown as the key policy under Xi, the party’s large-scale media digitalization experiment aimed at recapturing public opinion online, has thus far been largely absent in the analyses. This study examines this experiment: the emergence of the Shanghai-based model, a digital-only news outlet, Pengpai, and its diffusion across different regional contexts in China. We argue that the synergy between local-level officials and media entrepreneurs has facilitated Pengpai’s emergence as a model in digital journalism. We further demonstrate that while a cross-national attempt at diffusion of this model has been made, it achieved ambivalent results due to a number of factors, including superficial commitment by local officials and media professionals. These findings question the authoritarian resilience paradigm in thinking about propaganda in contemporary China, and demonstrate that decentralized experimentation is a volatile approach in the sphere of media policy.",Propaganda and Information in China,Political Communication

It argues official live broadcast of court trials serves three main purposes to sustain the legitimacy and continued domination of the Chinese Communist Party. Analyses of two cases – the trials surrounding QvodPlayer and the ex-leader Bo Xilai – reveal how the pre-designed order of power is arranged, wrapped up, and exhibited as the official live broadcasting becomes surveillance footages of courts’ daily working routine, and how potential agency could be brought when ordinary netizens poach and rephrase the official live stream thereby turning a decent court into a real-time power arena.

Extant studies about mediated diffusion suffer shortcomings of “one-medium bias” and “one-way transmission bias”. Following a tradition of holistic analysis which sees media infrastructure as media ecologies for social protests, a spatial Durbin approach is taken to generate insights into different impacts of three media modes—the number of newspaper and magazine subscribed, the popularization rate of broadband subscribers of Internet, as well as long-distance telecommunications—on the dissemination of industrial strikes. A 31×5 panel data of labor protests is used, which covering strikes occurred in 31 administrative units in mainland China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) during 2011-2015.

Why do they do so? What does the term democracy mean in an authoritarian political language? This research uses a computer-assisted text analytical approach illustrating how an authoritarian government strategically manipulates the discourse about democracy to benefit itself. By analyzing 1,371,607 political articles in China over 58 years, the study shows a refocusing framing strategy, in which the Chinese government defines democracy not with regime justification but with national policy priorities while denoting democracy most frequently alongside liberal values. With this strategy, the democracy discourse can masquerade as consistent with liberal values in Western democracies but work for the preservation of the authoritarian regime by convincing the masses who are aware of popular conceptions of democracy.",Propaganda and Information in China,Political Communication
2018-0294,2018,Paper Session,Getting the Hamster off the Wheel: The Search for Meaningful Media Effects Research,1,"While new media literature is often criticized for atheoretical research, scholars often overlook problems within the media effects field that contribute to this lack of theory. Over the last 60-70 years, mass communication literature has proposed hundreds of effects, produced a vast amount of research, and developed into a variety of subfields (Nabi & Oliver, 2009; Potter and Riddle, 2007; Perse & Lambe, 2016; Sparks, 2015). Yet, it has largely failed to answer fundamental questions (Lang, 2013; Potter, 2011). The purpose of this paper is to identify the current paradigmatic theory of measurement, validity, and psychometrics, which confound epistemology and ontology, as the fundamental mechanism stalling the field. This paper will evidence the crisis in media effects research, review the problematic paradigmatic theories, and propose the need to incorporate advances in theory of measurement, validity, and psychometrics.","Revisiting the Concept of Media, Public, Effects",Mass Communication

Yet, individual-level evidence is still lacking to gain further insights in the mechanisms underlying these effects and to disentangle which exact dimensions of consumer confidence are susceptible to the effects of media tone. Building on media dependency theory, we differentiate empirically between sociotropic, egocentric, prospective and retrospective economic perceptions as separate consumer confidence dimensions. We combined the results of a large manual content analysis (n = 5,630) with data from a three-wave panel survey containing repeated measurements of consumer confidence among members of the general population (n = 4,301). Findings demonstrate that the effects on consumer confidence, in general, are largely the result of media effects on sociotropic and prospective economic perceptions. Egocentric and retrospective economic perceptions, by contrast, were not significantly influenced by the economic news that citizens consumed.","Revisiting the Concept of Media, Public, Effects",Mass Communication

Using Word Value Survey data from around 4900 individual respondents in 29 countries, as well as annual public reports describing and grading national characters, this study explores how the media system features and individual’s media exposure work jointly to affect individual national identity in a globalization context. An overall analysis of globalization, mass media diffusion, media control and individual media exposure predicting individual national identity suggests that globalization and mass media diffusion reduce national identity while media control and individual exposure to mass media indicate positive contribution. At the individual level, the positive influence of mass media exposure indicates the function of mass media to promote national identity. At the macro-level, the general negative influence of mass media diffusion indicates that increasing amounts of media channels do not necessarily guarantee the expansion of this function. In contrast, media diffusion could be interpreted as information variety, harming certain issue-specific outcome such as national identity.","Revisiting the Concept of Media, Public, Effects",Mass Communication

The Longitudinal Relation Between Adolescents’ Involvement With and Viewing Frequency of Reality TV,2,"Reality TV is a genre that fascinates both viewers and scholars. Extant research used a cross-sectional approach to investigate the relationship between involvement with reality TV and viewing frequency. Remarkably, existing research on involvement with reality TV was carried out among young adults, but not among its most frequent consumers: adolescents. To better understand this demographics’ viewing motivations, and the causal link between reality TV viewing and involvement, we conducted a longitudinal survey among 392 adolescents aged 15 to 17. We found that reality TV viewing increased involvement: Viewing frequency at Time 1 positively predicted adolescents’ narrative engagement, parasocial interaction, emotional empathy, merging with characters, wishful identification, perceived realism, and enjoyment at Time 2 (six months later). A question for future research is whether adolescents’ involvement with reality TV content is associated with an increased risk for experiencing its known adverse effects, for instance, on body dissatisfaction, materialism, and aggression.","Children, Adolescence, and Parental Mediation",Mass Communication

A meta-analysis was conducted using 52 empirical studies on parental mediation, which represented a total sample of 72,024 participants and yielded 122 independent correlations. The results indicated that restrictive mediation was more effective than active mediation in decreasing the amount of time children spend on media, whereas the effects of active mediation and co-using were greater than restrictive mediation in reducing the incidence of media-related risks. According to the moderator analyses, age, risk type, medium, and culture significantly moderated the effects of active and restrictive mediation in reducing the amount of media use and the incidence of media-related risks.","Children, Adolescence, and Parental Mediation",Mass Communication

A three wave panel survey among 336 pupils enables us to disentangle (RQ1) which effect the social context has on individual media use and (RQ2) which effect media use has on the development and maintenance of social relations. Based on a multi-level approach of dynamic social network analysis and applying stochastic actor oriented modelling we find sound empirical evidence for processes of social influence regarding TV programs and YouTube channels. Only weak support is found for the hypothesized social selection processes. The theoretical reasoning and empirical investigation also include structural dynamics of media use and friendship structures. This elaborate research design provides unique insight into the complex social dynamics on the intermediate level between individual media use on the micro level and societal dynamics on the macro level.,"Children, Adolescence, and Parental Mediation",Mass Communication

Research on the formation of stereotypes and on the cultivation effect showed that beliefs about reality and judgments about social groups could be influenced by exemplars with stereotypical attributes that are repeatedly presented in media coverage. To analyze the influence of the number of stereotype repetitions on stereotype formation in children, we conducted a prolonged-exposure experiment (with three sessions over one week) with children between 10 and 12 years. We tested whether the number of repetitions of stereotypical attributes of exemplars who belonged to two occupational groups (no stereotypes at all/two/four/five repetitions of stereotypical attributes) in a radio drama influenced children’s general judgments about these groups. Findings indicate that even a single initial contact to stereotypes via media coverage establishes stereotypical judgments, and the influence becomes stronger with repetitions.","Children, Adolescence, and Parental Mediation",Mass Communication
2018-0302,2018,Paper Session,Mapping the Knowledge Construction in the Invisible College of Dialogue Research,1,"Taking a network perspective, this study systematically examines the public relations research on dialogue using bibliometric analyses that examine the development of dialogue in three ways. First, we examine the invisible college by revealing the co-author networks of dialogue research. Second, we study the knowledge construction process by assessing the theories and concepts public relations researchers use when studying dialogue. Finally, we analyze the in-text citations to identify the influential scholars and publications that serve as the foundation for dialogue research. Our analyses of 157 journal articles suggests that the invisible college of dialogue is fractured; conceptually dialogue has been torn between excellence and dialogic theories while relationship management bridge research on dialogue to several areas; and we find that a select few scholars serve as the foundation from which research on dialogue has emerged. We discuss these findings and present a path forward for public relations researchers.",Public Relations Student Top Papers,Public Relations
2018-0303,2018,Paper Session,The Network of Territorial Dispute Discussion as Twitter Diplomacy: Four Models of Public Relations and Human-Robot Accounts’ Interaction,3,"The current study examines the use of four models of public relations in a public diplomacy
context: the online discussion about Diaoyu (Senkaku) Islands Territorial Dispute among U.S.
twitterers, and explored how human and automated/robot accounts differ in terms of their
communication manner and roles in the discussion network on Twitter. Combining a content
analysis and a social network analysis, we found that although two-way models gained high
frequency, the use of one-way models are still predominant from a network perspective.
Moreover, we found that automated/robot account do interact with human account in the
discussion, but human accounts are often the hubs of sub-level networks and are more capable of
adopting mixed models of public relations in their communication.",Public Relations Student Top Papers,Public Relations

Specifically, findings revealed a positive influence of government SNS engagement on perceived government transparency, perceived external political efficacy, and public participation but to varying degrees depending on the level of government (e.g., federal, state, and local). Noticeably, this study suggested a limited influence of public engagement on perceived government-citizen relationship quality via SNS. This empirical research demonstrated how a contextualized investigation of public engagement and relationship management helps to gain better insight into the role SNS can play in connecting young people to democracy.",Public Relations Student Top Papers,Public Relations

Identity Negotiation Among Onsite Contractors in Global Outsourcing Arrangements,3,"This study examines fluid identification among onsite contractors involved in global outsourcing arrangements. A comparative case study of two global software organizations involved in offshore outsourcing reveals that onsite contractors negotiated fluid identification in different ways, which shaped whether they felt stigmatized or empowered by these foreign assignments. Further, we found that organizational differences in outsourcing models produced different expectations about foreign assignments, which triggered positive or negative social comparison processes among onsite contractors across sites due to their comparison with different referent groups. These differences also impacted their identification as contractors and job satisfaction in opposite ways. These findings reveal that the types of outsourcing arrangements impact the ways in which foreign workers form organizational attachments with implications for their satisfaction with their foreign assignments in ways often unanticipated by managers.",Organizing and Multiple Levels and Types of Identities,Organizational Communication

One issue potentially decreasing the tenure of fund raisers is the negative reputation sometimes associated with fund raising work. This study uses Stigma Management Communication Theory and content analysis of in-depth interviews with current and former university fund raisers to investigate how fund raisers communicatively manage stigmatizing messages associated with their occupation. The findings suggest that current fund raisers use a greater number and variety of stigma management strategies than former fund raisers described using. The findings also highlight the potential consequences and distinctions among different ways of using humor to manage stigma messages. On a practical level, these findings can be translated into orientation and training programs for fund raisers, teaching them successful ways of framing their occupations and work.",Organizing and Multiple Levels and Types of Identities,Organizational Communication

It proposes a narrative perspective to understand strategic practice as narrative, organizational identity work. Based on a case study of organizational identity work among frontline personnel in the European retail bank, BestBank, this paper demonstrates that strategic identity work involves multiple organizational levels in crafting aspirational identity narratives, building new narrative repertoires, encouraging narrative experiments, and balancing narrative closure in order to re-author ‘who we are.’ A process model is proposed to illustrate the various iterative steps and interactions with notional ‘outsiders,’ in which the organizational members engage in re-authoring a new provisional organizational identity that is rendered authoritative based on perceptions of authenticity and legitimacy.",Organizing and Multiple Levels and Types of Identities,Organizational Communication

Analysis of an online survey with 156 humanitarian organizations in the Asia Pacific region, Europe, and North America, as well as the semantic network analysis of their messages on Facebook and Twitter over one year revealed both convergence and divergence of organizations’ social media use. Although the semantic differences between the two groups of organizations were significant on Twitter and Facebook, such differences were even more salient on Twitter than on Facebook. Theoretically, this study enhances institutional theory and dialogic theory by examining levels of dialogic employment on different social media platforms as the manifestation of organizations’ adaptation in following the trend of social media adoption and use.",Organizing and Multiple Levels and Types of Identities,Organizational Communication
2018-0310,2018,Paper Session,The Supply-side Determinants of News Media Trust: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment,3,"Several experimental and correlational studies have investigated how different factors shapes citizen's' trust in news. Yet, due to methodological restrictions, previous studies have only focused on a small number of explanatory factors and consequently been unable to test competing hypotheses.
This paper contributes with the first causal test of several attributes’ relative importance in shaping citizens' trust in a news publication. We use an advancement in survey experiments known as conjoint designs to disentangle the effects of eight different theoretically relevant attributes. Through an experiment fielded in a probability based panel of 1955 Norwegian citizens, we find that, in order to remain a trusted source of information, publications should avoid too many ethical violations, endorsing political parties, using native advertising, and to primarily produce entertainment news.
This evidence sheds new light on the ongoing debate on declining trust in news media.",In News We Trust?,Journalism Studies

Effects of Evidences on Trust and Credibility in News Messages,3,"With reference to the current debate about a loss of trust in news media, journalism experts in practice and research often demand that journalists should concentrate on enhancing the quality of their reporting and hence focus on facts and evidences. Building on research on trust and credibility, we investigate how the use of different forms of evidences affects the credibility and quality evaluation of news stories, as well as the reading experience from the audience’s perspective. We conducted an online experiment to detect the influence of the presence of scientific sources, sta-tistical information, and their visualization in an online article. Our findings indicate that these evidences increase the perceived credibility. At the same time, we found that adding scientific sources, statistical data and visualizations to an article does not lessen its reading enjoyment but improves its perceived vividness in the view of news users.

2018-0312,2018,Paper Session,Trust in Journalistic Content: Exploring the Antecedents of Trust in Journalism on a Micro-Level,3,"Trust is a multidimensional phenomenon. To describe trust in journalism we argue to measure it on a micro-level: We develop a model for describing the process of trust in journalistic content (based on Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Therefore, trust consists of the two steps willingness to be vulnerable and risk taking in relationship. As antecedents of trust we determined quality and reputa-tion as factors of perceived trustworthiness as well as the trustor’s propensity regarding media. Thereby we provide an operationalization that clearly distinguishes journalistic trust from the quali-ty of a news media content and the media outlet’s reputation. To test our assumptions we conducted an online survey containing an experiment (N = 625). Altogether, the tested antecedents of trust help to explain 23.3 percent of the trust in journalistic content. While not all interaction effects test-ed in the MANOVA were interpretable, all assumed main influences show significant effects.",In News We Trust?,Journalism Studies

Applying Expectancy Violations Theory, a contributing factor to news media mistrust may be due to differences in how the public perceives journalistic roles and how journalists perceive their roles. Using a representative sample of U.S. news consumers, this study uses survey data to examine audiences’ perceptions of journalists’ roles. Survey data are then compared to existing data regarding how journalists view their own roles. Finally, news consumption habits and levels of media trust are used to predict the public’s journalistic role perceptions. Key findings show that in most cases, public perceptions of journalists’ roles are significantly different from journalists’ perceptions of their own roles. Further analysis showed that trust, more than media use or demographic variables, most strongly predicted perceived role functions.",In News We Trust?,Journalism Studies
2018-0314,2018,Paper Session,Political Disagreement and Uncertainty: Examining the Interplay of Political Talk and News Use in Online and Offline Environments,2,"Prior research has found that social media and other online media technologies largely promote exposure to political disagreement. But if this disagreement has little to no effect on individuals’attitudes and opinions, the democratic benefits of this increased exposure could be limited. This study empirically investigates whether exposure to political disagreement in social media versus face-to face settings has differential effects on individuals’ uncertainty about their political opinions and beliefs. In doing so, the paper accounts for the interplay in news use and political discussion in these two settings. The results show (a) differences in the relationship between political disagreement and uncertainty in social media and face-to-face settings and (b) considerable overlap in discussion and reflection processes between these two settings. Results are discussed in light of ongoing conversations about the democratic benefits of political disagreement.",What’s on Your Mind?

2018-0315,2018,Paper Session,The Issue Takes it All? A Qualitative Study on Factors Influencing the Shift from Incidental News Exposure to News Engagement on Social Network Sites (SNS),1,"Social network sites (SNS) like Facebook have become an integral part of accessing news. However, as most users come across news on Facebook while they are doing other things (incidental news exposure), they will not necessarily engage with the content they encounter. Although there already is some evidence on the role of single factors that can inform news engagement decisions on Facebook, integrated findings—considering the highly personalized information environment—are still missing. Addressing this, the following study adopts a qualitative approach and relies on self-confrontation interviews with Facebook users (N = 16). Results of the observations/interviews show that engagement decisions are mostly determined by users’ perception of the news content and whether they are (already) interested in the issue of the linked article. Yet, in some situations, this “Matthew effect” can be overshadowed by users’ perceptions of the recommending friend, leaving at least some room for social influence.",What’s on Your Mind?

The frequency of Facebook use is found positively associated with incidental exposure to dissonant political information and this relationship is fully mediated by network heterogeneity. In addition, the findings of the experiment indicate that individuals coming across counter-attitudinal posts are able to recognize and even recall some details of these posts. This study suggests that incidental exposure is an important route for social media users to encounter and learn about dissonant political information. Implications are discussed in terms of the influence of social media use on deliberative democracy.",What’s on Your Mind?

The relationship of affectively charged, “hot cognition” responses to current public affairs issues in Taiwan were examined in combination with an experimental comparison of Facebook newsfeed pages with those of a fictitious news aggregator among Taiwanese college students with strong Facebook newsfeed habits. Selective exposure to news items congruent with pre-existing attitudes was evident from eye tracking when hot cognitions were present. The presence of hot cognitions, compared to their absence, shortened the latency of initial fixations and increased the total number of fixations on congruent news items when presented in a Facebook newsfeed environment, but the reverse was the case in a control condition that did not contain Facebook cues.",What’s on Your Mind?

This work explores the effect of publicly advocating a political position in computer-mediated communication (CMC) on an individual’s own attitude on the position advocated over time. In an original experiment, participants commented on a contentious political topic while their levels of anonymity were varied. Results demonstrate that participants internalized their positions in the comment the most when they commented non-anonymously on the issue, and when they generated two-sided messages, compared with in other conditions where their identities were concealed to different degrees. This effect occurred immediately after the commenting behavior and lasted at least until a week after the experiment.","HIGH-DENSITY: Politics, Journalism, Online Discussion, and Fake News!",Communication and Technology

Given the serious concerns about fake news, an important question is how accurately can people discern fake news from real news when they encounter it online. Our study, adopting an interpersonal deception detection paradigm, offers insights about how accurately people can detect fake news in a current online news environment. Our findings provide empirical evidence that people can detect both fake news and real news at 58% accuracy rate, and their detection performances varied by news domains.","HIGH-DENSITY: Politics, Journalism, Online Discussion, and Fake News!",Communication and Technology
2018-0320,2018,Paper Session,Following the Voices? Effects of Social Endorsements on Exposure to Political Content on Social Media,2,"New technologies have altered news use patterns of citizens worldwide. A particular prominent feature on social media platforms are social endorsements (i.e., recommendations, reactions, and popularity measures). Those newly available indicators may guide users’ news consumption in significant ways. Extant research points to the capability of social endorsements to instigate user interest and to even counteract traditional effects of source credibility or partisanship. However, effects of endorsements have not yet been tested comprehensively in realistic exposure settings. This study explores effects of social endorsements on selective exposure to political news in an online-survey experiment (n=209) before the German federal election in 2017. In a closely mimicked Facebook newsfeed, participants were provided with news and entertainment posts in conjunction with various social cues. Under these circumstances, only small effects of social endorsements on selective exposure were found. However, users were more likely to select political articles, if popularity measures were included.","HIGH-DENSITY: Politics, Journalism, Online Discussion, and Fake News!",Communication and Technology

Technology as a Source of Partisan Information,2,"Personalized recommendation systems have long been blamed for increasing political polarization in our society. What if these systems started recommending content from the opposing political side? Would people be willing to see it? And, if so, does it matter who recommends their exposure to the opposing viewpoint? To answer these questions, we conducted an online experiment (N= 257) in which we examined how different recommending sources in the system, including machine (mobile phone), other users, friends, ingroup friends and outgroup friends, would affect online users’ willingness tofollow partisan news sources. The results showed that mobile phone as a recommending source elicits higher willingness from both Democrats and Republicans to follow like-minded news pages. In addition, Democrats demonstrated significantly higher willingness to see the other side, i.e. rightwing media, when the recommendation comes from their Democratic friends. Theoretical and practical contributions and implications are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Politics, Journalism, Online Discussion, and Fake News!",Communication and Technology

With the rise of new information intermediaries like Google Search, Facebook or YouTube, whose technical structures are enhancing the opportunities to encounter news as by-products of other use purposes, questions regarding the more beneficial usage patterns in terms of knowledge gains are emerging. As incidental and intentional exposure are not mutually exclusive, we aim to investigate connections between both usage patterns in terms of current affairs knowledge using online behavior tracking and survey data. Against our assumption, preliminary findings reveal higher current affairs knowledge among those incidentally exposed in contrast to those using new information intermediaries intentionally as a source for news.","HIGH-DENSITY: Politics, Journalism, Online Discussion, and Fake News!",Communication and Technology

However, these interactive environments also allow for hateful comments and the distribution of illegal content, disturbing and potentially destroying the deliberation process. Hate speech is a widespread problem and it seems that some topics, such as immigration for example, particularly trigger hateful comments. The increase of refugees arriving in Europe, that climaxed in summer 2015, is also associated with an increase of online hate against refugees and migrants in general. Contributing to the research on online community management, we investigate the handling of online hate speech in particular. In guided interviews with community managers in Germany, we explore which moderation strategies are used to prevent and counter hate speech and in how far technological features shape these strategies.","HIGH-DENSITY: Politics, Journalism, Online Discussion, and Fake News!",Communication and Technology

In reaction to this, a large number of syntheses (i.e., meta-analyses and systematic reviews) has accumulated. As these syntheses present widely different conclusions about the effects of various forms of CMC on various mental health indicators, there is need for a new approach that can integrate disparate research results from a disconnected literature. We address this issue with a meta-review of twenty syntheses articles. Results underline that conclusions about the effects of CMC on mental health are mixed and often premature, due to severe conceptual and methodological limitations of the synthesized primary studies. By constructing a theoretical model of mental health and a taxonomy of CMC variables, we offer a framework that can guide future communication research in this interdisciplinary field.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances in Understanding the Relationship Between Social Media Use and Mental Health,Communication and Technology
2018-0326,2018,Paper Session,Small and Varied Effects: A Meta-Analysis of the Association Between Social Media Use and Depression,4,"Debate surrounding the impact of social media (SM) use on depression remains inconclusive, with some evidence suggesting that SM use exacerbates depression while other evidence suggests the opposite or no effects. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine the overall effect size of the association between SM use and depression. Fifty-nine quantitative studies with SM use as an independent variable and depression as a dependent variable were examined to reveal a very small, positive relationship of r = .126. This suggests less than 2% variance in depressive symptoms can be explained by SM use. Since the effect was heterogeneous (Q=487.97 (59), p<.001), potential moderators were analyzed, but only the scale chosen to measure depression explained significant variation in the effect. Considering this small effect size and lack of significant moderators unveiled by this study, scholars should try to uncover critical indirect effects, to better understand this relationship.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances in Understanding the Relationship Between Social Media Use and Mental Health,Communication and Technology

This paper specifically explores if the relationship of social network site (SNS) use to PD is dependent on awareness of changes in the PD experienced by extended family members. Text messaging, social network sites, email and other Internet use do not contribute to increased PD. Having extended family members who are also internet users substantively lowers PD over time and reduces the likelihood of SPD. SNS use also reduces the risk of SPD over time. However, as hypothesized, having extended family members who also use SNS contributes to higher/lower PD over time, depending on corresponding changes in the family member’s PD.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances in Understanding the Relationship Between Social Media Use and Mental Health,Communication and Technology

Based on this example, the paper argues that the interplay of three different motives should be kept in mind when seeking to understand the system's overall evolution: the business strategies of news agencies, the interests of national governments in news dissemination, and journalistic ideas about how news organizations should operate. The paper demonstrates the complex manner in which business concerns (especially about competition), nationalistic motives, and normative ideas about journalism sometimes conflicted with and sometimes reinforced each other.","Nation, Narrative, and Histories of News",Communication History

This gives rise to the question of whether an increasingly ""right wing"" press climate aided the emergence of fascist movements. Based on a comparative analysis of the daily press in Germany and Austria, this paper argues that in a democratic-corporatist media system (to which both countries belong), certain newspapers not only assume the role of opinion leaders, but act as a ""suitable"" sounding board for the relevant political parties. According to sociometric theory, in times of serious crisis, the cohesion of this group of ""elite media"" is lessened and its composition changes in the direction of those actors that are perceived as being responsible for making fundamental decisions in politics and society. There is empirical evidence for both assumptions, reflecting a growing significance of right-wing positions in public discourse.","Nation, Narrative, and Histories of News",Communication History

Inspired by an article published in 2005 by Georg Christ that for the first time problematized this notion, the author offers additional evidence conveyed in the experience of the late medieval Venice and Florence, while relying on contemporary chronicles, merchant letters and diplomatic dispatches. Mainly through the analysis of three historical case studies, the essay argues that the existing networks of lower-tier diplomatic representatives, sea captains and military liaisons were already functioning as nodal points of an intelligence-gathering mechanism. But it was the merchant circles that decisively shaped the whole news-gathering network by lending it its own matter-of-factly writing style, as well as allowing it to rely on its own scarsella system of couriers.","Nation, Narrative, and Histories of News",Communication History

The newspapers and journals mirror the communal life as well as the central debates prevalent in the German-Jewish communities of the past. The outbreak of war triggered a lively discussion on the current and future position of the Jews within the German nation in Jewish papers. Initial hopes that the war would increase Jewish inclusion were, however, thwarted, for the war led to a rise in antisemitism and thus to experiences of exclusion at home and at the front. My article analyses the discourses on the Jewish war experience, using selected journals as a source. These discourses, which were quite similar on the outbreak of hostilities, drifted apart as the conflict continued, mainly as a result of the diverse religious and political orientations of the journals. Still, the discourses continued to reveal certain similarities in their reflection on the Jewish war experience.","Nation, Narrative, and Histories of News",Communication History

Based on archival sources, institutional reports and oral history interviews, it examines how reporters and editors mobilized rhetorical and material resources to define, articulate and practice narrative journalism in newspapers. It also demonstrates how the success of narrative journalism led to a diversification of the genre. While some newspapers associated narrative techniques with feature and lifestyle sections, others systematically implemented them in news sections. Situating the efforts of individuals within an emerging community of practice, this paper describes how conventions, conferences and workshops helped construct a common identity, fostered relationships between proponents of the genre, galvanized the imagination of young reporters, canonized theory and practice, and established narrative writing as an institutional fixture in American journalism.","Nation, Narrative, and Histories of News",Communication History

2018-0335,2018,Paper Session,Perceiving and Remembering Changes in Visual and Audiovisual Dynamic Scenes,3,"Humans perceive changes in the continuous stream of sensory information as event boundaries. Although event boundary perception is thought of as a general mechanism, there is some evidence that it might depend on stimulus modality. As an example, memory for event boundaries is higher than memory for non-event boundaries. Yet, this event boundary advantage has only been demonstrated with visual dynamic scenes and has failed to replicate with audiovisual dynamic scenes. Because auditory information changes basic visual processes, it is thus possible that event boundary perception depends on stimulus modality. We report three within-subjects experiments that studied how humans perceive and remember changes in visual and audiovisual dynamic scenes using a single set of stimuli. We observed basic processes of event perception (event segmentation, change detection, and memory) to be independent of stimulus modality. We thus conclude that event boundary perception is a general perceptual-cognitive mechanism.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

The underlying mechanisms are unclear, partially because it is unknown who is most susceptible to conversational influence and how these individual differences relate to responses to message exposure. We assessed college students’ daily drinking behavior and alcohol-related conversations over 30 days. This work substantially increases the temporal resolution of prior conversational influence measures. Results show bi-directional relationships between conversational valence (pro/anti-drinking) and drinking behavior. Further, we assessed participants’ capacity to engage positively with anti-drinking media campaigns operationalized as neural value-related activity captured through fMRI. Pro-drinking conversations affected drinking behavior less strongly among those who showed greater neural valuation activity during engagement with anti-drinking advertisements at baseline.

We employed a 2 (Message valence: anti-policy vs. pro-policy) × 2 (Issues: legal age for drinking vs. legal age of marriage) × 2 (Threat to freedom: low threat vs. high threat) × 2 (Argument quality: low quality vs. high quality) plus 2 (Control groups: no-message control for the two issues) cross-sectional experimental design (N = 458). Based on structural equation models, we found that counterarguing (vs. anger) mediated the relationship between argument quality and belief position boomerang under a counterattitudinal message, whereas anger (vs. negative cognitions) mediated the relationship between trait reactance and belief boomerang under a proattitudinal message. Furthermore, we refined negative cognitions by modeling counterarguments and nonrefutational thoughts as two distinct constructs. Poor argument quality caused counterarguments, whereas perceived threat and trait reactance caused nonrefutational thoughts. Future research should explore the persuasive appeals for mitigating the cognitive or affective process resulting in a boomerang effect.",Best of Information Systems,Information Systems

2018-0339,2018,Paper Session,Predictors of Student Humor Use,1,"Student humor orientation within the college classroom has yet to be examined in scholarly research to date. Furthermore, predictors of student humor orientation such as; instructor immediacy, classroom connectedness and relational closeness are being examined within this research. This study consisted of 155 participants who are all college students at two Northern California colleges, in all different levels of their academic careers. The three Humor Orientation scale was used to measure the dimensions of student humor behavior. The Classroom Connectedness Scale was used to measure the presence of perceived classroom connectedness. A modified version of the Relational Closeness scale was used to measure how close participants felt to their peers. The Instructor Immediacy scale was also utilized to measure immediate behavior with the participant’s instructor. It was found that classroom connectedness, instructor immediacy, and relational closeness were all predictors of some type of student humor orientation. However, classroom connectedness was the greatest predictor of student humor use within the college classroom.",Top Student Papers in Instructional Communication Division,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2018-0341,2018,Paper Session,Hip-hop Practices as Recording-Based Music Education in an Urban Classroom: Chicago’s Foundations of Music,1,"Hip Hop Based Education, the usage of hip-hop practices and pedagogy in urban classrooms, has been argued as very beneficial to understanding how to improve the academic performance of Black youth in low income environments. This merger of hip-hop with music education has been described by many scholars as beneficial to several supplementary and after-school programs. However, there is a lack of understanding of how Hip Hop Based Education functions inside formal music education. This ethnographic investigation describes the program outcomes of Chicago’s Foundations of Music Songwriting and Music Production class. Findings suggest this program facilitated a process by which the youth were empowered by a) collaborative learning, (b) personal narrative as a media artifact and, (c) musical expression as emotional catharsis. The results of this study indicate that Black youth identity is formed and self-efficacy is bolstered within settings inclusive of social norms found in hip-hop practices.",Top Student Papers in Instructional Communication Division,Instructional & Developmental Communication

The question is whether a virtual reality 3D simulation with strong spatial cues can better support language simulation and interaction. One classic approach to memory s the ‘method of loci’ a language learning strategy that uses spatial cues to help remember objects and names. If so, VR, which organizes information around the body, will better activate spatial cues for word and objects, supporting subconsciously association and the student’s learning competency. An experiment was conducted in 3D classroom environment to test the learning of a Korean vocabulary using interactive objects arrayed around the environment and supported by visual or auditory cues. The result indicated that virtual reality had significant effect on presence, spatial awareness, enjoyment, and motivation. The participants feeling of presence mediated the other effects. As for language learning, the participants had great spatial memory for the language objects in VR, but did not show a significant difference in free language recall.",Top Student Papers in Instructional Communication Division,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2018-0343,2018,Paper Session,"Parental Skills Squared: Digital Skills, Risk Perception and Management of Children’s Online Risks",3,"Research shows that parental mediation of children’s internet use is related to parents’ digital skills and their perception of the online risks faced by their children. Little is known about the nature of or influences on risk perception itself. This paper draws on social-psychological approaches to risk distinguishing the perception of risk likelihood from the perception of severity. It asks whether parents’ digital skills and their child’s experiences of risk, influence their risk perception and their approach to parental mediation. Analyses of a survey with 6400 European parents show that parental skill is non-linearly related to perceptions of severity of harm resulting from online risk but linearly to the likelihood of online risks. Multiple factors influence parental risk perception besides their self-efficacy in risk management, especially the child’s prior experience of risk, and these enter a complex calculus that informs parental strategies of mediating and managing their children’s online experiences.

2018-0344,2018,Paper Session,Adolescents’ Online Risks and Opportunities: The Role of Digital Skills and Parental Mediation,3,"With the advance of digital technologies, concerns about adolescents’ exposure to online risks and the importance of digital skills have been raised. In this context, it is essential to consider parents’ impact on the development of such skills and not to forget online opportunities. Therefore, this study examines the influence of parental mediation (active and restrictive) on adolescents’ digital skills, and the effect of such skills on their online opportunities and online risks behaviours. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1.446 secondary students in Spain. Structural equation modelling shows that adolescents with more digital skills experience more risks, but also take more opportunities. Moreover, active parental mediation has no influence on adolescents’ digital skills, whereas restrictive mediation reduces these skills, and as such lowers opportunities and risks too. The results emphasize the importance of promoting digital skills as they let adolescents take more online opportunities.",The Caregiver Context: When Parents and Teachers Matter,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0345,2018,Paper Session,Parental Mediation and Excessive Smartphone Use: Perceptions of Singaporean Young People and Their Parents,3,"The smartphone has integrated into people’s daily life. With the highest smartphone penetration globally, Singapore has considerable number of young users, and their increasing dependence on smartphone raises parents’ concerns. This research aims to explore the patterns of parental mediation strategies as well as young people’s excessive smartphone use from the perspectives of both parents and children in an Asian context. Based on a nationally representative sample consisted by 500 pairs of young people and their parents, this study found a low level of parental mediation and seven strategies adopted by parents, namely technical restriction, active mediation, general restriction, content restriction, interaction restriction, supervision and co-use. A new dimension called privacy restriction was also revealed in the children sample. Additionally, the association between parental mediation and excessive smartphone use and the comparison between the perceptions of parents and children were investigated.

2018-0346,2018,Paper Session,Parental Mediation During the U.S. 2016 Presidential Election Campaign,2,"Presidential elections provide ideal opportunities for parents to socialize their children to become politically informed and engaged citizens. However, news coverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign contained inappropriate content, including discussions of sexual acts and violence. Rather than encouraging news consumption, parents may have restricted or denigrated it. The purpose of this study was to explore whether and how parents engaged in parental mediation of news coverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. Based on nationally representative sample of American parents during October and November 2016, we found that 53.4%, 85.1%, and 59.9% of parents engaged in restrictive mediation, negative active mediation, and co-viewing of news coverage of the campaign, respectively. These three mediation behaviors were predicted by a host of factors, including parenting styles, political variables, and child factors. The results are discussed in light of research on both political socialization and parental mediation.",The Caregiver Context: When Parents and Teachers Matter,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0347,2018,Paper Session,Virtual Safe Zone: Teachers' Online Psychosocial Role in Social Network Sites during Times of War,3,"School teachers leverage online Social Network Sites (SNS) communication for both pedagogical and psychosocial purposes. The aim of this study, which was conducted in the midst of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war, was to examine and illustrate how teacher-student SNS communication may facilitate students' resilience in times of crisis. Qualitative thematic approach and quantification methods were applied to examine the perspectives of both teachers and students, on SNS communication during the war. A quantification process of students' written perspectives (N = 68) on SNS communication with teachers revealed five distinct content categories of emotional support: (1) caring, (2) reassuring, (3) emotional sharing, (4) belonging, and (5) distracting. Moreover, regardless of the specific content of the SNS conversations, according to the students, the mere existence of a continuous online contact with their teachers contributed to their subjective feelings of resilience. Semi-structured interviews with secondary school teachers (N = 11) revealed three main motives for SNS usage in times of war: (a) delivering emotional support to the students, (b) monitoring their distress and (c) maintaining civilized norms of discourse. These findings are described in detail using rich and vivid examples. Aside from practical implications, we discuss theoretical contributions to our understanding of contemporary mental health roles of teachers in times of crises.",The Caregiver Context: When Parents and Teachers Matter,Children Adolescents and the Media

This High-Density Panel presentation will contend that – like other major paradigm-shifting technological changes in a society – the opportunities for locative journalism need more time to develop with audiences but also some help in that process. Only a decade has passed since the release of the first iPhone. More successful (and practical) locative-media prototypes need to be put into place. In conjunction, as the core of this particular academic argument, more conceptual models also need to be created upon which to explore those examples.

2018-0349,2018,Paper Session,It is Harder to Remember Information From News Stories on Mobile Devices,2,"In the U.S., people are increasingly abandoning broadband, opting to rely on wireless access, and tablets are replacing desktop computers in classrooms and school libraries. Elsewhere, tablets are replacing computers heavily relied upon by people without home access at public libraries and internet cafes. The implications of these changes have not yet been exhaustively interrogated, and despite the FCC’s recent position that mobile internet access is equivalent to broadband, there remains a debate as to whether mobile access is sufficient replacement for computers with high speed internet. We hypothesize that mobile devices attenuate attention and information recall relative to computers and that this effect occurs because processing information on mobile devices requires more cognitive effort. Testing our expectations using eye tracking, we find that attention and recall are curbed on mobile devices, and identify a mechanism for the effect: information processing requires more cognitive effort in the mobile setting.",HIGH-DENSITY: Mobile Social Media and Journalism,Mobile Communication

However, a small but nonetheless substantial number of Instagram users utilize the site primarily, if not exclusively, as a means to disseminate their more artistically oriented photographs. This research is based upon the author’s in-depth engagement with Instagram, and in particular its more artistic oriented communities. From its initial stage, the author’s immersion into Instagram and related research drew upon autoethnographic principles and techniques as prescribed in key work on such matters, and the author posted only photos taken with a mobile device. The results of this analysis suggest that the contemporary social media environment offers amateur photographers opportunities for widespread recognition of their work, but at the same time, successfully engaging these matters can be challenging.",HIGH-DENSITY: Mobile Social Media and Journalism,Mobile Communication

This study used a machine learning approach to identify the communication features of Instagram profiles that influenced trust in a rideshare setting. First, we collected data from public Instagram profiles. Then, survey respondents viewed posts from an Instagram profile and made a judgment if they would trust the person or not as a rideshare partner. These responses were used to create a labeled dataset of trustworthy and untrustworthy profiles. We then employed exploratory factor analysis to identify the communication factors of profiles that influenced judgments of trust. Analyses revealed three key factors of Instagram profiles that influenced trust judgments: social presence, virality, and transparency. Respectively, these factors accounted for 40%, 33%, and 13% of the variance in judgment. Findings indicate that people rely on social heuristics to inform judgments of trust.",HIGH-DENSITY: Mobile Social Media and Journalism,Mobile Communication

Now, individual news consumers can access news throughout the day at any networked location via multiple ubiquitous platforms. This study investigates how mobile devices and multiplatform access are shifting news consumption behaviours, particularly in the spatial diversity and access to a diverse range of ideas. An online survey of adult Australians (n=2004; weighted quota sample based on age, gender and region) was conducted as part of the Digital News Report: Australia in Jan/Feb 2017. We analysed a subset of the respondents who consume online news via mobile phones, mobile tablet devices and computers (n=1506). Our findings indicate that (a) mobile users tend to access a diverse range of news in multiple locations; (b) social media is an important platform where mobile users discover incidental news; and (c) they perceive that this diversity of access allows them to encounter an array of ideas beyond their usual interests.",HIGH-DENSITY: Mobile Social Media and Journalism,Mobile Communication

The study compares attitudes of gay men the US and UK and its relation to political ideology, as well as investigating whether or not media use contributes to homonationalism and/or support of Trump and Brexit. Results indicate that in both countries, anti-immigration attitudes and hostile sexism were significantly correlated to higher levels of homonationalism. Also, in both countries, increased homonationalism and politically polarized media were significantly correlated to higher levels of support for Brexit and Trump. The study also found that in the UK, inward feelings of nationalism accounted for nearly half the variance in the homonationalism scale; whereas in the US, negative external feelings toward non-nationals accounted for nearly half of the variance.","Homophobia, Homonationalism, and Geopolitics","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

This invites an understanding of the cinematic as (a) contextualization, (b) textuality and aesthetics, and (c) consumption and campaigning. The political objective of such an endeavor is to disrupt the normativity that structures the ways of being for queers in the thickening moment of widespread homophobia in Africa. I turn to two well-known documentary films – God Loves Uganda (2013) and Call Me Kuchu (2012) – as impetus for contextualization, queer textual reading, and consideration of international consumption in the human rights circuit. The convergences and juxtapositions presented by this pair of works depicting the crisis of homophobia in Uganda, afford a critical understanding of African queer worlding.","Homophobia, Homonationalism, and Geopolitics","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

However, few studies on ESM use have empirically analyzed its relationships with social network characteristics. Drawing on the three metaphors of ESM as a social lubricant, leaky pipe, and echo chamber (Leonardi, Huysman, & Steinfield, 2013), this study investigates the multifaceted effects of ESM use on distributed workers’ social connectivity. The analysis of full network data (N = 214) collected in a global high-tech organization revealed that the use of ESM for company-wide communication was positively associated with globally-dispersed workers’ network size, betweenness, and external connections. By contrast, the use of ESM for private group communication was negatively linked to their network size and betweenness. The findings suggest that ESM use may lead to disparate social capital outcomes, depending on the usage patterns that may vary by groups and individuals.",Top Four Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication

We compare US and Chinese students' ways of assigning value to the Anglo speech genre public speaking, and conclude that their ways of assigning acquisition-value to the genre is mediated through cultural models of self-transformation. In conclusion, we claim that both groups' concern with self-transformation feeds into a global language ideology of communication skills as technologies of the self.","LSI Research at the Intersection of Voice, Socialization and Culture",Language & Social Interaction
2018-0364,2018,Paper Session,“How Come Your Face is So Red”: Practitioners’ Practice of Making an Observation in Traditional Chinese Medicine,1,"This paper examines an interactional practice called “making an observation” in the setting of Traditional Chinese Medicine. This practice, frequently deployed by the medical practitioners in the diagnosis phase, is an important way for the physicians to establish and formulate evidence to support their diagnoses. Results of this study indicate that when delivered before the diagnosis, “making an observation” is utilized by the practitioners to point out a medical sign to the patient, and then use this sign as a major piece of evidence to build a case for the upcoming diagnosis. In the meantime, patients here are also provided with an opportunity to either accept or reject the observation to negotiate with the doctor about what their problem is. Data from this project suggest that doctors in TCM display a heightened orientation to the accountability of their diagnostic conclusions, and this may be due to the fact that TCM diagnoses are more ""opaque"" to the patients.","LSI Research at the Intersection of Voice, Socialization and Culture",Language & Social Interaction

In the first instance, various other modes of speaking (face and information-based talk) get in the way, and prevent alignment between the participants. It is on the fourth attempt that the participants finally align within an enactment of oplakvane, and provide an interactional response along particular local norms. Lastly, several local cultural norms for interaction, which become visible in the discourse are articulated.","LSI Research at the Intersection of Voice, Socialization and Culture",Language & Social Interaction

The Ethnography of Communication (EC) and cultural discourse analysis (CuDA) were used to understand how culture is a part of and a product of discourse, as well as the relationship between discourses of personhood and communication. Findings demonstrate how the CIE groups socialize students to the cultural premise that conversation in the United States requires both language and relational skills to generate talk that is jointly personal and communal.

The message is directed from a woman to her husband and lasts for two minutes. Although no turn-taking is possible, the discourse displays many well-researched features of recipient design. It further illustrates the enactment of a unique system of meaning between the wife and her husband and their immersion in a network of family and friendships. Its placement within the radio broadcast, and its performance of steps that pay homage to the sacred object of potential release of the hostages, place the message within a communal ritual that united Colombians during a time when kidnapping was a national, cultural tragedy.","LSI Research at the Intersection of Voice, Socialization and Culture",Language & Social Interaction

I argue that by carrying out such activities bound to the category of a higher position than hers (Sacks, 1992, p. 241), the child manages to grow “a head taller” in the Vygotskyan sense (1978, p. 102).

Thematic analysis revealed the following three themes: (a) culture of exclusion; (b) structural negotiations of health; and (c) agency as collective survival. These findings have implications for health promotion. Lived experiences illustrate the need to move away from traditional, top-down, linear behavior-change health campaigns to reconstitute health interventions with a participatory bottom-up approach that includes the voices of the cultural participants and which are situated within workers’ own needs and contexts.",Listening to Marginalized Voices to Understand Health Disparities,Health Communication
2018-0371,2018,Paper Session,The Exploration of Health Narratives from Chinese Female Migrant Workers under Culture-Centered and Gender Perspectives,1,"Female migrant workers are marginalized group in China who are not only facing health disparities but lacking of voices. This article drew on culture-centered approach together with gender perspective to co-construct health meaning with female migrant workers, aiming to answer the question of how female migrant workers narrate their health and reveal the agency of marginalized group. By employing dialog interview method accompanied with 9 months field work research, 30 female migrant workers’ health narratives had been recorded. The results showed that poverty, working conditions and discrimination were the main problems for Female migrant workers' health in the life course context. The participants highlighted the minimum wage and graded social insurance to be the key structural obstacles. Moreover, culture was an essential reference on making health decisions. As gender issues run through the contextualized health narratives, corresponding interventions initiatives had been discussed for future health communication programs.",Listening to Marginalized Voices to Understand Health Disparities,Health Communication
2018-0372,2018,Paper Session,Voices of Urban Poor Women in Manila: Communicating about Antimicrobial Resistance from the Global South,1,"By listening to voices of women residing in economic margins of urban Manila about antimicrobial resistance (AMR), this paper broadens conversations in health communication about a public health threat in the Global South. Drawing on Culture-Centered Approach, it explores meanings of, experiences with, and information sources for antibiotics among at risk yet rarely listened to populations. Through focus group discussions with mothers, guardians, and female senior citizens, this paper found that antibiotics had multiple meanings—from its purposes to side effects. Structures such as prescription policy and cost simultaneously enabled and limited antibiotic-related experiences. Furthermore, the primacy of doctors as information sources highlighted their role as stewards of responsible antibiotic use. Overall, this paper suggests that AMR is a shared concern located within broader constructions of health and socio-material realities of everyday living in the margins. Implications to AMR-related communication campaigns in the Global South are elaborated.",Listening to Marginalized Voices to Understand Health Disparities,Health Communication
2018-0373,2018,Paper Session,Lived Experiences of Unwed Single Mothers: A Peek Into the Relationship Between Structural Violence and Agency in the Context of Chinese Reproductive Health Discourse,2,"China’s family planning policy priorities the state such that the women’s voices remain silent in this national reproductive discourse. Furthermore, much of the research into China’s family planning policy has generally used census data and regulation texts, which continue to leave out the voices of the women. In particular, unwed single mothers are penalized and marginalized, always remaining invisible in the reproductive discourse that promotes childbirth only within the institution of marriage. Thus, this study explored the lived experiences of unwed single mothers in China in the context of the state-controlled reproductive health discourse. Drawing on Giddens’ theoretical framework of structure-agency, thirty in-depth interviews were conducted to understand the presence of structural violence in day-to-day interaction, and in turn enacting of agency that allowed the women to navigate these limitations. The findings revealed that structural violence was experienced in both social institutions and interpersonal relationships, causing great physical, mental, and emotional health costs to the single unwed mothers. Further, the findings revealed that these forms of structural violence were a manifestation of the state-policy. At the same time, the findings also revealed the ways in which the women enacted agency through employing various counteracting strategies both offline and online.",Listening to Marginalized Voices to Understand Health Disparities,Health Communication

Given the imperative to adapt to new generational ideologies, this study highlights responses from 100 students enrolled in Intercultural Communication in two urban U.S. cities. This study examines millennial students’ discourses of/about race across two universities in the Western United States in order to better understand the pervasiveness of colorblindness and subsequently propose alternatives for better teaching for racial and social justices. Specifically, we articulate a “W.O.K.E.” pedagogy as a vehicle for shifting discussions of race toward a critical consciousness.",Top Four Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

In-depth interviews and screenshots of posts on SNS were conducted. Results suggest that identity construction is a relational and dynamic process. The term “neidi” (Mainland) is not only a positioning word towards Mainlander identity, but also a symbol of being China-Chinese, a shared national identity between Mainland and Macao. However, they labeled themselves as oversea students, which is contradict with their nationalism and Mainland identity. Moreover, staying with other Mainland students, their hometown identity serves as a function to identify them from others. Base on geographic classification, this hometown identity thus is tightly linked with guanxi tie. Laoxiang, as a part of guanxi tie, provides mutual benefits and emotional supports. Their offline identity construction and adaptation process interweave with online self-presentation.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 participants: five Chinese who are also owners of their shops, one hired Chinese manager and eight PNG employees. The findings show that cultural values related to face and power distance along with situational features of labor laws and family obligations shape conflict strategies. PNG employees tended to submit to managers even when they felt wrongly accused given their cultural orientations and situational constraints. To express dissent, these employees often used passive aggression. Chinese managers reported using competition to resolve conflicts. The resulting conflict outcomes are distrust and dissatisfaction and have potential negative implications for intercultural relations and organizational success. Implications of the CBSECM are noted.",Top Four Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

In this study we examine the case of Hebrew Wikipedia as representative of localization that is not primarily top-down (producer-driven) or bottom-up (user driven), but rather implemented by mid-level, self-selecting bureaucratic administrators in an ongoing process that is driven by their own perceptions of Wikipedia's mission. Through an analysis of deletion discussion pages, in which decisions about what information should be included in Wikipedia or excluded from it are made, we demonstrate the primacy of national ideology and the ways in which it customarily triumphs over the global, communitarian ethos of the Wikipedia project. Even when decisions are aligned with a more ""global"" or ""neutral"" agenda, editors normally declare their allegiance to the national cause and portray their decisions as congruent with it.",Top Four Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

The hypothesized model was tested for both Democrats and Republicans Bootstrap analyses with 5,000 iterations were conducted using PROCESS (Model 4, Hayes, 2013). Results indicate that mediated and direct contact with “the other side” indirectly influenced group members’ intergroup bias in favor of their own party and tendency to adopt a social competition strategy through an increased political party identity. That is, intergroup contact did not diminish bias or competition. It actually increased it, not directly but through enhanced party identity.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication

In this experiment (N = 98) we investigate the connection between PCE and language production. Participants wrote a spontaneous story about a fictional group of individuals, which were presented at different levels of entitativity (low, high). Results of self-reported and actual coded language use showed that participants perceiving a higher level of category entitativity wrote more about the group as a whole (i.e., use generic labels), while participants perceiving a lower level of entitativity wrote more about subgroups and individual category members. These findings highlight the important role of language in the consensualization of category perceptions and the formation and maintenance of generalized stereotypes.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication

The current study included 28 in-depth interviews with CHWs, including 22 in Spanish. Results suggest that language, operating across three ecological levels, reinforced CHW in-group identity when working with community members, yet reinforced out-group identity when working with health care providers (HCPs) or other employers. Key findings included identity and communication challenges at the individual-level in English-based job training; relational-level with clients refusing interpreting services; and organizational level with lack of interpreters on staff. These findings have implications for CHW effectiveness and multi-level integration into the healthcare system, especially in low-resource rural environments, where staff shortages are problematic.",Top Papers in Intergroup Communication,Intergroup Communication
2018-0381,2018,Paper Session,The Dominance of Parental Voice on Children’s Participation in Youth Sports,2,"This study was an exploratory investigation of the role of parental voice in youth sports in America. A total of 393 parents of young athletes completed a survey assessing how they socialize their child’s participation in sport based on their familial history with athletics, as well as how social support from romantic partners aids in diminishing parental stress. Results indicated that evidence of a family lineage of sport influences levels of parental sport commitment. Additionally, in families with a history of sport, parents reported financially spending nearly twice as much as in families without. Finally, results demonstrated that social support from romantic partners buffers the negative effects of stress related to youth sports, allowing parents to be more relationally invested in their child’s participation. Practical implications of the presence of dominant parental voice in youth sports are discussed in relation to how parents communicate commitment and expectations to young athletes.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication
2018-0382,2018,Paper Session,The Role of Emotion Regulation in Experiencing Sports Media with Age,2,"Recent research indicates that sports fanship decreases with age. Socio-emotional Selectivity Theory (SST) posits that older people are aware that time is limited. They select situations that they know will make them happy and avoid those that are emotionally intense or unpredictable. Media choices reflect this strategy. By means of an online experiment (N = 1131) the current study investigates whether the unpredictability of sports contributes to older people disengaging from viewing it. The study also asks if older adults employ different emotional regulation strategies than younger adults when it comes to sports fanship and sports viewing. The results are mixed: Older adults are better at emotion regulation, and avoid thrilling TV genres, but are no less likely to be sports fans or view sports. Older adults do indicate to be less affected by the losses or wins of their favorite teams. It seems that fanship may contribute to happiness for some and thus reflect an active choice.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication

We know far less about the decisions taken inside Paralympic broadcasters that led to such representations. In this study – based on interviews with senior production and promotion staff at the UK’s Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4 – we provide the first examination of mediated para-sport from this vantage point. We explore the use of controversial promotional devices such as athletes’ backstories – the “Hollywood treatment” – to hook audiences as a vehicle to achieving its social enterprise ambitions of changing public attitudes toward disability. In so doing, we reveal myriad tensions that exist within a Paralympic broadcaster as they attempt to balance the competing goals of key stakeholders with their own desire to make the Paralympics a commercial and socially progressive success.",Top Papers in Sports Communication,Sports Communication

Grounded in framing theory, this study utilized eye-tracking technology to examines whether four common photographic frames of athletes (active, passive, personal, and sexualized) differentially drive attention for male and female athletes. The results of a 2 (participant sex) x 4 (framing type) x 2 (athlete sex) between-subjects experimental design found the main driver of visual attention is the framing of the athlete, with interactive effects of the sex of the participant and sex of the athlete being much smaller than expected.

Extending previous research on the destigmatizing effects of empathy, we investigated the effects of two content factors (background music, and framing of the content as fact vs. fiction) on empathy, and on prosocial changes in attitudes and behavioral intentions. Structural equation modeling revealed that both content factors reinforced empathy effects on prosocial attitudes and behavioral intentions, and that these destigmatizing effects of empathy were mediated by cognitive elaboration.","Emotion, Media and Psychological Well-Being",Mass Communication

Based on these findings the present study explored the effects of exposure to such gratitude portraying movies on audience’s experiences of gratitude and effects of such on well-being. Thereby, the study is one of the first to explore gratitude as a self-transcendent emotion in media systematically. Participants (N = 189) were exposed to a previously validated sample of gratitude movies or funny movies and the effects of exposure to the movies on participants’ life satisfaction, connectedness to humanity, altruistic motivations and prosocial behavioral intentions was explored. Results suggest a unique effect of gratitude as elicited from gratitude but not funny movies on the well-being outcomes, especially for connectedness and altruistic motivations.","Emotion, Media and Psychological Well-Being",Mass Communication

Different types of audiences showed different patterns of influence of an actual event that a media figure announced his romantic relationship. The announcement event did not cause PSR reduction in romance-fans, although this type of audiences had more negative emotional reactions toward the event in contrast to friendship-fans and non-fans. Friendship fans’ PSRs with the figure were undermined by the announcement. The announcement event also generated more negative emotional reactions in friendship-fans than in non-fans. Prior-satisfaction, investment size, and alternative quality were associated with different types of behavioral responses. PSRs with the media figure’s romantic partner were associated with romance-fans’ and non-fans’ emotional reactions to the event.","Emotion, Media and Psychological Well-Being",Mass Communication

It compares news by Ghanaian News Agency and Ethiopian News Agency. Guided by Most Different Systems Design, the study adopts Musa’s alternative/ extension framework and content analysis approach. The results indicate that the two African national news agencies shared similar patterns of covering China, despite differences between Ghana’s and Ethiopia’s relations with China. The common features are 1) a high degree of self-reliance on agencies’ own journalists; 2) a majority of news expressing favorable or neutral tone; 3) actors in news mainly consisting of African and Chinese elites. Possible causes for these commonalities are discussed, including African agencies’ forming alliances with Chinese Xinhua News Agency.

Interventions for countering Wikipedia’s systemic bias tend to focus on efforts to enlist the support of outsiders in editing Wikipedia via educational programmes or notification mechanisms that alert users as to the existence of gaps on the site itself. We tested a number of interventions in this project to improve content relating to South Africa and found that weak topics can be improved by collaborations between academic experts and Wikipedia editors when there is a successful negotiation between those communities of practice. Such a process, we find, cannot be achieved through software mediated processes or by only compelling outsiders to contribute directly on the wiki platform.",EXTENDED SESSION PART 2: Global Communication and Social Change in African Contexts,Global Communication and Social Change

One of the main tenets the current government’s development models is state ownership of the commanding heights of its economy, including the telecommunications sector. A rare breed in the era of deregulation, Ethiopia’s state-controlled telecommunications sector has been a source of intense debate involving different stakeholders, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Primarily based on analysis of interviews, this essay explores discourses of divergent telecommunications policies and their implications on development. Findings indicate, while the Ethiopian government’s rationale of state control of telecommunication for equitable growth is a valid proposition, the policy has created a revolving door scenario between developmentalism and neopatrimonialism that oftentimes trumps the agency of end-users.",EXTENDED SESSION PART 2: Global Communication and Social Change in African Contexts,Global Communication and Social Change

This study examined a CSR communication strategy that increased donations to CSR programs by 25% with emotional message appeals (pride vs. sympathy) and group-membership identification appeals by a strategic focus on stakeholders’ sociocultural backgrounds (self-construals). Rooted in corporate communication and public relations perspectives, it addresses the question of (1) how to maximize the impact of CSR investment on social causes by effectively engaging stakeholders’ prosocial behavior in CSR programs (i.e. donation to CSR programs) and (2) how stakeholder prosocial engagement in CSR programs can be translated into organizational outcomes (i.e. organization-public relationships).
This study used a 3 x 2 factorial experimental design and found that emotional appeals, social group appeals, individual differences in self-construals, and the interactions between these factors can effectively predict stakeholders’ donation likelihood and increase the donation amount by 25% to CSR programs. Also, stakeholders’ donations to CSR programs are associated with their relationships with their attitude and behavioral intentions towards the corporations behind the CSR programs.

The argument’s central premise is that if these companies would admit this fact, responsibility would follow. But a paradox sits at the heart of this claim. Those seeking both more and less accountability for platform companies conceptualize them as the press. Those using the argument in pursuit of less accountability build on a taken-for-granted legal and cultural legacy that digital is different. Those using the argument to seek more accountability fail to contend with this legacy and, moreover, ground their thinking in a nostalgic, revisionist view of the twentieth-century press as free and responsible. Unwinding this paradox uncovers problematic assumptions on both sides of the debate, and shows that conceptualizing platforms as the press is the wrong approach to accomplish platform accountability.",Top Papers of Communication Law and Policy and Accountability and Diversity as Policy Objectives,Communication Law & Policy
2018-0400,2018,Paper Session,"Media Cross-Ownership, Editorial Autonomy, and Viewpoint Diversity",1,"Empirical questions about the relationship between ownership structure and media content are
central to the debate about media ownership policy across the world. At the core of the debate is the concern that an individual or company owning multiple media outlets will slant news in an attempt to distort public opinion and influence public policy. The premise is that a single owner represents a single voice, regardless of how many media outlets the owner operates. This study, by analyzing news stories/reports of the 2012 and 2017 presidential campaigns of South Korea from commonly owned newspapers and television stations, tests the validity of the one owner, one voice premise in the context of newspaper-broadcast cross ownership. The results reveal that cross-owned media slant the news in their newspapers and television stations in a very similar direction rather than expanding the diversity of news content.

2018-0401,2018,Paper Session,Not all users are created equal: Algorithmic agents for diversity fans and diversity avoiders,3,"In this article, we combine survey-based evidence with theory to challenge the filter bubble argument in news personalization. Using evidence from the Netherlands, we show that, contrary to Pariser’s assumptions, the diversity of recommendations is an important factor by which citizens evaluate news recommenders. We also use our data to demonstrate that not all users are equal, and that the current debate about algorithms and filter bubbles fails to acknowledge that the audience is heterogeneous in its expectations of how news personalization should work, and has diverse personal preferences and propensities not just in terms of their interests and ideologies, but also in terms of their attitudes towards news personalization, and expectations vis-à-vis news services. We then use theoretical arguments to show that there are ample incentives for algorithms (or for the business entities that operate them) to respond to diversity seeking people. Finally, we conclude that, under the right conditions, the user’s expectation of diverse recommendations could be the starting point of a feedback loop that shapes the interaction between algorithmic recommenders and online publics. We also warn that this positive effect is not universal, and we provide empirical data on societal groups that might still be in danger of being locked in filter bubbles.",Top Papers of Communication Law and Policy and Accountability and Diversity as Policy Objectives,Communication Law & Policy

2018-0403,2018,Paper Session,Protecting Against Repercussions of Journalism: Re-Conceptualizing Mediatization in Regard to Defensive Adaptations to News Media Logic,3,"Most research on the meaning of mediatization for journalism focuses on media-related measures that aim at attracting media attention. However, social actors may also opt for defensive strategies and try to avoid media attention. This tactic has implications for journalism as it might limit the access to events and the availability of sources. We argue that defensive measures follow the same rationale as progressive adaptations. Consequently, we conceptualize them as a further facet of mediatization. Moreover, we demonstrate the relevance of such measures by systemizing defensive adaptations on micro-, meso- and macro-levels of social fields. We test our systematization against data from different research projects conducted by authors of this paper. Theoretical considerations as well as empirical results suggest to differentiate between three categories of defensive adaptation: persistence, shielding, and immunization. We discuss these adaptations with regard to their meaning for mediatization theory and their implications for journalistic practices.",Negotiating Media Logics in Crisis Situations: Attention Management and Self-Protection Strategies,Journalism Studies

Prior research has found that knowledge sufficiency and risk perception are two key factors that influence disaster preparedness. We examine the role of mediated and non-mediated sources in predicting information seeking behaviors and disaster preparedness activities, as well as what influence the recent weather events may have on those issues. Findings indicated that worry and perceived risk about severe weather were significantly influential on information seeking, but that mediated and non-mediated sources, along with information sufficiency were key predictors of disaster preparedness. The findings are important for both scholars and practitioners of media messaging.",Negotiating Media Logics in Crisis Situations: Attention Management and Self-Protection Strategies,Journalism Studies
2018-0405,2018,Paper Session,"Capturing Hearts: Charm, Personal Magnetism and the Iranian Nuclear Deal in the American and Israeli Press",2,"This paper examines the journalistic coverage of “charm offensives” in foreign affairs. Charm offensive is a diplomatic technique when negotiators use the power of their personal magnetism to achieve certain goals in international relations. The paper focuses on the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal negotiations with a particular interest in the charm offensives of the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We examine the journalistic coverage of Zarif’s and Netanyahu’s charm offensives in the American (New York Times and Wall Street Journal) and the Israeli (Haaretz and Israel Hayom) press. Overall, the paper presents a preliminary definition of charm, it examines non-Western charm, challenging the notion that it is a characteristic of Western leadership, and finally, it analyzes the role of media, in particular the press, in constructing and presenting charm in two countries, Israel and the United States.",Negotiating Media Logics in Crisis Situations: Attention Management and Self-Protection Strategies,Journalism Studies
2018-0406,2018,Paper Session,Faces of Companies: Personalization of Corporate Coverage in Crisis and Non-Crisis Situations,3,"The aim of this study is to contribute to personalization research and knowledge about how journalists cover corporate crises. Based on the concept of personalization, as well as research on crisis communication and corporate coverage, the present study explores the overarching research questions of how journalists cover corporate crisis situations vs. non-crisis situations and to what extent corporate coverage is personalized in crisis and non-crisis situations. For this purpose, I selected six corporate crises occurring in the last 10 years and analyzed the coverage of selected German media before, during, and after these crises using a quantitative content analysis. The results show that journalists cover corporate crises differently from corporate issues in non-crisis situations. During a crisis, there is more personalization, and differences can be seen at various levels. A discussion of the results is provided, as well as limitations and suggestions for further research.",Negotiating Media Logics in Crisis Situations: Attention Management and Self-Protection Strategies,Journalism Studies
2018-0407,2018,Paper Session,Making Us Aware or Making Us Afraid? Modelling the Newsworthiness of Terrorist Attacks in the German News Media,1,"Journalism secures publicity for terrorists by reporting on their attacks. Such news coverage is highly selective and entitles very few voices to be heard in the public discourse of terrorism. But how do journalists decide which attacks are newsworthy enough to cover? Based on the Global Terrorism Database and German news, this paper models media attention paid to attacks between 2012 and 2015 (N = 52,134). Event and context characteristics are used to predict new attention using zero inflated negative binominal and logistic regression. Results illustrate that online and offline outlets follow a similar logic regarding their news selection. Especially if an incident takes place in Western Europe, a German citizen is targeted or a prominent perpetrator group such as the IS claims responsibility, news attention is guaranteed. Overall, this study illustrates the asymmetry of news on terror but shows that further research is needed related to variation over time.",Negotiating Media Logics in Crisis Situations: Attention Management and Self-Protection Strategies,Journalism Studies

The importance of the media has not decreased with the increase in media choice and social network sites like Facebook. Instead, social media provides additional opportunities for scholars to observe how individuals are following and engaging with news content. Through the collection and analysis of all Facebook posts and their metadata from eight prominent Facebook pages, this study tracks the changes in Facebook user’s engagement over the course of the 2016 campaign using multilevel spline regression. We extend prior research by examining traditional campaign events as well as partisan scandals across media organization types. Engagement with news sites does vary from July to November, and we find source characteristics drive attention at specific phases of the campaign.",The 2016 Election and Social Media,Communication and Technology
2018-0409,2018,Paper Session,The Formation of Attentive Publics in the Hybrid Media System: How Donald Trump Assembled his Amplification Machine,4,"Crucial to Donald Trump’s electoral success was his ability to draw attention from all corners of the hybrid media system. Previous research has shown the importance in particular of his Twitter following in driving press attention and coverage of him. However, we know relatively little about how Trump assembled the attentive public who would ultimately amplify his presence. In this essay, we take Trump’s 2016 campaign as an instructive one for theorizing and testing questions around the assembly of social media publics in hybrid media. We begin by placing Trump within the context of contemporary discussions of attention flow and audience formation. Then we develop a set of propositions concerning the processes by which social media publics are likely to aggregate to a particular object, in this case Trump himself. And we test the propositions using two methods, one quantitative and one qualitative case-based.",The 2016 Election and Social Media,Communication and Technology

To understand how politicians used Twitter in the 2016 U.S. presidential election we examined the Twitter posts from Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Hillary Clinton, and Tim Kaine. We collected data using Crimson Hexagon, a commercial social media analytics library and application. For each candidate, all Tweets from September 5th to November 8th 2016 were collected. We used the text mining Package in R) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LWIC) to analyze the content. Our primary findings show that Hillary Clinton heavily focused on mobilization and not much on donation while Donald Trump heavily focused on Donation and not on mobilization in their Twitter posts. Our results also show that Donald Trump could elicit more reactions from Twitter users via his negative posts. However, Hillary Clinton could not seem to motivate Twitter engagement by going negative.",The 2016 Election and Social Media,Communication and Technology

In this study, we investigate the relationship between seeing and posting news and political content on social media websites, news media literacy beliefs, and attitudes about the prevalence of fake news on social media. This study finds that different social media habits contribute to NML beliefs, but in general posting news and political content on social media is associated with lower self-perceived media literacy, lower value for media literacy, and less knowledge of media structures. However, it is these news media literacy beliefs – especially seeing news media literacy as valuable for society – rather than social media habits that predict attitudes about misinformation on social media.",The 2016 Election and Social Media,Communication and Technology

A pen-and-paper survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of Singaporean adults (n = 1,000). The model had good psychometric properties and explained more than 40% of the variance in the proposed three problematic SNSs use dimensions—excessive use, withdrawal symptoms, and negative outcomes. Among the different motivations, deriving shared identifies online is an integral reason for problematic use development, above and beyond using specific functions such as sharing of photographs; this attests to the importance of looking beyond technological affordances when examining problematic media use. Results also showed that access to bonding and bridging social capital could influence problematic SNSs use because the potential to alleviate dysphoric moods.",Social Network Site Use and Well-Being: It’s Complicated,Communication and Technology
2018-0413,2018,Paper Session,The Moderating Role of Age in the Relationship Between Social Media Use and Mental Well-Being,2,"The relationship between using social network sites (SNS) and mental health is a thriving area of research producing mixed results. While terms such as “Facebook depression” have gained popularity in the mainstream press and are used by organizations such American Academy of Pediatrics, there is not a consensus on the relationship between SNS and mental health. The mixed results of past research hint that age might moderate a SNS/mental health relationship yet no specific tests of this interaction have been previously reported. In this study we examine this relationship analyzing data from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS). We show that overall social media use is positively related to respondents reporting that they have felt like they were going to have a nervous breakdown. However, for respondents under 30 years of age this relationship is negative, while it is positive for those 30 years old and older.",Social Network Site Use and Well-Being: It’s Complicated,Communication and Technology

Consistent with previous research, participants’ total number of Facebook friends emerged as a significant linear and curvilinear predictor of well-being in the form of self-reported happiness, satisfaction with life, emotional well-being, and social support. The percentage of SNS-only Facebook friends was a predictor of social functioning (Study 1 and Study 2) and social support (Study 2), whereas the percentage of Facebook friends that represented reconnected relationships emerged as a significant predictor of every well-being indicator except general health. Both studies garnered more significant findings in relation to social and emotional aspects of well-being as opposed to physical measures (e.g. general health).",Social Network Site Use and Well-Being: It’s Complicated,Communication and Technology

Drawing from Social Presence Theory, the present research explores the differing modalities of Instagram and Twitter through a novel construct—platform intimacy. Three studies converge to show that use of an image-based (vs. text-based) social media platform may enhance emotional well-being. Two surveys (Study 1 & 2) demonstrated this pattern based on chronic measures of social media use, sense of intimacy with others, and emotional well-being. To follow-up, a main experiment (Study 3) then demonstrated the real-time effect of Instagram (vs. Twitter) use on both positive and negative emotional states, and that this effect was mediated by enhanced platform intimacy. That is, because an image-based (vs. text-based) platform such as Instagram offers greater social presence via a richer modality, it more greatly enhances users’ connection to others and thus emotional well-being.",Social Network Site Use and Well-Being: It’s Complicated,Communication and Technology

In the first experiment, participants viewed a profile containing either low or high quantity of information. Analyses indicated that, higher quantity of information increased interpersonal attraction. Attributional confidence mediated this relationship. The second experiment tested the respective influences of quantity (low vs. high) and intimacy of disclosure (low vs. high) in a profile on perceivers’ attributional confidence and interpersonal attraction. While increasing quantity had a positive impact on interpersonal attraction to profile owners, increasing intimacy reduced this attraction. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between quantity and intimacy of information in predicting attributional confidence; increasing the intimacy of information shared in an SNS profile enhanced attributional confidence only when the quantity of information shared was low.",Self-Disclosure Processes in Online Contexts,Communication and Technology

The Role of Audience Similarity and Interactivity,2,"Writing about trauma can improve wellbeing, and some evidence suggests that sharing writing with others can amplify effects. By adjusting design of online communication environments, it may be possible to maximize benefits of self-disclosure. In a two-by-two experimental design, the present study examines effects of self-disclosure about a recent breakup when writing for a website that: 1) is open to the public or that limits access to others with recent breakups and 2) enables or disables audience comments. We examine effects of our manipulations on writing style and on psychological growth at follow-up. Of 175 undergraduate participants, those expecting similar audiences showed more cognitive processing in their writing, and those expecting comments wrote less about emotions. Whereas audience similarity increased post-traumatic growth at follow-up, expecting comments did not. Writing styles did not mediate effects on post-traumatic growth. The mechanisms accounting for the benefits of similarity on psychological growth warrant investigation.",Self-Disclosure Processes in Online Contexts,Communication and Technology
2018-0418,2018,Paper Session,Confiding to Imagined Audiences: How Affordances of Online Support Groups Construct an Audience for Therapeutic Self-Disclosure,2,"Online support groups have become popular around the world, transforming the audiences that Internet users can reach with their personal disclosures. While the literature outlines a number of mechanisms underlying benefits of self-disclosure (including disinhibition, cognitive processing, and social support), the question of how disclosers perceive online audiences, and how audience perceptions impact these mechanisms of self-disclosure, remains underexplored. This theoretical exposé proposes that audience perceptions play a key role in supporting benefits of online self-disclosure, and that these perceptions are constructed in variable ways through affordances of online groups. Design decisions therefore have potential to amplify or diminish mechanisms of self-disclosure benefit and to affect health and wellbeing outcomes. We propose a research agenda investigating the ways that disclosure effects unfold through a multistage process where website affordances shape audience perceptions, which in turn influence the disclosure event and subsequent reflection on the disclosure, and ultimately health and wellbeing.",Self-Disclosure Processes in Online Contexts,Communication and Technology

This study examined the intention of teachers to intervene in cyberbullying situation when they encounter it at school by utilizing the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and uses these results to provide suggestions for future cyberbullying interventions in India. Employing a survey of 402 teachers in Indian schools in 2016, this study investigates how attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and perceived responsibility affects teachers’ intentions to intervene. The results of hierarchical regression found that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control significantly influenced teachers’ intentions to intervene. All the TPB variables collectively explained 40.9 % of the variance in the intention to intervene. Perceived responsibility accounted for an additional small but significant amount of variance explained. Of all the predictor variables, attitude was the strongest predictor of teachers’ intention. This formative research informs the design of school-based interventions that aim to motivate teachers and provide them resources necessary to mitigate the impact of cyberbullying in Indian schools.",Top Papers in Instructional Communication Division,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Specifically, we tested nine different mediation models in which the three dimensions of instructor credibility (i.e., competence, caring, and trustworthiness) served as mediators, the three dimensions of instructor misbehaviors (i.e., antagonism, lectures, and articulation) served as the antecedents, and students’ willingness to express academic performance concern to their instructors served as the consequent. The results of correlational analyses and mediation analyses using PROCESS 2.16 largely supported the hypothesized relationships among the variables examined in this study, and our predictions that instructor credibility would mediate the relationship between instructor misbehaviors and students’ willingness to express academic performance concern to their instructors.",Top Papers in Instructional Communication Division,Instructional & Developmental Communication

Even in co-present interactions, they are used frequently. This inappropriate smartphone usage has been termed phubbing, compromising the words ‘phone’ and ‘snubbing’. Although being a worldwide phenomenon, little is known about what determines phubbing behavior in the first place. Drawing on injunctive norms (i.e., what ought to be done), this study’s aim is to shed light on the relationship between mobile phone norms and phubbing behavior. Based on today’s ‘always-on’ society, furthermore, the moderating role of permanently online/permanently connected (POPC) and fear of missing out (FoMO) on this relation is investigated. The findings of a quantitative online survey (N = 278) showed that mobile phone norms were, as expected, negatively related to phubbing behavior.

Studies examining the non-use of communication technologies focused on various new media resistance, but barely on cellphone resisters – individuals voluntarily deciding to not own cellphones. Based on in-depth interviews with cellular-refusers, the study presents two refuser types differing in refusal dynamics: “ideologists,” whose rejection stems from a formulated, critical worldview towards the cellular in particular, and communication technologies in general; and “realizers,” whose “post-factum resistance” resulted from a forced but positive experience of a temporary break in use (e.g. when their device was broken or stolen), motivating them to disconnect in an attempt to preserve the new, liberated space they experienced. Additionally, the study deals with the psychological and sociological motives underlying cellular refusal, and with the refusers’ resistance discourse, which focuses solely on the medium’s nature and not its content.",HIGH-DENSITY: Mobile Norms,Mobile Communication

The practices of using these applications bring about extensive visual and metric data through which individuals gain autobiographical insight into their lives: Places and events visited, people seen, food eaten, kilometres run, hours slept, etc. Visual and numeric data are often combined in these practices for documenting and storing the self via the smartphone. For example, metadata establish when and where selfies have been taken and self-tracking apps provide options for taking and posting images and for visualizations through maps and graphs.

However, computer mediated communication has evolved since that time. Regarding time- and location-independent communication, WhatsApp has become one of the most popular mobile applications therefore potentially affecting both the formation and maintenance of social capital. Thus, this study continues the theoretical and methodological approach of Ellison et al.

In societies where death is a near-taboo, implicit norms require mourning to be limited both in expression and duration. This reduces possibilities for coping with the situation, and bereaved parents experience a lack of support and understanding both from health care and in their everyday life. However, the affordances of mobile technologies and social media offer bereaved parents new possibilities for support in their process of adapting to the loss of a child. Based on surveys and interviews with members and moderators in a closed community on Facebook, this study shows that the possibility of “high quality emergency response” through instant access to peers available through social media and mobile technologies is of vital importance to grieving parents.",HIGH-DENSITY: Mobile Norms,Mobile Communication

In order to contribute to an understanding of how the Turkish media industry helps the government to constitute hegemonic discourses through the articulation of neoliberalism in the realm of public discourse and to preserve status quo of the neoliberal order, I examine discursive representations, hegemonic struggles, and different alignments of Turkish and the Middle Eastern agents represented in the Turkish media.

To investigate synergistic effects between satire and news, the design varied whether the news and comedy segments were viewed alone or in sequence (news before comedy or comedy before news). The results show that all four treatments (news-only, comedy-only, news-comedy, comedy-news) significantly increased support for refugees from pre-test to post-test, and these effects were maintained after a two-week delay. However, the effects were significantly greater in the three comedy conditions relative to news-only.

Unlike other studies, we argue that celebrity influence on political attitudes is a complex process involving a favorable attitude towards celebrities that enhances enjoyment of the political activities attended by celebrities, and subsequently influences political attitudes of fans of a celebrity culture. By introducing a new measure, Political Influence of Celebrities Scale (PICS), we examined the psychometric properties of this scale designed to explore the extent to which celebrities politically inspired their fans. We explored the factor structure, internal consistency, and the relationship between assorted dimensions of PICS. We confirmed our results employing a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which examined the three-factor construct and found sufficient evidence that confirmed and validated the scale.",Issues in Political Communication,Mass Communication

The present study investigated whether implicit and explicit attitudes predict news choice in Muslims with migration backgrounds living in Germany. We used both attitude constructs to predict a selection bias for news about the same event stemming from the host country (Germany) vs. from other countries. Using a survey (N = 1,107), we found that favorable implicit and explicit attitudes toward Germany increased a participant’s tendency to select German news. Each attitudinal construct predicted a unique variance in news choice. Using a subsample of Turkish citizens living in Germany who participated in the Turkish constitutional referendum 2017 (N = 241), we found that the attitude-based selection bias predicted their voting decision.

This study aimed to determine the direct causal relationship of the points-based reward system on PA in children. A 72-hour field experiment with children aged 9-13 (N = 67) was conducted using a digital PA intervention featuring a virtual dog, with and without a points-based reward system. Overall PA, three levels of PA intensity, and PA maintenance over time were measured with an activity monitor. Results indicated that the points-based reward system did not significantly affect overall PA. However, children’s strategy differed when they were exposed to a points-based reward system, promoting significantly higher engagement in light intensity than moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. Results also indicated that the points-based reward system might promote perceptions of relatedness with the virtual agent featured in the gamified intervention.",Digital and Mobile Health Intervention Research,Health Communication

This study provides a summative evaluation of the Family HealthLink tool, using semi-structured interviews with breast cancer patients and support persons, to better understand how tool design and message content impact user perceptions. Users responded positively to many of the tool’s features, but the noted that it lacked a modern design. Participants felt much of the risk information was too generic and did not account for lifestyles factors. Users also did not consistently interpret qualitative risk assessments provided by the tool.

2018-0440,2018,Paper Session,Boundary Work and Journalism: Charting a Key Concept in Journalism Studies,2,"As a variety of social, political, economic, and technological influences reshape the media environment for news production and circulation, fundamental questions such as “what is journalism?” and “who is a journalist?” have become more pressing. At bottom, these are questions of boundaries—of determining how journalism comes to be demarcated from non-journalism, journalists from non-journalists, and so on. These are more than symbolic contests for control; they also mark a material struggle over resources. Although boundary work matters, there has been a lack of conceptual cohesiveness in what scholars mean by the term “boundaries” or in how we should think about specific boundaries of journalism. This paper offers a state-of-the-art analysis of boundary work and journalism. Most significantly, we refine a typology—of expansion, expulsion, and protection of autonomy—that organizes existing research on journalistic boundary work and highlights emerging opportunities for conceptual and empirical development.",Journalistic Boundary Work,Journalism Studies

Social network sites have played an important role in these processes, with the rapid emergence of non-traditional actors engaging in activities that can be classified as journalism. Yet, while scholarship on Twitter and Facebook has continually expanded, the visual platform Instagram has received comparatively little attention, even though it has become an important venue for new forms, particularly in lifestyle journalism. Through an examination of Instagram users' discursive constructions of journalistic boundaries and their role perceptions, this paper suggests that in many ways their approach to their work resembles traditional journalistic approaches. Even though many struggle to articulate their relation to the journalistic field, they express role perceptions that are similar to those of professional lifestyle journalists.",Journalistic Boundary Work,Journalism Studies

Consequently, meta-debates concerning how the news media deal with deviance and extremism has intensified in the digital media landscape. The present article analyzes metajournalistic discourse and media criticism following a highly controversial 42-minute studio interview with the spokesperson of a Norwegian Salafi-jihadist group (supportive of the actions of the ‘Islamic State’ in Syria). Through a qualitative analysis of meta-debates across media outlets and platforms the paper analyzes how the interview was debated and justified i) among journalists and commentators, ii) among external experts, and iii) among readers. It finds that journalists, commentators and external experts collectively mobilize against extremist threat, by evoking normative journalistic ideals. At the same time, legacy media’s coverage of extremism is criticized by experts on extremism, minority representatives and by the readers (in comment sections). Theoretically, the paper contributes to the literature on media criticism, metajournalistic discourse and mediated extremism.",Journalistic Boundary Work,Journalism Studies

The Impact of Children on Internet Use by Adults,1,"Scholars have observed that children can promote Internet adoption among adults by positively influencing skills acquisition. However, it is also possible that children discourage online engagement by adults, who may lean on them to act as proxy users. Both processes have been theorized, but the net result of these opposite effects has not been empirically tested. This study provides such as test, sourcing data from large-scale surveys in six Latin American countries. The results indicate that the presence of children is negatively correlated with Internet use by adults.

The present study investigates the use of sites like Facebook for supplementing weak-tie interactions, toward accumulating bridging social capital, or personal network and resource diversity. Path models and regressions analyses are used to analyze two waves of a national web survey drawn eight months apart (N = 436). Results indicate that weak-tie discussion contributes to bridging social capital, and access to bridging motivates additional weak-tie discussion. Facebook use is also source of weak-tie discussion, but not of bridging social capital, at least not directly. The site contributes to bridging indirectly though, by increasing weak-tie contact over the eight-month period. Levels of bridging social capital T1 are also key, and here determine whether Facebook gets used for weak-tie discussion at all, and how much of it spills over to social capital in the end.","Extending Scholarship on Social Capital Processes: Second Screens, Weak Ties, Requests for Support, and Multimodal Communication",Communication and Technology

This study examined how message publicness influences outcomes of support seeking by testing six potential underlying mechanisms. We conducted a 3 (publicness: private, medium, public) X 2 (problem severity: mild vs. severe) between-subjects online experiment with 196 college students. Participants were shown a screenshot of a fellow student’s message about a recent mishappening common among college students that was either delivered through public post, post visible to friends, or as a private message. Compared with public support seeking, private message led to more empathy and sympathy, higher likelihood to help and more effort in helping. Publicness increased attribution to social validation goal when the problem is not severe, reduced attribution to support seeking goal when the problem is severe, reduced favorable perceptions, and personalism, which all contributed to the failure of support seeking on social media.","Extending Scholarship on Social Capital Processes: Second Screens, Weak Ties, Requests for Support, and Multimodal Communication",Communication and Technology

Analyses from a serial mediation model showed no direct relationship, but there were several significant mediating pathways through individual social capital, civic engagement and emotional well-being. Further analyses of three age cohorts (18-34, 35-54, 55-70+) demonstrated two significant indirect pathways for the 18-34 cohort, one for the 35-54 cohort, and five for the 55-70+ cohort. Even though the oldest cohort used fewer communication technologies and had smaller social networks, they are more likely to benefit from multimodal communications because they are motivated to engage in behaviors that result in positive emotions and feelings, which in turn engenders overall well-being. The study points to the utility of a lifespan perspective in understanding the effects of communication technologies in society.","Extending Scholarship on Social Capital Processes: Second Screens, Weak Ties, Requests for Support, and Multimodal Communication",Communication and Technology

This relationship is mediated through online political discussion. Moreover, the between-country variation in the relationship between second screening and social media social capital is related to freedom of expression.","Extending Scholarship on Social Capital Processes: Second Screens, Weak Ties, Requests for Support, and Multimodal Communication",Communication and Technology
2018-0453,2018,Paper Session,"Invoking Gaming Nostalgia: Past Play, Entertaining Experiences, and Social Others",4,"RESEARCH PAPER: As video games have grown from distracting toys to emotional experiences, so have the people who play them. Gamers have spent on average nearly one-third of their lives with the medium, often during childhood, which provides for the potential for video games to spark a sense of nostalgia. The current study parsed out feelings of nostalgia for past gaming memories as a function of a game’s recalled entertainment value (in terms of enjoyment and appreciation), its ability to satisfy basic psychological needs (from self-determination theory), and the social and temporal context of the gaming memory. Older memories (on average, a decade or more) led to increased nostalgia, with unique variance in nostalgia also accounted for by a game’s appreciation, enjoyment, and the extent to which it fostered a sense of relatedness with others. Post-hoc analyses comparing popular genres mentioned by participants (platformers, FPS, and RPGs) found similar results.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

Due to the virtual nature of video games, it is possible that gamers can attribute morality to themselves (self-attribution) or to video game itself (game-attribution), which might influence how much guilt one feels for committing virtual wrongs. Drawing from previous research, the current paper reports results from a between-subjects experiment (playing as an immoral versus moral video game character) with measures of trait empathy, moral intuition sensitivity, attribution, and guilt. We partially replicate earlier findings but more importantly, we find self-attribution and game-attribution measures can extend understandings of user engagement with game characters. Moreover, the results provide evidence for a valid measure of attribution of video game behavior to either the game or the player. Implications are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

Cueing Sex-Based Stereotypes in Games,2,"RESEARCH PAPER: In an online between-subjects experiment manipulating the platform (analog tabletop, digital tablet computer, digital desktop computer) of a game, Splendor, 105 participants revealed several trends that enrich knowledge of stereotypes surrounding gaming and gamers. Compared to men, women were perceived as having less of an affinity for Splendor—confirming extant research on stereotypes and stereotype threat. While this trend emerged similarly between all versions of the game depicted, moderation analyses revealed an effect for participant characteristics. Specifically, greater gamer identity—and not gender identity—decreased individuals’ perceived differences between males’ and females’ affinity for Splendor. Given the power of stereotype threat in regard to women’s behaviors in gaming contexts (Kaye & Pennington, 2016) and the prominent and persistent public interest in gaming, we suggest that future research further examine these variables in the study of more diverse games and game platforms.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

In order to improve reliability of self-report experience measures by reducing satisficing in young children (< 8y), a straightforward 6-item combined visual and verbal differential scale is presented. This new type of instrument aims to account for the socio-cultural embeddedness of experience by juxtaposing the stimulus with familiar activities in the lives of young children. The procedure for identifying these activities is described and the resulting scale is validated in two experimental studies. Results suggest that RES-C provides more reliable, normally distributed data when compared to existing instruments and shows higher content, concept and criterion-related validity. Furthermore, results indicate that it is more sensitive than existing methods in that it is able to detect variation in enjoyment between gaming and traditional learning experimental conditions in contrast to existing methods.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

The experiment compared attitude outcomes between players who assumed the roles of an Israeli, Palestinian or Western reporter in a computerized simulation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The first two represent directly involved parties to the conflict, while the latter represents a distant party to the situation. Two hundred and forty Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian undergraduate students participated in the experiment. They filled in questionnaires measuring attitudes before and after playing the game. Results suggested that participants playing the role of a distant party became more impartial regarding the conflict than those playing the roles of directly involved parties. The results show that role playing is crucial in determining whether Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian participants will become impartial regarding the conflict or not.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

Since mobile games often use a free-to-play business model that involves additional in-game purchases, some monetary and event mechanics of mobile games have been controversial in Japan. This study analyzes the long-term effects of monetary and event features of game mechanics by combining a systematic analysis of mobile social games with a longitudinal study. Having no monetary or event features increased game addiction scores six months later when previous game addiction scores were controlled. However, players who were exposed to one monetary mechanic, in-game purchase of continuing battles with other players, were likely to spend more time playing games six months later. Players who were exposed to a higher amount of limited-time only gacha, a lottery mechanics, were likely to spend more money six months later, but players who were exposed to a lower amount of normal gacha were likely to spend more money later. Those effects were found especially among players who preferred gambling. The results imply that some game mechanics can cause excessive use of time and money for certain players, but monetary and event mechanics are not directly linked to game addiction per se.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies
2018-0459,2018,Paper Session,Cleaning Up the (Virtual) Environment: Communicating Risk and Minimizing Psychological Distance With a Serious Game,3,"Persuading individuals to engage in pro-environmental behavior is challenging. One reason is the psychological distance people experience with environmental issues such as climate change. Interactive media such as serious games present opportunities to mitigate psychological distance and bolster perceived risks associated with environmental threats. In this experiment, participants (N = 190) entered a virtual environment and navigated down a polluted river that was geographically close or distant. Participants were able to clean up the river; the scenery either changed contingent on the users’ actions or regardless of their actions. Feeling close to the environment (i.e., lower psychological distance) led to greater risk perception; greater interactivity led to greater self-efficacy. Both of these outcomes led to more environmental behavior and greater support for environmental policy in the days following the experiment. We discuss how affordances and their perceptions are crucial to the success of serious games and persuasive virtual environments.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

While current literature mostly addresses the psychological processes that form different types of player-avatar relationship, lesser is known about the roles of game design elements in the construction of player-avatar relationships. The current study explores how game design elements – namely, game narrative, game mechanics, and game system interface – influence players’ construction of player-avatar relationship. Twenty-eight adults who played an action adventure PS4 game, The Last of Us, participated in game play interviews and semi-structured in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis of the results revealed six different themes that explained how participants relate to their game avatars through their use of game design elements. Subsequently, it discussed three major ways in which players construct player-avatar relationships.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies
2018-0462,2018,Paper Session,State of Play: Games and Moral Dilemmas,4,"Morality is a fundamental component of the human experience, and videogames are no exception to this rule. The history of “ethically notable games” is almost as long as the history of gaming itself, with formative examples appearing in the early 1980s. Following the success of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Bioware, 2003), it became something of a trend for videogames to feature “morality meter” systems in which the player’s moral decisions contribute to an overall “morality score” for their character. Subject to criticism from academics, critics, and fans, morality meters have fallen out of favor and there is now a “growing corpus” of ENGs that treat morality with greater care and nuance. In this paper we will examine three Ethically Notable Games: Firewatch, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and Darkest Dungeon, focusing in each case on unusual or innovative design features for facilitating moral engagement. Limiting ourselves to games released in the last two years, our primary goal is to provide a state-of-play for ENGs and identify elements that designers and academics can use in their own work.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies

This study examined the social network of a Battlefield 4 gaming clan through the lens of social exchange theory. We explored, via social network analysis, what resources the most central members of this gaming clan provided. The results suggested that more central members of the clan contributed significantly more time and money to the clan than others. In addition, central members of this clan revived other members in-game more often. This study extends social exchange theory from face-to-face interaction to the virtual world, by showing communicative factors that influence online gamer networks, and to game studies by offering results applicable to online gaming clans. This study shows how gamers engage in various types of social exchanges and earn central positions within the network in return for their investment of time, money, and communication.","HIGH-DENSITY: Games Studies, a lot have Hatched; All the Research, Gotta Catch",Game Studies
2018-0464,2018,Paper Session,Children’s Cognitive Responses to Constructive Television News,5,"Given the importance of news in preparing children for their role as active citizens in society, insight into how negative news can be delivered to children most optimally is warranted. Therefore, the current study investigated how constructive (i.e., solution-based news stories including positive emotions) as compared to nonconstructive news reporting affected recall of television news. An experiment (N=281 children, 9-13 years old) was conducted. Analyses revealed that children in the constructive condition displayed a lower recall of the general information about the event. However, they recalled specific stories better than children in the nonconstructive condition. Fear and sadness elicited by the news did not mediate the relation between news reporting style and recall. Instead, constructive reporting directly induced smaller increases in fear and sadness than nonconstructive reporting. Thus, results suggest that the negative aspects of the news event were less prominently available in memory of children exposed to constructive news.","Raising Civically-Minded Youth: Digital Literacy, Civic Engagement, and Political Consciousness",Children Adolescents and the Media

Analyzing 1,116 creative artifacts and 14,202 associated comments posted in the two weeks following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we find that online spaces offer a valuable window into the main concerns experienced by youth around the election, which they voice through unique modes of expression. The data also highlights the social aspects of peer discussion and learning. At the same time, participants exhibit uncertainty regarding the limits of free speech and the potential consequences for speaking out. We argue that online spaces should be acknowledged as a significant channel for youth political expression and socialization, and consider how the practices encountered there could shape our approach to civic education.","Raising Civically-Minded Youth: Digital Literacy, Civic Engagement, and Political Consciousness",Children Adolescents and the Media

First, it explicated each effect of the four main components of digital literacy such as access, problem solving (analysis and evaluation), communicating and creating. A nationwide survey of more than 2,500 South Korean students about social media use showed that all components but access were significant predictors of various activities of engagement. Next, we tested if there were any salient differences among the low, medium and high -news attention groups. Digital literacy components were significantly and consistently related to engagement among high-news attention respondents. In the low-attention group, however, the variables rarely predicted participation. The normative and practical implication for digital literacy education and the function of news regarding the connection between digital literacy and engagement were discussed.","Raising Civically-Minded Youth: Digital Literacy, Civic Engagement, and Political Consciousness",Children Adolescents and the Media

A face-to-face survey was conducted with 1200 adolescents in South Korea. According to the results of this study, digital connectedness and the access dimension of digital media literacy have a negative influence on civic engagement, and the understanding dimension of digital media literacy positively impacts civic engagement related to both political and social issues. There is an interaction effect between the understanding dimension of digital media literacy and tolerance, and tolerance plays a role in increasing civic engagement. This suggests that it is necessary to teach tolerance as an individual attitude alongside digital media literacy when enhancing civic engagement.","Raising Civically-Minded Youth: Digital Literacy, Civic Engagement, and Political Consciousness",Children Adolescents and the Media

2018-0472,2018,Paper Session,Feminism and Queer Counterpublics in China: The Case of Activist Media “Queer Lala Times”,1,"Recent years have witnessed the development and increasing visibility of China’s feminist and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) movement. From the feminist movement perspective, Chinese feminists have not only utilized the traditional media to achieve public support and extract government responses in order to instill the feminist concept into the public sphere, but also adopted a strategy of digital masquerading to tactically avoid censorship, assemble feminist activism, and remake publicness. From the LGBTQ movement perspective, one characteristic of China’s LGBTQ movement is the emerging alternative media practices from sexual minority groups, affording the opportunities for such groups to speak out voices and advocate rights. Utilizing Uzelman’s (2012) analytical tool of autonomous media, this paper examines how Queer Lala Times (QLT) exists as an organization in the Chinese society. This paper analyzes QLT’s organizational form, mode of governance, process of production, relationship to audiences, and professional norm. Specifically, as a radical activist media organization, QLT aims to experiment new relations and modes of organization differentiated from traditional media practices; its mode of governance is based on the Internet and is characterized in its dialogicality, negotiability, and flexibility; its process of production is democratic and participatory; its relationship to audiences is collaborative and interactive; its professional norm is anti-discrimination, anti-violence, and diversity-oriented. The study finds that, whilst facing state control and censorship inevitably, QLT can be seen as a radical feminist and queer activist media for two reasons: first, it introduces and develops queer theory into China; second, it highlights both public and private issues discussed in the feminist and LGBTQ community. QLT’s political and social beliefs imagine a more open, inclusive, democratic, and egalitarian public sphere for gender equality and LGBTQ rights through civic participation and public education.",Alternative Media and Counter Narratives,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

Populism is defined as a thin ideology and four dimensions of populist communication are distinguished: people-centrism, anti-elitism, popular sovereignty, and exclusion. We analyze online news articles and reader comments during election campaigns in France, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. We find that comment sections are more populist than online news articles and that the majority of populist messages in online news articles originate from politicians, not from journalists. However, we further show that opinion-oriented stories are more prone to populist messages by media actors than straight news items, which favor populism by political actors. Finally, we investigate how online news media moderate populist messages disseminated by political actors.",Understanding Populist Communication Practices,Political Communication

It is an open question, if this leads them to avoid specific news genres. This is a secondary analysis of two large multi-national datasets from 2015 (11 countries, N = 10,570) and 2017 (4 countries, N = 2,165) examining populist attitudes as predictor for media use. Results show that populist citizens are more likely to consume news than non-populist citizens. Moreover, across countries populist citizens show a robust preference for tabloid newspapers and commercial TV news. While they use fewer quality newspapers, public service TV is not systematically avoided. Moreover, populist citizens are not more likely than others to turn to online only news sources for political information. However, they prefer Facebook over Twitter. This selective pattern will be discussed in light of the debates on audience fragmentation and societal polarization.",Understanding Populist Communication Practices,Political Communication

We understand populism as a thin ideology that is articulated discursively by political and media actors and focus on two ideational constituents of media populism, namely ‘people centrality’ and ‘anti-elitism’ to investigate three possible theoretical explanations for their proliferation: media as ‘gatekeepers’, ‘interpreters’ and ‘originators’ of populism. Adopting a rarely taken media-centric perspective and employing a research design of unparalleled scope in this research field, we analyze 9000 news stories published between 2014 and 2015 in 59 media outlets from 10 European countries on migration and the labor market.

An Analysis of Social Media and Talk Shows in Six Countries,5,"To understand the rise and success of populism, populist communication must be investigated. In a hybrid and high choice media system, the comparison of various media channels is especially fruitful. We argue that populist communication is a combination of key messages (content) and communication styles (form), and we compare its utilization by a broad range of political actors on Facebook, Twitter, and political talk shows across six countries (CH, DE, FR, IT, UK, and US). We conducted a content analysis of social media and talk show statements (N = 2067) from 31 parties during a non-election period of three months in 2015. First, the study demonstrates that seven populist communication styles form three distinct dimensions – negativity, emotionalization, and sociability. Moreover, we confirm that political parties are generally more inclined to use populist communication on social media than in political talk shows and that both new challenger and extreme parties use higher amounts of populist communication.",Understanding Populist Communication Practices,Political Communication
2018-0477,2018,Paper Session,Information Sharing to Promote Risky Health Behavior on Social Media,1,"A large number of posts promoting risky health behavior are posted on social media, but not all posts are widely disseminated. Disseminated information is more likely to influence social media users as users may not be exposed to non-disseminated posts. Thus, this study focuses on principal features of disseminated Twitter posts that attract individuals who promote smoking behavior. After collecting 6,432 tweets and analyzing highly propagated and non-propagated tweets, this study found that Tweets expressing emotional support were observed more than expected among the pro-smoking group and less than expected among the anti-smoking group. Affective tone was also found to be an important factor in Tweet dissemination both in pro- and anti-smoking groups. Interestingly, in the pro-smoking group, Tweets having a negative tone were shared more than those having a positive tone.

More importantly, we sought to determine whether this relationship might vary by opposite marijuana legislation. College students were sampled from Washington State, where marijuana is legalized for medical and recreational purpose, and the state of Wyoming, where marijuana is not legalized. Our results showed that college students who had a higher level of perceived injunctive norms about pro-marijuana messages were more likely to share the messages on social media. Interestingly, college students in Washington were marginally more likely to share pro-marijuana messages on social media than those who in Wyoming at the high level of a perceived injunctive norm of typical students on their campus about the messages, whereas, when at the low level, it was predicted in the opposite way.

Arguing critical concepts, such as a valence of communication, impression management, perceived risks and benefits, this study develops the O1-S-R1-O2-R2 model. The analysis, first, shows that an impression of smokers mediates the relationship between exposure to smoking-related contents and the valence of expression of smoking behavior. Second, the effect of exposure to pro-smoking contents on smoking behavior is mediated by an impression of smokers, a favorable expression of smoking, and perceived benefits. Third, the effect of exposure to anti-smoking contents on smoking behavior is mediated by an unfavorable expression of smoking and perceived risks. Finally, an impression of smokers has not only a direct effect but also a mediating effect on smoking behavior through perceived risks and benefits.",The Dark Side?

A cross-sectional survey was administered among 770 college students (nUS=253, 24% male; nBelgium=487, 34% male) aged 18-20, using structural equation modeling for the analysis. Exposure to alcohol references was similarly related to drinking intentions through more positive descriptive and injunctive norms for both populations. Sharing alcohol references was also similarly related to drinking intentions through more positive attitudes. However, only among Belgian respondents was sharing alcohol references also related to drinking intentions through descriptive and injunctive norms and perceived behavioral control. Overall, this study points to the generalizability of attitudes and social norms as mechanisms of alcohol-related social media (self-)effects among emerging adult college students across Western drinking cultures.",The Dark Side?

2018-0482,2018,Paper Session,Fear Appeals: Advances Through Meta-Analysis,2,"This manuscript provides a systematic narrative review of the 11 fear appeal meta-analyses conducted from 1984 to present. The preponderance of evidence indicates that threatening communication has small effects on attitude, intention, and behavior, and that there are a few factors that can further enhance the effectiveness of fear appeals, sometimes greatly. Most notably, fear appeals are most effective when they (1) focus on both components of threat—i.e., severity and susceptibility, and (2) focus on both components of efficacy—i.e., self-efficacy and response-efficacy. In spite of this clear pattern of findings, two-thirds of fear appeal studies include just a single component of threat (i.e., just severity or susceptibility, but not both), and two-thirds of fear appeal studies include just the threat component (i.e., there was no efficacy component). The theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of these findings are discussed, as recommendations for future research and meta-analyses in this area.",New Research on Fear Appeals in Health Contexts,Health Communication

Attention patterns were captured while participants viewed the health message. A particular emphasis was placed on understanding the role of valence and arousal in determining defensive avoidance processes. Such processes were found in the high threat message condition, particularly for those who suffered from more severe depression symptoms. Furthermore, arousal mediated the effects of strong fear appeals on attitudes toward information-seeking, whereas negative emotions did not. Caution is warranted when utilizing fear appeals in vulnerable populations affected by depression.",New Research on Fear Appeals in Health Contexts,Health Communication

Our findings illustrate the importance of distinguishing between subjective knowledge and objective knowledge. While the latter has desirable impact on formulating intentions among young adults to resist e-cigarette use by contributing to negative attitude and perceived severity, the former seems to activate defensive motivation among people who have used e-cigarettes before and lead them to engage in fear-control mode after being exposed to fear-appeal messages. These results offer important theoretical implications for research related to the EPPM. In terms of practical implications, our findings suggest that health communication efforts that target young adults who currently use e-cigarettes should focus on making a case that having experience with the product does not equate to actual knowledge about the risks involved.",New Research on Fear Appeals in Health Contexts,Health Communication

Historically, the news media have been an important information source for voters during elections, and may influence voters’ choice. In the recent election, social media was a popular source to obtain news concerning the election and presidential candidates. However, in the three months preceding the election day, an exponential increase in fake news stories was observed, and seen to be more widely spread as compared to news from mainstream media sources. The present study presents a qualitative textual analysis of the top fake news stories in the months preceding the election day. It was discovered that the stories predominantly used propaganda aimed at activating heuristic rather than systematic psychological information processing. The particular heuristics that may have been activated to have led to such widespread propagation are discussed.",Media and Elections,Mass Communication

This study explores how voters (N= 657) evaluated media’s gatekeeping choices in the lead-up to the election, finding widespread agreement that news media misallocated attention to various election narratives. Voters disagreed, however, when estimating attention to negative narratives about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, with a candidate’s supporters, compared to nonsupporters, sensing media gave more attention to negative stories about their candidate. We introduce these perceptions of media attention as a form of the hostile media perception: the tendency for news consumers to see news as undesirably divergent from their preferences. We then present evidence that citizens believe media’s gatekeeping choices have consequences–not on themselves–but on other voters. The more citizens believed news coverage missed the mark, the less prepared they believed the public was to make an informed choice at the polls.",Media and Elections,Mass Communication

It means that well-known celebrities publicly support political candidates or parties in election campaigns. Since most studies focus on the US, little is known about the effects of celebrity political endorsement in Europe. The present study aims to fill this gap by testing the effectiveness of such endorsements in the context of the 2014 European parliamentary election. Online-experiments were conducted in five European countries (Germany, Great Britain, Spain, Poland, and Sweden), measuring effects of celebrity endorsements on attitudes towards the EU and on vote intention. Political expertise, trustworthiness and likability of the endorser were included as moderating variables. Results show only few statistically significant effects and are furthermore inconsistent with the theoretical assumptions. Given that celebrity political endorsement does not elicit the assumed effects in European countries, we discuss possible explanations for our results.",Media and Elections,Mass Communication

Central to the debate is whether, to what extent, and under what conditions the social media affordances that enable information to rapidly circulate also encourage misinformation and disinformation. If media are resources that people use to try to influence others on social media, then, in the UK context, where US-style fake news “factories” do not play a role, key among the resources that matter are articles published by mainstream tabloid outlets, whose stock-in-trade has always been sensationalized and exaggerated news. Integrating four unique datasets we gathered during the 2017 UK general election campaign—individual-level data on people’s posting and news sharing on Twitter (N=1,525,748 tweets), website data (N=17,989 web domains), news article data (N=641 articles) and data from a custom-designed survey of Twitter users (N=1,313 respondents)—we find that sharing tabloid news articles on social media is a significant predictor of democratically-dysfunctional misinformation and disinformation behaviors on UK social media.

Inspired by recent shifts across the news media landscape, we explore the extent to which three headline factors—slant, source, and accuracy — shape how different ideological groups assess news headlines and verify information. Guided by the literature on motivated reasoning, we focus on the interplay between contextual cues and the biased processing that ideological groups are prone to. Using an experimental design with a national sample of adults, we investigate how liberals, conservatives, and moderates: a) evaluate the truthfulness of headlines, b) decide to verify headline claims by using various fact-checking mechanisms, and c) detect misinformation in a headline.

Using population-level time-series behavioral data of audience exposure to NYT articles and associated article content and context data, the study found that content positivity and emotional evocativeness increased the length of time for which news stories attract selection. Audience selection of articles was also more likely to persist when the articles stayed longer on the “most-viewed” list, demonstrating social influence-driven cumulative advantage effects. The results further revealed a synergistic interaction effect between social influence and emotional evocativeness on the lifespan of news articles: While social influence exerted strong cumulative-advantage effects, articles conveying highly emotionally evocative content produced even stronger social-influence effects than those staying on the “most-viewed” list for the same amount of time but delivering less emotionally evocative content.",News Goes Digital,Mass Communication

Drawing on the concept of social navigation and selective exposure research, this paper aims to investigate the relative importance of social media characteristics (web metrics and user comments) compared to the topic of the news post when selecting journalistic articles on social media platforms. Furthermore, we ask if the incongruence or congruence of the journalists’ reported political opinion and the political opinion in the related user comments increase the article’s likeliness of being selected by the audience. Applying a choice-based conjoint design, data were collected through an online survey. Findings illustrate the importance of user-generated figures and opinions for the selection of journalistic news posts on Facebook and suggest that controversy between the reported journalistic and a user’s opinion is more likely to foster selection than congruent opinions.",News Goes Digital,Mass Communication

Focusing on the increasing use of MIMs in today’s organizations, this study aims to explain how different aspects of KakaoTalk, the most dominant MIM in Korea, influence employees’ attitudes toward their current employers, and how these attitudes impact the employees’ intentions to stay at their present workplaces. Overall, with the exception of one factor (satisfaction with KakaoTalk use), all other factors (perceived quality of information exchanged through KakaoTalk, belongingness through KakaoTalk, and KakaoTalk overload) significantly influenced employee’s attractiveness toward their current employers. Specifically, while KakaoTalk overload’s effect on perceived organizational attractiveness was negative, two other factors were positively associated with it. Perceived organizational attractiveness also strongly influenced employees’ intention to stay at their present workplaces.

This paper suggests the problem is better understood as an epistemological imbalance. We suggest that one epistemology—we call it “universalism”—underpins much comparative scholarship. While this approach produces numerous comparative insights, it also struggles to adequately account for the diversity of contexts it studies. We therefore describe an alternative epistemology, which we term “contextualism,” which aims to identify the mechanisms or principles that link cases across contexts. We suggest that progress in the field depends in part on the co-existence of multiple epistemologies, each with careful awareness of its strengths and limitations.","The Production of Knowledge About Journalism: Academic, Professional and Educational Perspectives",Journalism Studies

The Role of ‘Pioneer Journalists’ and ‘Pioneer Communities’ in Transforming Journalism,2,"Based on qualitative interviews conducted in the Bay Area (USA), Berlin (Germany), Lisbon (Portugal) and Perugia (Italy) we will present an analysis of how pioneer journalists interact and imagine the journalism’s future. First, we will reflect in more detail on the role of ‘professional pioneers’ in journalism. From this basis, we will explain our methodological approach and the foundations of our data. Arguing alongside four extreme cases of pioneer journalists, we will discuss in more detail how they act and which futures of journalism they imagine. Based on such an analysis we will come to some more general conclusions about the role of pioneer journalists and their pioneer communities as ‘makers’ of a future of journalism.","The Production of Knowledge About Journalism: Academic, Professional and Educational Perspectives",Journalism Studies
2018-0507,2018,Paper Session,Journalism Education for Democratization: Lessons from Norway’s Experiment in Ethiopia,1,"Although the number of journalism education programs in Sub-Saharan Africa has historically been low, recent trends indicate a rise both in scope and specialization. While this increase is usually attributed to higher education institutions’ response to market demands, certain journalism education programs are born out of development assistance initiatives that envision nation building processes of democratization and development. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) is notable for its involvement in higher education journalism training at a graduate level in select developing countries. This paper assesses the presently discontinued involvement of NORAD in the establishment of a graduate journalism program at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia between 2004-2007. In doing so, it reviews what has been learned over the lifespan of NORAD’s sponsorship of the program by discussing what worked and what did not work.","The Production of Knowledge About Journalism: Academic, Professional and Educational Perspectives",Journalism Studies

Journalists, feminists and the public tweeted back and forth to determine if Watson was either a hypocrite who championed feminism while appealing to the male gaze, or an empowered woman who expressed her sexuality artistically and freely. This study looked at mainstream media and women’s magazines’ coverage of this controversy to identify and interrogate the postfeminist sensibility that informed it. Postfeminist notions of female empowerment, individuality, choice, and the body as a source of power dominated the media discourse. Neoliberal political investments were also present in the analyzed articles. The paper reflects on the pitfalls of postfeminist sensibility, and calls for more nuanced coverage of and discussions about feminism in popular mass media.",Redefining the Feminist Identity in Today's World,Feminist Scholarship

Wang hong are the fulcrum of contemporary cultural labor, who not only generate economic and financial capitals for different industrial stakeholders, but also produce social and cultural capitals to articulate their aspirations and ambitions. They actively package themselves into a whole set of lifestyle for sale, expressing their autonomy and pleasure while simultaneously subject to self-governed.

2018-0511,2018,Paper Session,Perpetuating Pop Culture Postfeminism: A Feminist Analysis of Emma Watson’s UN Address,1,"On September 20th, 2014, Emma Watson delivered an address to the United Nations for the launch of UN Women’s HeForShe campaign. Though it was written for a specific event and gained wide reception due to the setting of the UN and Watson’s notability, the speech is shaped by the context of modern feminism, competing postfeminist discourse, and a tradition of celebrity advocacy. Through feminist and ideographic critical lenses, I argue that Watson’s speech successfully reframes as a beneficial movement, and effectively reconstructs gender expectations. However, it falls short of fulfilling third wave feminist goals by reverting to male-centeredness and missing opportunities to unite the feminist movement through advocacy of intersectionality. Ultimately, Watson’s emphasis on responding to the criticism of postfeminist discourse results in a misuse of celebrity diplomacy that shifts the attention of the feminist movement to men on an international stage, while actively disregarding intersectionality and global perspectives.

Immediately the hashtag began by the editors of the article, #AmplifyWomen, erupted with arguments against this premise. This study conceptualizes the Twitter response to this article as an “affective public” (Papacharissi, 2015) and employs the method of “hashtag ethnography” (Bonila & Rosa, 2015) as a means to investigate this public. Ultimately, I argue that though it is through a reliance on the tropes of postfeminism that Christian celebrity bloggers have gained their influence, the affective public that emerged to defend them mobilized a tactical rhetoric (following Certeau, 1984) to resist the dominant patriarchal structure of evangelicalism. Furthermore, I assert that this public points to the beginnings of a connective feminist movement in evangelicalism brought about by the affordances of digital media.",Redefining the Feminist Identity in Today's World,Feminist Scholarship
2018-0513,2018,Paper Session,#BlackLivesMatter to #dogsatpollingstations (but not #CrookedHillary): Platform Politics and the Visual Affect of Twitter hashflags,1,"During the 2010 men’s football World Cup, Twitter launched a new feature: hashflags, pictograms of competing nations’ flags, which accompanied hashtags for each nation. These ‘hashtag emoji’ were intended as a fun, temporary addition for fan tweets, and have become a major commercial strategy for Twitter. Partnerships with brands, films, and television programs have led to promotional hashflags, presented as exclusive features that can only be ‘unlocked’ by using specific hashtags. Unlike the discursive flexibility of the Unicode emoji set, hashflags are only accessible with particular hashtags. Furthermore, the feature imposes meaning and intentionality onto tweets.

This paper examines the implications of hashflags as a platform intervention that risks overlooking or counteracting user intentions and cultures. It explores the selective politics of platforms exemplified by Twitter hashflags, focusing on the tensions created between platform privilege, user practices, and the platform’s role and influence in public communication.","Rethinking Participatory Media, Spectatorship and the Witness",Visual Communication Studies

Findings reveal similar rankings by both groups regarding the importance of content, structure and technical mastery. Citizens found professional and citizen media to provide similarly credible content, but visual professionals viewed citizen media as significantly less credible—a sentiment reflected in their confidence regarding the public’s source differentiation capabilities. Further, the expectations by professionals and actual submissions of visual content by citizens did not align. Visual professionals exhibited a much more guarded attitude toward their citizen counterparts while citizen contributors appeared to indulge in the opportunity to participate in visual journalistic activities.","Rethinking Participatory Media, Spectatorship and the Witness",Visual Communication Studies

Eyewitness photographs and recordings is a growing genre of images, which are difficult for organisations to respond to, because they are regarded as more authentic and true than other images of crisis events. In addition, it is here argued that widely circulated eyewitness imagery often involve iconic motifs with already established interpretation repertoires. The paper identifies and discusses three types of organisational response strategies to iconic imagery in eyewitness footage of a violent encounter between a boy and a security guard at a train station, which raises questions of organisational responses to visual representation and power.","Rethinking Participatory Media, Spectatorship and the Witness",Visual Communication Studies

2018-0517,2018,Paper Session,The Distant Sufferer: Measuring Spectatorship of Photojournalism,1,"Recent studies of graphic images indicate that pictures have the power to mobilize people via emotions. Yet little is known about other potential reactions embedded in the theory of distant suffering, such as apathy or voyeuristic pleasure. This study uses an experiment to, for the first time, quantify overlapping roles of the spectatorship of suffering. Via cluster analysis I explore in which combinations responses of empathy, voyeurism, protest and apathy co-occur within spectators. Exposing participants to victimizing photographs of children and adults suffering during the Syrian civil war suggests that personal characteristics of participants like gender play a larger role in the processing of distant suffering than the pictures’ content. Besides shedding light on audience perception of suffering, this study provides empirical evidence for a fuller range of potential responses to photojournalism.

The current study aims to identify a function of the observable characteristics of cardiovascular tweets, including characteristics of the source, content, and style in predicting the retransmission of these tweets. We drew a random sample of 1,251 tweets associated with cardiovascular disease originating from the U.S. in 2013. Automated coding was conducted on the affect values of the tweets as well as the presence/absence of any URL, mention of another user, question mark, exclamation mark, and hashtag. We hand-coded the tweets’ novelty, utility, theme and source. The count of retweets was positively predicted by message utility, health organization source, and mention of user handle, but negatively predicted by the presence of URL and non-health organization source. Regarding theme, compared to the tweets focusing on risk factor, tweets on treatment and management predicted fewer retweets while supportive tweets predicted more retweets. From the diffusion of innovations perspective, the study sheds light on using twitter to disseminate cardiovascular educational and supportive information to improve public health.",Trick or Tweet?

In an online experiment (N = 203), a tweet about the rumor related to food safety was presented with the variations of virality metrics (i.e., the number of retweets, likes, and replies). The results showed that exposure to high virality metrics resulted in greater perceptions of descriptive norms and injunctive norms of sharing the tweet, and in turn, increased message believability and viral behavioral intentions. Overall, findings demonstrated the normative influence of virality metrics.

In the context of this debate, we explore whether crowdfunding decreases or increases gaps between established academic centers (that currently enjoy more funding) and the academic periphery. We collected data on scientists requesting funding for their studies on Experiment.com – a popular scientific crowdfunding online platform and investigated the factors contributing to initiation and success. Crowdfunding appeals tended to come from larger, wealthier and more active and prestigious institutions. However, success at the institutional level was not predicted by the institution's status, but rather by the number of appeals from an institution, an indication that crowdfunding might have an equalizing impact.

The current study examines the wisdom of crowds performing collective evaluation tasks in an online community, as well as the structural factors that impact the crowd’s performance. We found evidence supporting the idea of wisdom of the crowd - their evaluation of the target was found to be predictive of the target's actual outcome. Consistent with prior theorization of the wisdom of crowds, crowd size positively influenced the crowd’s performance. Yet contrary to the theory, crowd disagreement (i.e. difference in opinions/attitudes within the crowd) negatively influenced the performance of crowds. In addition, while existing theories have neglected the effects of communication in crowd collaboration, we found that centralization of communication (i.e., inequality in communication network) was negatively related to the wisdom of crowds.",Trick or Tweet?

In contrast with Wodak’s thesis (2010), i.e. foreign political fictions greatly facilitate circulating political values and ideology with their own origins, our findings suggest that the meaning making of Chinese participants is more like domestically cultural circulation, than the globalization or glocalization of overseas political culture. The hierarchy, relationship and morality are interlinked, consisting of the major cultural premises for comprehending political fictions. We argue that participants’ appropriation of the three cultural premises to interpret politics together imply a kind of cynical attitude with uncertainty and fear about the abstract politics. Concerning the reception of political fictions, precariousness manifests in the distrust and uncertainty about the sociopolitical conditions determined by the hierarchical, relational, and moral factors.","Politics, Propaganda, Phobia: Diverse Cultural/Intercultural Perspectives",Intercultural Communication

Mass media, and many anti-Islam institutions played a significant role in spreading and perpetuating Islamophobia. In response to the negative media coverage, many Islamic organizations were established to counter such misperceptions and deliver the voices of the Muslim communities in the U.S. through various methods including the use of social media.  This paper examined major Islamic organizations’ use of social media. A total of 420 social media posts over the course of three months by five major U.S.-based Islamic organizations were gathered and analyzed using quantitative content analysis method. The results show that the Islamic organizations adopted different and complementary approaches to promote their values and combat Islamophobic perceptions. Using offensive and defensive strategies, the organizations tried to correct misconceptions about Islam and to replace some negative stereotypes about Muslims with positive associations.","Politics, Propaganda, Phobia: Diverse Cultural/Intercultural Perspectives",Intercultural Communication

Because parasocial interaction theory purports that athletes can have tremendous influence on fans’ opinions and behavioral intentions regarding health issues, it is important to understand how media framed athletes’ response to their risk of contracting Zika at the Games and the possibility of a global epidemic. The authors found that media employed three main frames: 1) the risk of Zika was small compared to potential Olympic glory, 2) participating in the Games is an individual choice between family and athletic career, and 3) Zika concerns employed as a convenient excuse to avoid a troubled Games. The combination of these frames painted a contradictory portrait of athletes’ risk perception, which arguably created uncertainty regarding fear of the Zika virus and the Games for the fans that admire them.","Communicating via Mega-Sporting Events: Content, Uses, and Effects",Sports Communication

We ask, how big must random document sample be to yield the same or very similar topics as compared to models based on the whole corpus? We empirically examine this approach by comparing models for variously sized random samples to reference models calculated for the whole corpus. Our preliminary results indicate a saturation effect: increasing the sample size beyond a certain threshold (between 10% and 20% of the corpus size) will not yield other topics compared to the reference models.",New Directions in Text Mining,Computational Methods

Both appear to share a common aim: to find underlying themes within data. Thematic analysis is based on detailed human interpretation of the data, while topic modeling is totally automated. This leads to them being useful in different ways: thematic analysis can lead to rich understanding but cannot be applied to big data in the way topic modeling can. Interactive machine learning is a recent approach that introduces more human involvement in machine learning processes such as topic modeling. This paper investigates whether it can be used to create research methods that can make use of rich human interpretation while being applicable to big data.

Simultaneously, supervised methods usually incur high costs as they are based on manually labeled text. Unsupervised methods, specifically topic models, have thus become popular in recent years because they can minimize human labor. However, these methods are typically challenging to validate, are not additive, and suffer from low generalization power. This paper proposes a three-phase solution that combines supervised and the unsupervised approaches to exploit the advantages of both—the low cost of human labor in unsupervised methods, and the capability of supervised methods to test theories. We test the validity of the classification by comparing it to human coding and also in the context of political and economic categories using the 2016 presidential elections and the Dow Jones index.",New Directions in Text Mining,Computational Methods

In particular, the inherent duality between stability and flexibility in conflict management has been explored from the three core principles of Yin-Yang paradigm. As a result, this paper has redefined adaptivity strategy and provides a corresponding operational definition. For both conflict management researchers and practitioners, this paper argues that a Yin-Yang paradigm perspective helps to further explore and effectively manage the inherent duality between personal integrity and situational adaptation in conflict management behaviors.",B.E.S.T.

Using a qualitative interview approach, I explore the emotional experiences of Korean social workers. Korean social workers experience wide array of different types of emotional work, however, expresses them implicitly and indirectly due to contemplative and considerate communication tactics in order to save others’ face and avoid burdening others with their emotions. Furthermore, the emotional work experience leads Korean social workers to develop a sense of pride, responsibility, and compassion toward their clients which were not inherent from the beginning of their professional experience due to lack of autonomy when choosing their profession. The findings not only support the different cultural norms and constraints that influence Korean social workers’ emotional work but also contribute to further the understanding of the role of organizations in providing proper outlets for emotional work experiences.",B.E.S.T.

The study focuses on a specific form of employer-employee encounter, namely performance appraisal interviews, and it builds on a collection of central sequences, where an employee’s complaint about a given matter makes relevant a managerial response. The findings indicate that managerial responsibility is multi-facetted and multi-modally accomplished and it consists of three central aspects: complaint acceptance, problem resolution, managerial agency. The way managers balance these different aspects in their responses is highly dependent on the way, the employee complaint is raised and produced. In sum, the study highlights the co-constructive nature of organizational responsibilities and enhances our understanding of talk’s reflexive participation in the constitution of organizational reality.",B.E.S.T.

While there is a longstanding tradition to study strategic dialogue, those studies have mostly reported on interventions that brought together a range of organizational actors, without actually looking at how people talked to each other. In contrast, the literature on Strategy as Practice has emphasized that strategy is something that is done, but has overlooked dialogue to this day. By combining both approaches, and by taking seriously the notion of dialogue as a creative space, we were able to show that strategic dialogue consists of an interplay of autonomous matters of concerns. Through that interplay, strategy is discovered rather than decided upon, and attributed to specific organizations, thus turning them into actors and participating in their communicative constitution.",B.E.S.T.

With a survey of 206 employees in Hong Kong’s organizations, this study examined relationships among sex stereotyping, communication style, leadership style, and perceived managerial effectiveness. Results indicated that communication style explained more variance in managerial effectiveness than did leadership style. Male managers received slightly higher ratings on communication assertiveness, autocratic leadership, participative leadership, planning effectiveness, and performance management effectiveness whereas female managers received higher ratings only on relationship management. After communication style and leadership style were considered, male stereotyping explained additional variances of 5% to 10% in four of the five aspects of male managers’ effectiveness, whereas male and female stereotyping explained additional variances of .7% and 8.2% in female managers’ relationship management and information provision effectiveness.

Women experienced everyday marginalization and subordination by being positioned as not competent business partners, not informal business network insiders, and not good partners or mothers. Facing and sometimes subscribing to hegemonic controls from masculine entrepreneurship ideals, gendered ideology, and patriarchal structures, women engaged in situated acts of dissent, circumvention, transgression, and/or conforming and reifying gendered control.

Relatedly, the ways in which young adults talk about their future careers or particular aspects of their careers, such as their expectations for how leaders should relate and communicate, may also serve as a sensemaking tool and a source of anticipatory socialization. Through two mixed-methods studies (focus groups and a two-stage Q methodology), prominent managerial archetypes—or common approaches to managing—are explored, categorized, and nuanced. Archetypes are particularly powerful in terms of anticipatory socialization and for helping young adults make sense of the potential landscape of their future organizations by allowing them to proactively consider how this may impact their own communication tendencies and behaviors.",B.E.S.T.

Specifically, I examine the content and context of memorable messages about work and/or family. Themes of work enjoyment and marriage prevailed across memorable messages about work and family respectively. Regarding memorable messages on work, fathers communicated messages about having priorities and work input whereas mothers communicated messages about attitudes towards work (i.e., working hard, not missing work, and treating people well), the value of work (i.e., education and financial empowerment), perseverance, and offered encouragement. Regarding memorable messages on family, mothers communicated messages about marriage/relationship (i.e., prioritization of work over family, readiness for marriage/family, and premarital rules), family responsibility, and support/love/unity whereas fathers communicated messages about the importance of family (i.e., family is everything, family is first), marriage, and father responsibility.

Findings indicate that when children engage in online search and brokering on behalf of and with their parents, they become co-owners of private information, and gain access to intricate details that they might not have been exposed to otherwise—including information regarding the health and wellbeing of their parents or other family members. During urgent or sensitive health situations, privacy boundaries become particularly blurred as children are tasked with finding, translating, and interpreting high-level medical information that requires a certain degree of language proficiency and digital literacy. Child brokering and informal health advocacy during intergenerational online health information seeking thus poses important implications for communication privacy management within families.",Communicating Intergenerationally and About Aging,Interpersonal Communication

N = 320 young adults (age 18-30) completed a survey assessing their parents’ and grandparents’ negative talk about aging (NTA) and discussion of caretaking and death (DCD), and their own attitudes toward aging. Consistent with the CEMSA’s predictions, encountering NTA (from parents) was associated with young adults’ experiencing higher levels of negative affect and anxiety about aging, and lower levels of efficacy about aging. Family members’ DCD also predicted young adults’ communication about health-related care wishes, an important issue in aging successfully.

In this article, we make three theoretical contributions to BBTPE. First, we apply BBTPE to communication constructs by examining how emotional experiences predict cognitive flexibility, social skills, and social support. Second, we theorize and test the role of negative emotions in the broadening and building process. Third, we add a relational component to the theory by testing how partner emotions predict broadening and building outcomes among dyads. To test these expansions, we conducted Actor-Partner Interdependence models using multi-level modeling with reports from 148 mother-child dyads (N = 296). We observed that positive emotions positively predicted all three communication-based dependent variables for mothers and adult children, whereas negative emotions negatively predicted those outcomes.

This cross-cultural study examines youth media cultures in urban regions in Vietnam, Malaysia and Austria by investigating visual representations of self and together-ness in converging media environments (such as social network sites, chat applications, photo sharing platforms) as well as related concepts of intimacy.Firstly, qualitative in-depth interviews in combination with qualitative social network analysis (n=18, six from each country, Vietnam, Malaysia, Austria) was conducted to uncover how culturally variant concepts of intimacy as well as technological affordances affect the formation of communicative figurations (family, friendship), “selfies” and group photos (n=36, self-selected by the participants) were analyzed applying the method of reconstructive image interpretation. In a second step, seven more Austrian Interviews (three Instagramers and four users of the platform Snapchat) were added to widen the sample for ego network analysis.The results show that pictorial representations of Malayan, Vietnamese and Austrian youth vary with regards to aesthetic style and the individual’s position within the group and the surrounding environment, which points towards different underlying concepts of sociality. Culturally variant concepts of privacy and gender relations seem to profoundly affect pictorial practices.

When criticized, users of on bigoted visual memes often downplay their practices referring to the polysemy of images or free speech rights. However, Pepe is not a completely arbitrary symbol. The way in which it was appropriated fits with certain right-wing ideologies in which alleged “censorship” plays an important role and where provocation for its own sake and political statements tend to become indistinguishable.

To observe this, we used a Judge-Advisor System in which participants had to answer the likelihood to visit a physician at two different times: before and after seeing the recommendation of others. Within the experiment, three conditions were presented: high and low number of users recommending a physician, and no recommendations. We also assessed decision-making behavior, executive functions, and personality. We found that the participants’ likelihood to visit a physician was in accordance to the displayed characteristics on the platform. However, after the recommendation of others was presented, the likelihood changed significantly. The participant’s opinion was significantly closer to the recommendation coming from higher number of users, which indicates that this social media cue influences the disposition to visit a physician.","Effects of User-Generated Comments, Ratings and ""Likes"" on Health-Related Outcomes",Health Communication

Over six hundred participants were recruited through a crowd source website and asked to view a mockup physician review web page before completing a survey on their perceptions of the physician and willingness to seek health care from the physician. The results suggested that participants were more willing to choose a physician with high ratings on technical skills and moderate ratings on interpersonal skills compared to a physician with reverse ratings on the two skills. As predicted, patients were more likely to choose a specialist with high ratings on technical skills and moderate ratings on interpersonal skills compared to a primary care physician with the same ratings.

A Study of the Role Played by User Commenting and Audience Metrics in Persuasion,2,"Health communication messages can generate psychological reactance and lead to boomerang effects. The purpose of our study is to explore non-message factors that could potentially help reduce reactance. As health campaigns go online, many technological affordances of interactive media provide important cues that influence user’s perceptions and evaluations of the message, which can reduce reactance and improve message acceptance. To test this possibility, we conducted a 2 (message threat: high vs. low) X 2 (bandwagon cue: high vs. low) X 2 (comment function: presence vs. absence) between-subjects experiment (N = 179). Findings suggest that high bandwagon cues can reduce reactance and improve persuasion by eliciting bandwagon perceptions and feelings of isolation. Comment action is associated with a strong sense of agency, which positively predicts intention to follow the message recommendation. Technological affordances interact with message features and with each other in influencing users’ evaluation and acceptance of health messages.","Effects of User-Generated Comments, Ratings and ""Likes"" on Health-Related Outcomes",Health Communication

To answer our research questions, we conducted an online survey with 1.581 (Age: M=46.7, SD=14.89; 51.1% female). The findings show that monitoring enhances knowledge gain, whereas ‘blunters’ feel more informed, but actually know less.

This study contributes to this ongoing research by empirically constructing and validating efficient and effective scales, correlating with these important dependent variables for a population of interest. With a sample of smokers and non-smokers (N = 639) on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we adapted information overload, backlash, and confusion about electronic cigarettes’ (“e-cigs”) information, a new domain of conflicting health information and uncertainty. We empirically tested the items for conceptual redundancy and distinctiveness and evaluated their discriminant and predictive validity. Our results suggest separating information overload into two distinct constructs in a reduced scale that captures the underlying factor structure while being concise for future research.",HIGH-DENSITY: Effects of Public Information on Health Outcomes,Health Communication
2018-0575,2018,Paper Session,Of Monsters and Men? The Impact of Media Coverage About Pedophilia in Germany on the Acceptance of Preventive Therapy Programs and the Process of Treatment on Pedophile Nonoffenders,3,"Media coverage has the potential to make complex health topics like pedophilia comprehensible for the public and may thereby reduce stigmata. Meanwhile, media coverage can be a major contributor to stigmatization by affecting society´s perception as well as self- perception of pedophiles. It might therefore have an impact on both the acceptance and process of preventive therapy for pedophiles who are currently nonoffenders. Our study aims to gain an understanding of the connection between media coverage, therapy acceptance and treatment process of pedophile nonoffenders by conducting five qualitative focus groups interviews with 24 participants of the German preventive therapy program “Kein Täter werden” (wordplay: not to/do not become an offender).",HIGH-DENSITY: Effects of Public Information on Health Outcomes,Health Communication
2018-0576,2018,Paper Session,Memorable Messages of the HPV Vaccine and Their Impact on Behavior,2,"Mass health communication campaigns have been successfully assessed with the memorable messages framework, yet it has not been applied in the context of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Memorable messages (MMs) are defined as communications that are well remembered and have an impact on the listener. Survey data were collected from 131 students. Of the participants, 63.4% recalled an HPVMM advertisement while 96.9% recalled an HPVMM conversation. For advertising, materials in doctors’ offices (32.1%) were the most frequently reported sources, followed by television (20.6%), while doctors (45.8%) and friends (16%) were the most frequently reported conversations. Preliminary thematic analysis yielded evidence for all four topics representing knowledge of the disease: awareness, prevention, detection, and treatment, in line with Smith et al.’s work on breast cancer information (2009), with evidence for a fifth topic: normalization. Although mediated sources primarily contained messages of awareness, conversational sources tended to discuss prevention.",HIGH-DENSITY: Effects of Public Information on Health Outcomes,Health Communication
2018-0577,2018,Paper Session,How Health Information Environment and Communication Orientations Affect Health Outcomes: Testing O1-S-O2-R Model Among U.S. Adults,4,"This study examines the process through which the general public attend and respond to health messages in a new health communication ecology. Extant studies tend to simply connect mass media use and health outcomes, closing off a number of avenues to theorizing interpersonal communication as a potential outcome or mediator of media effects. To directly address this issue, we explicate the mechanism of how health media use influences health outcomes through its effects on interpersonal communication orientations, whether conventional collaborative communication between providers and patients or online interactive health messaging among peers and health professionals. We explore these relationships using data collected from the Health Information National Trends Survey conducted with a U.S. national representative sample from 2011 through 2012. Overall, these results shed some lights on (a) the relationship between health message consumption and expression effects, and (b) how health media consumption and communication orientations work together to influence health-related outcomes among the general public.",HIGH-DENSITY: Effects of Public Information on Health Outcomes,Health Communication

Prior research suggests few Americans know about the health impacts of climate change. For this reason, novel information about this topic may pose a significant identity threat to political conservatives, increasing the likelihood of defensive processing. Such tendency toward defensive processing, however, may be mitigated by self-affirmation. In this study, we examine the influence of self-affirmation tendency on conservatives’ responses to information on the public health impacts of climate change. An online experiment was conducted with a sample of politically conservative MTurk workers. The general hypothesis was supported that those higher in self-affirmation tendency were more receptive to a message depicting the health effects of climate change.",HIGH-DENSITY: Effects of Public Information on Health Outcomes,Health Communication

While speculations about the effects of binge consumption are frequently made by popular press (e.g., NPR, 2015), scholarly work is only beginning to emerge on the topic and often focuses on the negative outcomes. To extend the research agenda and better understand binge watching behavior, this research turns the focus from normal binge-watching to deviant binging. Specifically, this study examines the effects of planned versus unplanned viewing and normative versus deviant binge behavior on subsequent negative affects including guilt, stress, anxiety, and depression. In doing so, this research furthers understanding on how unplanned, deviant binge behavior can have an impact on viewers psychological state.",Media and Enjoyment,Mass Communication
2018-0581,2018,Paper Session,Binge Watching and Psychological Well-Being: Media Use Between Lack of Control and Perceived Autonomy,2,"Binge watching—the intensive, consecutive, and non-linear use of televised series—has become a prevalent usage pattern of entertainment media, which can influence users’ psychological well-being both positively and negatively: on the one hand, binge watching could increase recipients’ enjoyment, recovery experiences, and vitality through an increase in perceived autonomy. On the other hand, binge watching can trigger goal conflicts and feelings of guilt, which reduce well-being. Drawing on an online survey (N = 499), the present study examines the tension between these two mechanisms and their effects on users’ well-being. The data largely support the hypotheses: binge watching is perceived as recreative as long as goal conflicts and feelings of guilt can be avoided. Well-being, on the other hand, is positively affected by a binge watching-induced increase in perceived autonomy. These results corroborate the central role of self-determination as a link between media reception and psychological well-being.",Media and Enjoyment,Mass Communication

The findings show that constructive and solutions journalism are defined similarly: they are claimed to follow traditional journalistic norms and practices, even as they shift focus from problems to solutions. The metajournalistic discourse reveals a tension about the normative roles of journalism. Constructive journalism and solutions journalism justify their existence by the intensified need to solve vexing social issues. At the same time, they distance themselves from being advocates for social good, and instead insist that they are objectively covering solutions without endorsing them. This strategic rhetoric signals an attempt to draw a sharp line between constructive journalism and advocacy, and to situate constructive journalism within the boundaries of a traditional monitorial role of journalism. Metadiscourse about constructive journalism reveals reluctance to acknowledge and articulate its normative constructive role that seeks to help society.",New Perspectives Upon Journalistic Roles,Journalism Studies

Through in-depth interviews, journalists familiar with solutions journalism offered insights about how to define and measure the practice. Specifically, journalists said solution-oriented news stories contribute to more accurate and balanced news coverage, are sophisticated and rigorous, and intend to motivate readers to contribute to societal change. Finally, we offer guidelines for measuring a solutions news story in an effort to spur consistent future research on the effects of the solutions journalism approach.",New Perspectives Upon Journalistic Roles,Journalism Studies

Using journalists covering art and culture - i.e., cultural journalists - as point of departure, the paper, first, provides a theoretical framework for understanding the professional logics that currently characterise cultural journalism: an ‘aesthetic logic’ and a ‘news logic’. Based on data from The Worlds of Journalism Study, the paper, second, shows that cultural journalists differ from other types of journalists in terms of social and professional characteristics, perceived influences in daily work and role perceptions. Furthermore, it shows that even though media systemic contexts play a role, cultural journalists still have distinct characteristics worldwide. Being the first study to apply a global-comparative perspective to the role perceptions of this particular group of journalists, the paper concludes that cultural journalists are ‘journalists with a difference around the globe’.",New Perspectives Upon Journalistic Roles,Journalism Studies

In this study, we investigate how the watchdog is perceived and enacted in a political system that grants its citizens rather high political power. Based on survey data of 121 Swiss newspaper journalists, we study constitutions of the ideal role of being a watchdog, how they can enact this role as well as how characteristics of the media organization and the media system might influence their role conception and perception of role enactment. We find five types of watchdogs: “alpha dog”, “sniffer dog”, “hound”, “supporter”, and “educator” roles. Overall, our results show a predominance of rather distant and neutral watchdog roles.

Based on a content analysis of 1,519 stories from Chilean online and print news outlets, this study finds that although the media platform does have an influence on the way journalists do their work, the news beat, followed by media audience orientation, were more crucial to explain differences in the presence of different roles in news. The findings support a position that lays midway between the generalist and particularistic approaches regarding the influence of the media platform in role performance, thereby showing the multilayered nature of journalistic practice.",New Perspectives Upon Journalistic Roles,Journalism Studies

When many others join in and large quantities of messages containing negative word-of-mouth suddenly spread online we speak of an online firestorm. But what drives people to engage in such collective online protesting? Drawing on the situational theory of problem solving (Kim & Grunig, 2011) and extending it to the online sphere, we analyze the drivers of online firestorm participation on Facebook in the context of a perceived moral misconduct by a company. Results of an online survey indicate that individuals’ involvement recognition, their perception of being a collective actor as well as their approval of slacktivism behaviors positively predict online firestorm participation. Conversely, non-anonymity was found to hamper individuals’ participatory behaviors. This study contributes to the understanding of online firestorms, which is valuable not only for theory building but also for professionals’ crisis management.",Theorizing Social Movements and Media Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

In a news and information environment increasingly characterized by biased information and alternative facts, fake news as both a concept and a cultural practice has greatly contributed to the muddying of traditional news discourse and everyday news consumption. Far from merely serving as a tool of state and corporate propaganda, fake news should be firmly situated as a ubiquitous mode of public discourse that is leveraged and deployed by a wide range of actors, including propagandists, hoaxers, hackers, partisans, and activists.

In this paper we analyze fake news as genre blending combining elements of traditional news with features that are exogenous to normative professional journalism: misinformation, sensationalism, clickbait and bias. Through a content analysis of stories published by 50 sites that have been labelled fake news and their engagement outcomes on social media, we found that stories employed moderate levels of sensationalism, misinformation and partisanship to provide anti-establishment interpretive frameworks to political events. Complete fabrications were uncommon and did not resonate well with audiences, although there was some truth-stretching that came with genre blending. Results suggest that technocentric solutions aimed at detecting falsehoods are insufficient, as fake news is defined more by partisanship and identity politics than misinformation and deception.",Delineating the Meanings of Fake News,Journalism Studies

Although social media use and social media stress were positively related to both sleep-related parameters, when examined together, social media use was not a significant predictor above the predictive role of social media stress. Longitudinally, social media stress positively predicted both sleep-related parameters over time, but only among girls. Our findings stress that it is important to focus on how adolescents perceive and cope with their social media use.","Hybrid High-Density: T(w)eens, Media, and Health",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0613,2018,Paper Session,“Likes” as KPI: Girls’ Coping Strategy to Depressed Mood in Seeking Feedback on Instagram,4,"Taking on coping theory, the study mainly investigates the influence of feedback-seeking tendency on teenage girls, and the coping strategies that girls adopt to handle the depressed mood. 296 female secondary students in Singapore was surveyed about their selfie-posting behaviors on Instagram. The results of SEM indicate that feedback-seeking tendency is positively associated with depressed mood, but self-esteem exerts negative effects on depressed mood; and that depressed mood and feedback-seeking positively influences both problem- and emotion-focused coping, but the positive effect of self-esteem on problem-focused is marginal. The implications include peer feedback is becoming a KPI for the performance of girls’ selfie, and a parallel coping mechanism is employed by girls. More implications are discussed for research.","Hybrid High-Density: T(w)eens, Media, and Health",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0614,2018,Paper Session,Instagram and American Teens: Understanding Motives for Its Use and Relationship to Excessive Reassurance-Seeking and Interpersonal Rejection,2,"Adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period when individuals are at risk for low self-esteem and the onsets of depression. Despite news articles focusing on the “dark side” of social media and how teenagers use them, no prior studies have tried to understand personal and social attributes that affect why pre-teens and teens might use Instagram. Drawing from the uses and gratifications (U&G) theory, this study explored how depression-related behaviors relate to Instagram use among minors. Specifically this study focused on excessive reassurance-seeking and perceived interpersonal rejection, and their relationship to gratifications for Instagram use –and the intensity of that use. Participating were pre-teens and teens, ages 12 to 17 years. Results from structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that teens who were driven by gratifications of self-promotion and creativity were more likely to suffer from excessive reassurance-seeking. Excessive reassurance-seeking could also predict the number of hours they spent on Instagram. In addition, those who perceived interpersonal rejection were more likely to use Instagram to escape from reality.","Hybrid High-Density: T(w)eens, Media, and Health",Children Adolescents and the Media

The analysis consisted of 55 studies in 54 papers. Collectively, there were 152,827 participants, ranging in age from middle childhood to emerging adulthood. Exposure to substance use in media was positively related to acceptance and permissive attitudes toward substance use, peer norms, and intention to use. Additionally, exposure to substance use in media was positively associated with initiation of substance use and general substance use. The only moderator of the above was region, with studies coming from North America finding larger effects than those in Europe.

2018-0616,2018,Paper Session,Examining Peers and Parents as Moderators of Alcohol-Related Social Media Self-Effects Among Late Adolescents,2,"The present study is among the first to empirically demonstrate that alcohol-related social media self-effects may occur via a change in attitudes over time, and that the strength of this association is dependent on the social micro-environment. A two-wave panel study with a one year interval (N=1006) among late adolescents (age 16-20 at baseline) showed that especially individuals whose peers and parents engaged in alcohol-positive socialization behaviors, held higher alcohol-related attitudes one year later when they shared alcohol-related self-presentations on SNS. The strength of the alcohol-related social media self-effect was dampened when peers and parents engaged in more negative alcohol-related socialization behaviors. Overall, these results do not only provide support for the idea that individuals can affect themselves through displaying certain content on SNS, they also suggest that the social micro-environment continues to play a socializing role, even when adolescents transition into emerging adulthood.","Hybrid High-Density: T(w)eens, Media, and Health",Children Adolescents and the Media

Grounded in social cognitive theory, we also examined the moderating role of reward sensitivity. Results revealed that boys who consumed more sports magazines at W1 were more likely to report personal mesomorphic standards and perceived mesomorphic standards for men and boys in general at W2. Additionally, W2 personal mesomorphic standards mediated the relationship between sports magazine consumption at W1 and self-sexualizing behaviors at W3. Reward sensitivity moderated the relationship between personal mesomorphic standards and self-sexualizing behaviors.","Hybrid High-Density: T(w)eens, Media, and Health",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0618,2018,Paper Session,Media ideals and Early Adolescents’ Body Image: Selective Avoidance or Selective Exposure?,1,"Research among adults indicates that body surveillance may mediate the relationship between media internalization and people’s body image self-discrepancy. Yet, little work has been done on how these relationships evolve over time in early adolescence and no study has examined the reciprocal relationships between media internalization, body surveillance, and early adolescents’ body image self-discrepancy. To examine these reciprocal relationships, two-wave panel data (NWave1 = 1,986) gathered among early adolescents (ages 10-14) were analyzed. Cross-lagged structural equation models indicated that media internalization at Wave 1 predicted increases in body surveillance at Wave 2. Body surveillance at Wave 2, in turn, was associated with more body image self-discrepancy at Wave 2. In addition, body image self-discrepancy at Wave 1 predicted increases in body surveillance at Wave 1. Body surveillance, in turn, was related to more media internalization cross-sectionally, but less media internalization over time.

Specifically, we examined the potential value of self-objectification as an explanatory mechanism in the relationships between different types of media and positive body image. The results demonstrated that exposure to particular types of media was related to self-objectification in the overall sample of adolescents. Self-objectification was, in turn, negatively associated to positive body image. Multiple-group comparisons revealed no differences in the examined associations between boys and girls. However, substantial differences between the investigated countries were found. Together, the findings underscore the potential detrimental influence of media use on adolescents’ positive body image and highlight the need for further research including different types of media genres and media messages in cross-national contexts.","Hybrid High-Density: T(w)eens, Media, and Health",Children Adolescents and the Media

A possible explanation for this negative relationship may be the internalization of societal ideals displayed in social media content, but research is largely missing. The present cross-sectional survey study among 1,983 Austrian, Belgian, Spanish and South Korean adolescents (aged 12-19, 50.3% boys) addressed this gap by studying the relationships between Facebook and Instagram use, the internalization of professional, social, sexual and romantic ideals and mental well-being. Facebook use was positively related to the internalization of social and romantic ideals. Instagram use positively predicted the internalization of professional, social, sexual and romantic ideals. The internalization of sexual ideals was, in turn, related to a decreased mental well-being. Also a direct relationship emerged between Facebook use and mental well-being.

We find that group size is positively related to concentration of participation among fewer members, an effect that is partially mitigated by the passage of time. As time passes, groups fail to retain as many actively contributing members from month to month, an effect that is partially mitigated by group size. The effect of time on active member retention appears to be comprised of both a maturation effect as well as a cohort effect. We can conclude from these results that both the passage of time and increased group size make online groups less community-like, but in different ways.",Understanding Online Discussion Forum Dynamics: Community Formation and Interaction Patterns on Reddit and YouTube,Communication and Technology

A Content Analysis of Civic Conversations on Reddit,1,"A functional public sphere depends on quality information, the traditional source of which has been legacy news media. The ongoing contraction of the legacy media has led to concerns for the public sphere. A frequent prescription is to either bolster legacy media or enrich the information environment by incubating alternative forms of news media or expanding access to non-mediated information sources such as government data. However, little research has been done to investigate what citizens use as sources of information for public sphere discourse. In this case study I conduct a content analysis of links posted in discussions of local public affairs on Seattle’s subReddit r/Seattle to see what sources discussants are citing. Findings show that Seattle Reddit users rely far more on alternative media sources and non-mediated sources, especially government data, than they do on legacy media, but legacy media is still important in setting the conversation agenda.",Understanding Online Discussion Forum Dynamics: Community Formation and Interaction Patterns on Reddit and YouTube,Communication and Technology

Nowadays, counterpublics as well as public spheres, in general, cannot be thought and analysed without the internet. First of all, we analyse YouTube because of its potential to challenge traditional media and thus offer a counterpublic opposed to the mainstream public sphere. Empirically we want to map the network of right-wing YouTube channels in the German-speaking YouTube sphere and identify the topics that users discuss. We are especially interested in the communities, that we are able to identify within the right-wing and whether they differ with regard to the topics that are being discussed. We thus contribute to the literature on the right-wing in Germany, as well as on the literature on YouTube which is, in comparison to Twitter and Facebook, scarce.",Understanding Online Discussion Forum Dynamics: Community Formation and Interaction Patterns on Reddit and YouTube,Communication and Technology

This paper analyzes nearly a quarter of a million anonymous comments over a 14-month period from two online Reddit forums matched in topic and size, a “safe space” and a “free speech” space.
We found that moderators of the safe space removed significantly more comments, but authors deleted their own comments significantly more often as well, suggesting self-censorship. We used LIWC to analyze comments, and found that language used in the safe space was significantly more specific and positive, whereas in the free speech space language was more broad and negative.
Most interestingly, we found that these linguistic differences in comments persisted even among users who were posting concurrently in both subreddits. Altogether, these results suggest that even in anonymous online spaces, implemented moderation policies are highly effective in setting norms.",Understanding Online Discussion Forum Dynamics: Community Formation and Interaction Patterns on Reddit and YouTube,Communication and Technology
2018-0625,2018,Paper Session,Artificial Intelligence and Communication: Toward a Human-Machine Communication Research Agenda,2,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an integral aspect of communication technology. From virtual agents to bots, the exchange of messages is shifting from a human-human process to one between human and machine. How is communication research to account for and develop theories by which to explain such human-machine communication—encounters in which people communicate not only through machines as a medium but also with machines as interlocutors? This article seeks to advance the study of communication in relation to AI by examining the challenges that AI poses to existing conceptualizations of communication as a human phenomenon and by developing a theoretical starting point for addressing such challenges. Drawing on human-machine communication (HMC), an emerging area of research that focuses on machines’ roles as communicators, we identify three dimensions—communicative agency, social configurations, and ontological classification—around which to develop a research agenda for the study of communication in relation to AI.",How is it Different?

Two experimental studies (VR vs. PR) were conducted to investigate the impact of deficiencies and potential indicators for compensation.
In study 1, subjects performed a collaborative motor task and a verbal negotiation task. Results suggest significant differences in attentional allocation, perceived message understanding, and affective understanding. Time to finish the collaborative motor task was slower in VR. Functional outcomes of the negotiation did not differ between scenarios. Study 2 indicated that VR was party perceived as less efficient although participants were identically effective regarding a communication outcome.

2018-0629,2018,Paper Session,"Colorblind Racial Ideology, Feelings of Racial Closeness, and Interracial Conflict",2,"Within multiracial and pluralistic societies, race relations are often steeped in a long history of discrimination, conflict, and mistrust. Intergroup contact literature suggests that bringing groups together can lead to prejudice reduction. However, other perspectives such as conflict theory and cultural theory are not as optimistic. They postulate well-entrenched interracial beliefs might remain intact even when groups report feelings of closeness because of a heightened sense of threat and competition when in proximity. The present study examines these competing theoretical approaches to ask if feeling close to a racial group outside of your own increases your propensity to be less colorblind about issues facing that racial group. Colorblind racial ideology (CBRI) is the belief that treating everyone equally and providing equal opportunities regardless of race leads to a more equal society. CBRI ignores the empirical reality of real differences in life chances by race, and is most prevalent among Whites. In our sample of 2,140 participants from the Portraits of American Life Survey, we find that feelings of closeness for a racial group outside of one’s own group is associated with colorblind ideology, and there are particular associations among gender, years of education, and self-identified race with colorblindness. Findings lend greater support to conflict and cultural theory perspectives rather than contact hypothesis. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, as are research questions that should be addressed in the future.",Studies on Race and Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

This study used discourse analysis to analyze undergraduate essays, class discussion, and performances from five sections of introductory intercultural communication course in an American international college in China. Chinese students’ active identification “yellow race” raised questions on racial formation in China from linguistic and historical premises. First, I mapped the genealogy of “yellow race” in contemporary China. Then I used Müller-Saini’s (2008) glocalization of race to examine ways in which students’ identification of “yellow race” in an international classroom: 1) yellow race and Chinese language, 2) yellow race and nationalism, and 3) yellow race and cultural superiority-unity. The interpretation adds insights to the critical intercultural communication scholarship on pedagogy of race in global contexts.

Here we seek to move beyond this and determine if there is a trickle-down attitudinal component, in that the places from which the media report the news determines several factors of news stories including what people think of news sources, the environment in which those sources, speak and the information provided by sources from different types of neighborhoods. Using a largely Hispanic sample, we find that when media report stories from neighborhoods that are not perceived favorably by viewers, audiences not only dislike such neighborhoods, they also dislike sources from neighborhoods finding their information to be less credible and the suspects they describe to be guilty of the crimes they are suspecting of doing. This effect is more pronounced when audiences evaluate Hispanic sources and sources from urban Hispanic neighborhoods.",Studies on Race and Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

This study experimentally tests the effects of a Muslim leaders’ mediated response to an extremist attack, which is manipulated to vary both the level of empathy expressed (empathy expressed vs. no empathy expressed) and the level of responsibility accepted (responsibility accepted vs. responsibility denied). Results show that expressing empathy leads to more favorable perceptions of both the leader and response. Accepting responsibility makes leaders appear more genuinely sympathetic toward the victims, but the group as a whole appear guiltier. These findings suggest that there are downsides to both accepting and denying responsibility for minority groups who are forced to respond to extremism perpetrated in their name.","Outgroup Depictions in Mass Media: Content, Responses, and Effects",Intergroup Communication

This extensive advertising strategy has led to an increase in votes for populist parties/politicians and in membership numbers for extremist groups. Although there are speculations in media reports that the simple worldview created by populists contributes to more extreme positions, no study tested whether extremists rely on populist communication in their communiqués. The current study therefore investigated whether populist communication styles are present in extremist propaganda. A quantitative content analysis on N=51 extremist YouTube videos (n=25 right-wing extremist,n=26 Islamist extremist) was conducted to analyze potential differences between ideologies. The results demonstrate that 30% of videos display all three elements of populism (people centrism, anti-elitism and restoration of sovereignty). However, multilevel analysis revealed only small differences between ideologies regarding the use of populist communication.

The results indicate that Islamist as well as right-wing videos tackle conspiracy theories and implement their inductive argumentation style. While Islamist extremist videos focus on innocent war victims, right-wing extremist videos address the threat ensuing from different cultures. However, both employ the creation of an elitist oppression and a forthcoming unpredictable anarchy as a source of fear.

During organizational change, resources are often redistributed. Although change messages highlight overarching benefits for the organization, recipients of the message are interested in knowing how they will be affected at the group level, and this affects the way the message is processed.
Using concepts from Elaboration Likelihood Model and Prospect Theory, the effects of messages that outline benefits to a specific independent group (as compared with generic benefits to all), messages that outline benefits to a group the recipient’s own group shares resources with (as compared with an independent group), messages that outline specific losses to one’s own team (as compared with no mention of specific losses) and messages that outline losses to one’s own team and also mention generic gain as well as generic gains and compensatory action (as compared with messages that only mention losses to one’s own team) were studied. The dependent variable was negative opinion of the change initiative. The indirect cognitive path resulting from message perception to scrutiny, loss framing and subsequent negative opinion was also studied.
The findings indicated that messages that specify the beneficiary group, that outline gains to an interdependent out-group and those that explicitly state losses to one’s own team were likely to lead to the formation of negative opinion. Individuals were seen to directly frame messages that specified the beneficiary group and messages that outlined specific losses for their own team as losses, leading to negative opinion. Messages that offered gains to interdependent groups were scrutinized and framed as losses before the formation of negative opinion. Implications for research and practice of organizational change are discussed.","B.E.S.T. Session: Teams, Change, Health, and Organizing",Organizational Communication
2018-0640,2018,Paper Session,Promoting Voice in Hospital Culture: An Assessment of Organizational Influence on Speaking Up About Medical Errors,5,"This qualitative research study investigates health care providers’ perceptions of speaking up in a hospital setting about medical errors. Focus groups and one-on-one interviews were conducted with health care providers from a Midwestern hospital system. Participants were asked a series of questions, focusing on the definition and frequency of medical errors, as well as questions about barriers and benefits to speaking up. Specific system questions were also asked. Although most health care providers indicated there are benefits to speaking up, results also identify specific barriers in the organizational culture varying by a provider's specific position in the hospital. For example, while both groups reported consequences, nurses were significantly more likely to report interpersonal consequences, while managers and directors were significantly more likely to report organizational consequences. In addition, residents and interns saw culture as a barrier, while managers and directors saw culture as a facilitator. These, and a mixture of additional variables do not promote the reporting of medical errors. Implications for promoting a safe health care environment are discussed.","B.E.S.T.

2018-0641,2018,Paper Session,Joint Emplotment: How Interprofessional Teams Establish and Negotiate Perspectives in Acute Care,2,"Exploring the link in actual practice between interprofessional collaboration on health care teams and patient-centered care, this paper has a twofold purpose. First, we propose and develop the notion of joint emplotment to conceptualize the collaborative sensemaking work (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005) observed in the acute care context, in particular in rapid-paced daily interprofessional team meetings. Joint emplotment refers to the means by which teams construct and negotiate shared understandings; that is, how they collectively make sense of the information and issues that are discussed during team meetings by narratively weaving them together to plan their future actions. Second, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of this notion for understanding a core element of patient-centered care, namely how different perspectives of the patient’s situation are made relevant and meaningful in team talk. We draw on illustrative data from a longitudinal naturalistic study of communication practices in daily interprofessional team meetings in acute care to show how perspective get established and negotiated in joint emplotment, and why this is important for patient-centeredness.","B.E.S.T.

2018-0642,2018,Paper Session,Origins of Omission and Commission Errors in Perceptions of Group Communication Networks,3,"We study how and why members in a group misperceive the existence of relationships in their networks. We collected data on 10, 12-person groups, measuring both the actual communication networks (who chose whom as contacts) and perceived networks (who was perceived by others to have chosen whom as contacts). Comparing the actual and perceived networks shows group members are more likely to make errors of omission (i.e., not perceive a link even though one exists) than errors of commission (i.e., to perceive a link exists when it does not). Further, our analysis indicates that members tend to incorrectly perceive (overestimate) the presence of communication links between members grouped by formal and emergent structures and incorrectly miss (underestimate) the presence of links between people in different groups. These findings suggest that people in a network make systematic errors which might hinder their ability to share information effectively.","B.E.S.T.

2018-0644,2018,Paper Session,Moving From Centralized to Decentralized Work Spaces: Network Change in Two Hospital Intensive Care Units,4,"This study investigated differences in network density, homophily, and closure within an intensive care unit (ICU) moving from centralized to decentralized nurse work spaces. Observational methods were conducted to evaluate changes in communication. There were 866 communication interactions in the pre-study aggregated by hour to create a sample of communication networks (n = 48). Post-study, there were 3,923 communication interactions aggregated by hour (n = 126). There were significantly less messages/hour (density) in centralized (M = 16.65, SD = 14.23) than in decentralized (M = 24.65, SD = 14.02) structures t(172), p = 0.001. Homophilous communication remained unchanged. Network closure (triadic structures) increased in decentralized (M = 0.13, SD = 0.33) versus centralized (M = 0.00, SD = 0.00) structures t(172), p = 0.003. Implications suggest spatial configuration offers key affordances in social networks. Higher integration and connectivity occurred among key professions, suggesting that nurses are important to connecting others.","B.E.S.T.

Using an action research methodology, we examined the conversations and texts and whether they revealed emergence of an authoritative text. We started the process by developing a diagram of an organization’s work life cycle and materials needed to support organizational functioning. We then conducted 13 interviews with organizational members, showing the diagram and adjusting it according to interviewee responses. The process revealed conflicts in perceptions of organizational structure and afforded a reflexive space for unifying participants around a common understanding of organizational needs. Results show the importance of managing the tension between individual agency and collective identity through facilitating participation of diverse member voices.","B.E.S.T.

Data were collected from 541 bus operators drawn from a total of 60 geographically dispersed bus operation teams of three bus companies in Shenzhen, China. Multilevel analyses of hierarchical data that nest bus operators within teams, which are nested within bus companies, were performed. Results showed that group culture mediated the influence of organizational culture on bus operators’ mental health. Team-level organizational work conditions, such as overtime workload, participation in organization-sponsored social and entertainment activities, quality of meals provided by the organization and discounted housing conditions, affected bus operators’ perceived respect for the job, which was significantly associated with their mental health. In addition, bus operators’ mental health was associated with both their occupational identification and occupational commitment.","B.E.S.T.

2018-0647,2018,Paper Session,“Talk More About it”: Emerging Adults’ Attitudes About How and When Parents Should Talk About Sex,2,"Sexual communication from parents is crucial to healthy sexual well-being in young people, yet there is a dearth of research offering explicit guidelines for how and when parent-child sexual communication should take place. The perspective of youth on what works and when conversations should happen is also largely absent from the literature. We conducted a mixed-methods study on emerging adults’ (N = 441) beliefs about the ideal age and frequency for parents to discuss sex-related topics, and about their parents’ strengths and weaknesses in sexual communication. Most participants reported that parents should talk about sex frequently, early, and on a wide variety of topics. They also recommended parents be open, honest, and realistic when talking to their children about sex. We discuss implications for how to re-position parents to engage in successful sexual communication, and thus improve sexual health and well-being for young people.","Sex, Dating, and Beyond: Perceptions and Messages Matter",Interpersonal Communication

Although communication skills and being out are crucial coping mechanisms for same-sex couples, how partners talk about relationship disclosure with one another (i.e., coming out talk) remains unknown. This study explored the content of couples’ coming out talk, and investigated how couple members’ relative outness levels to those of their partners (i.e., relative outness) predicted coming out talk, which in turn was associated with relationship satisfaction. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained from 202 participants in a same-sex relationship. The content analysis identified five themes of coming out talk, including (a) disclosure attitudes (mutually positive, mutually negative, and discordant attitudes), (b) disclosure conducts (daily behaviors, initial disclosure actions), (c) disclosure outcomes, (d) disclosure targets, and (e) disclosure timing. Path analyses revealed a positive indirect effect from relative outness to relationship satisfaction through coming out talk. The results have implications for studying and improving same-sex relationships.","Sex, Dating, and Beyond: Perceptions and Messages Matter",Interpersonal Communication

We looked at whether attachment anxiety and avoidance and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) predict virtual conversational choices (i.e., to dismiss, deny, or reciprocate in virtual conversations during a virtual date). We tested this possibility through Socially Optimized Learning in Virtual Environments (SOLVE-IT), a web-delivered interactive 3D video game intervention designed for Young Men Who Have Sex with Men (YMSM) to reduce risky sexual behaviors. Data analyzed were drawn from 358 HIV-negative, self-identified MSMs, aged from 18 to 24, who were part of the SOLVE-IT intervention. Using ordinary least squares regression, we found that both BIS and attachment styles affect in-the-moment conversational responses, and attachment moderates the effects of BIS on those responses. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Sex, Dating, and Beyond: Perceptions and Messages Matter",Interpersonal Communication
2018-0650,2018,Paper Session,The Medium Impacts Emotional Suffering: Exploring the Non-Initiator’s Perspective as a Target of Ghosting,5,"This study investigates how non-initiators retroactively experience ghosting. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, we first explored in which mediums the non-initiator learned about their relationship dissolution and their storied ghosting experience. We then examined the impact of particular medium (means) for communication and how the medium influences the suffering felt by the ghosting target utilizing the Media richness theory and Hyperpersonal model. Non-initiators who experienced ghosting exposure participated in an Amazon Mechnical Turk (N = 189) survey. On average, participants indicated their ghosting occurred across multiple mediums. Non-initiators demonstrated that ghosting occurred multimodally and reflected their previous communication patterns. The message medium carries an emotion that can be evoked as a product of their exchanges, and leaner mediums with more frequent communication caused greater suffering. Results intersect these frameworks to determine that the medium impacts emotional suffering at both channel and message levels.","Sex, Dating, and Beyond: Perceptions and Messages Matter",Interpersonal Communication

2018-0652,2018,Paper Session,Brexit and Blame Avoidance: Officeholders’ Discursive Strategies of Self-preservation,1,"In modern democracies, governments increasingly engage in blame avoiding behaviour when they initiate loss-imposing policies that hurt the interests of some groups. The recent decision of the British government to leave the European Union is a case in point. As nearly half of the voters said they wanted to remain, and millions of people were left deeply concerned about the adverse effects of leaving, the government had to deal with an acute blame risk.
In my talk, I make an original contribution to the linguistically informed study of blame games in government. I identify the discursive strategies by which the Brexiters – the officeholders who lead the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union – try to get away with advancing their divisive policy. I bring concrete textual examples from their public statements to illustrate how they use language to minimise the perceived agency of the government and downplay the contentiousness of their policy.","How Politics, Identities, and Attitudes Get Done in Language and Interaction",Language & Social Interaction

The focus is to examine sequences in which descriptions are made relevant, how they are formulated, and how they get produced, oriented-to or resisted. I employ Conversation Analytic approaches to build on previous studies of description types: race (Whitehead, 2009), sex (Weatherall, 2015), gender (Jackson, 2011) etc. This is in the service of identifying practices which obscure and obfuscate descriptions through which micro-inequalities of everyday life are accomplished. Drawing on a corpus from two interactional settings; protest interactions where race is omnirelevent, where particular descriptions are relevant for the duration of the interactional event (Sacks, 1995), and 'institutional' break-time interactions where certain member omnirelevancies are absent. I examine cases in which ‘race’ gets oriented-to, and I attended to the sequential organisation, and members’ practices for producing ‘ordinary’, everyday demonstrably discriminatory descriptions.","How Politics, Identities, and Attitudes Get Done in Language and Interaction",Language & Social Interaction
2018-0654,2018,Paper Session,Two Structural Elements of the Entertainment-Political Interview and Their Contribution to Deformed Political Interviews,4,"Politicians increasingly appear on broadcast late-night talk shows. Their visiting these entertainment programs creates a unique type of interview, which we call the Entertainment Political Interview (EPI). Based on analysis of politicians’ interactions on such shows, we present some of the structural elements of the EPI. We find that at EPI the interviewer asks open-ended questions or do not pose questions at all, and thus do not constrain the politician’s answer. Second, hosts respond to the politician’s answers and often even evaluate those. Comparing these features to the traditional interview and the hybrid political interview, we assess the significance of the EPI to the political system in the USA. The EPI may inform the public and showcase politicians’ social skills. Yet, the interviewer does not hold the politician accountable and approves their answers, which may easily turn the EPI to a platform for political propaganda.","How Politics, Identities, and Attitudes Get Done in Language and Interaction",Language & Social Interaction
2018-0655,2018,Paper Session,“What’s that ROI Going to Look Like?” vs. “We represent a community”: Indexing Neoliberal Identities in a Racially Diverse Business Community,2,"This study examines the relationship between political ideology and indexing political identities in everyday interaction through analyzing audio-and-video recorded interactions gathered during eight months of ethnographic fieldwork with two Texas chambers of commerce. The analysis illustrates how participants of various races and classes use assessments and idiomatic language to construct stances towards public policies. These stance-taking practices in turn index neoliberal identities because they draw from main tenets that constitute neoliberal ideology: privatization, individualism, free market competition, and racial neoliberalism. Findings also illustrate how, while White upper class beneficiaries of neoliberal ideologies regularly and unproblematically index neoliberal identities, minority and lower class members of the business community criticize neoliberal ideologies because they do not benefit minority communities, yet simultaneously enact neoliberal identities to be acceptable members of the business community. Overall, this study shows how, while participants do draw from multiple communicative sources to creatively negotiate neoliberal identities, their interactions ultimately reflect and reproduce the hegemonic position of neoliberal ideology that structures societal power relations in ways that privilege upper class, White, corporate identities and marginalize working class, minority, small business identities.","How Politics, Identities, and Attitudes Get Done in Language and Interaction",Language & Social Interaction
2018-0656,2018,Paper Session,Voicing a Gifted Child: Reported Speech and Problem Telling as Resources for Doing Epistemic and Moral Work in Parent-Teacher Conference,2,"As with many institutional interactions, parent-teacher conferences are impregnated by a socially sanctioned distribution of types of knowledge. This paper reports data from a mother-teacher conference concerning a gifted child. We describe two intertwined resources - reported speech and problem-telling - used by the mother in pursuing a “problem trajectory” and contrasting the teachers’ “no-problem” trajectory in the evaluation of the child’s status . We illustrate how by these resources the mother: a) makes information from her territory of knowledge more relevant than information provided by the teachers concerning the child’s (assessed as good) school performance, and b) undermines the teacher’s epistemic authority by vicariously blaming her work. We advance that the mother’s interactive competence in doing epistemic as well as moral work can explain why the mother’s problem–centered perspective gains over the teachers’ perspective and the mother succeeds in shaping the teacher’s professional conduct in the classroom.","How Politics, Identities, and Attitudes Get Done in Language and Interaction",Language & Social Interaction
2018-0657,2018,Paper Session,Preference for Online Social Interaction in Mobile Dating Applications and Negative Outcomes of Compulsive Use,2,"More and more individuals hunt for information on and reach out to potential romantic partners through mobile dating applications available on their smartphones. Although these emerging technologies offer social benefits, certain individuals become overly dependent on such applications and suffer from negative outcomes. Relatively little research in online dating to date, however, has investigated what predicts problematic use of such social technologies. Building upon the cognitive-behavioral model of problematic Internet use and the social skills model, we examined the relationship between social anxiety and problematic use of dating applications. An online survey (N=276) conducted with a college student sample provided support for a moderated serial mediation model. Specifically, consistent with the social skills model, we found that social anxiety influenced negative outcomes sequentially through preference for social interaction via dating applications and compulsive use. Additionally, we found that the serial mediation was significantly moderated by loneliness.","HIGH-DENSITY: Explaining Online Behaviors: At the Intersection of Personality, Motivation, and Cognition",Information Systems
2018-0658,2018,Paper Session,Trait Motivation As a Predictor of Online Dating App Behavior,2,"In the newest iteration of mediated dating technology, adoption of mobile dating apps has steadfastly increased in the last few years. Nascent empirical research has examined when and why people use these platforms, but has yet to shed light on the nature of that usage. The current study (1) directly observes sessions of dating app usage, monitoring how different users cycle through and make decisions about assortments of potential partners and (2) examines how differences in user behavior may be related to trait differences in motivational processing of media messages. Dating apps encompass highly motivationally relevant content, having effectively mediatized the process of seeking, meeting, and initially engaging prospective romantic partners. From a 10-minute Tinder session in which app activity is directly recorded, this study examines how self-reported measures of trait motivation and other individual differences explain swiping behavior, selectivity in profile “likes”, and searching for additional profile information.","HIGH-DENSITY: Explaining Online Behaviors: At the Intersection of Personality, Motivation, and Cognition",Information Systems

In particular, it looks at how platform variation and content variation impact purchase intent through elaboration, ad credibility, and experiential pleasure. An online experiment conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 739) finds that content variation affects purchase intent via two routes - cognitive and experiential routes. The cognitive route has three pathways: through the number of positive ad-related thoughts, through ad credibility, and through ad credibility and the number of positive ad-related thoughts sequentially; the experiential route involves experiential pleasure as the mediating mechanism. In terms of platform variation, multiple platforms bring users greater experiential pleasure, but no other effects are confirmed. More theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Explaining Online Behaviors: At the Intersection of Personality, Motivation, and Cognition",Information Systems
2018-0660,2018,Paper Session,Social Network and Daily Rhythms on Twitter,2,"The use of social media has changed our life routines. Previous studies have found consistent diurnal patterns of user activities on social media platforms. However, the temporal organization of human behaviors is partly socially constructed and is determined by numerous factors other than the diurnal cycle. The current study argues that peer influence from online social networks is one of these factors. To test our hypotheses, we collected a random sample of active Twitter users (N = 5,066), their followers and followees (N = 424,984), and all available tweets posted by these users. Results suggest that the temporal patterns between self-posting and interaction behavior differ across individuals. Users’ daily activity rhythms are more similar to their followees’ rhythms than to their followers’ rhythms. Peer influence seems to be a major mechanism explaining such similarity.","HIGH-DENSITY: Explaining Online Behaviors: At the Intersection of Personality, Motivation, and Cognition",Information Systems

The current cross-sectional study (N = 286) examined the relationships between the use of geo-social dating apps and emerging adults’ casual sex and long-term romantic experiences with a match from a geo-social dating app. Attention was given to the role of peer norms concerning sexual and romantic experiences with dating app matches. We found that more frequent usage of geo-social dating apps and positive descriptive norms positively predicted oral sex and sexual intercourse with a casual partner met through a geo-social dating app. A similar result emerged for emerging adults’ engagement in a committed relationship with a partner met through a geo-social dating app. These findings underline that not only actual usage of geo-social dating apps, but also the peer culture surrounding these apps play a role in users’ sexual and romantic behavior.","HIGH-DENSITY: Explaining Online Behaviors: At the Intersection of Personality, Motivation, and Cognition",Information Systems

In the current study, we investigated how dating app use and motivations for using these apps were related to demographic (gender, sexual orientation) and personality-based variables among emerging adults. Nearly half of the sample (48%) used dating apps regularly, with Tinder being the most popular app. Non-users were more likely to be heterosexual, high in dating anxiety, and low in sexual permissiveness than dating app users. Among users, dating app motivations, i.e., relational goal motivations (love, casual sex), intrapersonal goal motivations (self-worth validation, ease of communication), and entertainment goal motivations (thrill of excitement, trendiness) were meaningfully related to individual differences, e.g. sexual permissiveness was related to the motivation casual sex. Our study underlines the importance of looking at underlying motivations for using dating apps. More research is needed to study how motivations differ by sexual orientation.","HIGH-DENSITY: Explaining Online Behaviors: At the Intersection of Personality, Motivation, and Cognition",Information Systems

The present study exposed participants to 10 weeks of a popular fictional television program following the lives of 5 gay men and then asked participants to report their favorite and least favorite characters from the show. Results suggest that the sexual explicitness of gay characters’ depictions did not influence the liking of gay characters, but that gay characters talking about gay sexualities, issues, and community made the characters less appealing. Results support the need for more diverse, authentic depictions of gay individuals on television.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Specifically, this study observes the role of prejudices and moral attitudes toward lesbians on audiences responses to narratives about lesbians. A total of 206 undergraduate students voluntary took part in the study without receiving economical compensation (79.6% women M = 20.68, DT = 2.36). Participants filled in a questionnaire before viewing a movie sought to know the attitudes of the participants about lesbian people (level of prejudice) and the morality attributed to lesbians. After watching a movie, participants completed a questionnaire measuring appreciation and enjoyment. Statistical analyses show that homophobia and morality affects the evaluation of the lesbian character. Also, that homophobia is negatively correlated to enjoyment. Finally, there is not relationship between homophobia or morality and appreciation. These results inform theory, audiovisual industries and regulators.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"
2018-0679,2018,Paper Session,The Influence of Pornography Viewing on Attitudes Toward Transgender People Among Men Who are Attracted to Transgender Women,1,"In this study, we conducted a convenience sample survey study of 250 viewers of transgender pornography to assess viewing’s influence on attitudes. Within the field of communication there is significant debate about whether pornography has generally anti-social effects or pro-social effects, and our results indicate that perhaps this is the wrong question to ask. While we found pornography consumption was a significant negative predictor of anti-transgender prejudice, we also found viewers’ experiences of shame about their sexual desires for the pornographic performers was a much larger and more significant positive predictor of prejudice. Thus, at least among viewers of transgender pornography, our results suggest that pornography consumption is less influential on attitudes than the feelings viewers’ have about the pornography. More broadly, this suggests that the pornography itself is of much less consequence than the social context in which it is consumed.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

This study examines how Grindr reconfigures and shapes spatial practices within tourist-local interactions in Tel Aviv, Israel. A qualitative, mixed-methods approach was used that incorporates semi-structured interviews and audio diaries reflecting on daily Grindr use among tourists and locals. Grindr provides an alternative geography in that it facilitates the habitation of local spaces and interaction with the people who make them within the tourist experience, generating spatial layers that shape daily life in novel ways.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

Previous research suggests that trans people are uniquely targeted by incivility online, and this research uses incivility in discourse about trans rights as a broader lens for examining how different types of first-person dialogue trigger or otherwise affect the levels of incivility present in online discourse. In order to do this, the researcher is currently analyzing both of these issues through a textual analysis of 100 tweets shared by transgender people in response to President Donald Trump’s three-tweet announcement of his plan to ban transgender soldiers from serving in the US military and 1,000 tweets sent in response to those transgender people. The goal is to examine the role first-person plays in these anecdotal tweets, the major themes of the trans peoples’ tweets and the major themes of the responses to the trans peoples’ tweets, in addition to the norms and boundaries of this dialogue in Twitter.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

2018-0687,2018,Paper Session,"Locating Communication in a Metasynthesis of Research on Transgender Women, Sex Work, and HIV",2,"This is a work in progress and will be finalized for ICA 2018, if accepted.
Across the world, communication scholarship on transgender women sex workers is rare. This gap is more noticeable in health communication scholarship on transgender women sex workers and HIV, AIDS. In fact, a search of e-databases such as Communication Abstracts, Health Communication, and the Journal of Health Communication using ‘transgender+sex+work’ as a keyword combination does not bring forth published research relevant to the topic. Given the historical and current systemic oppression of transgender rights, there appears to be a need to understand and document life stories of transgender women sex workers and how they communicate/make meanings of health and HIV, AIDS. This research project presents a thematic analysis-inspired metasynthesis of 17 journal articles that have published findings related to transgender women sex work and HIV/AIDS. Findings of the metasynthesis are focused on three ideas: a) transgender women sex workers have knowledge about their marginalization in society, b) cultural and structural factors influence the way transgender women sex workers negotiate and communicate about health and the risks in their jobs, and, c) social and peer networks are crucial for the survival of transgender women sex workers and at the same time serve as nodes of risky health behavior.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

I will perform a discourse analysis of posts in a Facebook group dedicated to exchanging knowledge about the pill. There are over 10,000 members, and several posts daily asking about side effects, sex practices, access to prescriptions, and conceptions about people who do or don’t take Truvada. I surmise that codifying and analyzing the kinds of narrative that are exchanged will shed some light on the social and cultural reasons why the pill has not enjoyed as much popularity as its clinical success might seem to inspire. As part of a larger program of PrEP research, my hope is to have more public conversation about the motivations underlying these discourses, so that they can be deconstructed by the community.","EXTENDED SESSION: Reception of LGBTQ Representations, Social Media Use, Sexual Health","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

One, the interaction between the Internet proliferation and proportional representation system has relatively more positive impacts on voter turnout at the aggregated level. Two, individual probability of participating in a demonstration and political meeting/rally gets higher in the proportional representation system as the Internet proliferation increases. Three, the individual probability of participating in contacting politicians, signing petitions and expressing political views online gets relatively higher under the plurality system as the Internet proliferation increases.

The power of apps was unleashed in 2011 when they were first used to mobilize protesters and gain support for political movements in the U.S. and abroad. Mobile devices have since become a bedrock of political activism. To examine the influence of app reliance on political participation, this study’s path model extends the Campaign Communication Mediation Model by: 1) testing direct and indirect effects of apps on online and offline participation, 2) using media trust and offline and online discussion as cognitive elaboration variables and, 3) testing whether cognitive elaboration mediates the influence of reliance on apps on offline and online political participation. Results suggest that relying on apps boosts political discussion, which in turns leads to political participation.

Despite abundant research, two factors have not been sufficiently confronted. First, Internet access and Internet use are endogenous to political engagement. Additionally, past studies have treated access as binary, while quality of access varies tremendously. I confront the issues of endogeneity and binarity and assess whether Internet quality has changed political knowledge and turnout, and whether these effects differ between those with more or less political interest, by exploiting exogenous local variation in internet quality. Two different approaches with two independent datasets indicates that increased internet quality has substantively increased political knowledge but has not affected turnout. I then provide evidence that the increase in political knowledge may be a result of consuming more of all types of information, rather than a trade-off between news and entertainment.",Internet Access and Digital Media Influences on Participation,Political Communication

The study expands the literature by examining not only online participation, but also offline participation and voting. It employs multi-level modeling to assess the between-country variation in the relationship between second screening and political participation. It further argues that at least in part, this country level variation is due to indicators of internet access and economic well-being. Results indicate that second screening is positively related to online and offline political participation across countries, and that relationship is relatively stronger where (a) internet connectivity, (b) GDP, and (c) HDI are relatively weaker. In other words, second screening is most strongly related to political participation in the countries that have the most room for growth in democratic engagement and practice.",Internet Access and Digital Media Influences on Participation,Political Communication

Findings from the data collected from the U.S. (N = 326) and Korea (N = 371) revealed substantial explanatory variance of cultural traits.

A 2-condition, between-subjects online experiment (N = 103) was conducted to test a mediation model that predicted a series of mediators as the underlying growth mechanism for the effect of death awareness on sad drama interest. Death reflection, a mortality prime that was designed to be a personal and concrete contemplation of life and death, led to greater arousal and less positive valence, compared to the control group. Structural equation modeling also showed significant indirect effects of death reflection on sad drama interest through heightened self-perceptual depth and posttraumatic growth.",Media and Entertainment,Mass Communication

Results demonstrated that nostalgic experiences are affectively similar to both pleasurable experiences (regarding enjoyment) and meaningful experiences (regarding mixed affect), yet differ in their associated cognitions (namely, reflection on the past self rather than the present self or the media content). These differing cognitions had distinct implications for participants’ feelings of vitality and self-continuity. An experiment (Study 2) replicated these findings by demonstrating that exposure to familiar childhood programs induced nostalgic reactions, which enhanced perceived self-continuity.

Sponsored content disseminated on the online portals of newspapers is regarded as a promising new route to promote products and brands. Regulations require communicators to inform consumers about the commercial nature of this content by including sponsorship disclosures (e.g., a ‘Sponsored’ label). However, earlier research demonstrates that such a cue may not be enough to alert recipients. This study investigates the effects of disclosures by means of a 2 (no disclosure vs. disclosure ‘Sponsored’) x 2 (no instruction vs. explicit instruction) experiment. Preliminary results show that foregoing instructions (e.g., pop-up messages) aiming at activating consumers’ persuasion knowledge can help to foster the effect of disclosures in developing distrusting beliefs towards pushy brand-related messages, and in turn, decrease consumers’ perceptions of a brand’s credibility.",Ethical Dimension of Public Relations,Public Relations

Events of the civil rights movement of the 1960s serve as context for exploring media deployment of competing ethical principles associated with activist and deliberative models of democracy.
“Activist” media share perceptions of activist democrats about the lack of fairness in deliberative democratic processes that take place within unequal social, economic, and political environments. These media tend to challenge the status quo more vigorously than do media that accept the legitimacy of outcomes of open deliberative processes.
The New York Times pursued the civil rights story with an activist zeal that was not diminished even in the face of physical intimidation of reporters and in spite of the widely assumed “chilling effects” of libel suits.
Thus the Times’ coverage contrasted with that of the Birmingham News which, although supportive of the aims of the civil rights movement, nonetheless devoted its editorial focus in changing the system from within.",Journalistic Representations of Protest and Social Movements,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

2018-0708,2018,Paper Session,Media and Framing as Drivers of Political Participation: Evidence From the Social Justice Movement in Israel,1,"In September of 2011, the largest social protests in Israel history occurred. Scarcely a few months before, nobody had predicted these events. How and why did the protests reach such magnitude so rapidly and what are the roles of media and framing in driving the expansion of this social protest? Social movement theory has advanced various explanations for mass mobilization pointing to factors such as grievances, elite support and resources, social network structures, and cultural frames. While acknowledging the role of these factors, we instead emphasize the role of information and information flow. Specifically, we argue that a key driver in the development of the Israeli social protests was the existence and the rapid erosion of climate of opinion concerning socio-economic grievances. Climate of opinion refers to the aggregative perception of the dominant opinion in society. The grievances in question can be loosely described as the increasing economic burden on the middle class coupled with a sense of distributive injustice. During 2011, climate of opinion regarding these grievances rapidly changed. Data were collected via seven public opinion polls, including a survey experiment among Israeli-Jewish adults. These surveys were conducted during the protest period among three populations, protesters, activists, and a representative sample at three points in time. Our study shows that climate of opinion regarding the protest movement is associated with involvement in the protest and led to readiness to be involved in the protest.",Journalistic Representations of Protest and Social Movements,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

We analyzed 22 environmental and land requisition protests and found activists in China draw heavily on Chinese cultural repertoire. They embed family values in a rank system that is mapped onto two axes – space vs. time and us vs. them – with family/self at the center, to frame collective action frames. We also analyzed activists’ coordination mechanisms with media and found strategic framing was used in coordination with both traditional and new media to adjust their contentious discourse to achieve consensus mobilization, action mobilization, and social mobilization at various stages of protest. This study brings cultural repertoire back into the study of contentious discourse in China and highlights the dynamic nature of strategic framing that is often practiced in coordination with media.",Journalistic Representations of Protest and Social Movements,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

The five cities covered functioned as the sites of a wider research programme on the spatialization an racialization of poverty and labour. The news of evictions, the pieces on poverty and human interest stories, or the coverage of charity and aid are shown to contribute to making these spaces and their inhabitants invisible by casting the issues as local ones, ethnical indexing, by denying their labor the status of work, and demarcating interventions from the domain of economy. Instances of emotional framing and interventions by activists reinforcing the above demarcations make their reality extra-ordinary. It is this distancing logic that makes invisible and thus normalizes the role of these spaces and of the ""Roma"" label in contemporary Romanian discourses.",Journalistic Representations of Protest and Social Movements,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-0711,2018,Paper Session,Toward a Typology of Mediated Anger: Routine Coverage of Protest and Political Emotion,1,"This paper establishes the importance of studying mediated anger. It first develops a typology of mediated anger, suggesting it is performative, discursively constructed, collective and political. It applies this typology to routine coverage of anger in UK protest coverage during a two-month time period in 2015. The analysis demonstrates that anger serves as a cause of engagement and a barometer of public feeling. It sets out a spectrum of discursive constructions of mediated anger. At one end sits rational and legitimate anger, which forms the basis for social change. Along the spectrum sits aggressive and/or disruptive anger motivated by rational and legitimate concerns. At the other end of the spectrum lies illegitimate and irrational anger. The analysis shows that protesters can be simultaneously angry and rational, peaceful and legitimate.

The journalists make use of particular narrative strategies focussing on the incident of the attack by highlighting how pain was experienced by the individual. This often results in the women being singled out and isolated. While there is some discussion of the contexts in which the violence occurred, the wider socio-cultural background is absent from the articles. We conclude that the focus on intense pain in the articles may enable a particular affective relationality to emerge that is felt by victims, journalists and audiences alike.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies
2018-0714,2018,Paper Session,Affective Solidarity in Audience Encounters With Mediated Distant Suffering: In Defence of Mere Feltness,1,"In recent media theory affective solidarity has been treated as a contradiction in terms. Any relation to the other consisting in sympathy cannot form the basis of full subjective recognition, and in practice is often actively dehumanising. Further, there remains the notion that solidarity is contingent upon a rupture of habitual being-in-the-world, and in journalistic contexts this leads to practices that aim at intensive encounters that transcend the affective livedness of everyday routines. This paper, however, argues that solidarity is not clinched in spite of the merely felt experience of the other in everyday life, but instead is predicated precisely on that mere feltness. Interviews with heavy media-use journalists in Egypt and Lebanon are used to posit that it is the discontinuous and dispersed nature of multiple media immersion that affords the kinds of affective experience – busyness, pleasure, distraction, resistance and above all ambivalence – around which subjective recognition can crystallise.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies
2018-0715,2018,Paper Session,Emotional Journalism: The Discursive Construction of Soft News as Hard Facts in U.S. Newspapers,1,"Building on Wahl-Jorgensen’s notion of the “strategic ritual of emotionality” in journalism, this paper argues that reporters and editors have been actively involved in discursively constructing such a strategy of emotional storytelling to undermine traditional forms of objectivity. To trace and analyze the evolution of emotional storytelling, this paper presents a historical case study, examining the emergence of narrative journalism in U.S. newspapers between the 1970s and the 1990s. Drawing from archival research, oral history interviews and textual analysis of trade publications, this paper analyzes the discursive construction of narrative journalism with respect to new journalistic roles that consequently legitimized certain norms, ideas, and practices. It documents a more interpretive approach to news reporting and writing, a paradigmatic shift with implications that still reverberate today.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies

A 2 (involvement: low vs. high) x 2 (framing: emotional vs. rational) between-subject design featuring the health crisis of Zika virus revealed a contrary pattern to expectations: participants had moderately negative attitudes regardless of involvement and there was no interaction effect between involvement levels and type of response. However, those low involved placed a higher blame on the responsible organization than those highly involved. This emphasizes the need to further examine personal relevance and association as key moderators in responsibility attribution.

Structural equation modeling results indicated that problem, constraint and involvement recognition and health consciousness were key predictors of situational motivation for publics’ active communicative actions such as information seeking, forwarding, and forefending. A full mediation model between situational variables and communicative actions, and another full mediation model between lack of information anxiety and communicative actions altogether indicated a mediating role of situational motivation. The analysis also exhibited significant associations between communicative actions and two different types of behavioral engagement, viral and civic engagement.

Although the concept of misinformation has gained momentum in communication science, so far little is known about debunking misinformation during emerging public-health crises. As misinformation is often unavoidable and highly consequential during crises, we rely on an experiment (N=700) to seek a formula for misinformation treatment. We varied respondents’ exposure to type (simple rebuttal, factual elaboration) and source (government health agency, news media, peer) of corrective information after exposure to misinformation. Results show that presence of corrective information can debunk incorrect beliefs based on misinformation and exposure to factual elaboration can stimulate peoples’ intention to take protective actions. Moreover, especially government agency and news media were found to be successful in improving individuals’ belief accuracy. To explore the underlying mechanism behind the effect of corrective information, the mediating role of crisis emotions was observed.",Issues and Crises in Health Communication,Public Relations

The present study investigated how different reading media (screen versus paper) might result in different reading outcomes among older adults due to both cognitive and psychological factors. Using a laboratory experiment with eighty-one participants aged 57 to 85, our results supported past research and showed the influence of cognitive map formation on readers’ feelings of fatigue. Our findings also suggested that individual levels of technophobia was an important barrier to older adults’ effective use of mobile technologies for reading. In the post-hoc analyses, we further showed that technophobia was correlated with technology experience, certain personality traits, and age. The present study highlights the importance of providing tailored support that helps older adults overcome psychological obstacles in using technologies.",Older Adults and Online Technologies,Communication and Technology
2018-0721,2018,Paper Session,"From Exploration to Use: Senior Technology Exploration, Learning and Acceptance (STELA) Model",3,"The purpose of this study is to examine the process from technology exploration to acceptance for older adults. A senior technology exploration, learning and acceptance (STELA) model is proposed to examine the technology exploration and learning process. Adopting a new technology can be increasingly challenging as one’s age increases. In order to help older adults use new technologies so they can be included in today’s digital society, it is essential to understand factors affecting their technology adoption, and how the process is like. Previous research primarily employs qualitative approaches to examine how older adults learn to use new technologies. This study employs four waves of data from a randomized controlled trial computer training intervention with 195 participants in 19 different assisted and independent living communities (AICs). A senior technology exploration, learning and acceptance model (STELA), is proposed in this study. The results show the moderating effect of technology training and support for the relationship of exploring a technology and perceived difficulties of learning. However, the availability of training and support is not a moderator for the relationship between attitudes and exploration. Therefore, it is important to provide adequate training programs and support to help older adults explore technology and facilitate their learning process, for that the perceived difficulties of learning mediate exploration and technology use.",Older Adults and Online Technologies,Communication and Technology

Three and even four generations are now in a position to spend significant parts of their lives together, making it increasingly important to form and maintain strong bonds among older and younger adults in families. One way to maintain the important intergenerational relationships within families is through shared activities appealing to both sides of the age spectrum. In this study, we examined the potential of joint video gameplay to build or restore intergenerational family relationships. Participants (n=183), mainly grandparents and grandchildren, were asked to play video games together over a period of six weeks. Participants completed a modified version of self-other overlap and relationship closeness inventories before and after the treatment and responded to a series of open-ended questions post-treatment. Results indicate a significant increase in the inclusion of other in the self and in relationship closeness. A comparison group (n=88), tasked with having conversations with the same stipulations, yielded considerably less significant results. These findings suggest that video games as a shared activity hold the potential to positively impact family relationships, and thus improve the lives of both younger and older generation.",Older Adults and Online Technologies,Communication and Technology
2018-0723,2018,Paper Session,Privacy Attitudes and Concerns in the Digital Lives of Older Adults: Westin’s Privacy Attitude Typology Revisited,2,"There is a growing literature on younger users’ attitudes toward online privacy, yet little is known about older adults. As older adults join the digital world in growing numbers – going online to connect with friends and family, accessing services, and searching for information – we need to understand their privacy attitudes and concerns. This paper fills this research gap by examining 39 in-depth interviews with older adults (65+) living in East York, Toronto. Westin’s typology of privacy attitudes informs our qualitative data analysis. Specifically, we examine to what extent the typology is useful in understanding privacy attitudes of older adults. Our East York older adults varied considerably in terms of their comfort with digital media and their approach to privacy threats. We propose a typology of older adults that distinguishes this demographic into five categories: fundamentalist, intense pragmatist, relaxed pragmatist, marginally concerned, and cynical expert. We found that each category had a set of unique concerns, but some concerns were shared across several categories, the most common being surveillance, scams, spam, and unauthorized access to personal information. Fundamentalists had few concerns as a group, whereas intense pragmatists had many concerns. The marginally concerned group was more annoyed than concerned about potential privacy breaches. We discuss theoretical implications based on the findings for our understanding of privacy in the context of older adults and discuss implications for offering training geared toward enhancing privacy literacy in this age group.",Older Adults and Online Technologies,Communication and Technology
2018-0724,2018,Paper Session,The Positive Side of Social Comparison and Envy on SNS: Investigating Inspiration on Instagram,2,"SNS such as Facebook or Instagram seem to facilitate social comparison and envy in everyday life, with harmful effects for users’ well-being. Yet, prior research has neglected the positive side of social comparison and envy on SNS: Comparisons can also elicit a beneficial emotional reaction to other people’s online self-presentations (i.e., benign envy) and thus be motivating. We close this gap by investigating how social comparisons and envy on Instagram are related to the complex motivational construct inspiration. Results of a survey among N = 385 Instagram users reveal that participants associated high levels of inspiration with Instagram use. An SEM mediation analysis further indicates that social comparisons on Instagram indirectly increased inspiration via benign envy. Inspiration, in turn, increased positive affect. Our results underline that to understand the effects of SNS on well-being, we also need to consider the positive motivational side of social comparisons and envy on SNS.",Self(ie) Worth: Social Comparison and Well-Being on Instagram and Other Platforms,Communication and Technology

In a cross-sectional survey, participants (N = 396) self-reported their selfie posting behavior on the four social media platforms, the intensity of using each platform, and six psychological variables including self-esteem, life satisfaction, body image satisfaction, impulsivity, loneliness, and depression. Results showed that Snapchat was the platform with the greatest number of selfies posted, followed by Facebook and Twitter. The more intense one used Snapchat, the more selfies they posted on it. Loneliness was positively related to number of selfies posted on Facebook and Twitter.

However, there are questions about the relationship between traditional mass media and behavior on social media, particularly in the context of selfie sharing. In the tradition of social cognitive theory, we argue that reality television models a value system focused on the self and competition for attention, and heavy viewers should base their self-worth on these contingencies. Path analysis results from survey data (N = 334) show that contingencies of self-worth mediate the relationship between reality television viewing and selfie-related behavior. Self-worth based on competition predict specific selfie-related behaviors which were operationalized as capturing, editing and sharing digital images. These three behaviors were carefully explicated and measured via novel instruments. Network variables including online audience size and diversity also played roles in selfie editing and sharing.

Because online friends selectively self-present, social comparisons may be biased upward and produce feelings of inadequacy. However, existing evidence consistently confounded causes or outcomes of social comparison with social comparison itself. The present survey examines how traits, motivations, selectivity, and mood management influence both downward and upward social comparison on social media, and how patterns of comparison influence affect, self-esteem, and misperceptions of others. Results indicated age, social comparison orientation, mood modification, selectivity, and Facebook usage intensity predicted social comparisons. Younger, more frequent users made more upward comparisons, while mood modifiers made more downward comparisons. Comparing upward boosted negative affect, harmed self-esteem, and produced pluralistic ignorance. In contrast, downward comparison enhanced self-esteem and reduced pluralistic ignorance about actual friends. Findings illustrate differential predictors and effects of downward and upward social comparison, and their distinct beneficial and harmful effects.",Self(ie) Worth: Social Comparison and Well-Being on Instagram and Other Platforms,Communication and Technology
2018-0728,2018,Paper Session,Confronting the Unexpected: The Nature and Effects of Attributing Responsibility to Social Media Platforms for Expectancy Violations,5,"People develop folk theories for how social media platforms operate, from which they develop expectations for how platforms shape and direct communication (Rader & Grey, 2015) However, research to date has not closely examined the ways that platforms can violate these expectations and how people attribute responsibility for these events. The present study asks people (N = 137) to describe and explain a time that they experienced something unexpected on a social media site caused by how a site functioned. In addition, people reported the impact of the violation on uncertainty and their feelings towards the platform. Results suggest that people attribute responsibility to platform for violations caused both by the unexpected function of a site and the unexpected use by others. Replicating prior work (Afifi & Metts, 1998), violations lead to changes in uncertainty and evaluation, and the direction of change is moderated by valence of the violation.","How We Decide: Online Judgments, Attributions, Expectations, and Impressions",Communication and Technology
2018-0729,2018,Paper Session,An Investigation of Actual and Perceived Personality Similarity Effects on Social Judgments Across Communication Modalities,5,"We investigate the effects of individuals’ first impressions about the personality traits of others on their social judgments, after a brief encounter in one of three communication modalities: face-to-face, live Facebook profiles, and screenshots of Facebook profiles. Overall, our findings suggest that perceived similarity (i.e the similarity between perceivers’ ratings of targets’ personality and their self-reported personality) yielded stronger effects on interpersonal attraction than actual similarity (i.e. the similarity between perceivers’ and targets’ self-reported personality traits) across all three modalities. Perceived similarity explained significantly more interpersonal attraction in both of the Facebook modalities, in comparison to face-to-face. Polynomial regression analyses offered crucial insights about the non-linear nature of similarity-attraction effects. For example, in terms of agreeableness, similarity-attraction effect was observed in low and high scores of agreeableness, whereas no effect was observed when both the target and the perceiver were close to neutral values.","How We Decide: Online Judgments, Attributions, Expectations, and Impressions",Communication and Technology
2018-0730,2018,Paper Session,Effects of a Secondary Source on Spontaneous Trait Transference in Social Media,5,"The popularity of social media prompts a closer look at impression formation processes in online contexts. This study examines the effects of the presence of a secondary source (i.e., a retweeter on Twitter) on spontaneous trait transference (STT), a phenomenon where communicators are perceived as possessing the traits they describe in others. A 2 (trait: present vs. absent) x 2 (secondary source: present vs. absent) experiment was conducted (N = 136). Participants rated their impressions of primary and secondary sources after reading Twitter messages where a primary source described another person’s behavior either implying a trait or no particular trait. In conditions where a secondary source was present, the secondary source retweeted the primary source’s Twitter message. Results indicate that STT is weakened in the presence of a secondary source, and that STT to the secondary source is weaker than STT to the primary source. Participants perceived the primary source to be more salient than the secondary source, which may explain the difference in the strength of STT between two sources.","How We Decide: Online Judgments, Attributions, Expectations, and Impressions",Communication and Technology

We call this second-order judgment problems. The present study formulated second-order judgement problems into a theoretical model that focuses on the impacts of perceived social distance between a target and the informant who provides the information about the target on judgement formation processes. A set of hypotheses were developed and tested through a web-administrated experiment, in which participants were asked to make judgments in a hypothetical criminal incidence based on the information provided by multiple sources. The results suggested that perceived distance between targets and information sources had positive effects on trustworthiness of information as well as final judgment. However, the effects were found nonlinear, suggesting the possibility of compounded effects. This paper concluded with discussion of the implications of the current findings.","How We Decide: Online Judgments, Attributions, Expectations, and Impressions",Communication and Technology
2018-0732,2018,Paper Session,Communication With Non-Host-Nationals in Migration: The Case of Sojourning Students From the United States and China,1,"The role of interaction with host nationals in promoting sojourners’ intercultural adjustment has been discussed in depth. However, two other types of communication have been neglected in intercultural communication studies. One is sojourners’ communication with their co-ethnics and the other with their international fellows. The former has not received enough attention due to the assumption that it takes a weaker role in facilitating sojourners’ acculturation into the host culture. The latter, for a long time, has not been thoroughly examined due to the dualistic thinking which only pays attention to sojourners’ social interaction with their co-ethnics and with host nationals. Focusing on sojourning students’ communication with their co-ethnics and international fellows, this chapter will argue that these two types of communication can contribute to sojourning students’ acculturation in host cultures by providing social support.","Exploring Business, Student, and Media Experiences: China-U.S./Germany/Chile Intercultural Contexts",Intercultural Communication

Specifically, this study tested the direct and indirect effects (through intergroup anxiety and social attractiveness) of participants’ contact quality with Chinese and perceived strength of identification with Chinese home culture on conflict management styles. Results indicated that there were significant indirect effects of quality of contact and Chinese’s identification with home culture on the problem-solving, competing, and avoiding styles through communication anxiety. In addition, quality of contact had positive direct and indirect effects on the accommodating style through social attraction. Findings in this study generally indicated important ways in which prior contact experiences with outgroup members and perceived strength of outgroup members’ identification with their home culture influence specific communication behaviors during a conflict episode.","Exploring Business, Student, and Media Experiences: China-U.S./Germany/Chile Intercultural Contexts",Intercultural Communication

2018-0735,2018,Paper Session,"Mutual Perceptions of Chinese and German Students at a German University: Stereotypes, Media Influence, and a Worrisome Twist on the Contact Hypothesis",3,"In recent years, China and Germany have become invaluable partners in business, politics, and science. Yet, psychological research indicates that the countries’ large-scale affinity does not translate well onto the individual level, with many Germans expressing reservations towards China. Studies connect this effect to imbalances in media tonality, as German media mostly criticize Chinese politics, contrasting with idealized portrayals from the other direction. Acknowledging the high number of Chinese exchange students in Germany, we investigate mutual stereotypes in the context of a German university, measuring explicit and implicit associations. Despite expressing positive attitudes, both groups strongly prefer their in-group on an implicit level—which matches their generally sparse contact in university life. As hypothesized, German students mainly recall negative China-related media, whereas Chinese students perceive coverage on Germany as positive. However, with the latter showing even more extreme implicit preferences for their home country, a negative contact hypothesis is discussed.","Exploring Business, Student, and Media Experiences: China-U.S./Germany/Chile Intercultural Contexts",Intercultural Communication

Although engaging in self-commodification and providing soft power resources on behalf of the nation are both practices that are indicative of neoliberal governmentality, directors also use branding to attain creative autonomy and improve their professional standing. Kenyan music video directors build personal brands to wrestle creative control from their clients during the production process and they invoke their experiences representing Kenya abroad to elevate their professional status at home. Thus, branding in the Kenyan music video industry reveals both the power and the limits of governmental control over cultural production.","Country Images, Culture and Nation Branding",Public Diplomacy

2018-0742,2018,Paper Session,"""But How Are They Talked About?"": A Novel Measure of Entity Framing in Online News",4,"In this paper, we introduce a novel method for analyzing entity framing in a large corpus of online news articles. This measure is proposed as a solution to the heretofore intractable problem of large-scale analysis of framing for particular entities within corpora too large to be reliably hand-coded and for which no document selection procedures have been devised. In this method, a semantic network is constructed from preprocessed text wherein nodes represent individual words/n-grams, and edge weights represent cosine distance between words or n-grams in high-dimensional vector space. A random walk with restart (RWR) is initiated across the graph from the node of interest, creating a list of words associated with the node which can then be analyzed using a variety of computational or manual coding techniques. We demonstrate that this method serves as a helpful tool for the analysis of latent frames for both media researchers and journalists.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods

We present the results of applying the methods to a new corpus of 313,450 news articles showing the extent of textual overlap using both the more and less sensitive approaches evaluated. Despite our expectations from qualitative studies of journalists’ working practices, we find little evidence of the large-scale recycling of press releases, or copy from competing news sources. We detect heavy use of wire copy, but find the large majority of it to be directly attributed.

We explore the causes of textual reuse in the corpus, differentiating several distinct sources of overlap.

Computational data collection and text analysis techniques in this study allow for a large-scale comparison between social media posts embedded with a link to a news story and the original news stories. To test whether news organizations sentimentalize news on Twitter, I compare valence of news and tweets embedding a link to the original news story. Also, I measured the conditional probability that a word appears on a tweet given that it also appeared on the original news story. I categorized news organizations using a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the measured paraphrasing strategies. Finally, I suggested a model-based approach that extends the conditional probability measure, which allows for rigorous statistical tests.

In this study, we investigate how much of an impact these social media editors really have, focusing on the impact of newspapers' public pages on Facebook. Since the actions of individual users are not visible on many platforms due to privacy consideration, we propose a method that leverages time series of aggregated scores for total user engagement, which are available for various platforms. We use this method to study and compare the influence of Facebook pages for six newspapers from the UK, the Netherlands and Flanders, for all news items published over two weeks in 2017.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0748,2018,Paper Session,The Good and Bad in Economic News: Comparing (Automatic) Measurements of Sentiment in Dutch Economic News,3,"Scholars have repeatedly investigated the tone of economic news coverage over the course of many years or even decades. Because such studies, ideally, analyze more news items than feasibly is done with a manual content analysis, automatic measurements of tone have become increasingly popular and several classifiers have been developed and applied. However, similarities and differences between such automated sentiment classifiers in news items remain largely unknown, especially in smaller languages as Dutch. The current study compares four of such tools (SentiStrength, Pattern, Polyglot, DANEW) with a manual analysis of tone and a simple classifier (based on only 65 words). Results demonstrate that Polyglot and the simple classifier yield tone scores that are most comparable with manual coding. Remarkably, the different automatic classifiers only correlate very weakly among themselves. Overall, automatic sentiments measures are slightly better in capturing the tone of news headlines than that of complete articles.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0749,2018,Paper Session,Understanding News Stories by Clustering Articles: An Information Retrieval Approach,2,"We present a new method for identifying linked news stories from within a large number of articles, using Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to identify the textual closeness between pairs of articles and a network approach using Infomap to subsequently optimize the partition of the group into distinct stories. We distinguish IR approaches from other popular approaches to quantitative analysis of text, including dictionary, supervised and automated clustering methods. We argue for the value of Information Retrieval approaches as a means of quantitatively analysing textual data, particularly when trying to identify small amounts of relevant text within a very large corpus. This paper serves as a demonstration of how a real-world research question can benefit from the application of information retrieval techniques, as well as a substantive contribution to computational research projects with a unit of analysis at story rather than article level.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods

Only recently, however, have scholars of work begun to consider the impact of precarity in the workplace on work-life interrelationships. This study contributes to that research and expands its focus beyond the form of precarity represented by job insecurity to other forms of precarity that inhere in the management of work-life interrelationships for working families in industrialized nations. Taking a communication as constitutive of work-life interrelationships perspective, we examine, in middle income working mothers’ accounts of work-life, how precarity is communicatively constituted and how it is communicatively managed – both discursively (through forms of sensemaking), and materially (through practices involving information and communication technologies). We identify four intertwined forms of precarity and strategies by which participants manage them. We discuss implications of our findings for individuals’ relationships to the organizations that employ them and organizational change.","Voices, Voicing, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

However, there are few conceptual much less theoretical resources in extant scholarship on collaboration that address listening. In this paper we aim to: 1) highlight ways that listening has been overlooked in key veins of scholarship on collaboration; 2) bring listening theory from other scholarly domains to bear on collaboration; 3) propose an expanded conceptualization of listening as communicative act, voice, and invitation to hospitable dialogue; and 4) illustrate how this expanded conceptualization enhances analysis of collaborative practices.","Voices, Voicing, and Organizing",Organizational Communication
2018-0752,2018,Paper Session,"Employees’ Role in Talking, Acting, and “Voicing” Corporate Social Responsibility: A Case Study",1,"Despite the literature on CSR and employees is on the rise, there is little debate over whether and why employees can be seen as one of the most important organizational constituencies when it comes to CSR, and what role may employees play in “walking the CSR talk.” This research uses a qualitative case study of a global pharmaceutical company to explore the ways employees “talk CSR into being” as informed and shaped by a distinct organizational discourse. Doing so, this study compares employees’ constructions of CSR against corporate CSR talk, and brings to focus the interplay between employees’ ascribed role in CSR, and how such role gets enacted (achieved) in their daily work. New theoretical and empirical insights into both the “realized” and “unrealized” potentials of employee agency and voice in CSR are shared and problematized, thereby, contributing to the literature on CSR—and organizational communication, broadly.","Voices, Voicing, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

It argues that the current relation undermines the artistic freedom and aesthetic values of the film industry, featuring China’s adamant control with quota and censorship system and U.S. filmmakers’ compromises to appease Chinese censors to enter the lucrative market. The paper reveals the reasons for this relation through reading the representation of censorship and artistic freedom in policies and trade documents, arguing that the current relation is shaped by China’s persistence on the ideological needs for film control and the U.S.’s lack of concern on the impact of censorship and its impact on artistic freedom reflected in the policies and trade negotiations.

The paper first examines the CoE perspective, including the European Court of Human Rights case law and non-binding documents of the other main CoE institutions. Then, it analyses the Russian national legislation and the highest Russian courts’ perspectives. The paper compares the CoE and Russian legal visions of key principles to govern online freedom of expression, the new notion of media, editorial responsibility for the readers comments, the right to anonymity and the protection of journalists from surveillance. The paper concludes that the Russian legislation concerning online freedom of expression needs a considerable revision to comply with the CoE standards and suggests that Internet companies and international organisations should drive this process.",Global Perspectives in the Governance of Freedom of Expression,Communication Law & Policy

2018-0757,2018,Paper Session,The Market of Loyalties in Bulgarian Politics: Political Parties as Distributors of Transnational Ideologies via Freedom of Expression and Hate Speech Discourse,1,"According to Freedom House (2015), global press freedom declined in 2014 to its lowest point in more than 10 years. Bulgaria’s rating has deteriorated gradually since 2002, when it was rated #38 of 134 countries, to a staggering #106 of 180 countries in 2015. This is despite the proliferation of hate speech that is used by ultra-nationalistic political parties such as Ataka, targeting ethnic Turks, Roma, Jews, and Syrian refugees among others.
Through Price’s (1994) market of loyalties approach, this paper grapples with the following questions: If freedom of expression is restricted to this extent, but hate speech is robust, what is being censored in Bulgaria? The increase of hate speech compromises peace, so how is the political environment fostering the increasing number of ultra-nationalistic parties since 2005? Finally, why do media regulators restrict freedom of expression while concurrently tolerating hate speech?",Global Perspectives in the Governance of Freedom of Expression,Communication Law & Policy

Research suggests that current vaccination criticists are well-educated parents having higher health literacy (HL) who could be influenced by anti-vaccination on the Internet. It is unclear whether confirmation bias plays a role here. This study investigates the relationship between HL and the selection and evaluation of vaccination-related OHI and to what extent this depends on people’s existing vaccination beliefs. 480 parents of young children (0-4) were exposed to vaccination-related information. They were asked to select messages that interested them, and to evaluate positive and negative vaccine-related information for credibility, usefulness, and convincingness. Results showed that HL is associated with a biased selection and the perception that belief-consistent information is more convincing, but only if people hold strong beliefs either in favor or against vaccination. HL also influences the perceived credibility and usefulness of positive vaccine-related information, but only when people have strong positive beliefs.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication
2018-0761,2018,Paper Session,Comparing the Impact of a School-Based Health Literacy Intervention for Rural Children in Low and High Income Schools,4,"Second grade students from a rural low income school had lower baseline health literacy scores in the first year of testing than students from a high-income school in the same district. Low health literacy indicates that a person may struggle with numeracy, reasoning, reading, and comprehension regarding health information. Though children's health literacy has rarely been studied, low health literacy in adulthood is associated with poor health outcomes. Students from the low-income school showed low health literacy at pretest, but after a health literacy intervention delivered by their teachers, students’ posttest health literacy scores increased so that there was no longer a gap in health literacy between students from the low and high income schools. As these second graders transitioned into third grade the pattern was repeated such that after receiving a health literacy intervention, student health literacy in the priority school increased significantly and there was no discrepancy between schools. These findings suggest that a health literacy intervention integrated into elementary school curricula has the potential to reduce health literacy disparities among children. It is our hope that equity in health literacy will continue into adulthood for these children and will help close the gap in health disparities.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication

2018-0763,2018,Paper Session,Health Literacy and Diabetes-Related Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis,3,"Background: Health literacy is a prominent topic in health communication as studies have shown that low health literacy levels are associated with poorer health outcomes, especially in chronically ill patients such as diabetes patients. Narrative and systematic reviews have described the relationship between health literacy and diabetes outcomes, leading to heterogeneous results. Meta-analytic summaries of original research in this area are lacking.
Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis by searching five databases (MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and CENTRAL) for original empirical studies on adult diabetes patients that included at least one validated measure of health literacy or numeracy and one measure of diabetes-related outcomes. We extracted different demographics and methodological information from all retained studies and used Fisher's r-to-z transformation as a measure of effect size.
Results: The meta-analysis, including 41 studies, showed mixed results. Health literacy was significantly negatively related to glycaemic control only in studies with type II diabetes patients and in studies where the proportion of low educated patients was higher. Health literacy was positively related to specific diabetes self-care (blood monitoring), in particular, when the studies were carried out in American countries, used type II diabetes patients only, and used diabetes specific health literacy measures. A consistent positive relationship was found for health literacy and numeracy and diabetes knowledge. Egger’s tests did not point towards any publication bias.

2018-0765,2018,Paper Session,You Mad?: An Experimental Test of the Anger Activism Model,1,"Despite anger’s motivational ability to inspire action, persuasion researchers have largely ignored anger appeals. The purpose of this experiment was to test Turner’s (2007) Anger Activism Model (AAM), which posits anger appeals can persuade pro-attitudinal audiences if the anger appeal is followed by an efficacy appeal. Participants (N = 551) were randomly assigned to read one of four messages about sugary drink marketing to kids, following a 2 (moral anger: high vs. low) X 2 (efficacy: high vs. low) design, or to a no-exposure control group. The anger-by-efficacy interactions did not emerge, but a high moral anger appeal (vs. low) promoted policy support among audiences with initially higher levels of policy support. Contrary to the AAM’s predictions, exposure to any message (vs. control) increased policy support among audiences with initially lower levels of policy support. These results call for continued theoretical and practical attention to messages designed to arouse anger.",Communication in Shaping Health Policymaking and Policy Support,Health Communication

The versions of the PSAs that showed consequences to others were more successful at eliciting alcohol-control policy support than the versions showing only consequences to the self. As hypothesized, state empathy and negative emotions were supported as mediators of this relationship. Although negative affect and feelings of empathy for the victims of drunk driving are not pleasant emotions, they appear to play an important role in increasing support for public policies to increase safety without having a negative impact on viewer’s evaluations of the PSA.",Communication in Shaping Health Policymaking and Policy Support,Health Communication

This experimental study (N = 396) tests effects of patient narratives about treatment with medical cannabis on attitudes toward recreational cannabis. Participants were randomly assigned to view a narrative, or an expository video containing equivalent information about medical cannabis. Exposure to narratives indirectly increased positive attitudes towards recreational cannabis use through changing attitudes towards medical cannabis. Participants who viewed a narrative message reported more positive attitudes toward medical cannabis, compared with participants who viewed an expository message. Attitudes toward medical cannabis, were in turn, positively associated with attitudes toward recreational cannabis use. These results suggest that media coverage in the form of patient narratives about medical cannabis may influence attitudes toward recreational cannabis.

2018-0768,2018,Paper Session,The Influence of Natural Cigarette Advertising on Tobacco Control Policy Support,4,"Research indicates that exposure to advertising for natural cigarette brands such as Natural American Spirit (NAS) results in erroneous beliefs that these products are healthier than traditional cigarettes. In 2017, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company agreed to remove “natural” and “additive-free” from NAS advertisements; however, “natural” will stay in the NAS name, and terms including “organic” and “tobacco and water” remain permissible, causing concern for public health advocates looking for stronger policy action from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Despite the importance of policy action, few studies have examined whether product advertising affects support for related policy. Here, results of a randomized experiment exploring the effects of exposure to NAS advertising content show that exposure reduced support for policies restricting misleading terminology in natural cigarette advertising. Further, misinformed beliefs about the healthy composition of these cigarettes negatively predicted policy support and partially mediated effects of exposure on policy support.",Communication in Shaping Health Policymaking and Policy Support,Health Communication

Their use of the platform is characterized as a form of ‘wounded-storytelling’, a concept from the field of medical narrative that describes how those who suffer regain agency as healers through storytelling. The practice, however, is nuanced and studied in light of Instagram’s platform culture, data, and infrastructure. More concretely, through the technique of co-hashtag network analysis it is found that hashtags and visual memes enable the circulation of a coded-language that reframes ‘motherhood after loss’, making wounded-storytelling into a form of networked and public resistance against the taboos around stillbirth.",HIGH-DENSITY: Health Communication in Social Media,Health Communication
2018-0775,2018,Paper Session,Social Media as Bridges to Link YMSM and Physicians in China,10,"Background: Many young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are reluctant to seek health services and trust local physicians. Online information seeking may encourage YMSM to identify and see trustworthy physicians, obtain sexual health services, and obtain testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study examined online STI information seeking behaviors among Chinese YMSM and its association with offline physician visits.

Methods: We conducted a nationwide online survey among YMSM through WeChat, the largest social media platform in China. We collected information on individual demographics, sexual behaviors, online STI information seeking, offline STI testing, and STI physician visits. We examined the most commonly-used platforms (search engines, governmental websites, counseling websites, generic social media, gay mobile apps, and mobile medical apps) and their trustworthiness, and assessed interest and willingness to use an MSM-friendly physician finder function embedded within a gay mobile app. Logistic regression models were used to examine the correlation between online STI information searching and offline physician visits.

Results: A total of 503 men completed the survey. Most men (425/503, 84.5%) searched for STI information online. The most commonly used platform to obtain STI information were search engines (402/425, 94.5%), followed by gay mobile apps (201/425, 47.3%). Men reported high trustworthiness of information received from gay mobile apps. Men also reported high interest (465/503, 92.4%) and willingness (463/503, 92.0%) to use a MSM-friendly physician finder function within such apps. Both using general social media (aOR =1.18, 95%CI: 1.08 -1.30) and gay mobile apps (aOR =1.10, 95%CI: 1.01-1.20) for online information seeking were associated with visiting a physician.

Conclusion: Online STI information seeking is common and correlated with visiting a physician among YMSM.

This study aimed to empirically explore these different views on science fiction by examining the relationship between the science fiction consumption and the audiences’ sexist attitudes toward STEM fields and women in STEM fields based on cultivation theory. The study results demonstrated that lifetime viewing of science fiction is related to positive attitudes toward women in STEM fields and less sexist attitudes toward those fields, but this effect was significant only through the experience of boundary expansion from viewing the genre.

A 2x2 experiment was conducted in which participants read either a high or low attainability message, then portrayals of female role models in the counter-stereotypical career with a family (high congruity to the female gender role) or without a family (low congruity to the female gender role). Results showed that the high attainability message helped buffer against the upward comparison threat, leading to self-inspiration and higher career interest, but only when the portrayals were in a less self-relevant domain.

Experimental news stories presented assertion frames highlighting either safety from or vulnerability to violent crime and crime risk information expressing crime prevalence statistics in three different formats (i.e., absolute frequency, relative frequency and percentages) following a 2x3 factorial design. Findings indicate that the probability formats including relative frequency and percentage primarily drive the emotional effects of assertion frames. Furthermore, the negative emotions elicited by the interplay between the probability formats and the unsafe assertion can produce pessimistic risk assessments. These results not only contribute to our understanding of number format and assertion frame effects in the contexts of crime risk, but also to the larger body of framing theory regarding interactions between frames operating at different textual levels.",Risk and Media,Mass Communication
2018-0781,2018,Paper Session,"Systemic Racism, Twitter, and a Typology: A Content Analysis of #FlintWaterCrisis Tweets",1,"Access to clean water is an increasing global concern. In the United States, the city of Flint, Michigan has been experiencing a water contamination crisis since April 2014. The city’s piping infrastructure was damaged from untreated, corrosive Flint River water that was designated as the city’s interim water supply from 2014 to 2015. Flint’s crisis is slow-moving, has a prolonged crisis stage, and emergent information is omnipresent regarding blame, health effects, and operational and organizational failures in foresight. Therefore, this content analysis examines Tweets surrounding Flint’s water crisis, using the hashtag #FlintWaterCrisis as a search strategy to examine the plurality of voices communicating about this crisis. Specifically, Tweets were sampled within the week of release of an implicative piece of emergent information: the Michigan Civil Rights Commission’s (2017) report. This report details the role of systemic racism in Flint’s crisis. Systematic random sampling was used to create a sample based on “every fifth Tweet.” This resulted in a sample of (n=255) Tweets that were coded by two coders with high intercoder reliability. Results reveal that over half of the sample were original Tweets composed by lay individuals. In coding for and testing Houston et al.’s (2014) typology of disaster social media functions, over half of the Tweets discussed socio-political and scientific causes and implications of and responsibility for Flint’s crisis. The two most populated need displays according to uses and gratifications theory were cognitive displays and tension release displays. Implications are discussed regarding communicative functions of disaster social media, empirically testing Houston et al.’s (2014) typology, crisis communication, crisis (communication) professionals and praxis, uses and gratifications, and areas for future research.",Risk and Media,Mass Communication

It found both similarities and differences in terms of the channels and sources/contacts used for disaster information seeking and sharing, and the predictors of use of these channels in these two countries. Specifically, conventional media (newspapers, mobile apps, emails, brochures, and messaging services) and para-social media (FtF, phone calls, texting, mobile apps) were the most important channels for receiving disaster information from diverse sources as well as enabling wide sharing in the U.S. and Chinese samples, respectively. We also found the evidence showing the embeddedness of technology mediated-communication in Chinese respondents’ disaster social interactions. Among the personal factors, subjective norms were the most consistent predictor of all types of information channels in both samples.",Risk and Media,Mass Communication

Sixteen focus groups were conducted with citizens aged between 18 and 69 from five SEA countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Findings revealed that participants across the five countries utilized a combination of communication channels to acquire, receive, and evaluate nuclear-related information. However, participants’ media consumption preferences and habits differed across countries. Participants also agreed upon their credibility perceptions toward communication mediums, such as online and social media. Yet, the findings revealed cross-national differences regarding the news media outlets. Theoretical implications and practical implications for policymakers and communication practitioners were discussed.

An analysis of 550 political media articles reveals a complete dissociation between statistical power and alpha level in the literature. This study proposes the use of discontinuous criterion power analysis to address this power-alpha blind spot. Analyses indicate the persistence of Type II error concerns, but a majority of works retain sufficient power to warrant the use of stricter alpha levels to detect small effects. The surgical use of more stringent alpha levels to guard against Type I error will instill greater confidence in the field’s findings.",Methodology: New Thinking About Methods and Measures,Political Communication

In this paper, I propose a perspective upon discourse analysis that explicates and formalizes the major steps and resources involved in the contextualization and interpretation of discourse texts. Drawing upon techniques in computational text analysis, corpus linguistics, and semantic network analysis, I propose an algorithmic strategy for analyzing discourse. Extracting key semantic and relational information expressed in political discourse, it uses intertextual linkages to reconstruct relevant context knowledge and identify sets of information capable of sustaining coherent interpretations. Its detailed representation of both manifest and inferred contextual information enables a systematic appraisal of the contingency and multiplicity of discursive meanings. By explicating tacit knowledge, formalizing intuitive inferencing strategies and modeling their implications for discourse interpretation, algorithmic Discourse Analysis offers important new avenues for research.",Methodology: New Thinking About Methods and Measures,Political Communication

By systematically identifying, reviewing, and analyzing 134 articles in five of the top communications journals, we document deficits in existing research including geographic biases toward high-income Western democracies, minimal time series analyses allowing for temporal studies of media use patterns, and little consistency or consensus about how to measure and track news media exposure. We further show that the predictors of news use remain under-examined, with most studies treating media exposure as a sui generis independent explanatory or control variable in models of other behaviors and attitudes. Given the central role played by media exposure in most contemporary political communication research, the gaps revealed by our analysis indicate a pressing need for a refocused research agenda around forging best practices and new methods of measurement.",Methodology: New Thinking About Methods and Measures,Political Communication

Today, over seventy years after its construction, the wall is a material reminder for Detroit’s residents of the city’s racially contentious past. Recently, however, local artists painted the wall with murals of civil rights heroes and iconic moments from America’s civil rights struggle. The 8 Mile wall exists as a site of public memory, compelling visitors to reflect on struggles with housing segregation and racism. This essay proposes a mode of public memory, emergent memory, by which material sites built without commemorative purposes earn mnemonic value over time because to their rhetorical strength.

In addition, considering the extensive impact of new media technologies, especially mobile SNS platforms, we chose Tweeter as the source of data to analyze collective actions (Messages used for the analysis: N=1,779,902). We argue that understanding social movement requires comprehensions about the processes to construct characteristic identities and actions of collective actors involved in a movement. From this socio-cultural perspective of social movement, we drew three research questions asking about specific features of collective action repertoire, collective identity, and issue framing. Using multiple analytical methods including content analysis and semantic network analysis, we suggest that the collective actions and identities shape and are shaped throughout the movements as the participants in the movements are interacting with not only counter-movement actors but also social, economic, and cultural conditions of the movement.",Collective Identities and Memories,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

For news stories that depict moral violations, it is expected that the related emotions influence memory for information presented in the news story. To examine these assumed effects, two online experiments using news articles were conducted, manipulating violation of the moral domains care (N = 79) and fairness (N = 104). Emotional reaction was considered as a mediating mechanism between moral violations and information processing. In the care study, anger but not compassion had a positive effect on recall for information in the news that reported on the care violation relative to information presented in distraction articles. However, results in the fairness study produced different patterns and thus have to be discussed.

The extensive media coverage, non-stop updates, and the blurred line between reporting and archiving saturate collective memory with firsthand accounts and fragmented narratives. Weibo privileges the use of language that benefits journalists and media-affiliated groups most. Journalism draws on mnemonic practices to organize collective pondering over crises and current power structures in a shrinking space of online expression.

2018-0816,2018,Paper Session,How Digital Inequalities Affect Social Well-Being,3,"Digital inequalities have real consequences for individuals’ everyday life—this basic assumption drives digital inequality research worldwide. Recent efforts focus on tangible benefits of online engagement, yet subjective measures of quality of life are lacking. This article contributes to closing this gap. First, it theoretically introduces the appraisal of one’s functioning in society as an additional measure of digital inequalities. Second, it tests the dependence of this social well-being on digital inequality dimensions using structural equation modeling with nationally representative survey data. Results reveal that digital belongingness directly increases social well-being and Internet skills do so indirectly, whereas the net effect of Internet use is insignificant. These findings lead to recommendations for policies targeting digital inequalities and future research directions.",Digital Literacy: Unpacking Outcomes,Communication and Technology
2018-0817,2018,Paper Session,"Any Thing for Anyone? The Internet of Things, the Paradox of Skills, and Digital Inequality",2,"The “Internet-of-Things” (IoT) promises many potential social benefits across a range of areas. We argue that attention to the skills needed by individuals is an important issue for public policy, to fully exploit these technologies, and to avoid unintended consequences. We expect comparative advantages to increase based on differentiated skills, enabling smaller groups of people to benefit, and disadvantaging others in new ways. This need for renewed attention to digital skills at first seems paradoxical, given that many of these technologies operate autonomously. We discuss evolving digital technologies and related skills, and explain from a systems perspective how IoT differs from prior technologies, for policymakers as well as individuals, who must anticipate the consequences of technology use in complex systems. Finally, we bring the issues of the digital divide and IoT skills together and set an agenda for future research on IoT, as well as for public policy.",Digital Literacy: Unpacking Outcomes,Communication and Technology

Results from this study suggest lower SES participants primarily use the internet to train and educate themselves in areas where they would like to work while they apply to online jobs. However, the participants struggled to find concrete examples showing the immediate benefit of the internet outside of socialization and easier job application processes compared to in-person physical job application processes requiring transportation. While the majority were looking for employment, many held on to the belief that internet held substantial ability to uplift economically. These “aspirations of economic potential” surrounding participant rhetoric embodied a positive outlook, yet may appear unattainable given broader political, economic and monopolistic online features of U.S. society.",Digital Literacy: Unpacking Outcomes,Communication and Technology

First, it explores the extent to which diversity of connectivity enables online privacy behavior. Second, it explains the diversity of connectivity-online privacy behavior link in terms of information literacy. Drawing evidence from survey data among urban poor youth in Metro Manila, results suggested that diversity of connectivity is directly related to online privacy behavior. An indirect influence was likewise found, such that, diversity of connectivity exerts influence on online privacy behavior via information literacy. Diversified connection to internet was likely to heighten information literacy, and in turn, heightened information literacy was likely to facilitate online privacy behavior. For youth in the Global South, structure offers critical resource for protective online behavior. Implications to social differentiation approach, “under-connectedness,” and youth's rights in the digital age are elaborated.",Digital Literacy: Unpacking Outcomes,Communication and Technology

Results are reported from an ongoing experiment in which female participants (N=46) negotiated through male or female avatars. Participants who negotiated against a male avatar were significantly more aggressive, but there were no effects of avatar gender on negotiation outcomes. Participants who negotiated with female avatars were more satisfied with their self-image and relationship with their opponents than were those who negotiated with male avatars, and there was higher satisfaction with the relationship among participants who negotiated against a female avatar opponent. Prior to negotiating, participants expected female avatar opponents to be more competent and trustworthy than male opponents, but avatar gender had no effect on opponent ratings after negotiating. Implications for stereotype persistence in virtual environments are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Avatars",Communication and Technology

The design of the study is a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design. Two groups of participants are being recruited: elderly people and younger adults. The participants are supposed to watch a sequence of videos (15-20 minutes) of a virtual assistant reviewing their imaginary monthly schedules. All schedules are emotionally valenced and the agent responds to each uttered schedule in two different conditions: empathic vs neutral responses. After watching each video, the participants are asked to evaluate the agent’s behavior by filling a questionnaire. The results of this study can help with better and more precise design guidelines for different groups of users.","HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Avatars",Communication and Technology

In turn, there has been a great deal of popular discussion in recent years of newly emerging mainstream virtual reality (VR) systems serving as potential “empathy machines”. However, conceiving of empathy as a multidimensional construct, individual dimensions may be potentially differentially influenced by different aspects of immersive media use. The present study examines how cognitive, affective, and associative empathy may each be independently influenced by separate component elements of psychological presence (self-location, copresence, and social realism, respectively). In addition, it considers how message relevance and emotional flow – the series of emotional shifts one experiences during exposure to a media message – may moderate the above relationships. A holistic model of immersion’s impact on empathy is proposed and tested via a 3 (immersion) x 2 (message relevance) between-subjects experimental design.","HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Avatars",Communication and Technology

With a focus on human-chatbot interaction, the present study examined a) the effects of chatbot use on humanness perception toward chatbot, b) the effects of humanness perception on continuous use intention, c) the mediation process by which chatbot use indirectly affects continuous use intention through humanness perception, and d) the moderating effect of sense of belonging on the mediation process. An online survey was conducted in South Korea (N = 645). Our findings suggest that artificial intelligence agents such as chatbots will be perceived and treated as human beings. And such perception will lead individuals to interact with the agents more frequently and continuously. Those artificial agents even might become complementary to or substitute for traditional interpersonal interaction. Specifically, individuals with poor social relations may be most likely to appreciate the artificial companion.","HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Avatars",Communication and Technology

2018-0833,2018,Paper Session,A Continued Application of Confirmation Theory: Division-I Student-Athletes’ Responses to Coach Confirmation,2,"Confirmation theory recognizes that the communication of challenge and acceptance fosters a variety of positive experiences for recipients. This study utilized confirmation theory as a framework to explore coach confirmation as an effective coaching behavior within collegiate athletics. Coaching effective was assessed via student-athletes’ reports of communication satisfaction, sport satisfaction, motivation, competitiveness, and cognitive learning. Data obtained from 179 Division-I student-athletes from across the United States revealed that coaches’ use of challenge was associated with an increase in student-athletes’ satisfaction, motivation, competitiveness, and learning, whereas the use of acceptance was associated with the increases satisfaction alone. These findings demonstrate that confirmation functions differently within the athletic context, as challenge is the premier predictor of student-athletes’ experiences. The implications of this data reveal that student-athletes’ reports of coach effectiveness are largely determined by the implementation of strategies and efforts to refine skillsets and assist in development.","Attitudes, Emotions, and Gratifications: A Psychological Perspective of Sports Communication",Sports Communication

Using the theoretical framework of social identity theory, this study examined how nationalistic attitudes affect participants’ perceptions of athletes who engage in a form of activism. A 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 between-subjects’ factorial design was used for a manipulated newspaper article focusing on the issue of a college quarterback kneeling for the national anthem. Results found no significant effects with respect to implicit and explicit racial cues. Data did support the notion that individuals who displayed higher levels of nationalism would respond with more negative emotions to the athlete activism. On a theoretical level, this study lends support to the ideas of social identity theory and social identity threat management.

Specifically, the present study examines connections between argument effectiveness and appropriateness (the sub-dimensions of competence), argumentative traits, and situational features, as well as subsequent effects of competence on argument satisfaction. In addition, self-perceived versus observed argument competence were compared. Participants in the study (N = 50 dyads) completed measures before and after a face-to-face argumentative discussion with another person about one of two possible topics (student athlete pay and texting while driving). Results revealed that argumentation traits did not affect argumentative competence, but competence was correlated with situational features and differed based on sex. Argument satisfaction depended only on arguers’ own competence, not their partners. Finally, a perceptual bias existed regarding argument effectiveness (but not appropriateness) in that participants evaluated themselves more positively in this respect. These results are discussed in the context of interpersonal communication.",Managing Conflict and Negative Events,Interpersonal Communication

A sample of 436 first-year college students reported their communication environment growing up, perceived friend and family support, communication confidence, and communicative resilience at two points in time. Mediational model testing revealed that friend and family support mediate the positive relationship between communication environment and resilience.

Obsessive relational intrusion (ORI) represents a continuum of behaviors common to the crime of stalking. Substantive proportions of stalkers have clinical disorders, but the majority are subclinical and do not have diagnosed disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate personality traits associated with the Dark Triad as possible predictors of perpetrating obsessive relational intrusion. Because there are examples of socially successful Dark Triadic individuals, this study also investigated the roles of adult attachment style and communication competence as moderators in ORI perpetration. The results indicate that Dark Triad traits and ORI perpetration are positively correlated, however, only psychopathy emerged as a strong, individual predictor of ORI perpetration.",Managing Conflict and Negative Events,Interpersonal Communication

2018-0843,2018,Paper Session,Between Media Studies and Organizational Communication: Organizing as the Creation of Organs,2,"In this paper, we propose to examine the notion of medium, which will be compared with another term that, in our opinion, hold a family resemblance, that is, the one of organ. As we will show, these terms should, in fact, be understood relationally, that is, they should always be used to refer to something or even someone that is positioned or positions itself/himself/herself as the means by which something or someone else do something. While both terms—media and organs—tend to be neglected in the organizational communication literature, we believe their heuristic power is worth being examined to understand key aspects of organizing. Having established this point, we then explore how various beings can articulate themselves (in both senses of the word: enunciating and assembling) so that they become the media/organs of one another, and that the ensuing collective action becomes, to a certain degree, that of a collective body. Getting organized or organizing ourselves thus means becoming, partially and temporarily, the medium/organ of a collective action that will materialize and express itself through our contributions.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication

The study is based on qualitative interviews with 42 women scientists and engineers who are currently employed in organizations. Using thematic narrative analysis, the answer to the question, how do women craft stories of resilience when negotiating STEM career pathways, was explored. The three important themes of the study were 1) crafting stories about rebounding from long term career breaks, 2) narratives of short term resiliencies in career pathways and 3) anticipation as a narrative device. The findings suggest that women in STEM careers construct their sustenance in organizations though storytelling and shared meaning making of their present and past challenging experiences with respect to their careers. In addition, some of their stories are anticipatory in nature without having gone through the event in reality. Implications for retention in organizations and policy changes are discussed.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication

This overly positive portrayal of the benefits of HRO theory present a skewed perspective that favors implementation of these principles without fully understanding the human costs to HRO members associated with operating under the intense conditions called for by HRO theory. This paper is a first step toward understanding the costs associated with implementing HRO theory. Our findings suggest that HRO members experience mental and emotional strain due to their membership. Constant comparative analysis identified five ways that this mental and emotional strain is present: paranoia, cost/benefit analyses of performing work tasks, mental fatigue, jadedness, and non-work relationship deterioration. These results indicate that, contrary to calls from HRO researchers for all organizations to implement these principles, caution and mindfulness is required by organizational leaders when adopting these principles.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication

In order to address some of these issues, psychophysiological measures can be applied as an additional method since they provide further insights into cognitive and emotional processing of media content. However, only a small amount of studies on the processing and impact of health communication have taken advantage of this approach. On the basis of 42 experimental studies using psychophysiological methods, we provide a systematic review of the use of psychophysiological measures of attention, cognitive effort, arousal and emotional experience in health communication research.

First set of focus groups was with participants who had never used WATs. These focus groups included a WAT trial. Other focus groups were conducted with short-term, long-term, and former WAT users. The results revealed that older adults in different WAT use stages liked different WAT features. Long-term users were the most diverse and sophisticated users of WAT. Long-term users had developed a habit of WAT use while other participants needed to employ various encouragement strategies. Social support with the focus on collaboration was the primary motivator for long-term users, while short-terms and former users focused on competition, and non-users engaged in vicarious WAT use experiences.

Stigmatized representations are widely documented across mediums and the negative effects of these portrayals on individuals with mental illness are serious. However, recent health communication scholarship has identified another trend in mediated portrayal of mental illness whereby these diseases are trivialized. One component of trivialization is the idea that the symptoms of a mental illness are actually beneficial to the individual. The aim of the present study was to develop a scale of symptoms of benefits. Results across three studies support the existence of a reliable and valid two-factor scale whereby symptoms demark individuals with a mental illness as either exceptional or fortunate.",Innovative Methods and Measures for Health Communication Research,Health Communication

We conducted an eye-tracking study, presenting children one of two versions of a media-stimulus, either presenting a food low in nutritional value (candy condition), or a food high in nutritional value (fruit condition). As moderators, we modeled children’s prohibition of candy at home for children’s level of BMI. As the dependent variables, we investigated dwell time and pupil dilation. Our results indicate that mean dwell time did not differ between groups and that the moderators did not exert any effect. Moreover, pupil dilation did not differ between groups but was moderated by parents’ candy prohibition at home. Pupil dilation for children in the candy condition was significantly higher when parents prohibited candy consumption at home compared to children who were allowed to eat candy at home. This indicates a “Forbidden Fruit Effect”.",Innovative Methods and Measures for Health Communication Research,Health Communication

In experiment 1, we used a self-threat (yes vs. no) x 3 (medium: Facebook vs. comic vs. website)-design. The results showed that Facebook users reported a larger decrease in negative mood than the participants in the other two conditions. State self-esteem was not affected. In experiment 2, we used a better self-threat manipulation and focused in more detail on the underlying processes by comparing a Facebook use for social snacking condition with a Facebook use for self-affirmation condition (vs. a news reading condition).

Using a large personality survey and behavioral dataset on 52,004 Facebook users, we tested whether people with similar Big Five personality scores were more likely to be Facebook Friends, compared to randomly paired dyads. Controlling for the dyadic effects of age, sex, the number of Facebook Friends, and the main effects of personality variables, results indicate that people with similar levels of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism were more likely to be Facebook Friends. We also found that dyads with similar levels of agreeableness tend to share more mutual Facebook Friends, but such effect was nonsignificant for other personality factors. Because people are exposed to information and perspectives about the world from their Facebook contacts, we found that personality homophily might affect the size of their second-degree networks, as well as exposures to political ideology and emotions in shared status updates.",Online and Offline Communication Dynamics: What We Do and Why We Do It,Communication and Technology

However, studies of bystander effects in the online context has not been conclusive. This study conducted a 2 (anonymity) x 4 (bystander number) factorial experiment to examine bystanders’ intentions toward four different degrees of intervention behaviors. The findings indicate that anonymity and bystander numbers do not affect people’s intervention intentions in regard to passive or non-confrontational interventions. However, it does affect people’s intention to engage in direct interventions such as confronting the bullies. The relationship between bystander numbers and intervention intention was not a linear relationship. Instead, Initial intervention intentions increased with bystander numbers, but drops off after a critical point. By including several levels of bystanders and intervention behaviors, this study shows that bystander decisions are dependent on a combined consideration between anonymity, bystander numbers, and intervention behaviors.",Online and Offline Communication Dynamics: What We Do and Why We Do It,Communication and Technology

Yet, we know relatively little about how much people socialize across these modes of communication in the context of their day-to-day lives. Here we examined the daily socializing behaviors of three cohorts of young adults (total N = 941) using smartphone sensing methods to collect objective data about three modes of social behavior: in-person conversations, making and receiving phone calls, and sending and receiving text messages. We present findings establishing the base rates, variability, reliability, and validity of these behaviors. In doing so, we also provide the first psychometric assessment of smartphone-based social behavior measures using behavioral inferences obtained from 3 different smartphone sensing applications. Discussion focuses on how the observed patterns compares to previous research on socializing tendencies.",Online and Offline Communication Dynamics: What We Do and Why We Do It,Communication and Technology
2018-0854,2018,Paper Session,A Critique on the Use of Prospect Theory: Identifying Conceptual Mismatches between the Original Theory and Its Application in Health Communication Research,2,"Guided by prospect theory, a large body of research has investigated the relative effectiveness of gain- and loss-framed message appeals in various health communication contexts. Several meta-analytic reviews (e.g., O'Keefe & Jensen, 2007, 2009), however, suggest that the anticipated relative advantage of each type of frame under certain conditions (e.g., prevention versus detection behavior) was not found in the existing literature. In an effort to explore why such a robust theory in economics and behavioral psychology fails to receive consistent empirical support in health communication research, this theoretical article critically reviews how prospect theory has been applied in research on gain- and loss-framed message effects, with reference to the original prospect theory. Four mismatches were identified upon a closer examination: They differed in terms of conceptualization of riskiness, subjectivity of perceived risk, absence/ presence of required efforts in adopting a behavioral option, and argument framing. The identified four mismatches inspire the integration of prospect theory and major constructs in health behavior theories including response efficacy and perceived susceptibility, thereby offering more nuanced understanding of the use of prospect theory in communicating health.",Innovation and Integration in Health Communication Theory,Health Communication

Two theories, the diffusion of innovations (DOI) and the integrated model of behavior (IMB), were united to predict participants’ (N = 329) diffusion intentions. Positive attitudes about the innovation’s attributes positively predicted diffusion intentions: adopting it, maintaining it, and talking with others about it. As expected by the DOI and the IMB, the social pressure created by a descriptive norm positively predicted intentions to adopt and maintain the innovation. In line with sharing research (Berger, 2014; Cappella et al., 2015), the intention to talk about the innovation decreased as the descriptive norm increased. These results provide broad support for integrating the DOI and the IMB to predict diffusion and for efforts to draw on other research to understand motivations for social diffusion.",Innovation and Integration in Health Communication Theory,Health Communication

The results showed that among all TPB variables, attitude was the strongest predictor of the intention to seek counseling, whereas self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of the intention to engage in self-help methods. Contrary to the premise of RPA framework, the results revealed that only self-efficacy perception, but not risk perception, significantly affected the intentions of both mental health behaviors. However, the roles of TPB predictors changed for different RPA segments in terms of forming intention to get psychiatric help. In detail, compared with responsive group and proactive group, the indifference group was less subject to the influence of descriptive norms. In addition, compared with other three RPA segments, proactive was less likely influenced by self-efficacy.",Innovation and Integration in Health Communication Theory,Health Communication

We proposed and tested the hypothesis that collective norms would be associated with individual level attitudes and behaviors. This relationship was further hypothesized to vary by media use, such that the relationship between collective norms and individual attitudes and behaviors would be strong when media use was low, and vice versa. Data come from the 2016 Ethiopian and Tanzanian Demographic and Health Surveys (N = 6,907 and N = 4,083 in the two countries, respectively). Hypotheses, tested in the context of modern contraceptive use and tolerance for violence against women, were mostly supported, lending credence to the idea that mass media can serve as external agents of change to attenuate the impact of unhealthy collective norms on individual behaviors.

This study explores how news representations of neighborhoods and race affect audience news selection and their impressions of news coverage using an experiment with 900 randomly selected Chicago residents. We find that tailoring a headline to a specific neighborhood increases the likelihood that people from that neighborhood will read the story compared to a headline referencing an entire city. We find limited evidence of relationships between the race of the journalist and news selection or perceptions of representation. The suggestive evidence we do uncover illustrates that different racial and ethnic groups respond differently to hearing bylines from those sharing their race/ethnicity and from those of a different racial/ethnic background. We discuss the practical implications of our findings for newsroom diversity.",Media and Race,Mass Communication

This analysis retests that finding with a sample of 1,742 total videos from two online pornography sites. Findings suggest that black women still receive more physical aggression than white women. Other elements of objectification such as stripping and cumshots are not significantly different between white and black women. Looking at the racial makeup of depicted couples, black women actually are depicted as receiving most aggression from black men (54% of scenes); while white women are depicted as receiving the least amount of aggression from white men (35% of scenes). Black men in general are depicted as being aggressive and not intimate with their partners, kissing their partners less than white men. Overall this study suggests there are still persistent and harmful racist stereotypes of the aggressive black man and the “worse than an object” black woman in Mainstream pornography.",Media and Race,Mass Communication

To address this gap, we used SEM to test whether participants’ endorsement of gendered sexual scripts mediates connections between their consumption of four mainstream media (music videos, reality TV programming, movies, and women’s magazines) and three dimensions of their sexual agency (sexual assertiveness, sexual inhibition, and sexual deception). We surveyed 609 Black women who were undergraduate and graduate students at two universities. Results confirmed expectations, such that greater media consumption lead to greater support of gendered sexual scripts; in turn, endorsing these scripts predicted lower levels of sexual assertiveness, greater sexual inhibition, and stronger sexual deception reflecting a relational imperative. We discuss implications of these findings both for the field and for Black women’s lives.",Media and Race,Mass Communication

However, how audiences perceive such targeting is unclear. To investigate this, Black and White adolescents (n=1,990) identified the perceived target audiences of 15 movies (12 Black-oriented). Results from Item Response Theory and multiple regression suggest that Black adolescents, especially those with strong ethnic identity, differentiate Black-oriented from mainstream movies. Black adolescents report higher exposure to Black-oriented films, particularly if they perceive such films as targeted to Black audiences. White adolescents find it more difficult to identify Black-oriented films.

However, much meaningful and inspiring content nowadays is uploaded on social media in so called memes. Three exploratory studies therefore investigated the occurrence, content and effects of inspiring and meaningful memes in social media: The hashtags of eudaimonic memes were analyzed for semantic networks (study 1), a content analysis was conducted to typologize eudaimonic themes addressed in memes (study 2), and an online survey investigated the effects of eudaimonic memes on users (study 3). The results suggest that previously defined topics of inspiration and meaningfulness are also common among hashtags and memes and lead to the same beneficial effects for their consumers.

The present research extends this line of inquiry to examine how affordances in emerging technologies contribute to these outcomes. This study examined the association of sharing inspiring user-generated content (photographs) with affective elevation and connectedness. Results show that self-reported elevation and connectedness were highest among participants who opted to share their inspiring photographs.

The analysis reveals that brand-centric memes are generally classified as orphan memes, or memes that do not belong to an established or emerging meme family. The study also introduces fictive meme families into the conversation, which are amalgamations of established meme families and orphan memes, conjoined as a new family by brand-centric communication.

The range of content that is posted, shared, liked, and commented upon on Facebook is vast: from selfies to memes, top news to vacation pictures, and everything in between. Obviously, some posts are more likely to elicit positive emotional responses than others. As one prominent example, scholars have recently identified and begun exploring the effects of self-transcendent media content, which prompts audience members to recognize in themselves elements of shared humanity and their own potential for moral beauty, hope, and courage. In this study, we systematically analyzed such content on Facebook. Results show a high frequency of direct elicitors associated with appreciation of beauty and excellence and hope. Additionally, analyses show that elicitors associated with appreciation of beauty and excellence and gratitude can be used to predict the virality of posts.",Sharing and Finding Meanings on Digital Media,Mass Communication

We investigate how newspapers in developed countries (Australia, Germany, USA) and emerging economies (Brazil, India) covered this debate during the UN climate summits in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Newspapers in both types of countries attributed more responsibility to developed than to developing countries. In line with social identity theory, however, media in developed countries attributed less causal responsibility (blames) to developed countries than media in emerging economies, whose media, in turn, attributed less responsibility to developing countries than media in developed countries. This points towards an in-group bias that serves to protect countries’ interests in controversial international negotiations.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication
2018-0868,2018,Paper Session,Climate Change as a Polarizing Cue: Framing Effects on Public Support for Low-Carbon Energy Policies,2,"This study uses a survey question wording experiment with a nationally representative U.S. sample to test how public support for four specific low-carbon energy policies (renewable energy investment, revenue-neutral carbon tax, fuel efficiency regulations, expansion of nuclear power) varies when those policies are framed as a way to reduce either climate change, air pollution, or energy dependence. We find framing effects only among Republicans, whose policy support was lower in response to the climate change frame versus the air pollution and energy security frames for all policies except nuclear power. This suggests that framing effects are conditional on political partisanship and policy content. When testing the processing mechanism behind these effects, we find no evidence that the climate change frame functions as a simple heuristic; rather, the findings are consistent with motivated reasoning, whereby the framing effects on policy support are mediated by the policy’s perceived relative benefits and costs.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication

A Longitudinal Analysis of Fragmentation and Polarisation in the Networked Public Sphere on Climate Change in the UK,1,"Research into polarisation in hyperlink networks has for the most part neglected the longitudinal nature of the process. To overcome this deficit, this study uses temporal exponential random graph models (TERGMs) to investigate the degree of polarisation present in a hyperlink network on climate change that originates in the UK. Adopting an inferential perspective has the advantage of overcoming some of the methodological difficulties that beset current research. The approach presented distinguishes between a general, an intermediate, and a local level of the network structure and models the expected degree of polarisation on all three levels. The results show that contrary to some of the assumptions, the degree of fragmentation on the general level is lower than expected, while polarisation is present in how the relationships between the single network communities develop over time and in the like-minded link formation patterns of climate advocates and sceptics in these communities.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication

In these settings, we identify coalitions and counter-coalitions on the Web, compare their strength and determine the sources of their online strength. To do so, we combine link tracing and quantitative con-tent analysis in the field of climate change in Germany and the United Kingdom. Our results show that online contestation is indeed structured by competing coalitions of climate advo-cates and skeptics. Thereby, the counter-coalitions of climate skeptics turn out to be the true winners of online communication: they have not only incorporated conservative media as their allies but have also managed to become more visible than climate advocates. This visibility stems from their own link setting activity which makes climate advocates’ passive online strategy of just ignoring the other camp turn ineffective.",Climate Change Communication,Political Communication
2018-0871,2018,Paper Session,A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Cross-cutting Exposure on Political Participation,5,"Scholars have advanced many theoretical explanations for expecting a relationship between individuals’ cross-cutting exposure—either through interpersonal or mediated forms of communication—and their political participation. However, whether cross-cutting exposure is a positive, negative, or insignificant predictor of participation is still an unsettled question. To help fill this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 48 empirical studies comprising more than 70,000 participants examining the association between cross-cutting exposure and political participation. The meta-analysis produced two main findings. First, it shows that, overall, there is no significant relationship, r = .002, Zr =.002 (95% CI = -.04 to .05). Second, the null relationship cannot be explained by variations in the characteristics of cross-cutting environments (e.g., topic, place, or source of exposure), participation outcomes (e.g., online vs. offline activities), or methods employed (e.g., experiment vs. survey). Taken together, these results should alleviate concerns about negative effects of cross-cutting exposure on political engagement.",Studying Cross-Cutting Exposure,Political Communication

Based on in-depth interviews with 38 youths, this study examines the communicative strategies civic youth employ to talk politics across lines of difference. The study also explores considerations and motivations that inform youth’s strategic decisions to enter or pull back from cross-cutting interactions online. Findings suggest that civic youth are well-versed in elements of rational deliberative discourse (Habermas, 1991). However, youth appear to struggle when it comes to relational discourse that emphasizes reciprocity and ethical listening (Bakhtin, 1981).

Yet, few studies have examined how experiences with online persuasion might influence broader deliberative orientations. We propose the “Persuasion-Openness” model, in which both attempting and being the target of online political persuasion encourage individuals to engage in online cross-cutting discussion with those who hold differing political views. These more deliberative exchanges are in turn associated with increased “dialogic openness” - a broader orientation toward political dialog. We perform a test of this model using original panel survey data collected during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Findings show that both types of experiences of persuasion can indirectly lead to dialogic openness, by stimulating online cross-cutting discussion. However, we find that the mediated pathway for those targeted for online persuasion is only viable in online environments with low levels of opinion-challenging information.

With unprecedented choices online, do these choices lead to cross-cutting exposure or inevitably lead to increasing polarization? Instead of assessing political homogeneity online solely based on written messages, we focus on individuals’ underlying motives and mechanisms that drive one’s message “reception” decisions, and how such dynamics would manifest through patterns of individuals’ message selection behaviors. Using unobtrusively logged behavioral data matched with network panel survey responses, a TERGM analysis of online message selection behaviors during 2012 South Korean Presidential election indicates that the impact of overt partisan preference was rather limited. Rather, results indicate that various endogenous structural factors are pronounced, coupled with a non-trivial degree of message selection based on similarity of one’s candidate evaluative criteria, suggesting that social and utility consideration indeed strongly override overt partisan considerations.",Studying Cross-Cutting Exposure,Political Communication

Based on 68 interviews over two years with senior editors and managers, this study constitutes the largest comparative analysis of newsroom change among PSM organizations conducted to date. Our empirical analysis shows that full newsroom integration, in which editorial production is no longer primarily organized by media platform, remains the exception in this sector. Our findings suggest that centralizing online news under a single operational roof — only recently undertaken and still incomplete at several PSM — is a necessary first step to more thorough editorial reorganization across platforms.

2018-0878,2018,Paper Session,Breaking Through the Ambivalence: Behind Journalistic Motivations and Barriers to Adopt Digital Security Technologies,1,"Over the last several years, numerous journalists and news organizations have reported incidents in which their communications have been hacked, intercepted, or retrieved. In 2014, Google security experts found that 21 of the world’s 25 most popular media outlets were targets of state-sponsored hacking attempts, and many journalists have watched helplessly as hackers took control of their social media accounts while targeting confidential information in their internal servers. When journalists’ digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance, news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk and journalists’ ability to carry out their newsmaking function is reduced. Yet, many journalists do not believe that hacking and surveillance are significant threats and are not adopting information security measures to protect their data, themselves, or their sources. This research study considers their reluctance to adopt such measures. Drawing from 18 interviews with journalists, editors, digital security trainers, and newsroom web developers to shed light on journalists’ perceptions of digital security technologies, including motivations to adopt and barriers to adoption, the findings show that motivations to adopt digital security technologies hinge on the idea of protection: protection of the self, the story, and the journalist’s role. Less central to their motivations is the protection of the source, a finding that is contrary to contemporary discourse about why journalists need to adopt digital security technologies and journalists’ claims about their public service role.",Digital Technologies in the Newsroom: Opportunities and Challenges,Journalism Studies

On this day, a rightwing terrorist placed a bomb in front of the Norwegian government building, where the prime minister had his office at the time. Later, the same perpetrator dressed up as a policeman and tricked his way into a political youth camp, where sixty-nine mostly young people were killed. The present case study involves the leading national online news provider, VG, whose website, VG Nett, was Norway’s most-read online news site at the time of the 22 July attack, and addresses the research gap of how news workers and managers take advantage of the potential of the affordances of digital media. Tis study asks how such a potential is handled during crises events..Furthermore the study looks at how two different discourses of professionalism, the occupational and the organizational, informed journalists’ use of technological affordances, and particularly affordances which come with social media, during this terror event, and at how online journalists and management reflect upon and continue to refine these approaches five years later. Time and again, studies have found that news workers have a deterministic view of technological affordances in general, and this study stresses the importance of a clear understanding of the decision-making processes that actually guide the handling of those affordances during a crisis event. Ultimately, this study questions not the perceived tension between the two discourses of professionalism but their relative impact upon domestic crisis journalism in the technological realm.",Digital Technologies in the Newsroom: Opportunities and Challenges,Journalism Studies

In-depth interviews revealed that reporters and editors believed external (political and economic) pressure has increased in the province, resulting in a greater financial dependency on the regional government. The inability to survive without state subsidies has further affected professional (internal) norms, leading to the return of a model of journalism that is reminiscent of the Soviet era.

The main question is to what extent state financial support systems contribute to the diversity of topics in online news. Hereunder we investigate the impact of direct press support (production support) on the diversity of online news in Norway. Results show a relatively proportionate degree of variety, balance and disparity between topics found in the Norwegian national news landscape. While press supported newspapers give relative higher attention to local politics and rural industries, particularly in the minority written language nynorsk, overall, direct production support does not impact on the ability of newspapers in Norway to contribute to the diversity of news in the overall online news landscape.","Trust, Diversity, and Transition in the News Industry",Media Industry Studies

This study compared and evaluated three nonlinear models of the effect of message discrepancy on belief change: a model of message discrepancy with the probability of message acceptance (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975); a model of belief change by message discrepancy, source credibility, and noninvolvement (Laroche, 1977); and a psychological discrepancy discounting model (Fink, Kaplowitz, & Bauer, 1983). These three models suggest a nonlinear effect of message discrepancy on belief change but are not mathematically derived from the model’s assumptions. This paper proposes a modified psychological discounting model, based on Fink et al.’s and Fishbein and Ajzen’s models, by solving a differential equation about the rate of change of the probability of message acceptance with respect to psychological discrepancy. The new model predicts a monotonically decelerating positive function of message discrepancy on belief change.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Information Systems: Models and Theories,Information Systems
2018-0885,2018,Paper Session,Social Kinematics: An Application of Classical Mechanics to Perception of Social Meaning,3,"Animals evolved discriminative predictive cueing to discern opportunities and rewards (i.e., an approach system) and threats (i.e., an avoid system) (Tooby & Cosmides, 1990; Schneirla, 1959). Dogs gauge the movement and direction of other dogs’ tails to discern threat or reward (Siniscalchi et al., 2015). Surprisingly however, how humans use combinations of physical cues in making approach and avoidance-based social judgments is unknown. Here, in an investigation of human movement in terms of classical mechanics, we show that combinations of four systematically manipulated kinematic cues – speed (slow or fast; a mechanical cue), distance (towards or away, a mechanical), direction (near or far, a mechanical and social cue), and gesture (open or closed, a predominately social cue) impact social judgments. While our results confirm prior connections of directional movement on approach-avoidance motivations, what is novel and unexpected is that open and closed gestures overwhelmingly outweigh the effects of directional movement in approach-avoidance motivation. These findings suggest that long before formal language, humans may have evolved a “technology” for discerning friend or foe and other more sophisticated shades of social situational meaning – even at a distance.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Information Systems: Models and Theories,Information Systems

Gibson, 1979) to the context of immersive virtual reality (VR). As a first step, this study investigates users’ orienting and exploratory behaviors while they navigate a virtual house indexed by their gaze on virtual objects, viewing time, and time spent in different rooms in the environment. A content analysis of participants’ (N = 22) video recordings of VR exploration was conducted based on second-by-second time frame. Results indicate that participants tend to orient to the virtual objects when they display novel or unusual information. Also, users’ exploratory behaviors were focused on the virtual objects that are related to available actions of the given virtual environment.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Information Systems: Models and Theories,Information Systems

At the same time, research at the macro-level focuses on cross-cultural information system differences, and investigates how culture and infrastructure influence the development and use of information technologies, suggesting some degree of homogeneity and homogenization. Our research comments on this divergence by examining individual-level phone activity at the micro-level moment-by-moment level, using a giant corpus of screenshots passively captured every five seconds for weeks from participants in China, Myanmar, and the United States. We use ethnographic methods to compare and contrast information between countries, documenting cross-context behavioral similarities in how participants interaction with information and differences in how they accomplish these behaviors based on constraints in their environments.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Information Systems: Models and Theories,Information Systems

However, the CLPM has been criticized in the past (Hamaker, Kuiper, & Grasman, 2015; Keijsers, 2015; Selig & Little, 2012). This criticism is mainly related to the fact that the CLPM does not allow examining inter-individual change but only examines between-person differences. To address this problem, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel (RI-CLPM) was recently introduced (Hamaker et al., 2015). In the present presentation we would like to introduce this model and show its applicability to media effects research.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Information Systems: Models and Theories,Information Systems

A hundred and eight young healthy adults completed a forced-choice, speeded decision-making latency task before and after viewing a set of advertisements. Results suggested that participants were more appetitively motivated by more energy dense foods using direct food cues, but after exposure to advertisements, this predisposition was less pronounced. Advertisement food cues were also important in decision-making, especially in coalition with the cues used in the decision-making task stimuli. This study supports an optimal foraging perspective being expanded to human behavioral contexts in a modern landscape. Food advertising and packaging cues interact with energy density level of food to provide information relevant to biological imperatives, which significantly alters motivated decision-making.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Information Systems: Models and Theories,Information Systems

What has been overlooked is how certain tags are “intuitively” selected, as well as the influences these words exert on the taggers’ performances. Using data from a major crowdsourcing design community over a seven-year period of time, the study showcases that sensing the “right” tags is a critical skill for a designer to succeed. By performing k-core algorithm on a bipartite network consisting of over 11,000 nodes, a multi-layered core-periphery structure was identified, showing that some tags gradually occupied more advantageous network positions in the process of preferential attachment. Furthermore, the core tags were found to, at different levels, contribute to product sales significantly more than the peripheral tags.

However, there has been no systematic effort to synthesizing the unintended effects of public relations practices. This paper represents the first attempt to fill the gap in the literature. It begins with an overview on the types of unintended effects of public relations in the literature. The unintended adverse effects include confusion, dissonance, negative emotional responses, endangering media independence, reactance, boomerang and the impact of microaggressions. Next, I explicate several theoretical frameworks readily applied to examine the subject, such as the Psychological Reactance Theory, Cognitive Dissonance Theory, and Complexity Theory. To provide empirical evidence, I then reported a brief case on reactance induced by crisis communication based on an experiment. Finally, three key questions of unintended effects—on what, caused by what, and so what—are discussed. It is hoped that the conceptual dimensions and types presented in this paper will serve as an evolving framework for endeavors to enhancing the theory and practice of public relations.",Crisis Communication Theory: Further Explication,Public Relations

This study synthesizes three research streams through the extended impression management theory, which incorporates cognitive load, social risk, and brand engagement perspectives. An online survey was administered to 430 young adults across three universities. The findings revealed that self-esteem directly influenced Facebook advertising commenting behavior and indirectly influenced liking, sharing, and commenting behaviors through the serial mediation of brand engagement and actual self-brand connection. The results contribute to our understanding of Facebook advertising engagement by demonstrating that liking, sharing, and commenting on Facebook advertisements are not only done to build and maintain self-image. Young consumers also consider the levels of cognitive load and social risk and the degree to which the brands reflect the actual self to decide whether and how they will engage with Facebook advertising.","Selling, Sharing, and Personalizing: The Role of the User in Online Ads",Communication and Technology

The study investigated the moderating role of recipient’s narcissism and the suppressive mediating role of perceived ad creepiness and ad intrusiveness. Results showed that the individual-level personalization attracted a greater attention than the group-level personalization and the non-personalization. Regarding attitudinal responses, the individual-level personalization was more effective than group-level personalization, but it was not significantly different from non-personalization. The suppressing mediating roles of ad creepiness and ad intrusiveness were also confirmed. Lastly, consumers with a high level of narcissism tended to have more favorable attitude toward the individual-level personalized ad, while consumers with a low level of narcissism tended to have a more favorable attitude toward the group-level personalized ad.","Selling, Sharing, and Personalizing: The Role of the User in Online Ads",Communication and Technology

UGC can be separated into two categories: creating new content from scratch or customizing existing content according to one’s preferences. Although each category requires similar user-technology interaction and goals, it is possible that the preexisting content available to customizers shapes their attitudes toward content and the source in ways different from those creating material from scratch. Users created a new advertisement, customized or read an existing advertisement, and rated their perceptions on interactivity, autonomy, competence, attachment, reactance, source credibility, and product liking. Results indicate that customizers had higher reactance and lower product liking compared to those in the creation group, suggesting that preexisting material can significantly change attitudes despite similar tasks.
Advertisers should consider the benefits of campaigns that call for creation versus customization and strongly consider impressions from preexisting content on interactive customizable interfaces.","Selling, Sharing, and Personalizing: The Role of the User in Online Ads",Communication and Technology

One significant challenge refugees face when settling into the U.S. is the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV). Many outreach organizations have been established to help refugees cope with their violent experiences. Human service workers, who work at these organizations engage in a unique type of work as they communicate through emotions with clients. This qualitative study was designed to explore the cycle of emotions workers experience as they communicate with refugee women who experience IPV. In particular, 12 human service workers were interviewed. The results discuss how workers utilize their communication touchstones to navigate through challenges, emotional impulses, emotional labor, and emotional residue.

We argue that localized climate action consists of action nets-- the constellation of communicative actions performed by both humans (e.g., residents, agency representatives) and nonhumans (e.g., fire, policy). Action nets are performative relationships that make distinctive sets of organizational practices, stakeholder values, ecosystem processes, and physical landscapes ""matter"" to a community. We examine how residents of a wildland urban interface (WUI) town organize to debate whether to implement or oppose a US Forest Service fuel treatment plan, Fuels II, intended to protect the town from climate-driven wildfires.

It does so by exploring how the “alternative” is constituted through the ongoing practices, interactions and discourses of Upop, an alternative university based in Montreal. Drawing on Derrida’s notion of différance, the paper offers an analytical framework to study the constitution of the alternative that puts forth two processes of differentiation, which oscillate between being different/similar and polemic/consensual. Applying this framework to the case study reveals that these processes of differentiation are key to positioning Upop as an alternative to normative and dominant paradigms (e.g. capitalism, corporatization of the university, media corruption).",Emotions and Resilience in Organizing,Organizational Communication

One way that adoptive mothers likely do so is through rituals, or the meaningful, habitualized routines, events, and actions that create meaning and identity within families. Researchers have long noted that mothers tend to initiate, organize, and sustain family rituals. This invisible kinkeeping labor is time- and emotionally-intensive. The proposed chapter examines the rituals mothers enact in open adoption relationships. Data from 129 adoptive mothers reveal the type and frequency of rituals involving birth parents in the open adoption relationships as well as the effect of ritual use on adoptive-birth family relational closeness.

Contrapuntal analysis of 32 narrative interviews revealed two discourses as competing to construct meaning of the system: the Discourse of System as Helpful (DSH) and the Discourse of System as Broken (DSB). Participants’ talk recognized the necessity of the system, but themes of providing protection and safety, creating stability, and being comprised by “good” individuals constructed the DSH as a necessary good. Conversely, themes of harming individuals and families, inconsistency and imperfection, and under-supported/unsupportive collective constructed the DSB as a necessary evil.

Cultivating citizen scientists’ voices in research hinges upon their engagement with scientists who use a highly nuanced language of science, or jargon. However, it remains unknown whether scientists are accommodating to citizen scientists’ needs. Thus, the purpose of this case study was to uncover how citizen scientists and scientists navigate the language of science. We conducted in depth interviews (N = 24) and participant observations hours (N = 30) with citizen scientists and scientists. Our results revealed that scientists accommodated to citizen scientists when their perceptions of citizen scientists’ jargon preferences aligned with citizen scientists’ actual preferences.

A three-group pretest-posttest longitudinal experimental design was employed. Participants (N = 90) watched ‘Queer As Folk’ for a 10-week period either unedited or edited to remove sexual explicit content, or were in a control. Results suggest heterosexual audiences develop PSRs with gay characters, sexual explicitness did not influence PSRs development, and PSRs were related to decreased homophobia and increased endorsement of gay equality over time.

On the one hand, this is compatible with past research, which has found that group labels can prime negative stereotypes. However, past research has also found that fundraising messages that use normalizing language can be less persuasive. In this experiment, we test the extent to which stereotyped language (both positive and negative) and normalizing language about people with disabilities is persuasive, as well as how these different primes might interact with perceptions of issue importance and message offensiveness.

While group members with diverse backgrounds are more likely to generate creative solutions, high diversity is more likely to elicit “more conflict in the communication and discussion processes” (Chen, 2006, p. 106). In this study, we explored how transactive memory systems (TMS) may influence the relationship between conflict and creativity. Using data collected from 64 MBA student project groups, our study shows that task conflict could positively influence group creativity and relationship conflict can negatively impact creativity. Meanwhile, knowing each other’s expertise (TMS) in a group can not only significantly increase group creativity, but also mitigate the negative impact of relationship conflict on group creativity. These findings suggest that TMS can be used as a powerful mechanism that helps a team rise above relationship conflict and actualize the benefit of having a team with diverse expertise.",HIGH-DENSITY: Discussing Intergroup Issues in Diverse Contexts,Intergroup Communication

We conducted a 2 (similar vs. dissimilar) by 3 (factual vs. cognitive vs. emotional self-disclosure) between-subject online experiment involving 280 adult overweight participants who used weight-control related online support groups in the past month. Findings show similarity of health status led to increased level of perceived similarity and moderated the effects of self-disclosure. When viewers shared similar health status with the poster, both cognitive and emotional self-disclosure increased perceived similarity in comparison to factual disclosure. Path analyses show perceived similarity increased diet intention directly, and through increasing identification and perceived support availability as well. Contributions to theories on online supportive communication and implications to design effective online support groups are discussed.",Content and Effects of Online Social Support Communities,Health Communication
2018-0921,2018,Paper Session,Social Support Reception & Provision in Digital Substance Use Disorder Support Groups: How Self-Efficacy Moderates Effects on Substance Use,2,"Background: It is crucial to understand how giving and receiving different types of social support online can affect recovery outcomes, and how these effects may be moderated by individual characteristics like self-efficacy.
Methods: This study applied quantitative content analysis, survey data, and system use log data, to examine the benefits accrued from receiving and providing informational and emotional support in an online forum for substance use disorders (SUDs), and the interaction between self-efficacy and social support exchange in influencing substance use outcomes.
Results: Receiving more emotional support was associated with reduced illicit drug use. For patients with low self-efficacy, giving emotional support had enhanced benefits in reducing risky drinking at month 12. In contrast, those with low self-efficacy who gave more informational support had increased risky drinking.
Conclusions: Receiving emotional support predicted substance use outcomes. The effects of giving social support were conditional, depending upon the support provider’s self-efficacy.",Content and Effects of Online Social Support Communities,Health Communication

2018-0923,2018,Paper Session,Emotional Expression in Online Depression Support Communities: The Role of Anonymity and Interaction,1,"This paper sought to examine how online identity and interactions influence emotional expression in depression support communities using the social network site Facebook compared with Reddit, which require individuals to register as identifiable versus pseudonymous users, respectively. By comparing text, sentiment, and social network analyses, this study arrived at 3 major findings. First, Facebook community members demonstrated stronger awareness and attention on their imagined audience while also expressing more positive emotions in content. In contrast, the anonymity of Reddit communities shifted user attention from audience and self-presentation toward emotional needs, which enabled members to feel less inhibited to discuss feelings. Second, larger communities on Facebook were observed to be associated with more positive emotional expression, whereas larger communities on Reddit encouraged more negative emotional expression. Finally, users who are in more central positions in interaction networks are more likely to express emotions. However, this effect was not observed using the same analyses of Reddit communities. These observations provide practical recommendations for the design and management of online mental health communities and contributed to an improved understanding of how online identity and interactions influence imagined audiences, self-presentation, and perceived social capital in online communities, which cumulatively affect user online behaviour.",Content and Effects of Online Social Support Communities,Health Communication
2018-0924,2018,Paper Session,Clicking Health Risk Messages on Social Media: A Moderated Mediation Path through Perceived Message Features and Fear Arousal,2,"This study examined how fear appeal messages and individual coping styles combined to driving users’ intention to click health risk messages on social media. Two online experiments were conducted. Participants were recruited from Mturk and were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (2 (high vs. low threat) X 2 (high vs. low efficacy message), while their risk perceptions, fear arousal, and coping styles were measured with a questionnaire. The results suggested that: (1) threat and efficacy message influenced intention to click via the mediating effect of perceived threat, perceived efficacy, and fear arousal; (2) blunting style used by the participant suppressed fear arousal’s ability in mobilizing intention-to-click; (3) monitoring style has a positive main effect on intention-to-click. The theoretical and practical implications for health risk message design were then discussed.",Effects of Social Media on Health Risk Perceptions and Healthy Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0925,2018,Paper Session,Differential Effects of Content-Oriented Versus User-Oriented Social Media on Risk Perceptions and Behavioral Intentions,3,"Despite the increasing importance of social media in risk and crisis situations, little is known about which types of social media are more influential in predicting risk perceptions and behaviors. This study examines the distinct roles of different social media platforms in predicting risk perception, as well as the underlying mechanism by which social media exposure leads to greater levels of risk-preventive behavioral intentions. Analyzing survey data from 688 adults from the general population of South Korea in the context of carcinogenic hazards, we found that content-oriented social media exposure influenced both personal-level and societal-level risk perceptions. In addition, content-oriented social media exposure influenced behavioral intentions indirectly through risk perceptions. However, user-oriented social media exposure had no impact on risk perceptions nor on behavioral intentions, either directly or indirectly through risk perceptions.",Effects of Social Media on Health Risk Perceptions and Healthy Behavior,Health Communication
2018-0926,2018,Paper Session,Understanding and Diagnosing Antimicrobial Resistance on Social Media: A Yearlong Overview of Data and Analytics,5,"To better understand user conversations revolving around antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) on Twitter, we used an online data collection and analysis toolkit with full firehose access to collect corpuses of tweets with “antibiotic” and “antimicrobial resistance” keyword tracks. The date range included tweets from November 28th, 2015 to November 25th, 2016 for both datasets. This year-long date range provides insight into how users have discussed antibiotics and AMR and identifies any spikes in activity during a particular time frame. Overall, we found that discussions about antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance predominantly occur in the United States and United Kingdom, with roughly equal gender participation. These conversations are influenced by news sources, health professionals, and governmental health organizations. Users will often defer to retweet and recirculate content posted from these official sources and link to external articles instead of posting their own musings on the subjects. Our findings are important benchmarks in understanding the prevalence and reach of potential misinformation about antibiotics and AMR on Twitter.",Effects of Social Media on Health Risk Perceptions and Healthy Behavior,Health Communication

A randomized between-subjects experiment (N = 303) examined the effects of consumers’ own eating habits (meat eater versus non-meat eater) and vegan celebrities’ different motivations for becoming a vegan (altruistic motivation versus egoistic motivation) on various outcomes of health communication about veganism. The results show interaction effects between vegan celebrity endorsers’ motivation and participants’ eating habits on health consciousness, intention to spread electronic word-of-mouth (eWoM) about veganism, and behavioral intention to become vegan. Furthermore, moderating effects of source credibility, subjective norms, and identification with the vegan celebrity endorser were found.

Affect is a driver of risk perception, but is relatively neglected in the arena of tobacco product risk perception. This study examines how different advertising tactics produce emotional responses and inform risk perceptions. We conducted a 2x5 randomized experiment with 3,162 U.S. 18-24 year olds. Participants were shown an ad for one of two brands with one of five advertising tactics. Risk perception varied significantly by brand and tactic. Emotional response to the ad varied by brand, but not tactic. Ad brand had an indirect effect on perceived risk via emotion. These findings indicate that unique advertising tactics can affect citizens’ tobacco risk perceptions. These findings also demonstrate the powerful effect of brand on risk perception. Evidence-based tobacco marketing policy should take a holistic approach and account for cognitive and affective response.",HIGH-DENSITY: Research on Communication and Marketing Effects to Inform Tobacco Regulation,Health Communication

Individual outcome expectations have been linked to e-cigarette usage and are an important metric in guiding health messaging efforts. This study employed a national survey of adolescents (n = 1,298) and young adults (n = 2,219) to assess outcome expectancies related to e-cigarettes for both groups. Outcome expectancies were assessed with 21 items across 5 reliable expectation subscales (enjoyment, social aspects, better than cigarettes, health concerns, and smoker association). In multiple logistic regression models predicting adolescent use, higher expected enjoyment predicted higher likelihood of e-cigarette usage while greater health concerns predicted lower likelihood of usage. Higher expected enjoyment predicted usage in young adult models while greater health concerns and greater smoker association predicted lower likelihood of usage. Implications based on this data for future health messaging targeting to adolescent and young adult populations are discussed.",HIGH-DENSITY: Research on Communication and Marketing Effects to Inform Tobacco Regulation,Health Communication
2018-0933,2018,Paper Session,"Comparing the Effects of Organic, Natural, and No Additives Labels on Tobacco Packaging Between Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual (LGB) and Heterosexual Smokers",4,"Previous research has found that health-oriented labels including ‘organic’, ‘natural’, and ‘no additives’ on tobacco product packaging may lead to reduced harm perceptions and increased intentions to purchase tobacco products among smokers. However, how LGB populations–who have a higher prevalence of smoking and vaping–respond to health-oriented labels has not been examined. In this experimental study, we found that LGB smokers reported lower intentions to purchase and vape e-cigarettes, and lower attitudes and perceptions of package information than heterosexual smokers after viewing health-oriented labels on an e-cigarette pack. However, this effect was not found for those who viewed health-oriented labels on a traditional cigarette pack. Further research is needed to explore mechanisms for differential effects of health-oriented labels between LGB and heterosexual smokers.",HIGH-DENSITY: Research on Communication and Marketing Effects to Inform Tobacco Regulation,Health Communication

We assessed the impact of the FDA’s six newly-mandated cigar warning statements on young adults’ cognitive elaboration about (thinking about the harms of LCC use) and discouragement from using LCCs.
We conducted a between-subjects experiment in a national telephone survey of 791 young adults ages 18-25. Participants were randomly assigned to hear one of the six FDA-mandated cigar warnings, then were asked how much the warning made them think about the harmful effects of smoking LCCs and how much it discouraged them from using LCCs.
We found that two of the mandated cigar warnings were statistically significantly less discouraging and less likely to make people think about the harmful effectscompared to the other warnings. The four warnings that were more effective stated a specific health effect, such as heart disease.",HIGH-DENSITY: Research on Communication and Marketing Effects to Inform Tobacco Regulation,Health Communication

In an online study, 2,700 US adult smokers, non-smokers, and transitioning smokers (n=900 each) saw either high-emotion warnings, low-emotion warnings, or current US cigarette warnings (control). Controlling for demographics, pre-exposure quit intentions and experimental condition, anger and confusion were negatively associated with perceived effectiveness, while guilt, worry, and hope were positively associated. Perceived harm of smoking was negatively related to feeling angry, confused, or amused and positively with feeling sad, guilty, disgusted, or hopeful. Current smokers who felt angry or confused had less intentions to quit smoking, but hope and shame were positive predictors of intentions to quit. Warning labels and other anti-tobacco messages should evoke hope and try to reduce anger and confusion to motivate smokers to quit.",HIGH-DENSITY: Research on Communication and Marketing Effects to Inform Tobacco Regulation,Health Communication

So far, little is known about whether common misconceptions of suicide are related to individual tabloid newspaper use. In this cross-sectional online survey, we assessed suicide-related knowledge and stigmatizing attitudes towards suicidal individuals among 456 study participants in Austria together with their endorsement of five common suicide myths (e.g., “suicidal individuals do not communicate their intent”). Furthermore, we assessed participants’ time spent reading tabloids. Multivariate analyses controlling for gender, age, education, and the time spent reading broadsheet newspapers and watching television indicated that participants’ time spent reading tabloids was associated with the endorsement of suicide myths as well as with a lower level of suicide-related knowledge and a higher level of stigmatizing attitudes towards suicidal individuals. The present findings confirm that readers of tabloids are an important target group for suicide education efforts.",Media and Health Issues,Mass Communication
2018-0937,2018,Paper Session,Just One More Episode: Predictors of Procrastination With Television and Implications for Sleep Quality,4,"The effects of media use on sleep have received increasing scholarly attention. However, few studies have looked beyond the effects of duration and frequency of media exposure, or examined the mechanisms underlying this association. As recent research has related procrastinatory media use to lower well-being, we conducted two studies (N1= 821, N2 = 584) to investigate predictors of procrastinatory TV viewing, and the link between procrastinatory TV viewing and sleep quality. Results indicate that those with a stronger viewing habit, higher narrative engagement and an eveningness preference reported more procrastinatory TV viewing. Procrastinatory TV viewing was significantly related to subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction. This association was fully mediated by perceived stress. As sleep is key for the restoration of self-control, procrastinators may be setting themselves up to fail at self-regulating, a situation exacerbated by the omnipresence of media in today’s society.",Media and Health Issues,Mass Communication
2018-0938,2018,Paper Session,The Role of Language in Suicide Reporting: Investigating the Influence of Problematic Suicide Referents,4,"Experts recommend using neutral suicide referents in news reporting. This recommendation is based on the empirically yet untested assumption that problematic suicide referents carry meaning that is inappropriate from a prevention perspective. For example, in German-speaking countries, the neutral term Suizid (suicide) is recommended. Conversely, Freitod (“free death”) and Selbstmord (“self murder”) convey associative meanings related to problematic concepts such as free will (Freitod) and crime/murder (Selbstmord), and are therefore not recommended. Using an experiment (N = 451), we tested whether the news media’s use of Suizid, Selbstmord, and Freitod elicits framing effects. Participants read identical articles about suicide. Only the specific suicide referents varied depending on the experimental condition. We found that the news frame primed frame-related concepts in the memory and increased frame-related word choice. Importantly, we found that participants reading the free will-related Freitod frame showed greater attitudinal support for suicide among individuals suffering from incurable diseases.",Media and Health Issues,Mass Communication

The prevalence of video-on-demand platforms has afforded a style of television viewing known as binge-watching, which we define as the act of watching three or more episodes in a single viewing session. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between binge-watching, other types of media use, and health behaviors. Our results suggest that the more time viewers spent binge-watching, the more time they reported watching television and movies in general, listening to music, and using internet and phone applications – indication that media use in general increases to accommodate binge-watching. We also found that the time consumers spent binge-watching was associated with poorer sleep quality, higher scores for emotional and uncontrolled eating, and more hours spent sitting.

However, studies of how a party can use its communication to undermine its rival party’s issue ownership are very rare. Drawing on research on negative campaigning, this paper takes a first step to fill this gap. In a Danish survey of a nationally representative sample, the study tests four hypotheses on the influence of a party’s issue-based negative campaigning on the rival party’s issue ownership rating. The study tests not only if negative campaigning undermines the target party’s issue ownership, but also if negative campaigning is different from positive campaigning, if information about real-world problems condition the influence of negative campaigning, and if negative campaigning backfires or actually benefits the sponsor party’s issue ownership rating. The implications for the mass-elite linkage are important.",Party Communication Strategies,Political Communication
2018-0941,2018,Paper Session,“Flirting” for Coalition Participation? Exploring Parties’ Communication Strategies in Parliamentary Debates,1,"Parties in most multi-party systems deal with a ‘coalition dilemma’: they have to trade-off office-seeking and policy-seeking strategies. Selecting a (future) coalition partner is key factor in this decision. The coalition formation literature has theorized different models in which parties weigh a variety of costs when selecting their partners. I build upon these models to develop a theory of coalition appeals, explaining parties’ strategies for exploring potential coalition partners during the electoral cycle. I hypothesize that parties cater their strategies towards a certain preferred election outcome with low bargain costs for new coalition formations. I will test my theory using parties’ speeches in the parliamentary debates. By appealing to a particular party in parliamentary debates, parties send a signal that they are thinking alike and are on the same - “right” - side of this issue. Automatic text analyses yield me with approaches to investigate the tone of the speeches to create a novel measure of parties’ appeal-making. Utilizing the Austrian, Dutch, German, and Irish Parliament between 1997 and 2013, allow me to test my theory.",Party Communication Strategies,Political Communication

We assess if positive and negative messages are likely to alter how respondents evaluate the target and sponsor capacity at handling a specific issue. Relying on experimental data embedded in an online survey conducted in Australia prior and after the 2016 election we show that parties can operate to harm the performance of their rivals in the eyes of the voter; positive campaigning yields overall more negative evaluations, while negative campaigning is effective for respondents for which the issue a stake is personally relevant and identifying with the target. We also confirm that issue-based negative messages do not backlash and harm the sponsor of the message.",Party Communication Strategies,Political Communication

This paper addresses this question by focusing on how Swedish politicians from all administrative levels (n=2480) perceive the influence of a specific component of political journalism, namely media’s coverage of opinion polls. Among the key findings are that results from published opinion polls are seen as highly influential on serval aspects of politics, and that the level of influence ascribed to polls in part is a function of how the politician’s party has performed in the polls. More specifically, politicians who think that their own party has either increased or decreased their support in the polls view published poll results as more influential, compared to politicians who assess that their party has not moved in the polls.",Party Communication Strategies,Political Communication

There were four versions of the article for each celebrity, which varied information about the celebrity’s diagnosis, behaviors, and treatment. Before reading the article, respondents indicated their familiarity with the celebrity, and if the person was known to them, rated their parasocial relationship (PSR). After reading the article, they rated their emotions and perceptions of the celebrity, as well as two measures of stigma (stereotypes, social distance). Expected framing effects were observed for emotions and perceptions, and article content was related to stigma measures in expected ways.

Findings revealed that the narrative pro-radiotherapy message not only enhanced the immediate issue attitude, but also produced a carryover impact on attitude after exposure to the subsequent competing message. The carryover impact was generated via two distinct pathways. Enhanced memory accessibility was critical to the cognitive route; the heightened narrative engagement, self-referencing, and counter-arguing with the subsequent message explained the experiential process. Moreover, the narrative competing message elicited a greater attitude change than the rhetorical competing message.

2018-0946,2018,Paper Session,Predicting Nationwide Campaign Effects From Multivariate Brain Activity Signatures,7,"Billions of dollars per year are put towards public service messaging, but it is difficult to predict which messages will be the most persuasive and successful in changing behavior. Recent work has found that neuroimaging can improve predictions of message success and behavior change, but has primarily focused on average brain activity in single brain regions. By contrast, distributed brain activity signatures have been used to predict outcomes in specific cognitive and emotional domains, but have not been applied in the context of persuasive messaging, nor to link brain responses to large-scale human behavior. Here we record brain activity in a sample of smokers exposed to anti-smoking messages and test whether message-wise response patterns can forecast large-scale effectiveness of the same messages in the field. Specifically, we assessed the similarity between the neural response for each message and theoretically motivated multivariate brain signatures for positive valence, negative emotion, and vividness. We find that the latter two metrics predict population-level message success, operationalized as the click-through rate (CTR) each banner generated when it was viewed during the nationwide online campaign. Our work suggests that such multivariate signature maps, assessed in a subgroup of the population, can forecast meaningful, real-world behaviors, and may ultimately provide insight into improving message success in the new media environment.",Persuasion and Media in Health Contexts,Mass Communication

To answer the need for conceptual ground work, this theoretical paper synthesizes evidence from already existing studies on FN, as well as research on related concepts like misinformation, conspiracy theories, and propaganda. We present ideas for a clarification of the blurred usage of the term – distinguishing between FN as a label used to discredit information provided by news media, and FN as a genre, describing the deliberate creation of pseudo-journalistic misinformation. Furthermore, we identify possible challenges FN entails for modern democracies and present a research agenda to meet these.

We present a panel survey on the believability and the electoral consequences of online-spread fake news in the German parliamentary elections 2017 (N = 989). Results show that a right-wing political ideology facilitates belief in fake news, while news media literacy and trust in traditional news media diminish it.

However, we know little about the extent to which online audiences are exposed to fake news, and how these outlets factor into the average digital news diet. In this paper, I argue that fears about fake news consumption echo fears about partisan selective exposure, in that both stem from concerns that more media choice leads audiences to consume news that align with their beliefs, and to ignore news that does not. Yet recent studies have concluded that the partisan media audience (1) is small and (2) also consumes news from popular, centrist outlets.

A Technofeminist Analysis of the Use of Dating Apps Among Women in Urban China,1,"Based on the technofeminist perspective, I examine how dating apps disrupt yet reproduce existing gender dynamics in China. Female dating app users offer multiple interpretations of why they use dating apps: as a laboratory to experience sexuality, a springboard to romance and marriage, a third place between home and the workplace, and a door to new worlds. They also face several challenges in using dating apps, including resisting social stigma, assessing men’s purposes, and handling undesirable sexual solicitations. In the light of women’s struggles in contemporary China, I argue that, while dating apps might be a feminist tool, they conceal the structural gender inequality embedded in the sexual double standard, marriage expectations, and state policies.","Feminist Approaches to Technology, Internet and Apps",Feminist Scholarship

Specifically I use the method of ROM hacking on an original Nintendo console and cartridge to recover women's work in the production processes, both ideological and material, as well as in the consumption and cultural form. For example, disassembling the cartridge and circuit foments an examination into the tasks and narratives of assembly factory workers, such as the Chinese female migrant workers. Even the coloration of the console connects to object oriented feminist critiques of the representations of women within the algorithmic bias in these early video game systems. Therefore, working through the synthesization of these methodologies and theories on a case study of Super Mario for NES enables a practice that re-configures this media as feminist technology by incorporating the voices of those previously erased.","Feminist Approaches to Technology, Internet and Apps",Feminist Scholarship
2018-0954,2018,Paper Session,In Defense of the ‘Helminthiasis’: A Technofeminist Reading of the 1988 Internet Worm,1,"On November 2, 1988 by Robert Morris, a graduate student in computer science at Cornell university unleashed upon an unsuspecting and unprepared public the first Internet worm. Initially a small experiment, the impact of the worm, was much more devastating than intended. This small program ultimately led machines across the country to crash and the accumulation of thousands of dollars in repair costs (Kehoe, 1995). Using technofeminist and postcolonial STS literature, this paper will demonstrate how RFC 1135, or “The Helminthiasis of the Internet” can be read as trace related to the development of Internet infrastructure standards and values. In all, this work argues that the negative connotation of the ‘worm’ is undeserved because it creates a power and ethical binary within the constructs of the Internet infrastructure resulting in a conception of ethics and values enforced legally and across space and time that favors Western values and norms.","Feminist Approaches to Technology, Internet and Apps",Feminist Scholarship
2018-0955,2018,Paper Session,"Programming Sex, Gender, and Sexuality: Infrastructural Failures in ‘Feminist’ Dating App Bumble",2,"Bumble is a self-declared ‘feminist’ dating app that gives women control over initiating conversations with potential matches. Through a material-semiotic analysis of Bumble’s software and online media about the app, this article critically investigates how gender, sex, and sexuality are produced and given meaning by Bumble’s programmed infrastructure. Since the epistemological underpinnings of Bumble’s design center gender as the solitary axis of oppression, we argue that the app’s infrastructure generates an ontological relationship between gender, sex, and sexuality that narrows the capacity to achieve its creators’ stated social justice objectives. We detail several infrastructural failures that demonstrate how control and safety is (1) optimized for straight, cisgender women, and (2) contingent on the inscription of an aggressive form of masculinity onto straight, male bodies.","Feminist Approaches to Technology, Internet and Apps",Feminist Scholarship

Approaching the concept of 'third spaces' from a feminist perspective, it aims at revealing whether the primarily non-political online forum serves as a sheltered environment for women who are marginalized in online political discussions in other spaces. The results of our content analysis show that despite a very high level of incivility in the parenting forum, women create a space in which they protect themselves from harmful personal attacks and humiliation and that the minority of participating men seems to respect this approach.","Feminist Approaches to Technology, Internet and Apps",Feminist Scholarship
2018-0957,2018,Paper Session,Managing Up and Fostering Humility in Internal Crisis Communication,3,"Leaders and managers play essential roles in communicating about crises. In the case of hospitals, effective crisis communication can mean the difference between life and death. Despite a growing call for research on internal public relations and internal crisis communication, these research areas remain understudied (Heide & Simonsson, 2014, 2015; Volk, 2016). The aim of this study is to deepen understanding about how public relations practitioners can manage up to improve hospitals’ crisis communication. Managing up is loosely defined as when a middle-manager offers constructive feedback or guidance to members of top management (Herman, 2008). We interviewed 27 public relations practitioners from a variety of hospital types and sizes. Key findings reveal that managing up emerged as a successful internal strategy to course correct communication when senior leadership went awry before and after crises. Effectively managing up also increased communicators’ internal legitimacy, thereby enabling them to better influence senior management.",Involving and Engaging Internal Stakeholders in Public Relations,Public Relations

CEO ghost posting was found to be commonly expected and often accepted by employees. However, results of the structural equation model indicate that employee perceptions of CEO voice were found to play a more important role than their beliefs about CEO ghost posting in relation to perceptions of CEO authentic leadership, organizational transparency and employee-organization relationships.

2018-0959,2018,Paper Session,Employees Constituting Corporate Voice as Sensemakers and Sensegivers,1,"Fast evolving media landscape is transforming corporate voice mechanisms. Especially, social media has reshaped the power dynamics in corporate communication by empowering employees to communicate on behalf of their organizations. Employees’ communication role has extended to include external publics and employees are regarded as strategic constituents in corporate image and reputation construction. Employees interact with external publics in social networks and virtual issue arenas where communication is centered around issues and topics. Employees are required to take ownership of corporate content creation and this requires not only adequate communication competences but also understanding of social media logics. This conceptual paper aims to clarify how empowered employees individually and collectively construct corporate identity through sensemaking and sensegiving and how these sensemaking and sensegiving prosesses impact employees’ communication behavior, specifically employee advocacy. The paper contributes to public relations theory by integrating sensemaking theory to the corporate image and reputation construction.",Involving and Engaging Internal Stakeholders in Public Relations,Public Relations

This brings to the surface the necessity to explore the area of social behaviour from the employees’ perspective which has received scant attention in current scholarship. In seeking to address this lacuna, employees become the focal point of our research; aiming to create the space for alternative “voices” to be heard.
Drawing on the literature of scepticism this study investigates through a survey how employees’ scepticism affects their perceptions of the organization’s CSR and how the latter influences their trust, commitment and satisfaction.

This research seeks to broaden the existing discussion about news and numbers through in-depth semistructured interviews with nineteen working reporters about how they use numbers in their daily work. Sociological studies of news production show that journalists follow structured norms and routines such as the beat system to shape their concept of what counts as news. Except for lengthy investigative projects, the subjects closely followed beat conventions, relying heavily on official sources to define what counts as good measurement. Though they frequently recognize problems with particular numbers, their faith in numbers as a special kind of truth remains unshaken.",Data in Journalistic Practice: Challenges and Competencies,Journalism Studies

Secondly, it argues that both the ‘epistemology’ and domain of expertise should be treated interdependently as suggested by the concept of ‘boundary work,’ which implies the normative delineation of professional domains in which truth claims can be made. Ultimately, the purpose of the paper is to argue for an extended classification of the quantitative branch of journalism, shifting it from the model of ‘bipolar interactional expertise’ to that of ‘referred expertise.’ By ‘referred expertise,’ journalists are imagined to operate as ‘embedded experts,’ who in their daily work both refer to overlapping domains of expertise and infer from it a hybrid working methodology.",Data in Journalistic Practice: Challenges and Competencies,Journalism Studies

This has drawn considerable scholarly attention as researchers have sought to better understand the phenomenon and evaluate its impact on news production. It is argued in this paper that we are amidst a third wave toward the rationalization of audience understanding, and that there is value to distinguishing between “audience analytics” and “audience metrics.” Different theoretical perspectives are then used to explain this emergent phenomenon and the budding body of literature on it is synthesized across five key areas: attitudes, behaviors, content, discourse, and ethics. That synthesis leads to an overarching conclusion that modern journalism is not being driven by quantified audiences, but that both audiences and quantification are playing more prominent roles in the news production process than in the past.",Data in Journalistic Practice: Challenges and Competencies,Journalism Studies

One especially salient form of social stimuli with significant implications for both individuals and democratic societies consists of emotional displays by political figures. Emotional expressions displayed by a politician may impact individuals’ responses through the process of emotional contagion. In this study, we investigate how intense positive and negative emotional facial expressions by politicians impact emotional contagion and how contagion might vary according to pre-existing attitudes toward the politician. The overarching research question in this experiment is how does liking for a specific politician impact emotional contagion experienced in response to positive and negative facial expressions displayed by the politician.",HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive and Emotional Approaches to Understanding Morality and Ideology,Information Systems

After completing a measure of baseline intuition salience, participants in an experiment first read an article about a fighter pilot who shot down a plane with 164 passengers and then judged the pilot’s actions as morally right or wrong.
Participants were randomly assigned to read the article either as if they were the pilot (social distance low) or as objectively as possible (social distance high). The article indicated that the plane had been hijacked by a terrorist who wanted to let it crash into a nearby stadium, and that the pilot shot down the plane to save 70,000 people in the stadium. Results showed that baseline intuition salience and social distance interacted in determining moral judgment. If social distance was low, moral intuition salience was positively associated with moral judgments. However, if social distance was high, the association between baseline moral intuition salience and moral judgment was negative. Finally, moral judgment predicted whether participants would find the pilot guilty or not. In a second study using the same design as in the first study, we ensured that readers focused on different aspects of the dilemma depending on social distance to the pilot.",HIGH-DENSITY: Cognitive and Emotional Approaches to Understanding Morality and Ideology,Information Systems

Specifically, it is designed to test the hypothesis that political conservatism and proscriptive moral motives are based in the aversive motivational system, whereas political liberalism and prescriptive moral motives are based in the appetitive motivational system. Preliminary results from a survey using undergraduate subjects suggest that people’s moral motives and political orientations do not necessarily have a fixed relationship with trait motivational reactivity as previous research suggested.

Teachers’ attitudes towards inclusive education play a crucial role in this regard, and are shaped by single-case descriptions from news or social media. Building on exemplification theory and priming, two experiments with full factorial 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 between designs investigated the influence of such descriptions on student teachers’ attitudes towards inclusive education. Study 1 (N = 416) examined the impact of pupils’ disability type, behavior, origin, and sex. Study 2 (N = 703) focused on pupils’ origin, behavior, sex, school grades, and the role of respondents’ teaching self-efficacy as a moderator of these processes. The results support the general assumption, but the emerged effect pattern is complex and occasionally counter-intuitive.

While these courses and the skills learned are seen as vital by faculty and future employees, students often fail to understand the benefits of general education and are less motivated to learn and perform well in these courses. In an effort to increase undergraduate perceptions about the value of general education courses, we implemented a communication campaign effort entitled Think Beyond the Major. Data collected from pre- and post-surveys indicate that student exposure to the Think Beyond the Major campaign had a positive impact on student perceptions of the general, education, and individual benefits, but not on student perceptions of the career benefits of taking general education courses. While this study suggests that campaigns could be valuable tools for colleges and universities to improve student perceptions of general education courses, future research should explore campaign efforts at larger institutions and examine ways in which to impact student attitudes about the career benefits of taking general education courses.",Instructional Communication Variables Revisited,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2018-0977,2018,Paper Session,Podemos’s Performative Power: Materializing Voice Through Space Struggles,1,"This paper presents an analysis of Spanish political party Podemos as, first of all, an outcome of the shrinking space of privilege in post-crisis Spain and the social mobilizations that followed, and second, as a potential producer of a more democratic or ‘common’ political culture through its different performative actions in institutional spaces. Drawing on theorizings of space as a structured and (re)structuring force that regulates broader social relations (Lefevbre, 1991), I first discuss the intrinsic relation between Indignad@s and its particular uses of space, the development of a common social position for this social movement, and the emergence of Podemos as a political project. Then, I focus on Podemos’s ability to overcome the fixing trap of place, or the attaching of their voice to only a particular location, which was possible thanks to a further spatial “re-territorialization” (Deleuze & Guattari, 1988) beyond the plazas, and the “streets” more generally. I argue that, through different performances of politics geared towards the re-appropriation of institutional spaces such as the Congress or the Parliament, Podemos tried to challenge the dominant, unmarked—but equally performative—accepted practices that constitute these spaces through exclusion. Overall, although still in need to be further integrated as part of Podemos’s hybrid project, these powerful performances of politics can be seen as a manifestation of cultural (re)production and potential political transformation.",Critical Communication Theory: Times and Spaces,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

During a year of ethnographic research (between 2011 and 2012) in the newsrooms of the two television channels, I discovered an ideological divergence, which produces competing Arab images. The past research has either isolated journalism from its ideological appropriation, or considered ideology a hegemonic and conservative phenomenon, which produces domination through social control and manipulation.

However, limited attention has been paid to understanding the degree to which entrepreneurs’ social media knowledge and managerial skills impact their business performances. This paper fills this gap by investigating the variations of mobile entrepreneurs’ social media strategies from the perspectives of technological knowledge and IT managerial skills that derive from resource-based theory. Using qualitative data drawn from 45 semi-structured interviews with mobile entrepreneurs and advocates in the major U.S. tech hubs, we find the formation and implementation of their different social media strategies are premised on the social media knowledge and managerial skills associated with the business development needs, the business network, the broader industry context, and the understanding of mobile technologies and user practices.",Entrepreneurship and Business Model Innovation in Digital Media,Media Industry Studies

As the most popular entertainment media for adolescents, mobile games have the potential to facilitate recovery through the psychological dimensions of community experience, relaxation, mastery, control, and psychological detachment. As predicted, the positive recovery experience associated with mobile gameplay increases the likelihood of using mobile games for recovery purpose. Of all game clusters, social mobile games are found to provide a greater experience of recovery. In addition, mobile gameplay seems to be a promising activity to compensate for the loss in home life. But, surprisingly, students with higher levels of peer pressure are more likely to play mobile games yet less likely to gain positive recovery experience.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies

However, previous research on avatars widely neglected the dynamic nature of these processes. The current paper targeted this research gap examining shifting patterns in avatar creation and characterization as well as player-avatar relationships as a function of either players’ game experience or the time they have played with their current avatar. For that purpose, we conducted an online survey among players of traditional role-playing games making it one of a few studies addressing such games. Results revealed differential effect patterns with growing game experience being linked to a stronger emphasis on goal-directed avatar characterization and a less social player-avatar relationship, while players showed a slight increase in self-directed avatar characterization as well as a more social relationship the longer they have played with their avatar.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies
2018-0986,2018,Paper Session,"Playbor and the Gamification of Work: Empowerment, Exploitation, and Fun as Labor Dynamics",1,"The discursive separation of labor and play as distinct arenas that lead to pain and pleasure respectively has spurred the attempt to instrumentalize play and games by companies with the promise of making work fun. Such approaches are problematic because the claims of playful empowerment are often veiled in the opaque appropriation of game design and digital game mechanics. This is particularly important for game scholars, as the appropriation of game aesthetics for purposes of work not only allows for patterns of exploitation and control but because it potentially redefines the inclusion of game mechanics in labor-oriented technologies as technologies of contradiction. This paper theorizes the interplay between the contradicting logics guiding play and labor when placed in a for-profit advances immersive media system. By studying the way in which games and playful thinking are being incorporated into labor processes, I argue that organizations incur in a paradoxical reconfiguration of labor where working practices are disguised as game-like activities. This contradiction lies in the friction between the promise of empowerment and free will of play, and the tactics of control and for-profit determinism of capitalist ventures.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies

The current study examined specifically whether moral evaluations of a game designer (as manipulated using a Twitter profile) would impact moral evaluations of a character in a game made by that game designer. Results indicated that people formed moral evaluations of game designers based on Twitter feeds, but that these evaluations did not impact evaluations of game characters.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies

Using a convenience sample of 632 Pokémon GO players in Hong Kong, the present study identified six user-based motivations (i.e., nostalgia, relaxation, avatar identification, sociability, achievement, and fun) and three affordance-based motivations (i.e., peer-gamers friendship building, mobility, and realism) for playing AR games in general and Pokémon GO in particular. When linking motivations and playing styles to gameplay outcomes, the results showed that players who were motivated by relaxation, peer-gamers friendship building, and adopting the gameplay-centered playing styles were more likely to obtain in-game benefits, such as awareness of surrounding, social capital, and subjective vitality. In addition, players who were motivated by relaxation, fun, the mobile nature of AR games, and experiencing less avatar identification were more likely to perceive a higher level of well-being.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies

A 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial experiment was conducted to examine the effects of display fidelity (display resolution) and priming (absence or presence of a first-aid box) by getting participants (N=57) to play a preselected violent game and complete measures related to their game engagement, aggressive cognition, aggressive emotion, and aggressive behavior. The results indicate that fidelity and priming have no significant main effects on all four dependent variables, but they do have an interaction effect on game engagement. Game engagement, on the other hand, is associated with greater aggressive cognition, but not with aggressive behavior or aggressive emotions (with the exception of joy). Implications of the findings are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies
2018-0990,2018,Paper Session,Examining Social and Personal Factors That Influence In-Game Profanity Through Comparative Ego-Network Analysis,2,"[RESEARCH PAPER] Contemporary communications research has long been interested in the proliferation and influence of profanity in mainstream media (Kaye & Sapolsky, 2004, 2009), in particular with regard to its impact on individual behaviors. When it comes to online multiplayer games, the behavior and use of aggressive language of other players is just as much a part of players’ experience as the narrative and dialogue present in the game itself (Eastin, 2007). This study employs comparative ego-network analysis and stepwise model selection to probe what social interaction and personal factors predict in-game profanity. Our results show that for males, higher level of aggression personality and familiarity with peer players could lead them to use more verbal aggression during the game. For females however, while the personality remains as a significant predictor, they were more likely to be influenced by proteus effect. Reasons are discussed with the study’s implications and limitations.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies
2018-0991,2018,Paper Session,Entertainment Motivations and Gaming-Specific Gratifications as Antecedents of Hedonic and Eudaimonic Gaming Entertainment Experiences,3,"FULL RESEARCH PAPER (STUDENT SUBMISSION): Digital game entertainment research has identified a broad range of gaming gratifications that fuel players’ enjoyment. However, eudaimonic entertainment experiences (i.e., appreciation) have mainly been attributed to the satisfaction of basic needs proposed by self-determination theory (SDT). Yet, this perspective reflects the multifaceted gaming gratifications only abstractly. The present study thus investigates the role of well-established gaming gratifications in the emergence of appreciation and enjoyment. Additionally, trait-like preferences for eudaimonic and hedonic entertainment are investigated as possible antecedents of the entertainment experiences as well. To address this, a two-wave online survey of US-players of the action-role-playing game Mass Effect: Andromeda (N = 1,074) was conducted. Our findings show that the obtained gaming-specific gratification are closely related to feelings of enjoyment and appreciation. In contrast, trait-like entertainment motivations only exert a small influence. Implications for theorizing and investigating gaming entertainment experiences and motivations are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies
2018-0992,2018,Paper Session,"Voicing Creativity, Working with Constraints: Character Design in the Video Game Industry",1,"Scholars have studied video game studios and game developers using ethnography and interviews (e.g. O'Donnell, 2009; Johnson, 2013, 2014), but few studies have exclusively examined the process of character design (e.g. Srauy, 2017). The current study augments extant scholarship by homing in on the experiences of character designers, to provide creatives a voice within game studies research. Using grounded theory analysis of 19 interviews with current and former character designers, themes reveal insight on industry standards of successful character design, how audiences and publishers impact content creation, and how interactions in the workplace contribute to incremental changes. This project supports previous research on industry practices concerning the tensions between creativity and rationalization in the commercial games industry. Findings are discussed using theories on organizational cultures and the work of Bourdieu (1986) to conjecture about the development of diverse character portrayals in games. Changes in status quo character design are attributed to diversity-conscious individuals, who are often constrained by organizational practices that privilege proven formulas over innovative designs.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies
2018-0993,2018,Paper Session,"Not Only for the (Tom)Boys: Gender Variables as Predictors for Playing Motivations, Passion, and Addiction for MMORPGs",3,"Video games – especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) – do not only attract a male audience anymore but have had a huge increase in female players over the last years. Research on playing motivation and passion for MMORPGs and gender has so far mainly focused on biological sex and neglected variables related to social gender such as masculinity and femininity. Consequently, video game addiction is still considered a male phenomenon, often based on all-male samples and disregarding underlying causes in models of video game addiction that could explain or extent findings on biological sex difference. Our study investigated the impact of masculine and feminine personality on game play motivations, passion, and game addiction. We found that gender traits are indeed of high importance and significantly add predictive power for all variables of interest. We suggest investigating more gender and personality variables for future games and/or media studies instead of sex.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies
2018-0994,2018,Paper Session,Be Careful What You Twitch For: Dispositional Inferences of Videogame Streamers Based on In-Game Behavior,3,"Individuals form judgments of others based on observed behavior, often attributing behavior to internal dispositions rather than accounting for contextual factors. This fundamental attribution error may exist within videogame streaming communities like Twitch, where users observe hours of in-game behaviors. One popular behavior involves invasive and evasive interactions with nature. In games such as No Man’s Sky players acquire resources (e.g., carbon) via destruction of nature (invasively) or by harvesting from renewable sources (evasively). These forms of virtual environmental resource acquisition (VERA) may influence attribution of environmental dispositions, such that observers may attribute destructive VERA to disconnectedness with nature. To examine this attribution error within the context of videogame streaming, a counterbalanced within-subjects experiment (N=44) presented participants with two videos of gameplay footage featuring either invasive or evasive VERA. VERA-type significantly influenced attitudes and pro-environmental dispositions such that evasive players were perceived as more connected with nature.

The current study put this claim to a direct test, by examining the effect of identification with female game characters on women’s self-perception. Female participants (N = 78) played a video game for 20 minutes as sexualized or non-sexualized female characters and played the game on a casual or normal difficulty setting. Prior to gameplay, participants completed a pre-questionnaire which measured their body discrepancy and general self-discrepancy. A post-gameplay questionnaire measured several outcome variables related to participant’s self-efficacy, self-esteem, and body image. No effects were found between any of the four conditions on self-efficacy, self-esteem, and body image. The implications for the null findings are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Student Papers: No, I Don't Just Play Games, My Research Makes Change",Game Studies

In contrast to recent work in object oriented ontology, I argue that it is precisely the social—and, in fact, the mediated—that allows vague objects to be comprehended as meaningful components of everyday experience. Developing this insight, I suggest a specifically communicative theory of media materialism that is concerned with the ontological being of media objects, including their physical properties, but that does not abandon these objects’ deeply social elements.",Mediatization and Its Objects,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2018-0998,2018,Paper Session,Mediatization and Social Design: For a Better Life With Media,1,"Through the appropriation of new media people can extend their capabilities as autonomous human beings. At the same time, mediatization means that new forms of social and technological dependence emerge, accompanied by experiences of frustration, stress and anxiety. Against this background, this paper assesses the prospects of employing mediatization theory as a framework for social design. It is argued that social design should have as its goal to enhance the capacity among social agents to maintain a sense of autonomy in relation to mediatization. Social design can benefit above all from a cultural-materialist approach to mediatization. Following such an approach, the paper introduces a two-dimensional matrix that explicates the objects and objectives of social design. The concrete implications of the framework are demonstrated through empirical examples taken from the realm of mediatized work/life – a social terrain where the prospects of media-enhanced flexibility easily switch into further socio-technological entanglements with media.",Mediatization and Its Objects,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The debate is often portrayed as pitting the interests of creators against users. Australian copyright law features narrow and limited exceptions. Australian creators benefit from copyright monopolies; but do they suffer any costs for lack of flexible exceptions? A national survey of creators showed that they experience significant costs in time and money in making work; avoid or abandon projects because of copyright problems; and avoid developing ideas for projects that involve use of third-party copyrighted materials. These costs have previously been uncalculated and not included in national policy debate. The results provide information not only for the Australian context but for copyright policy discussion internationally.,The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy
2018-1001,2018,Paper Session,"Copyright Givers and Takers: Mutuality, Altruism and Instrumentalism in Open Licensing",3,"The discussion about the role of open licensing in creative industries and communities tends to be polarized into two vantage points. Either: 1) it is a new, altruistic paradigm enabling creative communities to rework copyright to fit their vision for the cultural commons, or: 2) it is a radical theft of creative labor, encouraged by digital industrial powerhouses such as Google, to cheat creative laborers out of their share of profits. Both of these rhetorical vantage points presume a monolithic and largely either selfless or unaware base of creative laborers. In this article, we analyze data from a series of surveys across a range of creative industries and communities to show that, in fact, cultural laborers employ open licensing agentically for a variety of reasons, including instrumental purposes oriented toward skirting the many impediments created by institutions and law, rather than merely because they are unaware or selfless.",The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy

This study utilized elements of the Theory of Motivated Information Management (TMIM) to examine how individuals decide whether to seek information about their chronic illnesses from online support groups. Adults with chronic illness who had visited at least one online support group in the last six months completed an online survey. Findings revealed that, although an uncertainty discrepancy about a chronic illness did not predict a negative emotional response, both the TMIM constructs of target efficacy and communication efficacy were positively related to information-seeking. Findings support the utility of TMIM in the computer-mediated context and aid in explaining specific processes individuals go through when deciding to visit online support groups to gather information about their chronic illnesses.",Theory and Research About Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Chronic disease patients (N = 684) completed an online survey. The internal structure of the scale was examined with a confirmatory factor analysis and Classical Test Theory and Rasch analyses. A hierarchical linear regression examined the relationship between perceived health information seeking challenges and socio-demographics, eHealth literacy, and trust in online sources. The unidimensional structure was confirmed. Item and person fit statistics were within appropriate ranges, with inconsistent measurement stability evidence. More perceived challenges were associated with being older and female, and a higher eHealth literacy and trust in online providers. Findings support the use of this scale among chronic disease patients; however, research should avoid adapting the number of response options and explore how additional items can better capture variability in scores.",Theory and Research About Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

We found that online health information seeking is explained by perceived self-efficacy, direct experience with online sources, direct experience with fellow patients, perceived barriers, direct experience with physicians, concern over one’s health, and one’s health condition. Our findings suggest that online health information seeking is not only explained by intrinsic perceptions about one’s self-efficacy, state of health, and concerns about one’s health but also by sociality—one’s experiences with and support from interactions with online sources as well as offline sources of health information such as physicians and others who have the same health conditions. We contextualized online health information seeking in relation to offline sources of health information, and found that despite our respondents’ significant reliance on online health information sources, they are most reliant on healthcare professionals for health information.",Theory and Research About Health Information Seeking,Health Communication

Results showed that international students rely on relationships in their home country for health information and seek health information online. International students find it difficult to navigate the U.S. health system and prefer to go to a doctor in their home country. They report insurance plans to be confusing and that language barriers deter them from using the campus health center. Implications from this study can help bridge the gap and lend the voice to international students by creating a platform for them to learn what the U.S. health care system entails and give them resources that are easy to understand.

Building on Knapp’s model of relationship development, the model describes stages of media consumers’ development of PSRs with media figures from initiation (i.e., first encounter with the media persona) to integration (development of secondary attachment). Through synthesis of research across disciplines, the model conceptualizes the relational goals at each stage of the PSR, identifies variables that predict engagement at this level, and describes this stage’s outcomes/effects. PSIs specific to the PSR at each stage are discussed.

In Study 1, we found that positive parasocial contact with a Muslim sitcom character would result in lower prejudice towards Muslims in general and that stronger parasocial interactions would be correlated to lower prejudice (i.e., lower social distance). Both hypotheses were supported. In Study 2, participants who saw a film excerpt with a Muslim villain showed greater anxiety about Muslims as a group than those who saw a film with a White villain (although social distance was not significantly greater). Moreover, negative parasocial interaction – specifically antipathy toward the Muslim villain – was associated with greater anxiety, while greater disinterest in the villain was related to lower social distance.

Parasocial Relationships With Liked and Disliked Media Personae as a Source for Physical and Social Well-Being,3,"The paper introduces parasocial relationships as a potential source for recreation in itself instead of being a surrogate for interpersonal relationships. We conducted two studies which manipulated a preceding social reminder task (social inclusion vs. social exclusion) and the valence of the parasocial relationship (favorite vs. most disliked). Each study addressed a distinct type of media persona (Study 1: fictional characters from TV drama series; Study 2: YouTube personalities) and used a different subpopulation (Study 1: university students; Study 2: high school students) as samples. The results of both studies show different effect patterns regarding physical and social well-being. Following a situational threat to participants’ social belongingness, both negative and positive parasocial relationships enhanced physical well-being, while only positive relationships demonstrated a similar effect after a positive social reminder. However, tapping an existing parasocial relationship enhanced participants’ social well-being irrespective of the preceding task or the valence of this relationship.",Parasocial Experience,Mass Communication

Fifty-one participants started using a new app. Within the field period of 30 days, they reported each day on their habit strength as well as potential predictors of habit formation discussed in literature. Multilevel models show that repeated use of the app determines habit formation. The relation is hereby non-linear: Growth in habit strength is stronger at the beginning of the period under investigation and then decelerates. Omissions in usage behavior do not sustainably influence habit formation. Whereas situational stability does not impact habit formation, perceived rewards boost the process, but mainly at the beginning.","Media Effects, New Approaches",Mass Communication

Results indicate high media displacement with regard to newspapers and magazines, followed by book reading, with a relatively marginal transition to online TV and radio. Displacement levels vary among participating countries and are highest in Spain and Israel, with differences remaining significant even after controlling for background characteristics. The most significant displacement predictor, however, is variety of users’ online activities. The findings suggest that despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices. Nevertheless, it also exhibits selective displacement that is highly dependent on users’ media habits, the relative advantages of each medium and socio-cultural contexts.","Media Effects, New Approaches",Mass Communication

The impact levels refer to the number of impact factors, which characterize social events (i.e., relevance, non-polarization, certainty, radicalness and closeness). The consequences, in turn, refer to the outcomes for media users (i.e., positive or negative outcomes). The results are based on data from the Standard Eurobarometer survey (N = 73860) as well as on data from a content analysis and cover 36 social events in 13 European countries over a time period of six years. The moderated moderation analysis reveals that social events only influence the effects of the use of more interactive media types (i.e., the internet and social network sites) on media users' life satisfaction but they don't influence the effects of the use of less interactive media types (i.e., written press, radio and TV) on media users' life satisfaction. In fact, social events with positive consequences increase these effects, while social events with negative consequences buffer these effects. Previous research has investigated how the use of different types of media or specific social events affect people's life satisfaction.

A May, 2017 survey of U.S. adults (N = 2,055) included items that reflect traditional approaches to the study of candidate support (e.g., political party identification, policy agreement) along with several batteries of a newly-developed political para-social relationship (PPSR) measure. This study gives primary attention to predicting support for U.S. President Donald J. Trump, but also focuses on Secretary Hillary Clinton and U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Parasocial relations prove to be a powerful predictor of Trump support, outperforming all other predictors (including past voting behavior). This study also explores what predicts citizen-politician PPSR. Citizens’ parasocial relationships with Trump are predicted by general political knowledge (-), 2016 Trump voting (+), support for Trump’s policies (+), along with news media exposure (+), and social media following of Trump (+).",Media Effects on Voters,Political Communication
2018-1024,2018,Paper Session,"News About Issue Positions, Attacks and Failures: How Classic Media, Facebook and Twitter Affect Voting",3,"The theory of issue ownership predicts that voters can be persuaded by media publicity about issue positions on owned issues. Theories of retrospective voting predict that the fate of incumbent parties depends on the media portrayal of whether real-world conditions improved. Theories of social identity suggest that the media portrayal of grass root support for parties matters. Bandwagon effects assume that attribution of successes, failures, and momentum matters. Content analysis data and seven-wave panel survey data were employed to trace the effects of news in the media on voters who self-selected specific media. The results show that all news content features matter, but that the attribution of success and failure by the media is most important. The propagation of news items through Facebook strengthens the effects of mass media. Effects of tweets are more subtle: they appear to immunize voters for effects of party endorsements in the mass media.",Media Effects on Voters,Political Communication
2018-1025,2018,Paper Session,News Bonus? How Saliency and Tone in the News Coverage Influence Voters’ Electoral Expectations About Coalitions,2,"Past research has shown that media coverage influences citizen preferences and expectations. Yet, the effect of media on expectations about post-electoral government formation has remained largely understudied. This is surprising, given that speculations about post-electoral coalition building are an integral part of election campaigns in all multiparty systems. This paper investigates the consequences that media saliency of and tone toward potential coalitions have on voter expectations. Using media and panel data from the 2013 German and Austrian election campaigns, we find that media coverage has substantial effects on voter perceptions and may even negatively influence voter ability to assess a coalition’s likelihood to form after the elections. These findings have important implications for our understanding of elections and campaign strategies.",Media Effects on Voters,Political Communication
2018-1026,2018,Paper Session,"Patterns of Intra-Election Volatility, Political Knowledge, and Media Exposure",2,"One key trend changing political environments across advanced industrial democracies is increasing electoral volatility. Despite extensive research, at the individual level we still know relatively little about the mechanisms behind electoral volatility during election campaigns (intra-election volatility). This includes the impact of political knowledge and political news exposure. Against this background and based on a four-wave panel study in the context of the 2014 Swedish national election, the purpose of this paper is to investigate (a) patterns of intra-election volatility and the impact of (b) political knowledge and (c) political news exposure on patterns of electoral volatility. Distinguishing between party alienation, crystallization, wavering, reinforcement, and conversion, among other things, findings show some effects from offline political news exposure on patterns of electoral volatility but none from stored or acquired political knowledge.",Media Effects on Voters,Political Communication
2018-1027,2018,Paper Session,The Rationality of Mediated Leader Effects,1,"There is a lively debate whether to consider vote decisions based on leader evaluations a threat to democracy, as this has long been assumed to constitute irrational decision-making behavior. Empirical evidence indicating that leader effects are not necessarily expressions of irrationality has recently mounted up, though skepticism towards leader effects remains resilient especially when considering voters being influenced through media coverage of party leaders. This paper studies the rationality of these mediated leader effects, by testing its conditionality upon voter characteristics. Two datasets are combined: a manual content analysis of leadership images in television coverage and a five-wave panel-dataset in the four months preceding the 2012 General elections in the Netherlands. The results provide evidence for both sides of the debate, as the lowest politically sophisticates are strongest influenced by media coverage of party leaders, while politically cynical voters, who are ideologically distant to the leader’s party, are weakest affected.",Media Effects on Voters,Political Communication

2018-1029,2018,Paper Session,Testing a Multidimensional Model of Media Multitasking Selection,2,"The aim of the present paper was to empirically test and extent the previously proposed multidimensional framework of media multitasking (Wang, Irwin, Cooper, & Srivastava, 2015). Specifically, we investigated to what extent four cognitive dimensions predicted the selection of media multitasking combinations. Moreover, we extended the framework by including an additional dimension, namely instant gratification. For this means, we reanalyzed a total of 14 datasets based on self-report data that assessed between 72 and 144 media multitasking combinations each. The findings of our study are largely in line with the predictions of the framework. The cognitive dimensions of task switching, task flow, shared modality and behavioral response requirement predicted which media multitasking combinations were chosen most frequently. Moreover, media multitasking behaviors characterized by high levels of instant gratification were selected more frequently. Combined the dimensions predicted 33% of the variance in media multitasking frequency. Overall, the present findings suggest that media multitasking behaviors are selected based on cognitive as well emotional dimensions.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems

To explore cognitive underload, we propose an experiment in which people engage in single- and multi-tasking with print and video media of varying interest, to assess how the addition of a second media stream (multi-tasking) affects the availability of cognitive resources, memory, subjective emotional experience, and mind-wandering. Specifically, we ask whether the addition of a second media stream can actually enhance any of these measures.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems

This study utilized the Gutenberg Diagram of user attention to operationalize story placement. We hypothesized that readers enter the visual layout through the Primary Optical Area (POA; the top-left screen quadrant) and will end in the Terminal Area (TA; the bottom-right screen quadrant). As a result, headlines in the POA will be selected sooner and processed better while headlines in the TA will be selected later and processed less thoroughly. Preliminary analysis of participants (N = 204) that navigated a news website containing 32 news headlines indicated structural placement of news headlines as a strong predictor of news selection and headline recognition; top-left headlines were selected early on, with more frequency, and were recognized best while bottom-right headlines were selected much later, with less frequency, and were least recognized.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems
2018-1032,2018,Paper Session,At Least Three Episodes or at Least Two Hours? Proposal for a Definition and Measurement of Binge Watching as TV Series Viewing Behavior,1,"Binge watching—the cumulative non-linear usage of televised series, particularly via video-on-demand services—is an increasingly prevalent and controversially discussed phenomenon of media entertainment. Prior research has not reached consensus about the criteria that characterize binge watching as a unique usage behavior. Accordingly, measurement and correlates of binge watching vary widely between studies. To close this gap, we conducted a comprehensive literature synopsis allowing us to present a refined definition of binge watching. In two empirical studies (N1 = 184; N2 = 499), we subsequently developed a concise five-item scale that operationalizes binge watching as an interindividually varying perception of one’s consecutive TV series consumption. High intensity of consumption predicted the level of perceived binge watching, but was not definitional for the usage behavior. The scale showed high internal consistency and construct validity, thus offering a valuable instrument for future research on predictors and consequences of binge watching.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems

Implications of Previous Research and Guidelines for Future Research,3,"Recently, media multitasking has received a lot of attention from scholars from different fields, with studies focusing on the prevalence, predictors, behavior, and effects. To help researchers structure their studies, the Wang et. al, (2015) synthesized media multitasking research to provide a systematic framework of the multi-dimensions of media multitasking. The current paper expands on that work by refining the elements that are important in media multitasking methods. The current paper examines the validity of operationalizations in previous studies, and the impact the design and measures had on the conclusions drawn. In order to do this, we map the differences in manipulating and measuring media multitasking, discuss the implications, and provide guidelines for future research examining media multitasking to help connect disparate findings and for media effects researchers to move forward with this topic.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems
2018-1034,2018,Paper Session,"The Selective Exposure Paradox: Prior Attitude, Eye Movements, and Attitude Polarization",4,"In this work we used eye-tracking technology to assess the different attention allocation patterns among partisans and their effect on attitude polarization. A 2-session study examined the relations among prior attitude, partisanship, selective exposure, and attitude polarization. Results showed that attitude-consistent articles were read significantly longer, however, when participants were simultaneously presented with attitude-consistent and attitude-discrepant messages confirmation bias decreased. An interaction effect was found among partisanship, prior attitude, and selective exposure. The model significantly predicted attitude polarization through visual attention on the web pages which presented both attitude-consistent and attitude-discrepant messages. On the issue of gun control, Republicans and Independents who opposed gun control performed longer selective exposure to attitude-consistent messages which resulted in attitude polarization. Those who supported gun control had shorter selective exposure to attitude-consistent messages, resulting in attitude attenuation.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems
2018-1035,2018,Paper Session,Involvement Without Learning: A Meta-Analytic Review on the Cognitive Effects of Website Interactivity,2,"Although website interactivity has been widely utilized to enhance user engagement and to facilitate online learning experiences, mixed results have been produced regarding how interactive websites actually impact the way users process and learn information online. This study conducts a meta-analysis of 37 studies (N = 6,286) to investigate the cognitive effects of website interactivity. Results indicate significantly enhanced user involvement instead of learning as a consequence of website interactivity, such that while website interactivity can effectively absorb users, it does not improve message comprehension, elaboration, memory, and learning. Furthermore, interactivity significantly inhibits users’ memories of website contents. While the cognitive effects of website interactivity do not vary due to the different operationalizations of interactivity, extremely high levels of interactivity fail to benefit users’ cognitive responses. This research also reveals that incorporating interactivity is desirable for experiential rather than for informational websites. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Tackling Selective Exposure, Multitasking, and Choice",Information Systems
2018-1036,2018,Paper Session,A Friend Who Was Supposed to Lose: How Donald Trump Was Portrayed in the Russian Media,2,"Donald Trump and his team have often been accused of having close ties to Russia. Russians, in turn, expressed much greater support for Trump than residents of other countries. This article provides the first systematic analysis of the Russian media coverage of Trump's activities during and after the election campaign. It was concluded, on the basis of the sentiment analysis of relevant articles and network agendas of 500 Russian magazines and 250 leading federal newspapers, that Trump's media portrayal was not necessarily positive. During the election, Trump was portrayed by the Russian media not as Russia's favorite candidate for president, but as Hillary Clinton's opponent and a critic of U.S. recent policies. Only for a short period after Trump's victory in the elections, the Russian media had been representing him as a friend of Russia, since there was hope that the new president would lift political and economic sanctions. Trump's policies failed to meet expectations of the Russian people, and starting from the beginning of 2017, media coverage of Mr. Trump has become critical, hopes for lifting of political sanctions have weakened, and public opinion on the United States President has turned negative.",New Research on the 2016 American Presidential Election,Political Communication
2018-1037,2018,Paper Session,All in Good Time: Comparing the Responsiveness of Online and Television Advertising in the 2016 Presidential Campaign,4,"The expansion in the number of campaign channels and platforms over the past decade has widened the range of communication tools examined by scholars. Recent research has strengthened our understanding of message differences across platforms, that is, how campaigns might coordinate or alter their messages between Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. Still, we know strikingly little about how campaigns use paid advertising online—and whether its use is similar or dissimilar to television advertising. We fill that gap in this study by presenting the first systematic analysis of paid advertising online in the 2016 presidential campaign and how it compared to paid advertising on television. Drawing on a theory of channel and platform affordances, we demonstrate that online and television advertising serve different functions, with online efforts being much more responsive to the events of the day and the latest campaign developments.",New Research on the 2016 American Presidential Election,Political Communication

We examine youth participation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election results on three online affinity networks representing different creative genres (games, fan fiction, and collaborative multimedia production). By qualitatively analyzing 1,116 creative artifacts and 14,202 associated responses posted in the two weeks following the election, we find that youth use online creativity to (re)claim agency towards the political process, provide peers with social support or distraction, and (re)imagine the political. Implications for youth and media, online participation, and political communication are discussed, thus further theorizing the connections between creativity and political expression.",New Research on the 2016 American Presidential Election,Political Communication
2018-1039,2018,Paper Session,Opinion Polls and Presidential Candidate's use of Persuasive Messages During the 2016 Election,5,"The use of digital technologies by political campaigns have been a topic of scholarly concern for over two decades, but most studies have been focused on analyzing the use of digital platforms without considering contextual factors of the race, like public opinion polling data. Opinion polls are an important information source for citizens and candidates, and provide the latter with information that might drive strategic communication. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the use of social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections and candidates' standing in public opinion polls, focusing on the surfacing and primary stages of the campaign. We use automated content analysis to categorize social media posts from all 21 Republican and Democratic candidates. Results indicate that a candidate’s performance in the polls drive certain communicative strategies, such as the use of messages of attacks and advocacy, as well as the focus on personal image.",New Research on the 2016 American Presidential Election,Political Communication

In this paper, we build on this work in the context of news media coverage of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Republican and Democratic presidential primaries. We develop a categorization scheme for American media outlets using two dimensions: partisanship, and embeddedness within a traditional, or social media conversation. Using that scheme, we map the flow of attention to Trump and Clinton through social media and each of the types of news media we identify. Our results demonstrate that whereas social media activity provided a significant boost to news media coverage of Trump, no such boost was available for Clinton. Moreover, it appears that multiple mainstream sectors of the media system were responsive to social media interest in Trump—not only those centered in the social sharing ecosystem.",New Research on the 2016 American Presidential Election,Political Communication

A large body of literature has suggested that individual factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, and BMI could certainly be related to lower or high self-perception and social factors such as media exposure, especially exposure to appearance-oriented media could also be related to a child’s negative sense of self. Using a survey of children in 2nd and 3rd grade from low SES households, factors such as nutritional knowledge, food preference, health literacy, household dieting, and demographic variables are considered in the context of two dependent variables designed to measure a child’s self-perception specific to body image. Results from the present study indicate that demographic variables, health literacy attributes, and the household environment specific to dieting were the strongest predictors of negative self-perception. Of note is that majority of the girls children in the study exhibited negative self-perception, which is notable given the age of the sample in the present study. Results from the present study will be used to modify an existing health literacy/health intervention program that is a part of a longitudinal study examining factors that are the strongest predictors of overweight and obesity in children.

As a result, experts have examined media literacy as a way to help adolescents develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to effectively process media messages. Studies indicate that media literacy training for young people can help to increase their knowledge regarding media and marketing practices, correct their media-based misperceptions, and increase their critical thinking skills and skepticism toward media messages. In addition, media literacy can help correct participants’ expectancies regarding negative behaviors and increase their perceived efficacy to resist the allure of glamorized media portrayals.

This research, in the form of two related case studies, uses grounded theory to examine the efficacy of an experimental embedded reverse mentoring approach to enhance professional development for K-12 teachers. The term reverse mentoring is commonly associated with former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, who in 1999 recruited a team of young associates to come in and mentor 500 of his senior executives to maximize the potential of the Internet. However, the approach is nearly nonexistent in K-12 teacher training. The mentorship experience gave both educators a fresh perspective about their own teaching, in terms of questioning some of their routines. They also felt it was inclusive and honored their expertise. Findings indicate, further development of the approach could positively affect teacher attrition rates.",Health Education and Media Literacy Through the Lens of Instructional Communication,Instructional & Developmental Communication

In so doing, it explores the notion of ""cut-and-paste journalism,"" between its modern understanding that links it to plagiarism and churnalism, and an earlier, nineteenth-century comprehension of newsmaking that saw reuses and reprints as a common, widely accepted practice. The analysis of textbooks (understood as crucial contributions to metajournalistic discourse) takes part in efforts to understand the historicized materiality of newsmaking. It also shows that the scissors and the paste pot, as well as the diversity of other objects that populate the notion of cut-and-paste journalism, can be primarily understood as devices of circulation, rather than devices of replication.",Beyond Churnalism,Journalism Studies

The content analysis data show the more profound the presence of certain (but not all) news factors in the press releases, the higher the chance that journalists choose to invest their journalistic capital in them. This means that journalists are only triggered to invest journalistic capital into press releases by specific news factors. This means that within the context of increased influence of information subsidies, journalists do make informed choices concerning their reliance on information subsidies.",Beyond Churnalism,Journalism Studies

At the same time, critiques that during wartime journalists rally around the flag and serve as mouthpieces for nationalist propaganda persist. Given these opposing views, we examine how three Israeli online newspapers covered the 2014 Gaza War and compare this coverage to posts on the Israel Defense Forces' official social media pages. Through discursive analysis of legitimation and referential strategies and the use of reported speech, transitivity, voice, and modality, we demonstrate both the ideological similarities between news discourse and military public relations, and the ways in which journalists transform the authoritative, formal voice of official texts into the more personalized, emotional voice of media discourse. We discuss our findings as reflective of the complementary influences of journalists' ideological presuppositions, professional rituals, and commercial constraints.",Beyond Churnalism,Journalism Studies

As a result, newspaper organizations are required to adapt their organizational strategies and editorial routines to face these challenges. Among journalistic routines, the use of sources is a prime example for an analysis of changing patterns in news production. This paper investigates regional newspaper’s use of self- and media citations in a longitudinal design (1995, 2006, 2015). Based on a content analysis of German regional newspapers (N= 4,520 articles) we illustrate changing patterns in the use of sources over a period of 20 years. Results point to an increase in using other media as sources as reliable and cheap content sourcing strategy.

The four stages – (i) external structures; (ii) internal structures; (iii) active agency; (iv) and outcomes – are discussed by drawing on existing literature and arguments surrounding the factors influencing news production and journalistic practices. Conceptualising news production in such a manner facilitates a wide-ranging, holistic analysis rather than limiting the discussion to structure- or agency-related factors. The paper was motivated by concerns around sourcing practices, online work environments, the role of PR/passive news sourcing, and the decline of specialised reporting, and such perspective is evident is much of the discussion. However, the broad, macro nature of structuration theory ensures that such a conceptual approach may be applicable to many aspects of journalism studies, and the quadripartite framework can help to facilitate any analyses in which multiple, complex factors are under consideration.",Beyond Churnalism,Journalism Studies

Incorporating the Situational Theory of Problem Solving (STOPS), hostile media perception, affective injustice, and social media efficacy, this study examined how the integrative model of activism predicts social media activism and offline activism on three issues of gun ownership, immigration, and police use of power. The results of this study revealed that social media efficacy was a positive predictor for social media activism, and STOPS variables and affective injustice were positively associated with activism. Furthermore, the influence of situational motivation on offline activism was exerted mostly through engagement in collective action on social media platforms, which means that social media activism is a positive and critical mediator that increases offline activism.",Activism for Changes in Society,Public Relations
2018-1054,2018,Paper Session,Tweet This!: How Activist Organizations Use Mobilizing Information During Crises,2,"Activists have long understood the power of social media to shape and influence relationships between constituents. Today’s more unstructured and informal grassroots organizers sometimes use social media to broaden and construct new networks and organize those networks for large-scale offline collective action processes, such as protests. Using the features of mobilizing information, this paper examined the social media communication of activist organizations at the height of a polarizing event. The data suggest that activist organizations fail to take full advantage of real-time social media communication by sharing mobilizing information during crisis events. Out of more than 8.6 million tweets collected, groups in this study sent 114 social messages signaling a measured approach to mobilizing their publics.

Here we examine parental attitudes around their children’s science and math learning and parental beliefs about the role media plays in exposing children to these concepts. Using interviews, we found that parents of preschool-aged children can identify science and math learning activities they do with their children, but feel more equipped to support math learning and identify math media in comparison to science. Parents described using media to support rather than introduce science and math concepts, but used YouTube to answer science questions. These findings broaden our understanding of how parents use media to supplement children’s informal learning.

A Study of Parents' Opinions About Violent Media Effects,2,"Using the extended parallel process model (EPPM; Witte, 1992), we argue that parents will care about media violence when they perceive the outcomes as being severe, and they perceive their families as being susceptible. To test these hypotheses, a survey was distributed among primary caregivers of children in K-5th grade. In it, we provided parents with layperson descriptions of five common media effect outcomes: fear, cultivation outcomes, desensitization, aggression, and hostility. For each violent media effect, caregivers provided their opinions on perceived severity and susceptibility for their oldest child in the K-5th range. Results suggest parents view their children as most susceptible to fear and cultivation outcomes, but not aggression and hostility. On the other hand, they perceived aggression and hostility to be the most severe. Consistent with the EPPM, ratings of susceptibility and severity predicted overall anxiety about media violence effects. Implications for media violence intervention strategies are discussed.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1058,2018,Paper Session,Using Media Technology as a Pacifier: Relationships with Parent’s Confidence in Child Raising,1,"Using an online questionnaire among 516 parents (children between 1 and 12 years) this study aimed to measure the extent that parents see media as a useful babysit in childrearing; the underlying needs that parents perceive; and which factors predict the use of media as a babysit, in particular, the parent’s confidence in childrearing. Key-findings are that only a minority of the parents (five to 34%) agree to use media as a pacifier. Moreover, parents use media to fulfil their own needs (e.g., instrument for better eating or sleeping, or to take time off) but mostly primarily because of their child’s needs (keep them occupied, reward or punish them). Parents low in parenting self-efficacy and who lack support of their partner and are confronted with child developmental problems are most apt to turn to media devices and fulfil the parent’s need for relief.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1059,2018,Paper Session,Parents’ Responses to Cyberbullying Effects: How Third-Person Perception Influences Support for Legislation and Parental Mediation Strategies,4,"The third-person effect has often focused on the perceived media effects on others versus the self. This study attempts to extend the existing understanding of the third-person effect by examining how parents’ perceived effects of cyberbullying is associated with two behavioral outcomes: support for anti-cyberbullying legislation and parental mediation of social media use. We surveyed 1,187 of parents of children aged between 8 and 17 in Singapore. Our results supported both the perceptual and behavioral hypotheses. Parents perceived other children as more susceptible to cyberbullying than their own children. Parents’ third-person perceptual gap was negatively associated with support for anti-cyberbullying legislation, and positively associated with parental mediation strategies, suggesting that different behavioral outcomes are associated with different processes. The associations between the third-person perceptual gap and both related outcomes were stronger among parents of younger children as compared to adolescents. Implications for research on the third-person effect were discussed.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1060,2018,Paper Session,"The Relationship Between Subjective Knowledge, Internet Trust and Protection Motivation in a Cybercrime Context",4,"Prior research investigating internet users’ intention to take protective measures often applied the Protection Motivation Theory. However, these studies did not take into account the ‘sources of information’ that are believed to initiate threat appraisal and coping appraisal, even though they are an important part of the model. Therefore, this study included two intrapersonal sources of information, namely subjective knowledge and internet trust, to discover how both influence the appraisal processes. Based on survey data collected among 967 respondents, we found that subjective knowledge is negatively related to perceived vulnerability and intention to take protective measures. Moreover, internet trust is negatively related to perceived vulnerability and perceived severity. Consequently, future campaigns should remind internet users about their own vulnerability and the risks that exist online, while at the same time ensuring that internet users do not completely lose trust in the internet and their own online knowledge.",Understanding and Preventing Online Crime and Fraud,Communication and Technology

Cyber vigilantism, defined as a mediated search process whereby people voluntarily and collaboratively use mobile devices and social media to search for private information about some individuals and publicize the information, is one such practice. This study analyzes the coverage trends and news frames in press coverage of cyber vigilantism in the Greater China region over a decade span. The findings showed that from 2006 to 2015, cyber vigilantism received substantial attention in this region, especially in media environments that encourage tabloid journalism. News media in this region tended to focus on the practice’s usefulness and citizen-driven nature, although later media discourse appeared more conservative and neutral. Across the three societies, media discourse about cyber vigilantism in China appeared most rigorous.",Understanding and Preventing Online Crime and Fraud,Communication and Technology
2018-1062,2018,Paper Session,Coping With Widespread Mobile Internet Fraud: A Social Network Approach,3,"The concurrent trends of deepening penetration of mobile Internet among smartphone population and rising waves of fraud targeting mobile Internet users in China prompted the present study. Informed by the robust third-person effect research of social media, the study examines the impact of perceived pervasiveness of mobile Internet fraud on user’s social relationships and their protective action. Findings of data collected from a probability sample of 816 respondents show that respondents’ perceptions of harms of mobile internet fraud vary significantly by strength of their social relationships and network size—The closer the ties, the greater and perceived vulnerability to mobile internet fraud. Moreover, the larger respondent’s social networks, the more pronounced the pattern. Finally, perceived harms on self and on their strong ties will lead to reactive action in terms of verifying suspicious messages online. On the other hand, perceived harms on weak ties result in likelihood of taking proactive action, suggesting that respondents viewed fraud victims they know as warnings to take preventative action. Implications of these findings for how mobile Internet transcends the divide of interpersonal communication, intergroup communication, and mass communication are discussed.",Understanding and Preventing Online Crime and Fraud,Communication and Technology

Evidence, however, suggests that reporting is scarce. The research using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) uncovered the inhibiting mechanisms of reporting by explicating the triadic reciprocal determinism among perceived self-efficacy towards antiphishing behaviors, expected negative outcomes from reporting a phishing email, and cyber security self-monitoring on the likelihood of reporting phishing emails. In addition, incorporating Cyber Risk Beliefs, this research revealed that it positively affects the three internal social cognitive factors of SCT and, in turn, the likelihood of reporting phishing emails.

A large body of research shows that employees are the weakest link in securing this information. Research has investigated how employees can be motivated to comply with information security procedures. However, research often ignores (bad) habits. Also, no model has tested a combination of habitual, situational and individual factors that may influence (non)-compliant behavior. This research uses a vignette approach to study non-compliant behavior. Statistical analysis of a survey, with 651 subjects from a Dutch governmental organization using Warp PLS, shows that the relation between habitual and non-compliant behavior is mediated by situational factors. In addition, self-efficacy and intention to comply influence non-compliant behavior. A communication strategy that addresses bad habits in a situational context might be an effective way to increase compliant behavior.",Understanding and Preventing Online Crime and Fraud,Communication and Technology

Despite its growing popularity, little is known about how Finsta is different from Rinsta and also, what motivates users to create Finsta. To answer these questions, we conducted an online survey with 106 college undergraduate students who are active Rinsta and Finsta users. By employing both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we found that Instagram users differentiate Finsta and Rinsta on two themes – unfiltered content and self-expression. Furthermore, users were more motivated to use Rinsta for social interaction, self-expression, escapism and archiving compared to Finsta. We identified two additional user motivations for creating Finsta - social bonding and sharing funny contents. We discuss practical implications for the designers of social media to fulfill the users’ needs to express multiple facets of their self and also, to reduce the tension created from contextual collapse.",The Presentation of Selfie in Everyday Life: Self-Presentation and Impression Formation in Instagram and Other Online Contexts,Communication and Technology

In a 2 x 2 experimental design, participants engaged in an email discussion task with or without 38 CC-ed observers and received either positive or negative feedback. Contrary to expectations, the effects of feedback valence on perceived argument quality and incivility were intensified in the private rather than public condition. This effect was moderated by individuals’ self-views. Participants with high self-views responded critically to negative feedback, regardless of audience size. For those with low self-views, public negative feedback prompted less critical evaluations than private negative feedback. Findings support self-verification theory, which argues that people seek self-confirming feedback even when self-evaluations are negative, and stress the importance of studying individual differences in CMC, particularly to understand the effects of audience in online impression formation.",The Presentation of Selfie in Everyday Life: Self-Presentation and Impression Formation in Instagram and Other Online Contexts,Communication and Technology
2018-1068,2018,Paper Session,European Co-Productions and Greek Cinema Since the Crisis: Extroversion as Survival,1,"The paper will focus on Greek film co-productions since 2010. It will argue that the advent of the financial crisis gave additional impetus to Greek filmmakers to adopt a more ‘extrovert’ approach in seeking transnational financing and creative collaborations, especially with European partners. Such activity refers both to the pursuit of ‘policy-driven official co-productions’ that ‘occur under the auspices of intergovernmental treaties’ (including Eurimages); and to ‘industry-driven co-productions’, i.e. producer-led initiatives not bound by such policy frameworks. (Distinction introduced by the International Coproduction Research Network - www.copro-research-network.org/projects)

The analysis will be situated within a broader constellation of factors that has led to changes in the film production culture in Greece in recent years. These include the international critical recognition of a new cinematic movement indirectly associated with the crisis – the Weird Wave of Greek cinema; the increased networking opportunities for filmmakers, especially in film festivals (esp. the Crossroads co-production forum at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival); and the emergence of a new generation of producers professionally trained in building European co-productions.

The approach will combine quantitative and qualitative methods, with an emphasis on the latter. Quantitatively, it will analyse data from Eurimages since 1989 in order to situate recent developments concerning European co-productions in Greece in a recent historical context. Other forms of co-productions in the earlier period will be accounted more circumstantially, as no comprehensive official national data exists about them. The analysis of the post-2010 period will rely more extensively on qualitative methods, based on accounts of film practice offered in personal interviews with producers and directors, analysis of policy documents, and the production and circulation trajectories of the films themselves.

The examination of European co-productions in the context of Greece contributes to an understanding of the impact of European-wide policies and broader forces of globalisation, on the development of a small national film industry. The intensity of the financial crisis in Greece and the austerity measures that ensued led to a reduction of state financing for cinema, as well as to a severe curtailment of private sources of film funding (as a consequence of the effective bankruptcy of private terrestrial television channels, and the drop in theatrical box office receipts). In such a context, the only available options for filmmakers were either low-budget, guerrilla-style filmmaking (including a recourse to crowdfunding) or co-productions. By focusing on the recent output and activities of a number of Greek production companies, the paper will assess the significance of co-productions in keeping Greek cinema afloat at times of protracted financial crisis.",Studies of Transnational Media Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies
2018-1069,2018,Paper Session,From Transnational Companies Abroad to Cross-Border Activities. Towards a Typology of Media Companies’ Cross-Border Engagement,6,"The cross-border engagement of media companies is an issue in transnational media management research as foreign markets offer additional opportunities for economic expansion and growth. At the same time, media products constitute cultural products that need adaptation to local markets. So far, media business researchers have distinguished activities of media companies referring to these two aspects. Thereby, research has focused on the media company as an entire organization and as a unit of analysis. The intent of this paper is to broaden this perspective by developing a typology of cross-border activities that draws on particular activities and integrates three types of motivations to venture abroad. This approach facilitates the comparison of cross-border engagement across different types of media companies in times of digitized media markets. The typology results from the analysis of a comparably large empirical interview-based qualitative dataset.",Studies of Transnational Media Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies

Through conducting both textual analysis of texts and paratexts of Crossing and discursive analysis of in-depth interviews with its executives and editors, I argue that media professionals working for the platform actively negotiate a variety of cultural flows and attempt to balance asymmetrical power relations between the flows.

Co-produced by Coca Cola company, Coke Studio Pakistan premiered in Pakistan in 2008 and met with unprecedented success. We engage in a postcolonial examination of Coke Studio Pakistan to explore how media cultures challenge dominant cultural assumptions and bring forth alternative rationalities and sensibilities. We find that our media artifact presents Pakistan as a diverse nation with different traditions and languages rather than a monolith understood in terms of Islamic militancy. The movement between local-global, core-periphery, fusion of old and new music, collaboration between mainstream and non-mainstream artistes, images of modern women with agency and authority as opposed to veiled women shown in media, and prevalence of Sufi poetry in Coke Studio Pakistan discursively construct polyvocality of the nation.",Studies of Transnational Media Production and Distribution,Media Industry Studies

Yet, amidst burgeoning debates about human rights and the digital, children’s rights rarely rate a mention or, when considered, focus mainly on protection to the exclusion of other rights and pay little heed to children’s voices. Research shows that children are calling for attention to their rights in relation to the digital environment and, child rights experts are seeking ways to represent them in state and international forums. This paper analyses expert interviews conducted to evaluate a case for the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child for a “General Comment on Children and Digital Media.” The interviews revealed the challenges faced by experts in interpreting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) for the digital age as well as their cautious optimism that a General Comment could prove a helpful mechanism.","Citizens' Voices in Policy: Rights, Protection, Expectations",Communication Law & Policy

Justifying Censorship on the Grounds of Child Protection,3,"This study tries to measure the potential of using the argument of needing to protect vulnerable populations, such as children, to limit freedom of expression in democratic societies. The research presented in this paper was designed and conducted with an understanding that the regulation of speech and access to content is not only a matter of law and legislative interpretations, but also a matter of societal as well as individual’s perceptions such as values and trust levels. Using a survey sample of the Norwegian population, the study finds that 76% of the population agrees with the statement that the protection of weak groups, such as children, is more important than freedom of expression. Logistic regression further reveals that gender, fear of a terrorist attack and a low trust in media are the strongest predictors of agreeing with this statement. We discuss policy implications in democratic societies.","Citizens' Voices in Policy: Rights, Protection, Expectations",Communication Law & Policy

First, mapping people’s responses on to the conceptual pairing of citizens and consumers, we find audiences aligning themselves with citizen interests, even when, often on the surface, they respond to media regulation and institutions with suspicion. Second, we find that complaints that make it to media regulators are just the tip of iceberg. Third, in investigating people’s expectations of actors and institutions in their responses to television content that startles, upsets, or just offends them, we note that it is crucial to treat a conversation on free speech and censorship with caution.

Two datasets representing #BlackLivesMatter and #AliveWhileBlack were examined to explore how message content varies based on topical orientation. A random sample of 600 tweets from each hashtag were classified based on content categories identified in previous scholarly work on collective coping and social movements. Two topic models were developed to further examine content differences between the two hashtags in a larger corpus of tweets. Results show that differences in hashtags can indicate significant differences in the nature of messages embedded in tweets. A χ2 test revealed that distribution of tweets was differed between the two hashtags in six out of eight categories.

2018-1078,2018,Paper Session,The Voices of #MeToo: From Grassroots Activism to a Viral Roar,1,"Following the avalanche of sexual harassment and assault allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, a social awareness and activism project emerged as women and men took to Twitter to add their voices to the growing roar of the #MeToo movement. Twitter became a megaphone for public outcry as women and men, public and private citizens alike responded to the tweet, with responses varying from detailed stories of their experiences to that simple message of “Me Too.” With the attention gathered by the viral movement, it was soon noted that black female activist Tarana Burke actually created an original “Me Too” movement a decade prior to actress Alyssa Milano’s call. This created a compelling new conversation that recalled earlier issues of feminist whitewashing that ignored or diminished issues specific to women of color. This study uses Patricia Hill Collins’ foundational work Black Feminist Thought as well as Kimberle Crenshaw’s concept of intersectionality to explore the power of #MeToo from its genesis to its current viral moment. Applying these ideas to the voices of #MeToo illustrates the intersectional nature of the movement and a legacy of Black women’s activism that gave voice to silenced communities.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

Such online spaces are claimed to be “fertile ground” for feminist activism, which can be seen in the recent emergence of “hashtag feminism,” or the use of social media hashtags to address feminist-identified issues through sharing personal experiences of inequality, constructing counter-discourses, and critiquing popular culture figures and institutions. However, little empirical research examines hashtag feminism and how it might create a space for feminist activism. Through a qualitative case study combining a thematic analysis of 51,577 archived tweets with semi-structured interviews, we explore how the hashtag #WhyIStayed creates a space for feminist activism. More specifically, we apply a postfeminist analytical lens to interrogate the contradictions and complexities of feminist hashtags and contribute to academic and practitioner understandings of hashtags as a site for feminist activism.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

There is also evidence that using these alternatives spaces, women transcended to an extent the gender segregation that exists in traditional public discourses and spaces of Saudi society. The anonymity of Twitter offered women a safe place to deliberate their concerns about male guardianship.

Less is known about the effectiveness of responding to user comments. Two studies were conducted to examine how exemplified accounts in user comments to a news story may influence audience perceptions and the effectiveness of responding to those comments by organizational actors. Respondents reported their perceptions of organizational reputation after viewing different manipulations of a news story. The findings are consistent with exemplification theory and support the notion that that user-generated comments can influence exemplification effects. They also highlight the ability of organizations to reduce those effects through responding to user generated content.

To do so, two surveys among Singaporeans using a fictional workplace gender discrimination crisis context were conducted, one for brand users (N=461) and another for non-brand users (N=277). Scales were developed based on Berger’s (2014) conceptualization of word-of-mouth motives, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to validate the scales. Findings from hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that non-brand users’ information forwarding behavior is driven by two impression management motives (entertainment and identity signaling) and altruism. Meanwhile, brand users’ information forwarding behavior is driven by impression management (entertainment) motive, altruism, and vengeance. Additionally, the referent criteria was a significant predictor of non-brand users’ and brand users’ information forwarding.","Relationships, Brands, Reputation, and Word of Mouth: The Intangible Aspects of Public Relations",Public Relations

The increased use of online channels raises questions to whether corporate reputation plays a similar or even greater role in the online context.
Based on an assessment of the specific factors that separate the e-commerce context from the traditional commerce context, this study aims at exploring the differences in the formation of a reputation, as well as the consequences of a favorable or unfavorable reputation. For this purpose, Walsh and Beatty’s CBR-scale is employed to measure both online and offline customers’ impressions (n=612) of two large fashion retailers in Germany.
Multi-group structural equation modeling identifies differences between the online and offline environment as results indicate that online customers leverage other associations to form reputations.

Using a survey sample of 246 Asian community members, the findings suggested that publics’ problem recognition was positively related to both control mutuality and trust. The finding on involvement was less strong and that on constraint recognition was mixed. Trust emerges to be the stronger indicator of relationship outcomes, empowering the publics on all three perceptional variables. This then was positively related to their communication activeness, especially information attending, permitting, and sharing, the three passive dimensions of communication behaviors. These findings offer important theoretical and practical implications for exploring the antecedents to situational perceptions and community empowerment.

The results of a path analysis show that sport media consumption directly affects team identification and OPR, while duration of being a fan did not significantly influence OPR and had only a small effect on team identification. Moreover, degree of identification and relational perception of an NFL fan directly affected attitudes towards the favorite team. Finally, a person’s attitudes towards the team directly affected the purchase intention of team-related products as well as attendance intention. Among paths in the proposed model, only one path—from attitude to attendance intention—was significantly different between the male and female groups.","Relationships, Brands, Reputation, and Word of Mouth: The Intangible Aspects of Public Relations",Public Relations

Messages directed toward connecting with loved ones and cognitively restructuring the disaster experience were associated with PTS symptoms and posttraumatic growth. Whereas messages confirming disaster reports and assisting with disaster recovery were associated solely with higher levels of posttraumatic growth. Results illustrate the need for robust disaster communication ecologies to facilitate public disaster mental health response and coordination.

2018-1090,2018,Paper Session,Reactions to Zika Case Data: Effects of Data Visualization and Past Occurrence Information,3,"This study examined the effects of data presentation and past occurrence information on participants’ reactions to Zika case data. It compared the effectiveness of two types of thematic maps—the choropleth map and the proportional circle map—with that of tabular data. Thematic maps facilitated performance in spatial oriented understanding of relative risk magnitudes, which required evaluating the data as a whole or comparing relationships in the data, whereas tabular data enhanced performance in symbolic oriented recognition memory of Zika case counts by location, which required extracting discrete data values. Thematic maps were superior to tabular data in facilitating behavioral intentions for risk aversion. The choropleth map was more effective than the proportional circle map in facilitating understanding of relative risk magnitudes, whereas the proportional circle map was more effective than the choropleth map in enhancing risk perception. Past occurrence information increased risk perception and behavioral intention for risk aversion.",Theory and Research in Health Crisis Communication,Health Communication

This study explored how individuals’ threat appraisals (perceived controllability, perceived predictability, and perceived responsibility) and their cognitive (i.e., information seeking) and conative coping (i.e., protective actions) differ by infectious disease threat type (i.e. airborne, bloodborne, foodborne, sexually transmitted, waterborne, or zoonotic/vectorborne) in epidemic situations. Findings revealed that IDT types varied significantly based on individuals’ appraisals of predictability, controllability, and responsibility for different disease types. Across all disease types, however, predictability appeared to be the most impactful factor related to participants’ information seeking and planned protective action taking.",Theory and Research in Health Crisis Communication,Health Communication
2018-1092,2018,Paper Session,Agenda Divergence in a Developing Conflict: a Quantitative Evidence from Ukrainian and Russian TV Newsfeeds,2,"Although conflict representation in media has been widely studied, few attempts have been made to perform large-scale comparisons of agendas in the media of conflicting parties, especially for armed country-level confrontations. In this paper, we introduce quantitative evidence of agenda divergence between the media of conflicting parties in the course of the Ukrainian crisis 2013-2014. Using 45,000 messages from the online newsfeeds of a Russian and a Ukrainian TV channels, we perform topic modelling coupled with qualitative analysis to reveal crisis-related topics, assess their salience and map evolution of attention of both channels to each of those topics. We find that the two channels produce fundamentally different agenda sequences: in particular, while the Russian channel pays little attention to confrontation between the Ukrainian government and the opposition before the regime change, the Ukrainian channel is less inclined to cover armed violence in East Ukraine and refugees after the regime change.",New Research on Agenda Setting,Political Communication

It focuses on France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands for the period 2005-2016. Based on insights from political agenda setting and media effects research it expects multi-directional relationships to be present. Parliamentary records and newspaper archives are used to analyse the monthly amount of attention for the crisis. Pooled time series fixed effects models and vector autoregression analyses are used to demonstrate that indeed, politicians, journalists and citizens depend on each other, but also that remarkable cross-national differences exist. In the countries where the economy was severely damaged by the crisis (France and Spain) consumer confidence exerted the strongest influence, while in the countries that were less affected by the crisis (Germany and the Netherlands) newspaper coverage was leading.",New Research on Agenda Setting,Political Communication

But why? This paper investigates one relevant factor: intermedia agenda setting between digital-native and legacy press news entities. Through a content analysis of the top-five digital-native and top-five legacy press online news entities from 2014 to 2015, we investigate the dynamics of intermedia agenda setting in the context of transgender topics, both at the level of attention to transgender topics in general and at the level of attention to specific issues related to the transgender community (e.g., anti-transgender violence). Results indicate significant causal effects of digital-native coverage on legacy press coverage at the level of general attention to transgender topics. However, results also indicate that at the level of specific transgender issues, digital-native coverage drives legacy press coverage on some issues, which legacy press coverage drives digital-native coverage on others. Implications for intermedia agenda setting in the digital news media environment and for the future of transgender political rights movements are discussed.",New Research on Agenda Setting,Political Communication

To account for between-issue differences in likelihood and strength of agenda-setting effects, it explores the impact of intensity of baseline coverage and the momentum of news waves on agenda-setting effects. It concludes that agenda-setting effects grow more likely and stronger the higher the baseline amount of coverage and the higher the momentum of news waves.

However, little empirical evidence has supported this idea. Additional challenge in media literacy research involves conceptual and methodological differences across existing literacy scales, including media, information, news, and digital literacy. To address this issue, this study evaluated the predictive power of various literacy scales for fake news identification. The results revealed that information literacy, but not other literacy scales predicted the accurate identification of fake news. To interpret the results, we provided both conceptual and methodological explanations.

It is easy to presume that Fake News begins as a qualitative classification that is primarily dependent on the veracity or falsity of specific media content. I am convinced that the classification of Fake News is not a function of truthfulness. Instead, it is a residual classification for media content that has been instrumentalized to influence politics, independently of whether or not it is substantiated by political reality. Furthermore, Fake News is not the domain of a particular ideological positionality; it is not a right versus left phenomenon. Instead, the category itself is a cultural artifact that corresponds to a broader contemporary crisis within Western liberal democracies.",Media Scholars' Consideration of Fake News,Mass Communication
2018-1099,2018,Paper Session,Confessions of a Fake News Scholar,1,"Should we talk about “fake news”? According to several observers, we shouldn’t as this notion is vague, politically dangerous; indistinguishable from past misinformation; charged with a simplistic idea of truth, and missing the most important features of its referent.
Such feature is not deceptiveness, but virality – the capacity to pollute media public debate by spreading and transforming. But if virality is the defining features of fake news, then isn’t their critique another way of propagating the infection? Yes and no. Yes, if we stop at the critique. No, if we exploit it to encourage a media inquiry.
Because of their simplicity, exaggeration, diffusion, rapid reproduction and mutation, fake news may be the drosophila of media studies – the little fly, which revolutionised genetic mapping for reasons similar to the ones just listed.
In this paper, I will exemplify the research opportunities offered by viral news by discussing my recent Field Guide to Fake News (http://fakenews.publicdatalab.org) and two case-studies from the French election.",Media Scholars' Consideration of Fake News,Mass Communication

Our study considers the effects of people’s cognitive as well as their affective involvement on HMPs. As the media landscape has changed fundamentally since HMPs were initially identified, we also explore the role of social media more profoundly. In addition, this article not only examines the direct effects of involvement and communication variables, but tests for indirect effects of involvement mediated through media use and interpersonal communication. Using data simultaneously collected from two online surveys conducted in Germany and Switzerland, the findings strengthen previous evidence that affective involvement is a stronger predictor than cognitive involvement on HMPs. In contrast, media use and interpersonal communication had only marginal direct effects. Finally, our study provides first evidence for indirect effects of involvement mediated through interpersonal communication.","Influences on Hostile Media Perceptions: Exploring The Effects of Social Media, Discussion, Involvement and Exposure",Political Communication
2018-1101,2018,Paper Session,"Following Politicians on Social Media, Affect, and Hostile Media Perceptions",5,"Hostile media perceptions—partisans’ beliefs that media are biased against their side—are prominent today but surprisingly little research has examined whether and how social media contribute to these perceptions. This study addresses these questions by examining whether following politicians’ social media feeds is linked to hostile media perceptions. We argue that politicians’ feeds may indirectly encourage beliefs that the media are biased by evoking affective responses in the audience. We test this possibility using two-wave panel survey data collected in the U.S. during the 2016 presidential election. We find that individuals who more frequently followed politicians on social media were more likely to be angry about the state of the country and were more enthusiastic about their supported candidate, both of which were subsequently related to hostile media perceptions. Our findings suggest hostile media perceptions can arise from using social media and are enhanced by both positive and negative affective states.","Influences on Hostile Media Perceptions: Exploring The Effects of Social Media, Discussion, Involvement and Exposure",Political Communication
2018-1102,2018,Paper Session,Is My Friend’s Enemy Also My Enemy? The Spillover Effect of Interpersonal Discussions on Hostile Media Bias Perceptions,3,"More than a decade ago, Eveland and Shah (2003) published a study on the impact of social networks on media bias perceptions in the US, showing that individuals with like-minded interpersonal networks are more prone to hostile media perceptions; particularly those who hold right-wing views. Since then, little has been researched about the interpersonal antecedents of perceived media bias. In this study we address this gap by investigating the role of safe, or like-minded, political discussions on individuals’ likelihood to perceive media as hostile. We use survey data from more than 5,000 individuals in Germany, and account for both individual and situational factors. Our findings reveal that being located in social settings sharing political views increases the likelihood to perceive hostile media bias, particularly among those who are more engaged and ideologically to the left. The implications of our results for the study of spill-over communication effects are discussed.","Influences on Hostile Media Perceptions: Exploring The Effects of Social Media, Discussion, Involvement and Exposure",Political Communication

However, most of these experiments rely on single-shot exposure and cannot mimic the effects of media bias in a world where consumers encounter news everywhere. This study exposes users to a manipulated online news portal for a week to approximate repeated exposure to a diversity of media. We randomly assign individuals to non-partisan and partisan news streams and find that repeatedly dosing partisans with out-party media attenuates the effects of hostile media perceptions towards Fox News, but not MSNBC. Our results improve exposure measures and contribute to our understanding of media bias in an environment characterized by minimal effects.","Influences on Hostile Media Perceptions: Exploring The Effects of Social Media, Discussion, Involvement and Exposure",Political Communication
2018-1104,2018,Paper Session,"Science, Politics, and the Public: Do Frames Affect Attitudes Towards Science?",5,"By selecting some aspects of a research project and making them more or less salient, politicians, journalists, and researchers routinely use frames when communicating to lay publics about the pros and cons of science. This experiment (N = 170) embedded stimuli articles with different message frames (3: political/journalistic/researcher frames) and types of science research (2: “hard”/“soft”) to examine effects on people’s attitudes towards the featured project’s utility and worthiness of federal grant funding. Overall, political frames suppressed ratings of the project’s utility, and while researcher frames produced greater utility ratings compared to journalistic frames for soft science projects, this pattern was reversed for hard science research. Individual differences in political ideology and interest in science also affected attitudinal ratings. Additionally, frames influenced people’s comprehension of articles they read. We discuss results in light of framing theory and conclude with brief practical recommendations for those engaging in science communication.","Science, Media, and Public",Mass Communication

We identify the PCST activities that the scientists have engaged in. This study also explores the forms of communication training that scientists have undergone, and would prefer to attend. Five focus group discussions were conducted with scientists across various scientific disciplines. The findings revealed that scientists were mainly deterred by their lack of time and institutional restrictions. Meanwhile, scientists were motivated by extrinsic rewards (e.g., securing research funds). Across the major themes, differences were observed among scientists with varying levels of seniority, institutional affiliations, and PCST experience. Notably, scientists suggested that communication practitioners should undergo science education training to minimize misrepresentations of research findings. Theoretical, conceptual, and practical implications, as well as directions for future research were discussed.","Science, Media, and Public",Mass Communication

These models reflect the process of change that has occurred, and is continuing, in the understanding of democratic society. They can be described as representative, deliberative and participatory conceptions of the public sphere, and they correspond to a shift in science communication, from ""public understanding of science"" to ""public engagement with science"", and then to ""public participation in scientific research."" Taking Austria as an example, multivariate analysis of representative survey data reveals the participatory conception as the only approach that increases public interest in science to a significant degree, thus providing legitimacy for scientific research.","Science, Media, and Public",Mass Communication
2018-1107,2018,Paper Session,Framing Responsibility in Online News About Climate Change,4,"This paper explores the effect of responsibility attributions in online news about climate change in two experimental studies. Climate communication is a relevant topic for responsibility frames in the news, since the reader is directly affected by the problem and also asked to engage in climate mitigation. In Study 1 responsibility attributions in an online news article (individual responsibility, political responsibility and non-point responsibility) are manipulated. Paradoxically, an individual responsibility frame does not affect perceptions of individual responsibility but decreases norm perceptions. Study 2 specifies the effect of individual responsibility attributions. Combining an individual responsibility frame with information about climate friendly engagement of others (descriptive norm) in user comments increases intentions for climate friendly behavior through perceptions of individual responsibility and social norms. In contrast, information about others' disengagement negatively affects intentions for climate friendly behavior.","Science, Media, and Public",Mass Communication
2018-1108,2018,Paper Session,Privacy Principles and Technological Affordances Shaping Employees’ Information Sharing in Enterprise Social Media,2,"This paper presents a qualitative study on employees’ perceptions of information sharing in enterprise social media (ESM). The study is based on interview and ESM review data from a large, Nordic media industry organization. Our findings contribute to communication privacy management theory (Petronio, 2002) and to the literature on technological affordances by showing how privacy management principles and technological affordances explain information sharing behavior of employees in ESM. We found that privacy management principles shape the information sharing behavior of the employees for four reasons: personal privacy boundaries, overall technological privacy and online safety, professional roles and responsibilities, and the perceived audience. Technological affordances of visibility, association, awareness, persistence, and searchability shape the employees information sharing in varying, sometimes even contradicting ways. Additionally, organizational norms and ESM culture, the structure of information in ESM, achieving goals, as well as technological competence and familiarity of the platform affect the information sharing.","B.E.S.T.

During change, input is solicited from stakeholders and lower level employees for several reasons. However, little is known about the specific manner in which input is solicited and used. Past studies have talked about the importance of design in shaping input and voice, but the importance of design features have been left unexplored. This study used a case study approach to investigate the beneficial and problematic features of the architecture of input solicitation during a planned organizational change related to nurses in a medical center. The study sought to identify the important design features of input solicitation and the implications they had for the stakeholders—both implementers of change and providers of input. The study found that designs of solicitation altered the quality of input provided, where self-censorship started at the bottom of the organization.","B.E.S.T.

2018-1110,2018,Paper Session,When Failure is the Only Option: How Framing Resources Organizational Innovation,3,"Innovation is increasingly valued by organizations seeking opportunities for growth and survival in a competitive marketplace. However, encouraging investment and engagement in innovation is difficult because innovation presents contradictions for organizations and workers who must make choices between novel courses of action and pursuing an established path. One fundamental contradiction is that most efforts at innovation end in failure, meaning pursuing innovation carries tremendous potential risk. This study examines how individuals responsible for encouraging and facilitating innovation communicate about the relationship between innovation and failure. Data from interviews reveals that these workers communicate in a way that frames failure as a potential benefit for the organization. This framing is enacted communicatively through a variety of language tools, a mindset aligned with the frame, and the development of organizational strategy that communicatively supports this framing. These findings indicate the central role communication has in constituting innovation practices in organizations.","B.E.S.T. Session: Knowledge, Innovation, and Media",Organizational Communication

It first reviews and synthesizes the extant research addressing the integration of social media into the recruitment and hiring process and subsequent effects on hiring decisions. It then applies two theoretical mechanisms as examples to explain how and why employers use social media to reduce their uncertainty and make informed decisions about applicants, ultimately deriving seven empirically-testable propositions to guide the immediate future of the research. Social media’s integration into the selection process is receiving increased attention; but the emergence of research in this burgeoning area is challenged to keep up with the technological and organizational advances on which they are built.

2018-1112,2018,Paper Session,Knowledge Integration in Crowdsourcing for Innovation: The Temporal Effects of Different Types of Knowledge Contribution,2,"Organizations are increasingly using crowdsourcing to generate innovative solutions. With a focus beyond incentivizing or attracting participants, knowledge sharing in crowdsourcing plays a key role in leading up to successful outcomes of innovation. Our focus of this study is to examine the impacts of time and various types of knowledge contribution on crowd-sourced innovation. We suggest that different types of knowledge can lead to differential innovative outcomes due to temporal factors. By analyzing 21 organization-partnered crowdsourcing open challenges in which both those in the crowd who eventually integrated shared knowledge into solutions and those who did not integrate the three types of knowledge were observed, we show that the innovativeness of an integrated solution is positively related to: 1) more paradoxes contributed by non-integrators prior to emergence of integrated solutions, 2) less wild ideas shared by non-integrators, and 3) time elapsed between the non-integrators’ sharing of assumptions and the posting of the integrative solution by integrators. Implications for crowdsourcing theory are drawn from temporal effects of knowledge contribution on integrated innovation emerging from the crowd.","B.E.S.T.

It explores a 2015 South Korean protest movement for which protesters actively communicated credibility and legitimacy by appropriating traditional media contents on their personal posts. The study identifies four types of legitimation enabled by the appropriation of traditional media contents: source credentials, warranting values, responsiveness, and quality enhancement. The results suggest that activists who were affiliated to formal organizations differed from those unaffiliated in that the affiliated activists felt more compelled to expand their influences beyond their network boundaries, whereas the unaffiliated activists confined their targets to personal networks. In close relation to these differences, the organizationally affiliated activists legitimized their voices to a greater degree than the unaffiliated activists in order to mobilize a greater diversity of participants.","B.E.S.T.

The results of analyses of variance and covariance indicated immigrant workers’ acculturation type and mobile usage for work were significantly and distinctively associated with their various perceptions and communication of temporality (e.g., time being scarce, plentiful, short- vs. long-term perspective, organized, unscheduled, rigid, and hurried). Participants with segregated form of acculturation seemed to struggle with adapting to the monochronic orientation of the US workplace whereas those with integrated form of acculturation did not necessarily perceive time in their workplace as scarce and communicated about their actions in relation to time as more organized way.","B.E.S.T.

In numerous domains, however, formal data on market categories is not available. Our paper uses social tagging data to track the features that products include. We draw on methodologies from the fields of data mining and network analysis to group tags together into clusters of closely related elements. These implicit categories describe the unarticulated norms of style and content that shape buyer behavior in an online marketplace, even when these categories are not explicitly defined. As a predictor of sales, we demonstrate implicit categories operate just as formal categories do; more conventional combinations of tags lead to higher sales than those with more unusual, boundary-spanning sets of tags. This finding implies that the power of categories to structure markets and the negative impacts of spanning these categories are apparent even when the boundaries themselves are not.","B.E.S.T.

Furthermore, public relations researchers continue to center the interest of an organization in social capital research. This paper is designed to explore (a) whether public relations practices in social media build social capital among the publics that organizations serve, and (b) how the increased social capital is positively associated with civic engagement in a local community context. The results of a national survey (N=570) showed that public engagement with organizations’ social media is positively associated with bonding and bridging social capital. Bridging social capital was found to increase trust in the local community and civic engagement.

Traditional approaches focus on community engagement as short-term event-based episodes of interaction. This paper proposes two further forms of community engagement in addition to the episodic: relational and synergistic. Relational community engagement demonstrates an ongoing organizational commitment to maintaining and enhancing community relationships through lower intensity yet longer forms of engagement that bring both social and organizational benefits. Synergistic community engagement combines both the episodic and relational forms into a hybrid in which episodes of interaction draw on the social capital generated out of relational engagement.

An online experiment was designed with a 2 (number of likes: low vs. high) × 2 (gap between the number of likes and the number of shares: narrow vs. wide) between-subjects design. Counterintuitive effects were detected. A large number of likes displayed under a nonprofit organization’s Facebook post that featured a fundraising cause led to a less amount of public donations compared with a small number of likes when the gap between the number of likes and that of shares was narrow. Decreased self-perceived contribution in the given fundraising event was discovered as the mediator, which explained the effect.

Driver education interventions directed at males are less likely to succeed than those directed at females, and stronger optimistic bias and overconfidence bias have been implicated as likely reasons. We report results from a quasi-experiment conducted in Serbia, targeting male and female adolescents. Stratified by size, forty schools were randomly assigned to either a personal-narrative intervention or a no-intervention control arm. Data were collected before the intervention (N = 1,449) and again six months later (N = 1,072). Risk perceptions improved for both males and females, and injunctive norms improved for females. Improvements in overconfidence bias and descriptive norms were predictive of improvements in high-risk driving behaviors.

2018-1123,2018,Paper Session,Manipulating Character Vulnerability and Victim/Other Perspective in First-Person Narratives of Foodborne Illness,2,"This study examined the effects of narrative perspective (victim’s vs. other’s perspective) and victim vulnerability (high vs. low) in an autobiographical account of contracting foodborne illness (salmonella) because of careless preparation. Narrative perspective and character vulnerability did not directly influence audience members’ risk perception or their intention to perform risk-reducing behaviors. However, participants were more likely to egocentrically project their own mental status into the character’s mind and identify with the story character after reading the high-vulnerability victim’s account. Identification with the character increased but egocentric projection decreased audience members’ perceived seriousness of foodborne illness risk and their behavioral intention to perform safe food-handling practices.

Two controlled experimental studies test this hypothesis in the context of organic tobaccos, one using discrete emotions (Study 1, n = 385) and the second valence-based ones (Study 2, n = 586).The emotional shifts in the appropriate conditions were observed by participants but shifts did not appear to increase engagement with plots or characters, at least in the short narratives tested here.

To examine this issue, this study conducted a 2 (perceived similarity vs no perceived similarity) X 2 (sympathy vs pride) between-subjects factorial experiment to examine how perceived similarity affects emotional appeals in organ donation messages. The results revealed that regardless of emotional appeals, perceived similarity drives people’s intention to promote organ donation campaign and being an organ donor. Furthermore, no matter exposed to which type of emotional appeal message, perceived similarity induces both more sympathy and pride, which indicates a mixed altruistic and egoistic motivation in organ donation intention. These findings offer important theoretical and applied implications for future research.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narratives and Health Communication,Health Communication

The more openly Fisher was perceived as disclosing, the lower stigma reported by people who did not have a mental health condition. Perceiving that her disclosures had lowered public stigma was associated with lower stereotypes and social distance, and greater willingness to seek treatment. Identification with Fisher was associated with lower stereotypes, but only for those with a mental health condition, suggesting lowered self-stigma. Finally, emotional responses to her interviews/writing suggest that compassion lowered social distance and that her humor may have increased comfort about seeking treatment. Implications of the findings for media and celebrity health disclosures are discussed.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narratives and Health Communication,Health Communication

We predicted when audience members feel socially excluded, they are less likely to share a narrative obesity message than a non-narrative one, since their desire to connect with others can be more satisfied by reading a narrative message than by reading a non-narrative message. An online experiment (N = 359) with a 3 (social exclusion: rejected, ignored, control) X 2 (message type: narrative, non-narrative) between-subjects design supported our predictions. The participants in the ignored and rejected conditions were less likely to share a narrative than a non-narrative message, while those in the control condition showed no difference. Furthermore, increased empathy with a character in the narrative was associated with decreased desire to share the narrative message when participants experienced rejection.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narratives and Health Communication,Health Communication

Traditionally, Washington journalism has been unwelcoming to women; women continue to face ample gender discrimination even at the most prestigious news organizations. However, previous analysis of political journalism suggested that Twitter might soften beltway insularity. Given the importance of Twitter to journalism as a whole and to beltway journalism in the age of Trump, we sought to explore the gender dynamics of beltway journalists on Twitter.

Relatively few studies, however, investigate whether news articles that discuss women as a politically underrepresented group drive gender differences in political engagement. We develop a theoretical framework to explain how and why news coverage about the role and experiences of women in politics decrease women’s interest but increase men’s interest in pursuing a political career. We track the effect of messages that highlight the exclusion or inclusion of women in politics through a series of unique survey experiments using national samples of adults. We find that messages emphasizing women’s political exclusion lead to differential effects among women and men. In particular, we demonstrate that messages about the political discrimination and exclusion of women in politics lead men to feel more positive and optimistic about the benefits of holding office while women feel more negative about the prospect of pursuing a political career.",Journalism and Gender,Journalism Studies

A Qualitative Look at the Gender Gap in News Avoidance,2,"Using in-depth interviews with 43 individuals in the United Kingdom who say they rarely or never access conventional news sources, we find that news reception is often viewed through a gendered lens, and that gender roles influence news consumption habits. We document considerable evidence supporting two of the main explanations for gender gaps in news consumption suggested by previous mainly quantitative research: role socialization and structural inequalities. We explore those dynamics by analyzing three gendered themes that arose in our interviews: (1) “news-is-for-men” perceptions, (2) gendered household divisions of labor in the consumption of news, and (3) the importance of caretaking as an obstacle to staying up-to-date with news. In our sample, these dynamics contributed to extreme news consumption patterns—that is, near-total news avoidance—but they provide helpful clues to how less extreme gender gaps in news consumption and political engagement more broadly are continually reproduced.",Journalism and Gender,Journalism Studies
2018-1131,2018,Paper Session,If it Bleeds it Leads: Coverage of Violence Against Women and Sexual and Reproductive Health in the Argentine Press,2,"This paper examines newspaper coverage of two issues of paramount relevance to the women’s rights movement: sexual and reproductive health and violence against women, from 1995 until 2015, in two print newspapers from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Content analysis shows that while coverage of violence against women increased over the 20 year period, coverage of sexual and reproductive health did not. Moreover, drawing on framing theory, content analysis indicates that, regardless of the level of coverage, throughout the period examined, articles on these topics tended to eschew a gender equality approach, and to be framed in episodic, rather than thematic frames. Finally, articles about violence against women are significantly less likely to use either the equality frame or the thematic frame than stories about sexual and reproductive health. This paper draws on these findings to reflect on the relevance of portraying these issues as social concerns with impact in gender equality.",Journalism and Gender,Journalism Studies

The Role of Emotions in Information Processing of News Stories,3,"Emotional reactions to news stories have been found to play an important role in the way recipients process the reported information (e.g., Lee & Lang; Nabi, 2003). For news stories that use emotional elements it is expected that the elicited emotion with its core relational theme and action tendency influences attention, memory, relevance assessment and policy preference. To examine the role of emotions in information processing of news stories, an online experiment was conducted (N = 330) manipulating emotional appeal of content and depictions. Emotional reaction was considered as a mediating mechanism between emotionally appealing news stories and audiences’ information processing and opinion formation. Anger had a positive effect on attention, relevance assessment and policy preference but not on memory. Hence, emotional reactions to news stories seem to influence information processing and opinion formation in an emotion-congruent direction.",HIGH-DENSITY: Processing News and Misinformation in Digital Age,Information Systems

By employing a model to test cognitive heuristic use proposed by Bellur & Sundar (2014), we sought to not only gauge the influence of three design cues on consumers’ credibility judgments, but also directly test the extent to which the cues influenced credibility by triggering one of two established cognitive heuristics -- namely the expectancy violation heuristic and the realism heuristic. The results showed that design cues indicating low content quality, image resolution, or poor oversight of online advertising led to lower evaluations of news story credibility, although there was no support for the realism or expectancy violation heuristics serving as mediators.

Results show that second screening negatively impacts factual recognition and program liking, regardless of presentation mode. While cued recall of information was lower in the second screen conditions than in the single screen condition, participants in the condition with presented information scored significantly higher on cued recall compared to the look-up condition.

2018-1139,2018,Paper Session,Considering Moral Foundations Theory in the Context of Child and Adolescent Development,2,"Theorizing about moral judgment and reasoning posits that these stem from the experience of at least one of six cognitive moral foundations. Concomitantly, work has examined how media use influences moral development among children and adolescents. To date, however, these lines of research remain unintegrated. Specifically, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) is adevelopmental: while arguing for the existence of six different moral foundations, the theory does not consider how human development may influence the relative salience of these foundations. We argue that MFT is a useful tool for sorting and contextualizing past findings; thus, we review the extant work on media and child and adolescent morality, sorting it into categories based on MFT. Secondly, we review theories of human development to integrate these with MFT. In all, this paper will help researchers to understand how human development and media can influence moral foundation salience, with implications for understanding effects of exposure.","Lessons From Media: Connection, Careers, and Community",Children Adolescents and the Media

It is important to investigate this phenomenon, as it may not only have a devastating impact on the celebrity, but also influence bystanders’ perceptions of acceptable online behavior. The current study empirically investigated the relationship between two socio-cognitive characteristics (empathy and moral disengagement) and online celebrity aggression. The sample consisted of 1,255 adolescents with a mean age of 14.17 years (SD= .47). Participants completed the Moral Disengagement Scale adapted to a celebrity context, the Emotional Quotient and a scale measuring mild and severe online celebrity aggression. Path analysis indicated that, when controlling for gender, moral disengagement predicted mild and severe online celebrity aggression. Emotional reactivity and cognitive empathy were only associated with severe online celebrity aggression. Moreover, moral disengagement was a mediator between emotional reactivity and both mild and severe celebrity aggression.","Lessons From Media: Connection, Careers, and Community",Children Adolescents and the Media

The results showed that even though the media content was identical, participants who viewed uncivil comments from virtual co-viewers (vs. civil comments) perceived that the media content had negative influence in general, and subsequently reported greater perceived influence of the media content on others than themselves (i.e., greater TPP). Those presented with the short distance social TV interface (vs. long distance interface) reported greater psychological distance to virtual co-viewers, but such effects were observed only when the comments were uncivil. Psychological distance to virtual co-viewers was significantly associated with TPP.","Cognitive Processes and Online Media Use: Norms, Priming, and Third Person Effects",Communication and Technology

Using a sample (N=613) from Amazon Mturk, the current research documented firm support for the perceptual and behavioral components of TPE in the context of Internet privacy. Respondents perceive greater Internet privacy risks on others than on themselves. The perceptual discrepancy of Internet privacy risks between self and others increases their willingness to recommend protective measures to others but decreases their willingness to adopt the protective measures. Next, the current study examined the five potential antecedents of third person perception. Social distance, perceived Internet privacy knowledge, negative online privacy experiences, and the activity of Internet uses were found to be significant predictors of TPE perceptions about Internet privacy risks. The findings of the current study indicated that third person perception is one of the major barriers for people to adopt protective measures.","Cognitive Processes and Online Media Use: Norms, Priming, and Third Person Effects",Communication and Technology

We conducted two studies to test whether thoughts of social media friends could also produce such an effect, and if so, why. Our data show that the mere thought of friends in one’s social media networks can make individuals perceive real-world challenges as less challenging and real-world threats as less threatening. The effect is attributable to both perceived social support and impression concerns associated with the presence of friends. Impression concern associated with offline networks, where impression management is more effortful, made the task appear more difficult, whereas that associated with online network led individuals to perceive themselves as more capable in the face of challenges and disasters.

In this paper, we focus the outpouring of grief in response to mass violence and the subsequent contestation over gun policy on Twitter, tracing these discourses to features of the tragic event. By measuring Twitter discourses with two distinct approaches that yielded highly consistent results and applying time-series modeling, we find that the characteristics of mass shooting victims affect the levels of collective grieving and gun policy discussions, highlighting the unfortunate fact that not all lives are equally valued and grievable by society. Additionally, the dynamics of responses to mass violence differ, with expressions of sympathy and discussions on gun policy more ephemeral and the second amendment gun rights discourse much more sustained.",Social Media and Communication About/During Crises and Natural Disasters,Communication and Technology

Based on a uses-and-gratification framework and terror management theory, the present study investigates the causal impact of motivation to maintain and strengthen close ties on the promotion of mobile voice calls. Specifically, we utilized the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 and investigated whether the motivation exogenously intensified by the disaster causally promoted voice calls. Study1 found that voice calls were promoted after the earthquake compared with beforehand, which was particularly dramatic in areas where there were severe tremors and calls placed to close ties. Study2 demonstrated that psychologically priming the earthquake led to an increase in the number of voice calls with close ties.

The four types of peripheral cues were assessed using the latest computational linguistic framework LIWC. Findings show that information sharing is positively associated with peripheral cues that reflect a confident, self-revealing and emotional language style, and is negatively related to the presence of angry and informal tone.

As theorized by Habermas, the public sphere situates the social experience, activities, and expectations of political representation. However, Habermas’s theory of the public sphere carries with it normative claims about democratic participation and representation. These theories elevate discourse, conversation, and opinion-making in the process of legitimating political representation, yet neglect aesthetic and symbolic features of political representation. This is a blindspot in his theory that does not account for behaviors, expectations, and tendencies within the public sphere that could lead to populist tendencies even within a democratic system.

Journalists accomplish this by: a) presenting events as if they had pre-established and immutable order and meaning, and b) setting this order and this meaning within the reference system specific to religious ritual and myth. Within this framework, meanings appear as already existing (they precede the event), and those who report the sequence of facts and their meaning appear as agents of an extra-mundane ‘truth’. The ritualization of the journalistic performance and the mythologisation of the representation of the events enable journalists to exert a ritual mastery over the process of building a version of the reality and to present themselves as lithurgic officiants and apostles of the event.",Publics and Their Problems,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Assuming that capitalism has increasingly subsumed more spheres of social life, and that it has mainly achieved so through the valorization of information and communication, the paper proposes translation as twofold historical-materialist perspective in order to make communication practices a terrain of critique of labour and political associationism. First, looking at knowledge labor, I use the notion of translatability to identify reciprocal translation among social phenomena, in order to detect an important hegemonic process. Second, looking at the Spanish political party-movement Podemos, I consider a politics of translation performed by knowledge workers which, in this particular case, aims at dialectically sublating economic interests into political praxis and create a collective will through a ‘chain of equivalence.’",Publics and Their Problems,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Finally, we observe how these different types of false information and forgeries were used during the 2017 French presidential election, culminating in the so-called “Macronleaks” and how some actors deconstructed them.

The current study aims to investigate whether playing a game in VR leads to stronger feelings of presence than playing on a TV, and if these feelings of presence affect emotional responses to the game. An experiment was held among 59 students, comparing the effects of playing a horror game in VR versus TV on heart rate variability, fear, aggravation and enjoyment. Results showed that playing a game in VR generally resulted in a stronger sense of spatial presence, which caused lower heart rate variability and a higher subjective sense of fear. Game enjoyment was also higher in VR, but only among males. No differences in aggravation were found.

Then, we measured how closely they approached another avatar (i.e., interpersonal distance) as an unobtrusive measure of attraction. The roles of spatial presence and perceived realism were also considered. Our findings replicated the original study, but also lend support for TMT-based explanations. We discuss the viability of using virtual reality to explore near-death experiences and other phenomena.","Keeping it Virtually Real, Realizing the Virtual Appeal",Game Studies
2018-1158,2018,Paper Session,Learning Through Embodied Experiences: Segmentation as a Tool to Support Recall in Immersive Virtual Environments,3,"Research suggests that spatial presence in immersive virtual environments (IVEs) leads to favorable outcomes on persuasion, though some the efficiency framework argues that increased cues and presence may distract from learning or outcome success. A recommended approach to reduce cognitive load while learning through a multimedia platform has been segmentation, or breaking mediated content into bite-size chunks. The effect of segmentation on recall of material presented as an embodied experience in IVE was compared against a continuous IVE experience (N = 229). Results confirmed that segmentation may be an effective tool to increase recall of information presented during embodied experiences, but females recalled more after the continuous experience and males recalled more after the segmented experience. Overall, segmentation led to perceptions of ease in information processing but had a negative relationship with recall. We discuss the juxtaposition of spatial presence and recall in the context IVE experiences.","Keeping it Virtually Real, Realizing the Virtual Appeal",Game Studies
2018-1159,2018,Paper Session,"True Presence, Finally: The Effect of Virtual Reality on Video Game Enjoyment",3,"RESEARCH PAPER. The contribution of VR technology to video gamers’ enjoyment was tested in an experiment (N = 61) with players of a space combat game (“Eve: Valkyrie”). Based on past research in games and virtual reality, Presence was hypothesized to mediate the positive influence of VR on player enjoyment. Participants were randomly assigned to either play the game with PlayStation VR equipment or while sitting in front of a conventional flat screen display. After exposure to the game for about 4:30 min, participants filled in self-report measures of Presence (SPES: Hartmann et al., 2016) and enjoyment. Findings demonstrate a massive effect of VR technology on Presence, a moderate effect on enjoyment, and a relevant indirect effect of VR on enjoyment mediated through Presence (self-location, cf. Wirth et al., 2007). VR is discussed as both amplifier of well-known elements of game entertainment and as possible source of new dimensions of positive player experiences such as awe.","Keeping it Virtually Real, Realizing the Virtual Appeal",Game Studies

However, approximately 70% of all digital transformation projects fail. Research and practice are therefore searching for ways to avoid these failures. Gamification is constructed by applying game elements to a non-game context, in order to create motivational affordance that signals gamefulness. This study explores how gamification, from a communication perspective, can be used within organisations to support change processes linked to digitalisation and IT-systems use. To understand how gamification can be used in an organizational change process, change communication, sense-making, and human psychology theories are combined in an interdisciplinary theoretical framework. A qualitative approach was chosen and the empirical data is gathered through semi-structured interviews with gamification experts and representatives from two case organisations. The conclusion implies that gamification can be used to engage and motivate employees and to help organisations adapt to a more digitalised way of operation.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

An Examination of the Effectiveness of Listening to Surbordinates on Organisational Performance: A Study of Busoga University,1,"In many cases, managers are known to be poor and ineffective listeners (Rayudu, 2010). Managers are used to giving orders to their subordinates, and therefore listening would render them demoted and it also hurts their ego. Managers are fond of listening to their own voices. The major channels of management communication are talking and listening. No matter what the intention of each manager who engages in these activities, the information they produce and the insight that follows from them can be put to work the same day to achieve organisational and personal objectives. The Critical Communication theory points out how communication practices within organisations play a big role in influencing decision making, because corporations have become political, as well as economic institutions, and therefore workplaces can become more productive by embracing communication reforms. This study seeks to find out if listening to subordinates has an effect on how organisations perform.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

Nevertheless, many advocates use narratives to strengthen their support base, with storylines using humanising frames. This is connected to growing research interest in organisational narrative as an influential discursive device to influence the actions of stakeholders, though little is known about the process by which stakeholders respond to and act on these narratives. This research seeks to address this gap through a qualitative case study of an asylum seeker advocacy campaign. By assuming a sensemaking/sensegiving lens, it will explore how different types of stakeholders react to and act on the organisational narratives designed to influence them through a series of workshops during the campaign. Using a uniquely interpretive and discursive approach to questions of influence will contribute theoretically to understanding stakeholder engagement and the interplay between identity, understanding and action.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

It is part of a larger project, examining how social media technologies are implicated in labor struggles in the neoliberal political economy. The discourse on Facebook pages related to unionization efforts in three mobile telephony companies in Israel is studied. Preliminary analysis reveals that the union was initiated through a discourse embedded in the individualized, competitive, spirit of neoliberalism. Hence, the workers' collective voice may be interpreted as an instance of shared self-representation. Three discursive practices were identified: Deliberating about the right to speak in the name of the collective; intensively discussing competing narratives; and, adopting a toolkit of personalized conversational formats. It is suggested that integrating such social media discursive practices into the institutionalized organizational communication may potentially further construct the organizational discourse.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

Many of the change models start with a break from the past and this can create feelings of loss, powerlessness and separation among employees. Through duoethnographic inquiry, a practitioner/doctoral candidate and academic/supervisor participate in conversation on a case study in which the feeling of belonging emerged as being relevant to employees in preparing them for change. In a script style text, the writers share their experiences, as thoughts, ideas and feelings, on different ways of communicating belonging in organizational change. Through this process, open spaces are created for other voices to question past meanings and invite possible reconceptualizations of meta-narratives around practice.

2018-1172,2018,Paper Session,Communicating in Space: A Discourse Analysis of Open-Plan Offices,1,"Open-plan offices were introduced in the 1950s to promote collaboration (Kim & de Dear, 2013), and reduce the cost for office space (Davis, Leach & Clegg, 2011). The subsequent trend of open-plan offices marks a controversial shift from relatively insulated cell offices to work environments characterized by a lack of walls between individual workspaces and access to individual windows. While advocates argue that open-plan offices facilitate interactions and foster closer working relationships, critics paradoxically argue that open- plan offices lead to a loss of privacy and induces conflict (Ayoko & Härtel, 2003). This discrepancy can largely be explained by the success of different adaptation strategies used by employees when faced with the challenges of a shared work environment. However, it is also clear from the research that the design of open-plan offices affects organizational communication, with implications on the behaviours and relationships among co-workers. Employees in open-plan offices personalize their space to express their feelings and identity (Askanasy et al., 2015). They also modify or rearrange aspects of their environment to construct, communicate, and maintain their territorial boundaries (Brown, 2009). However, previous studies on the effects of open-plan offices on behaviour and conflict within organizational behaviour focus largely on the emotions and experiences of individuals in that environment (Askanasy et al., 2015; Ayoko et al., 2014). Indeed, some studies treat spatial boundaries as little more than an obstruction of communication (Kim & de Dear, 2013). Instead, the current study takes a multimodal approach to organizational communication (Meyer et al. 2013), and reframes personalization and the construction of boundaries as part of meaningful communication.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

Organizations, and individuals within them, must face the obstacle of communicating tacit knowledge among members. Many scholars have looked at the role of objects in facilitating this tacit knowledge communication process (Barley, Leonardi, & Bailey 2012; Carlile, 2002; Star & Griesemer, 1989). The research thus far provides opportunities for expansion into the nuances of the relationship between objects and individuals in knowledge sharing practices. This study focuses on the role of tangible object familiarity, through a qualitative, ethnographic approach of on-site field observations. Through the data collected during these observations, this study expands our understanding of tacit knowledge communication and knowledge management in organizations, as well as our understanding of the role that objects might play in facilitating or mediating communication between individuals.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

A shift in the organizational scholarship from a cognitive and individual-based view of expertise to a communicative and practice perspective is similar. Even though the communicative view of expertise is generative, questions in the core of the debates on expertise are still unanswered. As a response, this paper presents an embodied view of expertise that grounds itself in its capacity to incorporate both the cognitive and the communicative aspects and thus further provides a middle ground where a more nuanced understanding of expertise can be developed as a response. This paper provides a reconceptualization of expertise and embodiment and a process model of expertise embodiment that offers theoretical and methodological implications for the study of expertise.",Research Escalator - Part 1,Organizational Communication

But does this relationship, and their ability to influence consumer behavior, change when an influencer affiliates herself with a brand? This study assessed followers’ perceptions of Instagram influencers and the brands they endorse through the lens of source credibility theory. A quantitative content analysis was performed on 100 influencer posts and their comments (n=7,716) to determine if followers interact differently on sponsored and organic posts.

This study considers social media time by asking how Facebook users interpret an acquaintance’s interactions with a post made one day ago vs. an acquaintance’s interactions with posts made two years ago through the expectancy violations framework (EVT). Employing narrative prompts and a survey of undergraduates, we found that engagement with posts made two years ago constitute an expectancy violation, and that, fitting with EVT premises, this violation is interpreted according to the reward valence of the violator. Contrasting EVT, violations were not interpreted more positively than confirmations when committed by a high reward acquaintance, and did not have more positive interaction outcomes.

In this paper, we apply the social interdependence theory framework to analyze how the co-opetition model impacts the modes of individual interactions and how these interaction patterns influence the creative process and outcomes. Social interdependence exists when individuals share common goals and each individual’s outcomes are affected by the actions of others. By adding collaborative features, we demonstrate that crowdsourcing platforms can positively impact the creative process and nudge the nature of competition along constructive lines.

2018-1194,2018,Paper Session,"Reds, Reactionaries, and Repression in Television’s First War on Women",1,"This presentation is about how the values and happy consensus that viewers saw on their television screens came about. It is about what seemed possible for the new medium of television in 1945, as progressives converged on the broadcast capitol of New York City, and how those possibilities were eliminated within a ten-year period. To dislodge the belief that what appeared on television screens in the 1950s and thereafter resulted from some broad social agreement, the book from which this presentation is drawn tells two overlapping stories. One story centers on the white, native-born anti-communists who created and carried out the blacklist in television, the principle means by which anti-communists were able to impose their version of Americanism on television.",Understanding Gendered Representations of Television Women,Feminist Scholarship
2018-1195,2018,Paper Session,The Voice of Women Who Stutter: Analyzing a Televised Case Study,2,"Despite the extensive literature dealing with disabled people, including analysis of depictions of disabled people in the media, much less attention has been paid to images of disabled women, and stuttering people in the media.
The intersection of stuttering and womanhood is an interesting case. As opposed to other disabilities, which can have clear external physical signs, stuttering typically only reveals itself when the person talks, creating the impression that it can't affect a woman's gender identity (which, according to social expectations is focused on physique and beauty).
This study thus uses Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis in order to examine a televisual case study: Amazon's legal web drama Goliath (2017), which includes the character of Lucy Kittridge, a young (female) lawyer who stutters.
The findings illustrate how a patriarchal society built on ableism and sexism can harm and hurt stuttering women.",Understanding Gendered Representations of Television Women,Feminist Scholarship
2018-1196,2018,Paper Session,Previving: How Unaffected Women With a BRCA1/2 Mutation Define and Construct Identity,5,"Receiving a positive result for a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA)—indicating a high lifetime risk to develop hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC)—can significantly alter a woman’s identity. Some BRCA-positive women have embraced the previvor label, which distinguishes individuals who are at-risk for developing cancer, but have not had cancer. Using interviews conducted with 25 women with a known BRCA1/2 mutation, this study explored the relationship between health and identity. Women in this sample defined previvor as someone who is aware of their risk for cancer or someone who has completed risk-reduction strategies (e.g., prophylactic surgery). Women differed on their acceptance, rejection, or ambivalence toward the previvor label and the degree of internalization of this construct into their own self-concept. Understanding how women interpret previvor identity can help inform and improve communication with those with BRCA genetic mutations but whom have not been diagnosed with cancer.","Communication and Identity among Cancer Previvors, Patients, Survivors, and Caregivers",Health Communication
2018-1197,2018,Paper Session,Adapting Online Decision Aids for Older Cancer Patients,5,"Although decision aids have been successful in improving the quality of decision making,
they are insufficiently adapted to the cognitive changes that older patients face. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of incorporating two strategies with expected potential for older patients (modality and narration style) in a decision aid. Second, to study the relationship between satisfaction with the information, recall and informed decision making in older (vs. younger) patients. A 2(Modality: visual vs. audiovisual) x2(Narration style: narrative vs. factual) x2(Age: <65 years vs. >65 years) experiment was conducted. The results showed an effect of modality on satisfaction with the information, information recall and informed decision making. In addition, we found a sequential mediation effect of modality, via satisfaction and recall on informed decision making. All effects were found in older and younger patients. Information provided in decision aids can be improved by applying this knowledge.","Communication and Identity among Cancer Previvors, Patients, Survivors, and Caregivers",Health Communication
2018-1198,2018,Paper Session,Using Social Media to Assess Care Coordination Goals and Plans for Leukemia Patients and Survivors,4,"Care coordination has been shown to have a positive effect on the management of chronic disease. Specific to the management of leukemia, coordination may occur among medical and radiation oncologists, surgeons, cardiologists, and genetics specialists. The goal of this study guided by the planning theory of communication was to provide an in-depth assessment of how individuals use online forums to deliberate about their goals and plans for leukemia care coordination. The data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network included 125 original posts and 1,248 responses. Thematic analysis and axial coding were applied to analyze the data. Goal-related themes included overcoming the diffusion of care coordination and achieving health management cohesion. Planning themes included social health management, communication self-efficacy, and role deliberation. Online patient forums provide an interactive platform for patients and caregivers to engage in active conversations, which in turn can serve as indicators of care coordination needs.","Communication and Identity among Cancer Previvors, Patients, Survivors, and Caregivers",Health Communication
2018-1199,2018,Paper Session,“It Changed Our Outlook on How We Want to Live”: Cancer as a Transformative Health Experience for Young Adult Survivors and Their Family Members,2,"Young adult cancer survivors (YACS) and their families face a number of unique challenges, yet little is known about how the experience of cancer in young adulthood can affect these individuals’ perspectives on health and wellness following the completion of primary treatment. We interviewed 30 YACS and 21 of their family members to explore how cancer can be a transformative health experience. Participants described transformation in three distinct ways: a) a shift in perspective on health and risk, b) a change in behavior toward healthier and more proactive living, and c) an opportunity to openly discuss health and wellness with others. A minority of participants reported no transformation based on a fatalistic view of their cancer diagnoses. These findings reveal a number of significant positive mental, behavioral, and communicative shifts in the post-cancer lives of many YACS and their families. We discuss important implications for health promotion and support in this population.

2018-1200,2018,Paper Session,Transformative Trauma: Cancer Caregiver Reports of Posttraumatic Growth Following Spousal Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant,2,"Cancer caregivers are at risk for experiencing a variety of psychological and emotional ailments due to the stress of caregiving. Despite negative outcomes that caregivers face it is possible to prompt an increased awareness of, and cognitive engagement with, personal benefits that arise from the cancer experience as well. Forms of emotional disclosure have been associated with caregiver reports of post-traumatic growth, defined as positive personal change following a traumatic experience. The current study used a qualitative approach to evaluate caregivers’ written emotional disclosure accounts of positive outcomes that arose from caring for a spousal cancer patient who underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Findings suggest seven areas of post-traumatic growth including: embodying mindfulness, affective transformation, experiencing a sense of honor or empowerment, an expression of their unadulterated self, respecting personal values over societal values, social and spiritual connection, and altruistic expansion. Theoretical and applied implications of findings are discussed.","Communication and Identity among Cancer Previvors, Patients, Survivors, and Caregivers",Health Communication

Effects of Humor in Health Narratives on Empathy with Ill People,3,"In the context of health communication, humor often functions as a “vehicle for the message” (Cernerud & Olsson, 2004, p. 397). However, studies illustrate both positive and negative humor effects. The impact of humor in health messages thus seems to be contingent on intervening factors (Lee et al., 2015). Whereas most studies have focused on humor in explicit health messages, little is known about the persuasive impact of humor in fictional narratives. Specifically, a test of differences between humorous and serious depictions of health issues in narratives is lacking. In two models, we assumed the impact of humorous versus serious narrative presentations of three health issues on empathy to be mediated by perceived humor, narrative engagement and counterarguing. An online experiment with a 3 (topic: diabetes, depression, drug abuse) x 2 (presentation: humorous vs. serious) between-subjects design with 248 participants was conducted.

We developed and validated a virtual supermarket paradigm and employed it to assess the neurocognitive drivers of health goal priming. The validation study showed that the Presence of the paradigm was excellent. In the fMRI study participants chose between healthy and unhealthy foods while brain activation was measured. Choices were preceded by health, hedonic, or control primes. No main effect of prime on choice or brain activation was found. However, those participants in which the health goal prime was more effective in promoting healthy choices had stronger activation in brain areas involved in self-control. To conclude, we validated a novel virtual supermarket with which we demonstrated that health goal priming might be effective in changing food choice through triggering neural self-control mechanisms.",HIGH-DENSITY: Message Effects Research in Health Contexts,Health Communication

This study examined the effects of both visual and textual features on the popularity of fitspiration images on Instagram. The results suggested that images containing identifiable human face(s), emphasizing a specific body part or sexy poses (i.e., objectification), or containing inspirational texts, were more likely to attract user likes. Two aspects of objectification also led to more comments from users. The current study is among the pioneering efforts on identifying crucial message features predictive of user engagement among online image-sharing communities. Furthermore, the overwhelming social endorsement of body objectification on Instagram was particularly worth attention as objectification was often found to be associated with negative health outcomes like heightened anxiety about body images.",HIGH-DENSITY: Message Effects Research in Health Contexts,Health Communication

This research examines how exposure to different “diets” of emotionally-framed health news (i.e., fear, hope, anger, and control) influences readers’ impressions of health threats, credibility judgments of both the news and scientific communities, and their preventative health behavior intentions. In an online experiment with 327 adults via MTurk, participants scanned 20 health news headlines, half of which reflected the target emotion and the remainder reflected more neutral themes. Results revealed that those exposed to more hope-framed headlines not only felt more hope, but that hope, in turn, associated with more trust in both science and news and greater prevention behavior intentions. These associations were stronger than those for fear and anger, which evidenced quite different patterns of results. Practical implications are discussed.",HIGH-DENSITY: Message Effects Research in Health Contexts,Health Communication

In this study, we examined the effects of message dose on four brain regions of interest (ROIs) associated with key processes that facilitate or inhibit persuasion. Adolescents between 14-17 years old without established smoking behaviors (N=37) underwent an fMRI session, in which they viewed 12 randomly-ordered anti-smoking video PSAs, created as part the FDA’s The Real Cost campaign. Results suggested that as exposure increased, 1) activity within the “valuation” ROIs sharply decreased with the several initial doses and flattened out at a low activity level afterwards; 2) although activity within the “deliberation” ROI did not significantly fluctuate over the course of exposure, significant increases in the “counterarguing” ROI activity was observed; 3) activity within the “attention” ROIs did not drop as we expected, but rather was slightly increasing.",HIGH-DENSITY: Message Effects Research in Health Contexts,Health Communication

A cross-sectional analytical survey (N = 480) was collected during the annual large-scale minister’s conference, with participants reporting: mean age: 57.16; 52.3% male; 93.8% Black/African American; 68.1% Baptist; 53.1% urban. T-tests detected a significant difference between urban (M = 4.17, SD =.55) and rural (M =4.04, SD =.57) pastors in the perception of the minister’s role in seeking and disseminating health information (t(454) = 2.33, p = .02). Ministers are more willing to seek information about health issues by which they were personally affected than information about how other ministers introduce health issues (t(479) = 2.63, p = .009). These findings can guide interventions to help Black clergy incorporate health as part of their role and positively influence their congregants.",HIGH-DENSITY: Message Effects Research in Health Contexts,Health Communication

While national studies done on breast cancer attest to the importance of awareness campaigns (Doumit, Fares & Arevian, 2017; LBCF, 2017), none examine the type of content that most effectively reaches women. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine the exemplar narrative versus the direct messaging of communication tools (e.g., brochure) addressed to two different age groups (below 50 and above 50), through a 2x2 experiment. The study will measure beliefs and knowledge prior to and after exposure to the content, attitude, intended behaviors, and self-efficacy – taking into consideration the age factor.

An experiment examined how listening to popular music from one’s early adolescence (versus the present day) influenced listeners’ engagement in temporal comparisons (i.e., musings about how they have changed over time) and their overall well-being. Participants recalled more personal memories and experienced more nostalgic emotion after listening to music from their early adolescence. For some, this music triggered downward temporal comparisons (i.e., contemplating how their lives have improved over time), which enhanced their life satisfaction. For others, it triggered upward temporal comparisons (i.e., contemplating how their lives have worsened over time), which diminished life satisfaction. Memory recall and nostalgic emotion were unrelated to life satisfaction.

Hip-hop music was selected as recent research indicates that a majority of the most popular songs containing references to infidelity were hip-hop songs. Specifically, we examined whether these portrayals affect intentions to commit infidelity, the tendency to justify infidelity, and the tolerance of a partner’s infidelity. Findings revealed that women who were exposed to negative consequences to infidelity in hip-hop music were more tolerant of a partner’s infidelity than women who were exposed to positive consequences. Participants’ attachment orientation, or level of attachment anxiety or avoidance, moderated the effects of exposure to infidelity on all three outcome variables.

Those who had first seen the feature film reported higher levels of issue involvement (topic interest, subjective knowledge, and information seeking), and altruistic responses (positive attitudes and behavioral intentions concerning organ donation, and willingness to get a donor card). Structural equation modeling revealed that these positive effects on issue involvement and altruistic responses were mediated by the extent to which participants felt moved by the feature film, and their cognitive elaboration of the feature film and the documentary about organ donation.",Synergy of Entertainment,Mass Communication
2018-1212,2018,Paper Session,"Distilling Selective Exposure: A Conjoint Analysis of Selective Exposure to Message Cues, Party Cues, and Source Cues",3,"Especially three forms of selective exposure to political news has dominated the communication literature: message cues, party cues, and source cues. Due to methodological restrictions, prior studies have been unable to consider that readers hardly encounter these cues in isolation. We have yet to know whether 1) these cues interact, or 2) if one is stronger than the other.
In two conjoint experiments, a large probability-based panel of Norwegian citizens (total n=6760) was faced with news headline decisions, randomly varying several factors simultaneously. 29,384 selection decisions were examined, showing that 1) only source cues and party cues interact, and 2) while party cues elicited the overall strongest effect, one cue is not substantially stronger than the other. Additionally, we demonstrate that these cues are robust to different measurements and against known countervailing forces.
We conclude that it is unproblematic that prior and future studies focus on one cue in isolation.
This evidence suggest that it is not problematic that prior and future studies focus on one news cue in isolation.","Innovative Experimental Political Communication Research From the US, Asia and Europe",Political Communication

This paper presents the results of a field experiment conducted in Dallas, Texas in partnership with a major media organization to increase Millennial turnout in a municipal election through the use of individually targeted Internet banner ads that offered information about the races, and reminders to vote. The results show that a combination of information and voting reminder ads was effective, but only for voters in competitive city council or school board districts.

Laboratory experiments have yielded great insights into the potential psychological mechanisms of attitude change, but their external validity is questionable. Field-experiments, which can claim higher external validity, are rare. Against this backdrop, we examine the effects of an issue mailing sent by a German employers’ group in favor of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) on recipients’ attitudes toward the issue. Subjects (N=8,388) were randomly exposed to either 1) a postal mailing under field conditions, 2) an identical facsimile as part of an online survey, or 3) no treatment. The results show substantial attitude change among both treatment groups, with larger and enduring effects in the survey-experimental group. In both experimental groups, the change in TTIP attitudes was largely driven by respondents having more considerations available in support of the free trade agreement. Furthermore, they attributed a greater weight to industry related considerations when evaluating TTIP.","Innovative Experimental Political Communication Research From the US, Asia and Europe",Political Communication
2018-1215,2018,Paper Session,Voting “Against Islamization”? How Anti-Islamic Right-Wing Populist Political Campaigns Influence Explicit and Implicit Attitudes toward Muslims as well as Electoral Support,1,"In recent years, Islamophobia has become a successful tool for right-wing populist parties to mobilize voters in Western societies. Yet, to date it remains unclear how the means with which these parties promote their anti-Islamic stance to the people—political campaign ads—contribute to their electoral success. Using a quota-based online experiment (N = 174), we explore the effects of anti-Islamic political ads on voting intention for the populist right. Additionally, we investigate implicit attitudes (i.e., automatic affective associations) and explicit attitudes (i.e., overtly expressed evaluations) toward Muslims as underlying mechanisms of these effects. We find that ad exposure prompts explicit hostile attitudes toward Muslims mediated by implicit attitudes. Explicit attitudes also shape voting intention. Moreover, implicit attitudes toward Muslims predict voting preference beyond the influence of explicit attitudes. Thus, resentments toward Muslims may foster voters’ support for populist parties even “under the radar” of conscious awareness.","Innovative Experimental Political Communication Research From the US, Asia and Europe",Political Communication
2018-1216,2018,Paper Session,Why are Politically Active People Avoided in East Asia? A Cross-Regional Experiment,4,"Although most democratic theories assume that political participation other than voting constitutes an essential input to the political process, little is known about the cultural universality of this assumption. Drawing on cultural psychology findings derived from the widely shared framework of collectivism vs. individualism, the present study tests the hypothesis that political demonstrators in East Asia are socially avoided because they are perceived to be a threat to harmonious interpersonal relationships. A cross-national experiment targeting Japan, China, the United States (US), and Hong Kong indicated that political demonstrators are significantly avoided in Japan and China, whereas this tendency was not observed in the US and Hong Kong. A series of mediation analyses suggested that the social avoidance of political demonstrators in East Asia is mediated by the perception that they are a serious threat to harmonious interpersonal relationships, which implies that inactive political participation in East Asia is at least partially explained by a cultural orientation that values social harmony. The cross-cultural validity of democratic theory is discussed.","Innovative Experimental Political Communication Research From the US, Asia and Europe",Political Communication

This research, however, has not been able to uncover if the findings are a function of the level of photograph filtering, the thinness or attractiveness of the individual in the photograph, or the social context of the photograph (e.g., the number of likes it receives). To provide clarity to these previous findings, we conducted a 2 (number of likes: low vs. high) X 3 (filter level: no vs. medium vs. high) online experiment with young adult females (N = 267). Results suggested a significant interaction, such that participants in the high like, medium filter condition reported significantly lower subjective physical attractiveness relative to all other conditions.

In addition, we examine self-serving perceptual biases that may also influence woman’s body image. Using an online experiment, we tested effects of two message factors that are expected to influence women’s body image - the model’s body size, and the presence of disclaimers. We found that disclaimers regarding digital modification do have some mitigating effect when they are featured in a large font size. In addition, we found that women with a higher BMI perceived the model as having a larger body size. Moreover, women perceived their body size as close to their ideal body and that of men. We suggest that these perceptions serve to protect woman’s body image.","Media, Body Image, and Sexualization",Mass Communication
2018-1219,2018,Paper Session,What a Successful Body in Porn Looks Like: Implications for Socialization and Women’s Body Image,4,"This is a preliminary investigation of data collected from the International Adult Film Database (IAFD), a crowdsourced website that has curated data on over 180,000 pornographic titles and 140,000 performers. The analysis presented here focuses on the subset of performers identified by the site as female (n=47,195). Using the number of films a performer has appeared in as a proxy for success in the industry, we examine the relationship between the attributes of the performer’s body, as recorded in the IAFD, and the probability of that performer being a “breakout” performer in the 95th percentile of film appearances or higher. The attributes under study include age, ethnicity, hair color, bra cup size, weight, height, BMI, bust-hip-waist measurements, and the presence or absence of tattoos and non-ear piercings. Our initial analysis finds a clear “hierarchy of preference” across all attributes, painting a portrait of the “ideal female porn star,” a performer with those specific attributes that lead to a higher probability of success. This study hopes to provide the research community with a grounded, quantitative foundation for future empirical and critical explorations of pornography and its implications for young women’s socialization and body image.","Media, Body Image, and Sexualization",Mass Communication
2018-1220,2018,Paper Session,Expanding Models Testing Media Contributions to Self-Sexualization,3,"Although media use is theorized to predict women’s self-objectification, empirical analyses yield mixed results. It is possible that associations between media use and women’s tendency to self-sexualize may not be direct, but may be mediated by other cognitions. Accordingly, surveying 662 undergraduate women, we examined contributions of traditional media and Facebook investment to self-sexualization, and tested whether these associations are mediated by three cognitions: perceptions of women as sexual objects, internalization of thin ideals, and pressure to conform to these ideals. Magazine use and Facebook investment predicted feeling pressure to conform to media ideals and internalizing these ideals; viewing reality television and sitcoms predicted all three mediators. Indirect effects of media on self-sexualization were observed for magazine reading and Facebook investment through internalization, and for reality television through internalization and viewing women as sexual objects. Results support the value of incorporating mediators and broader definitions of sexualization into future models.","Media, Body Image, and Sexualization",Mass Communication

Furthermore, multi-wave panel studies remain rare, which casts doubt on established selection and subsequent media effects. Finally, the question remains whether or not selective exposure is influenced by domain-specific attitudes that affect media choices above and beyond general political ideology. We investigate these open questions by drawing on three-wave panel data from the Netherlands and test whether citizens’ domain-specific attitudes towards the European Union influence their exposure to different media outlets. In addition, we examine the consequences of these selections for media effects, thus testing a potential reinforcing spiral of selection- and media effects over time.

European identity is conceptualized as support or rejection of a sense of both belonging to the EU and togetherness with other EU countries concerning a particular identity frame. The analysis is based on comparative quantitative content analysis of EU-related coverage in two weekly news magazines per country during four events in the Euro crisis between 2011 and 2014. The countries’ positions on strong or weak political integration, market regulation or market freedom, and financial stability or impulses for economic growth followed diverging national interests and adapted to the particular context. This was also reflected in mutual rejections of togetherness. While the crisis actualized old lines of conflict between the countries, a new conflict on financial policy also emerged.

Given the potential impact of the media on the Brexit vote, this study asks: How were EU citizens portrayed by the British media during Brexit and what factors are related to their visibility? The analysis is based on 19,940 news stories published between 1st June 2015 and 23rd June 2016. Automated content analysis was used to determine whether EU citizens were mentioned in a news story. The results show that even though EU citizens are more likely to be mentioned in tabloids, there is no interaction effect with the negative tone of a news story. Instead, it is regional papers from England and Wales where EU citizens are significantly more likely to be mentioned if the tone of a news story is negative, pointing to the decisive role that regional papers might have played for the outcome of the referendum.",Political Communication and the European Union: Media Coverage and Its Effects,Political Communication

To understand possible changes we draw on two literatures, namely political communication and European integration studies. We put forward several hypotheses that tap into a) the professionalization of political communication, and b) the politicization of EU affairs. Our sample comprises 156 posters for a total of 32 parties, which we analyse by a quantitative content analysis. Overall, our results do not lend sufficient support to our hypotheses. Neither professionalization nor politicization trends are manifest in the extent to which election posters change over time by means of featuring party logos, explicit calls to vote, personalization elements, European symbols, policy issues or Eurosceptic messages.

Personal normative beliefs (feelings of obligation to act) reliably predict pro-environmental behaviors, and a recent study found that chronically accessible personal norms better predicted a variety of environmental behaviors than beliefs alone, although the additional variance explained was somewhat small. However, just as with injunctive and descriptive norms, the influence of personal norms on behavior might be stronger if they are primed and thus made more accessible prior to decision making. The current study used a simple video game to attempt to increase the accessibility of pro-environmental personal norms and examined the influence of norm accessibility on intention to recycle as well as on the consideration of eco-friendly features when choosing a consumer product. More accessible norms were associated with pro-environmental outcomes.",HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Self and Other: Implications for Cognitive and Emotional Processing,Information Systems

2018-1229,2018,Paper Session,"Playing a Shooter Game Reveals an Implicit Racial Bias: Prejudice, Reduced Empathy, and Aggression Toward Racial Outgroup Member",2,"Playing shooter games has been studied frequently and is vividly discussed for its possible effects. While those games often address ethnic minorities as targets and victims, ethnic (dis)similarity between those who shoot and those who are shot are hardly studied. Based on social identity theory and implicit bias in social attitudes, we hypothesized that playing a first person shooter game against a racially dissimilar other may reveal an implicit racial bias in provoking prejudice and aggression, and reducing empathy. Therefore, we designed a 22 between-subjects experiment in which participants played against either an in-group or out-group target. Participants (N=80) of racially different backgrounds, Caucasian or from an ethnic minority descend, were randomly assigned to conditions. Targets were crossed with race in a manipulated large screen game using a lifelike rifle. Results revealed that participants who shot out-group race members in the game expressed more aggression after the game was over than after shooting in-group targets, both Caucasian and non-Caucasian participants. Empathy partly mediated this relationship. Non-Caucasian participants showed stronger prejudice toward Caucasians and empathy was stronger among racially in-group participants when the target was non-Caucasian. Results are discussed in view of implicit measures in video game research and in-game playful behavior leaving traces into the real world.",HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Self and Other: Implications for Cognitive and Emotional Processing,Information Systems

As media technology has improved, so has the presentation of sexual objectification. Video gaming offers a new medium through which to present sexually objectifying content. Video gaming, with realistic visualizations and individual control of characters, allows players to transport themselves into the environment and opens new opportunities to influence gaming consumers. Research on this element of gaming lacks depth and breadth. This project utilized an experimental design and psychophysiological tools to measure whether frequent gamers who played as a sexually objectified character had different cognitive processes during gaming than those who played as a non-objectified character. This study found that individuals exposed to a sexually objectified female character had stronger orienting responses, indicating motivationally relevant attention, and no difference in arousal level than those exposed to the control, a fully clothed female character.",HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Self and Other: Implications for Cognitive and Emotional Processing,Information Systems

Researchers have studied the adverse effects of discrepancies between actual and idealized self-concepts represented by one’s avatar. However, self-concepts can be wholly undesirable, as with the anxious self-concept’s infusion into one’s identity. Implications of creating avatars accurately representing negative self-concepts remain unknown due to two conflicting mechanisms: A desire to reduce discrepancy with a self-concept, and a desire to enlarge discrepancy from a disliked-self. Two experiments explored the effects of discrepancy reduction (study 1) and discrepancy enlargement (study 2). In study 1 (N=90), participants customized avatars representing their anxious self-concept. Customization significantly reduced anxiety compared to the control. Study 2 (N=122) employed a 2 (customization: Y/N) x 2 (destruction: Y/N) between-subjects experiment. Participants destroyed or observed a customized or non-customized anxious.

Previous works demonstrated similar perceptions of avatars and humans, yet, no research so far has examined whether this similarity also extends to the perceived authenticity of avatars versus humans and their relative ability to evoke empathy and trigger helping intentions. Moreover, most research on such comparisons focused only on highly expressive stimuli, allowing no conclusions about subtle differences.
The current study sought to fill in this void. In an online-experiment (N=172), we compared a human versus avatar narrator telling an empathy-triggering story. Expressiveness served as a second factor. We predicted authenticity to mediate the narrators’ ability to trigger empathy, and empathy to affect helping intentions. Our results indicated that avatars were perceived as being more authentic than humans. Moreover, authenticity increased empathy and therewith fostered helping intentions. The results are discussed in terms of their implications.",HIGH-DENSITY: Virtual Self and Other: Implications for Cognitive and Emotional Processing,Information Systems

However, less attention has been given to the citizens who follow politicians on social media. To help address gap this paper draws on data from the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017, in which 2680 social media news users from six countries (Australia, Germany, Ireland, Spain, UK, and USA) reported following politicians/political parties on social media. Regression analysis reveals these ‘followers’ are partly motivated by a desire to access political information that is unfiltered by the news media, as well as dissatisfaction with mainstream news coverage. The paper draws on a ‘hybrid media’ framework and contemporary gatekeeping theory to examine the shift in relationship between citizens, politicians and the news media from dependence to independence, pointing to questions about the continuing relevance of journalism’s watchdog role in the digital era.",Gatekeeping in the Age of Networked Communication,Journalism Studies

By analyzing 1,130 image-based Internet memes, we explore how visual and textual elements articulated politics and nationalism, as well as the difference between Chinese memes and Taiwanese memes. Our findings indicate that: 1) while China’s supporters discussed nationalism by implicit and satirical content, Taiwan’s advocates frequently engaged in politics through explicit and critical expression; 2) both China’s and Taiwan’s supporters combined visual and textual elements to articulate politics; and 3) Chinese memes contained anti-independence, expedition and food/scenery topics, whereas Taiwanese memes involved anti-China and independence topics.",Visual Communication Studies Top Student Papers,Visual Communication Studies

A grounded analysis of 119 meme instances identified three artwork's dimensions that are echoed in digital memes: the content, the form or the artist. Consistent with the metaphor of communication as transportation (Carey, 1989/2008), mimesis of content uses artworks as devices for political expression. Alternatively, mimesis of form and of the artist provoke a response that emphasizes the aesthetics over the narrative, albeit for opposite goals. While the former conveys a communal partaking of iconic gestures that emphasizes what Carey would depict as the ritual view of communication, the latter distinguishes the imitator and elevates him or her to appear as the only agent of the work. In this respect, the current study illuminates the way fine arts can be used in memetic practices in order to meet conflicting intentions.",Visual Communication Studies Top Student Papers,Visual Communication Studies

Determined to rebel against the actions happening in their city, the online media network Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) was formed, starting a long war over ideology, fought primarily with images across digital battlegrounds. Sharing regular images of the destruction and death caused by Isis in Raqqa, RBSS aim to “defeat arms with thoughts” through disruptive counter-images.

Created in the wake of the Arab Spring, these counter-images seek to promote Arab liberalism through modes of online resistance, while simultaneously criticising the actions and ideologies of Isis.

Interestingly, users of technology report to be in a state of constant mental preoccupation with online content. Critically, users feel like they have reduced attentional resources to process and assess other information, such as the trustworthiness of news sources. We thus investigated whether online vigilance is related to decreased trust in online news sources. In addition, we investigated the moderating role of Facebook intensity on this relationship: We hypothesized that people accustomed to reading news selected by an algorithm on Facebook would be especially susceptible to a possible relation between online vigilance and trust in online news. To study this, we conducted an online survey (N = 345). Regression analysis predicting trust in Facebook news from the interaction of online vigilance and the Facebook intensity indicated that Facebook intensity and the interaction of Facebook intensity and online vigilance were significantly related to trust in Facebook news. Online vigilance itself did not significantly correlate with trust in Facebook news. The results of this study suggest that online vigilance has different relationship with trust in Facebook news depending on the level of Facebook intensity.",Mobile Social Media,Mobile Communication

These men frame their use of dating apps as work-related; they present themselves as gentle, innocent, or wealthy; they make use of various strategies to maximize their chance of meeting women. I argue that their performances are better understood through wen masculinity, an indigenous Chinese concept that is often associated with literacy and sexual pursuits, and the neoliberalization of such wen masculinity.

Most current research employs retrospective survey measurements to do so, thus depending on the accuracy of users’ memories and generalizations. In-situ measurement, being less dependent on useres’ memories and not requiring generalizations, offers an alternative. In order to assess differences and similarities between these two measurement methods, we analyzed in how far common measures (duration, habit, elaboration, and gratifications) of mobile social media use (regarding Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube) vary between restrospective and in-situ measurement. Overall, we observe a consistent pattern of overreporting in retrospect compared to individual averages of in-situ reports. But, for most constructs and platforms, we find significant, positive correlations between retrospective and aggregated in-situ values. Thus, considering research efficiency, retrospective survey measures might suffice to approcimate mobile social media use regarding purely correlational research questions.",Mobile Social Media,Mobile Communication

This paper provides an empirical rationale for a theory of truth which explains actual journalistic fact-finding behavior vis-a-vis specific factual questions. It does so by drawing on in-depth interviews with mainstream Israeli journalists in which they reconstructed 20 factual controversies on which they worked.Findings show that during actual situations of coverage journalists' operative conceptions of truth match, at a minimum, the philosophical theories of coherence, correspondence and pragmatism.

2018-1248,2018,Paper Session,Verification in the Age of Post-Truth - A Mix Method Study (Top Student Paper),1,"If journalism is a knowledge profession, then verification of news information indeed constitutes as the “essence of journalism” and its key practice of knowledge-acquisition. During recent years, however, the practice of verification faces paradoxical pressures: the need to maintain higher epistemic standards in order to address the growing deception of post-truth era, and the dwindling time and resources to employ verification. This paper represents a comprehensive effort to explore the logic, dynamic and outcome of verifications, based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative reconstruction interviews, in which journalists from leading news organizations analyzed the biographies of hundreds of news items, supplemented by a content analysis of these items. It employs a knowledge centered and holistic framework that sees verification as primary epistemic process. Findings show that reporters employ four different scenarios of information verification, each of which embodies a different mix of motivations, procedures and contribution to the published items. The good news is that the frequency of verification is not deteriorating compared to 10 years ago, and that even when reporters do not verify with intent to advance their knowledge and contribute to the final item, the procedure often does that nonetheless. The bad news is that not only is verification executed in only half the news items and for only third of the sources, but even when it is practices the most common type of verifications are done in a way that hardly advance knowledge. Based on these findings, we recommend three improvements in the practice of verification to address the realities of post-truth era: greater openness to information that doesn’t conform reporters’ earlier beliefs; more openness to rival parties in the selection of verifying sources and greater reliance on evidence other than peoples’ say-so.",Journalism’s Truth Claims,Journalism Studies

While storytelling is usually studied through texts, we approached it from a practice perspective, combining data from three ethnographic studies in which 67 journalists from the Low Countries were extensively interviewed. Because of the emphasis journalists place on “finding out the truth” in public discourses, it is tempting for academics to present them as naive truth-seekers. However, by means of an interpretative repertoire analysis of their “practice” discourses, we seek to enlarge the discursive space to talk about the supposed tension between story and reality. Although departing from the idea that all news making is storytelling, the findings reveal that news making and storytelling are seen as distinct – and sometimes opposing – practices by journalists, distinctively practiced in the preparation and presentation of news stories. These practices serve as the organizing framework around which seven distinct storytelling repertoires are organized.",Journalism’s Truth Claims,Journalism Studies

Using the crystallization model, three events were considered — the Black Lives Matter movement, the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, and Muslim immigration. The results showed that greater diversity in one’s Facebook network, particularly regarding race/ethnicity and religion, predicted greater familiarity and a greater willingness to engage with information about recent social issues, even after controlling for overall network size, political ideology, and one’s own demographic characteristics. These results suggest that racial/ethnic and religious network diversity matters when considering the impact of social media use.

2018-1252,2018,Paper Session,Reflecting on Facebook News Posts: Effects of Active Reflection Strategies on Knowledge,2,"As social media platforms become primary sources for news, there is concern about how deeply users engage with news content and what they learn from it. The cognitive mediation model proposes that the link between attention to and learning from the news is mediated by elaboration, though recent research finds little empirical support for this theory in the context of social media. This experiment (N = 206) tests the effects of active reflection – thinking about and discussing news content – with news posts found on Facebook. Results show that active reflection does not lead to greater elaboration or knowledge. Instead, knowledge depends on story source and use of social media for news, while elaboration depends on story topic and previous topic involvement. Thus, elaborating on and learning from news content on social media is more dependent on content, source, and reader characteristics than specifically how individuals engage with that content.",New(s) Media: Implications of Engaging With News on SNSs,Communication and Technology

Using data from two experimental studies and a two-wave panel study, we test the effect of exposure to humorous context posts on message elaboration, and the consequences for political participation and knowledge. Results from the experimental studies indicated that incidental exposure to political posts in the context of humorous posts can increase message elaboration and in turn knowledge and participation. In line with these findings, results from the panel analysis revealed that exposure to humorous posts boosted message elaboration only among individuals who rarely used SNS for news. However, for citizens who use SNS for news more frequently, the effect of humor exposure on elaboration turned negative. While the panel data suggest that message elaboration positively affected political participation, we did not find a positive effect on general knowledge.",New(s) Media: Implications of Engaging With News on SNSs,Communication and Technology

The sample is made up of in-depth interviews with local journalists in ten of the 32 states in Mexico.

This offers benefits, such as social support, but it can also raise privacy concerns. The popular blog STFU, Parents contains a repository of cases of parental online sharing on Facebook. Through a qualitative analysis of posts from the blog, this study explores the norms that STFU, Parents advocates to govern parental online sharing and the reasons parents should follow them. It considers these emergent norms through the framework of contextual integrity and explains how these norms can help us better understand the privacy implications of parental online sharing. The findings suggest that parents should exhibit a sanitized view of parenting, largely through humor. From a contextual integrity perspective, the norms overemphasize the role of the audience and underemphasize that of the child. In addition, they show that parental online sharing can result in information flowing into different contexts than people may expect.",Communication and Technology Top Student Papers,Communication and Technology
2018-1261,2018,Paper Session,Switching Off a Robot: The Influence of Social Interaction and Objection on Behaviors Towards Robots,5,"Building on the notion that people respond to media as if they were real, switching off a robot which exhibits lifelike behavior implies an interesting situation. In an experimental lab study with a 2x2 between-subjects-design (N = 85), people are given the choice to switch off a robot with which they just interacted. The style of the interaction was either social (mimicking human behavior) or functional (displaying machinelike behavior). Additionally, the robot either voiced an objection against being switched off or it remained silent. More people left the robot on, when the robot objected, which could be due to the enhanced perception of lifelikeness derived from the robot’s display of intentionality. Furthermore, individuals hesitated the longest time when they had a functional interaction with it before, which can be explained by people’s cognitive overload when the robot suddenly displays own feelings, thoughts, and desires after not revealing anything personal before.",Communication and Technology Top Student Papers,Communication and Technology
2018-1262,2018,Paper Session,What Should We Do About Political Automation? Challenges for Policy and Research,2,"Amidst widespread reports of digital influence operations during major elections, policymakers, scholars, and journalists have become increasingly interested in the political impact of social media “bots.” Most recently, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have been summoned to testify about bots as part of investigations into digitally-enabled foreign manipulation during the 2016 US Presidential election. Facing mounting pressure from both the public and from legislators, these companies have been instructed to crack down on apparently malicious bot accounts. But as this article demonstrates, since the earliest writings on bots in the 1990s, there has been substantial confusion as to exactly what a “bot” is and what exactly a bot does. We argue that (1) this categorical ambiguity is responsible for much of the complexity underlying contemporary bot-related policy, that (2) ambiguities in defining bots pose serious issues for both under- and over-regulation, and that (3) before successful policy interventions can be formulated, more coherent definitions of bots need to be formulated. In this article, we outline the main challenges for both researchers and legislators working on bots, and we provide guidelines for policymakers to better categorize bots and unpack the social impact that policy can have in this increasingly important domain.",Communication and Technology Top Student Papers,Communication and Technology
2018-1263,2018,Paper Session,Perceived Active Control Over Digital Content: Effects and Underlying Mechanisms of User-Initiated Mode Tailoring,1,"Previous studies have traditionally studied effects of system-initiated message content tailoring to match individual characteristics. Recent work has explored the effectiveness of tailoring to match individual modality preferences and processing styles. Using a web-based experiment, this study investigated the mechanisms of user-initiated mode tailoring effects on attitudinal and cognitive outcomes in a representative sample of Internet users (N = 392; 25-86 years). Structural equation modeling showed that mode tailoring – enabling users to self-tailor the website’s presentation mode (via textual, visual, audiovisual information) – increased users’ perceived active control, which in turn contributed to higher perceived relevance and website engagement, and reduced cognitive load. Positive indirect effects of mode tailoring (vs. no tailoring) through these mechanisms were found for both website attitude and information recall. The findings suggest that perceived active control is the key driver of mode tailoring effects. Implications for theory and message design in digital environments are discussed.",Communication and Technology Top Student Papers,Communication and Technology

Using data from 50 countries and regions beginning in 2012 through 2016, the study reveals embedded and systemic global gender segregation in the creative department. This work is framed by sociological models of sex segregation and creative system’s theory. The study demonstrates pervasive and systemic horizontal and vertical gender segregation within advertising creative departments. Specifically, these data quantify the underrepresentation of women in advertising creative departments across a five-year period; demonstrating a global average of only 23.5% women working within advertising creative departments, and with only 16.1% women in creative management. Detailed data by geographic region and by country are also revealed.

In the convergent TV era, reality stars share intimate details on social media to extend interest in their TV series and persona. To investigate the gendered labor of online self-disclosure I look at the multi-platform world constructed around Bravo’s reality docu-soap franchise, The Real Housewives. I argue that the ostensibly quotidian quality of social media masks the immense amount of time and effort involved in crafting an online persona. I situate stars’ hyperbolic performance of jealousy and resentment as a form of gendered emotional labor that extends gender stereotypes into digital realm.

2018-1268,2018,Paper Session,#249: Michael Sam and Queering Failure,1,"This paper argues that the story of aspiring professional football player Michael Sam, as told through media commentaries, represents a twofold relationship between queerness and failure. First, that Sam’s ‘coming out’ narrative was predisposed to fail because it is out of step with heteronormativity and second, that his journey can instead be reevaluated within the lens of queerness in order to understand the ways in which it might open up a field of potentiality. While much emphasis was placed on Sam’s draft stock, his ability to make a team, and his chance to make good on the promise to change sports forever, this narrative ignores the way in which his experience can show a queered version of success. Instead of thinking of Michael Sam as an irrecuperable failure, this paper asks how we can think of Sam as a failure that allows us to undo narratives of success that are only available to heterosexuals.","Why Sports Communication Matters: Identity, Culture, and Politics",Sports Communication
2018-1269,2018,Paper Session,Trans Athletes and the Queering of Loss in Sex-Segregated Sports,2,"This paper examines the paradox that professional mixed-martial arts’ first openly transgender male-to female fighter, Fallon Fox, presents the sporting world. Because Fox is regarded as having physical advantages over cisgender women, she must lose against women in order to be considered sufficiently female, i.e. just as biologically inferior as other women. Yet, if she wins a fight, then she must face accusations that she has done so because of assumed innate physical superiority awarded to her at birth. In order to break free from this discursive paradox, we employ an ethnographic approach to center Fox’s voice as she grapples with the meanings and uses of failure. Fox’s experience destabilizes a seemingly fundamental paradigm of sports: winning/losing, success/failure. We examine how Fox’s expression of the queer art of failure provides space for rupture in racialized, hypermasculine, and gender normative sporting spaces by finding liberation through failure.","Why Sports Communication Matters: Identity, Culture, and Politics",Sports Communication

The first section offers a literature review argument theorizing how an issue that has dominated U.S. politics in the 21st century – militaristic nationalism – is, in fact, deeply intertwined in and reflected by sports culture. The second half draws upon a qualitative textual analysis of responses to a national survey among sports fans about the benefits and detriments of sports’ politicization. In sum, the paper suggests that while scholarly critics might doubt the apolitical façade of popular sports, fans themselves largely prefer to maintain that insulation from overt ideological intrusion","Why Sports Communication Matters: Identity, Culture, and Politics",Sports Communication
2018-1272,2018,Paper Session,Negotiating the Distribution of Responsibility in Client-Counsellor Interaction in the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration,4,"Client participation is an explicit goal in the Norwegian labour and welfare administration (NAV), and the NAV counsellors carry the burden of realizing this goal in their many meetings with clients. The current study explores the ways in which the counsellors make client participation relevant in interaction and how the client and counsellor negotiate the distribution of responsibility between them. The analysis is based on video recordings of 20 client meetings, supplemented by field work and interviews at two NAV offices. Discourse analysis of the client-counsellor interaction shows the complex ways in which the counsellors place responsibility with the client, employing a variety of linguistic and communicative strategies for drawing the boundary between their own professional responsibilities and the responsibilities of the client. We suggest that our findings reflect the general shift from a discourse of empowerment to a discourse of responsibility in the labour and welfare sector.","Social Life, Social Interaction in Public and Institutional Spaces",Language & Social Interaction
2018-1273,2018,Paper Session,Student-Initiated Sequence in the Conventional Classroom Setting,1,"It is commonly believed that the pedagogy is merely the teacher’s work in the conventional teacher-front classroom setting. The students’ contributions were viewed as limited to answering instructors’ questions. Not until the recent decade had the researchers realized that students’ contributions in the conventional classroom were not so constrained. Instead, students do initiative moves which are sequentially taken up by the instructors. With this realization, however, little attention has been focused on what the student-initiated sequences are performed to accomplish. The present study uses Conversation Analysis to examine a moment when a student’s turn successfully directed the teaching process and shaped the pedagogical trajectory. The implication of this study is that, for the instruction to take place, it needs cooperative work from both the instructor and the instructee because the pedagogy is a collaborative achievement.","Social Life, Social Interaction in Public and Institutional Spaces",Language & Social Interaction
2018-1274,2018,Paper Session,The Systematic Organization of Interaction in Periscope Live Video Streams and Their Performance as Online Sites of Public Exposure to Strangers,1,"In this study, we use a conversation analysis framework to understand the systematic organization of interactions in Periscope live video streams, and its crucial features: a) the talking heads orientation for the video stream, in common with video-mediated communication; b) the expectation that the streamer should attend to all messages as much as possible; c) the ‘loose’ organization of viewers’ responses to streamers’ turn-at-talk, as in multi-part chats. We also identify a distinctive design for streamers’ responses to messages, the ‘read-aloud and respond’ device. These distinctive features are oriented to the highly asymmetrical communicative affordances of Periscope streams. Without precluding other forms of Periscope-based activities, this systematic organization of talk and messages, coupled with the affordances of the application, favors a basic mode of topic initiation resting on a typical and minimal adjacent pair: viewer’s noticing / streamers’ reading and responding). We argue that this may account for the emergence of the dominant kind of use for Periscope streams, i.e. the online public exposure of (often bored) youth to strangers in order to elicit some conversation.","Social Life, Social Interaction in Public and Institutional Spaces",Language & Social Interaction

The paper seeks to bridge between research on the mechanics of sequential stance-taking-in-interaction, and central scholarly pursuits in media and communication studies, exploring—after Habermas—participatory discourse in mediated environments. After examining the affordances of a visitor book at the Florida Holocaust Museum, we turn to analyze visitors’ discourse (3,000 texts), focusing on the use of repetition of the museum’s discourse to construct reciprocity and alignment, and on visitors’ choice between two possible stance objects: the museum, and the narrated/mediated historical events and their moral implications. We demonstrate how stance-takers creatively mix different elements of the stance-triangle, and how macro-level narratives and other cultural resources are utilized in public/participatory stance-taking.","Social Life, Social Interaction in Public and Institutional Spaces",Language & Social Interaction

Secondary learning schools are complex environments where the work-life of teachers is intertwined with the students they teach, and both teachers and students are experiencing permeable boundaries via ICTs. Semi-structured interviews averaging forty-five minutes were conducted with forty-seven educators across three different public high schools of varying technological density.

2018-1279,2018,Paper Session,"One Look, Multiple Voices: A Compromise-Based View of Integrated Communication",1,"This paper explains how integrated communication projects succeed in including different and potentially contrasting voices and logics. While total integration is often perceived as the only way to stand out from the crowd and convey a consistent and seductive representation of organizations, it is argued that integration projects are dynamic processes characterized and shaped by the presence of multiple voices supporting different organizational logics and perspectives. Accordingly, drawing on Boltanski and Thévenot’s economies of worth framework (2006), the paper points out how actors involved in the development and in the implementation of an integrated communication project reconcile multiple logics in practice through compromises, contributing to evolve the project itself over time. To illustrate this process, it illustrates a case of a university where, following the development of a “new integrated image” for the organization partially carried out by an external design agency, new coordinated visual guidelines are being introduced.",Research Escalator - Part 2,Organizational Communication

Although one might intuitively describe information visibility and transparency as positive or even desirable aspects of the digital age, the concept may be interpreted differently across domains and stakeholders. A case in point are business journalists, who are fundamentally reliant on organizational information subsidies to construct their news articles, and in turn have a strong influence on how external stakeholders perceive the organization.

This article focuses on the textualization of marginalized voices created by value-based organizations and the circulation of the texts in multiple contexts and restriction to specific fora. Indeed, marginalized voices are shaped into discursive and semiotic forms – texts – to become visible, be audible and achieve performativity. To which extend are those textualized voices empowering?

Projects, as the preferred mode for tackling events, change initiatives or innovation, are great illustrations of heterogeneous assemblage for collaboration and cooperation. However, the instrumentalization of the notion of boundary-object that characterizes the project management literature has been criticized by Star (2010) herself. We note it has reduced the boundary-object to a tool to “cross” disciplinary or professional boundaries to foster collaboration failing thus to account for the heuristic frame of the original definition of boundary-object (Star and Griesemer, 1989). We develop and apply in the paper the notion of “project-boundary-object”, which combines the boundary-object’s features with the project’s features, to two research fieldworks. The comparison between these fieldworks reveals the strength of the project-boundary-object frame to study the coexistence of a plurality of voices in processes of organizing by emphasizing materiality, time, space and movement.",Research Escalator - Part 2,Organizational Communication

Using interviews and field notes gathered from a year-long ethnographic study of real estate agents, this study show how individuals are socialized through interactions with a wide network of actors inside and outside of their organization. Organizations socialize individuals into the real estate profession by providing training that increases their task mastery as well as with discursive resources to construct their professional identity. However, the most successful agents did not only rely on socialization from their organization but instead negotiated advantageous network positions that gave them access to social capital through voyeuristic socialization (watching how successful others work before entering the profession) and forming cohesive cross-organizational groups to share tacit knowledge.

Situated at the margin of the higher education spectrum, the number of alternative higher education institutions (HEI) has grown in the past years: there is even a list of alternative universities that counts more than 30 institutions. In the context of increasing competition between universities and crisis of the aim and place of the University in our society, these universities brand themselves as ‘new,’ ‘different,’ and ‘innovative.’ But is it really so? And if they are alternative, what does this really mean in practice? Following these questions, this paper proposes to unfold what it is to be an alternative university. For doing so I am taking a constitutive approach of communication.

First, from the entrepreneur’s perspective, we will develop a follow-up survey to test if age, gender, location (city size), industry and the stage of their startups have any impact on the entrepreneurs’ social support needs. Second, we will design questions in our survey to compare if there is any difference between the social support those entrepreneurs get from their families and loved ones, and the social group they belong to. The goal of this study is to examine what affects entrepreneurs' social support needs and if there is any significant difference between the support they get from families or outside groups.",Research Escalator - Part 2,Organizational Communication

In Thai organizations, where literally male and female are equally accepted, percentages of male and female workforce were almost equal. According to related statistics in 2017, while female employees are increasing, proportion of men to woman in mid-to-high-level management roles were 4:1 in public sector, and 3:2 in private sector. Previous studies revealed internal and external factors that were accounted for the phenomenon. Guided by theories of fluidity of identity, identity management, and influence strategies, this paper aims to examine 1) perception of self-identity, 2) identity management, and 3) influence strategies of top female leaders in Thai organizations. At the pilot stage, retrospective-approach in-depth interviews with 10 top female leaders in public and private sectors.

When a news organization is shielded from many of financial pressures, how do newsroom actors make the logic of their audience? Are there any discrepancies in using and understanding metrics among the newsroom actors? To address these questions, I conducted ethnographic research in the Peninsular Press, a non-profit, local news organization for Silicon Valley. The findings reveal that two main actors (editors and student reporters) of the Peninsula Press drew significantly different meanings from web metrics. Specifically, audience analytics was met with disdain and doubt by the editors, whereas the student reporters embraced it as an important yardstick of their performance and accordingly developed a career strategy. Even though the real-time, detailed information about the audience was just at their fingertips, this powerful tool remained generally obscure because the editors acted as gatekeepers to protect journalistic autonomy.",Research Escalator - Part 2,Organizational Communication

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine two individual variables related to well-being (emotional exhaustion and work-related irritation) as well as one leadership variable (participation) as potential moderators of the relationship between job satisfaction and employee voice. Based on theoretical models and previous findings from the fields of organizational behavior and communication, we developed three novel research hypotheses implying that dissatisfied employees will exhibit higher levels of voice when they experience high participation, low exhaustion or little irritation. Initial statistical analysis based on the current sample of 134 employees in German hospitals provided support for our hypotheses. Additional hypotheses and analyses will be included in the final version of the paper.",Research Escalator - Part 2,Organizational Communication
2018-1301,2018,Paper Session,The Potential for Narrative Correctives to Reduce Belief Echoes,3,"Misleading and incorrect information about health behaviors is prevalent in the communication environment. Correcting misinformation is often difficult and recent research has suggested that even when individuals accept corrected information, misinformation can continue to influence attitudes (known as belief echoes, affective perseverance, or the continued influence effect). The present investigation proposes emotional narratives might be a useful vehicle to correct health-related misinformation. An experiment was conducted with 586 daily and intermittent smokers. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of three narratives containing misinformation about the health effects of natural tobacco product use which contained either no correction ending, a simple (no emotion) correction ending, or a negative emotion correction ending. Both the simple and negative emotion corrective ending produced significantly lower misinformed beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions related to natural tobacco use. The negative emotion corrective also produced significantly lower attitudes than the simple corrective. Implications for corrective message design are discussed.",Top Four Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-1302,2018,Paper Session,What Frame Makes you Less Hesitant: The Interactive Effects of Message Balance and Gain or Loss Framing on Zika Vaccine Hesitancy,3,"Identifying effective communication strategies for increasing vaccine acceptance has been an ongoing concern. This study examined the moderating effects of message balance on gain and loss framed appeals on attitudes and behavioral intentions to receive a hypothetical Zika vaccination. A total of 190 participants were recruited to a factorial between-subject experiment. Loss-framed appeals were found more effective in comparison to gain-framed appeals in predicting positive attitudes and behavioral intentions to receive a Zika vaccine. Balanced messaging was a significant indicator of information seeking. Thus, participants spent more time reading the potential risks and benefits of a Zika vaccine, oppose to pro-attitudinal messages (slant message). No interaction effects or mediating effects were supported. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

2018-1303,2018,Paper Session,The Effects of Social Norms among Peer Groups on Risk Behavior: A Multilevel Approach to Differentiate Perceived and Collective Norms,4,"Social norms have been found an important factor in individuals’ health behaviors. Past research has typically addressed which social norms individuals perceive in their social environments. The present paper explores normative social influences beyond such perceptions by applying a multilevel approach and differentiating between perceived norms at the individual level and collective norms at the group level. Data on norms and three road traffic risk behaviors (speeding, driving after drinking, and texting while driving) were obtained from a representative survey among young German car drivers (N = 311 anchor respondents) and their peer groups (overall N = 1244). Multilevel modeling (MLM) revealed that beyond individual normative perceptions of peers’ behavior and approval, actual collective norms (peers’ actual risk behavior and attitudes) affect individuals’ risk behaviors. Findings are discussed in the light of normative theory building and regarding practical implications.",Top Four Papers in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-1304,2018,Paper Session,How Do Narratives Reduce Resistance? Meta-Analyzing Potential Moderators,2,"Recent meta-analyses demonstrated that narrative message formats are effective at influencing attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. A growing body of theoretical and empirical work, especially in health communication, suggests narratives produce less resistance than nonnarratives, apparently due to narrative engagement processes. The current meta-analysis seeks to synthesize this research, answering (a) whether exposure to narrative vs. nonnarrative messages reduces resistance (experimental studies; 9 studies, 13 effect sizes), and (b) whether narrative engagement is correlated with resistance (correlational studies; 19 studies, 64 effect sizes). We find a small but significant effect in each case. We also explore potential theoretical and methodological moderators to examine whether and how the effect size varies across the proposed moderators.

Data were collected from WeChat, the most popular social networking site in China; 135 WeChat Moments posts of one foreign English teacher from America were analyzed as they displayed identity formation: personal interests and needs, occupation, family (life), Chinese themes and American themes. Posts were further analyzed in terms of personal identity and intercultural identity. While the participant continued to display an “American” identity, she also portrayed and described experiences of Chinese culture, evident in posts about Chinese traditions, contrasts between American and Chinese culture, and usage of Chinese characters. Overall, anxiety and stress were not strongly evident in the participant’s acculturation process, and most posts indicated active and ongoing adaptation to Chinese culture.","New Media, Intercultural Communication, and the Global/International Context",Intercultural Communication

This paper argues that cultural fusion theory provides an alternative theoretical framework to understand the immigrant experience, and reaffirms that complete assimilation is theoretically and practically impossible. Cultural fusion theory focuses on the process and the conditions when the immigrants’ identities start to transform and a fused intercultural identity is created. Using this framework, this paper aims to understand what the fused intercultural identity would look like, an aspect that is not fully explored yet, by a case study of a Facebook group of Taiwanese female immigrants.","New Media, Intercultural Communication, and the Global/International Context",Intercultural Communication
2018-1307,2018,Paper Session,Telecollaboration and Intercultural Learning in Schools. A Case Study of eTwinning in Turkey and Germany,1,"Telecollaboration, using different types of online communication, has become an important instrument for intercultural learning in schools. Different classrooms around the world are connected through online communication opening up a space for contact between teachers and pupils from different cultural contexts. These mediated intercultural encounters can play an important role for increasing pupils’ knowledge about other countries and cultures, deconstruct prejudices, increase awareness about intercultural relations and enable them to be part of international networks. However, the learning effect of telecollaboration projects are dependent on the school context, the design of the projects and the teachers’ approaches to other cultures and intercultural communication situations. This paper will present an in-depth analysis of a telecollaboration project between Germany and Turkey. The paper will demonstrate the problems faced throughout the project with the aim of developing a critical perspective about the integration of intercultural exchange through telecollaboration in schools.","New Media, Intercultural Communication, and the Global/International Context",Intercultural Communication

One hundred and three international students from 19 countries enrolling in a U.S. college participate in this study. Participants fill out a questionnaire containing 63 questions about Internet use motives, intercultural adjustment, and other related variables. The results from T-test, Pearson product-moment correlations, and multiple regressions show that social media use motives are negatively correlated with one’s overall intercultural adjustment level. Results further show the significant impact of gender, age, and satisfaction on Internet use motives and intercultural adjustment.

2018-1310,2018,Paper Session,Changing the World Through Consumption: Oatly and the Contradictions of Political Engagement,1,"In 2014, Swedish oat milk producer Oatly was sued by the dairy lobby for their use of marketing slogans such as “It’s like milk, but made for humans” which the dairy lobby claimed painted cow’s milk negatively. Dubbed the “milk wars”, Facebook and Twitter became the front line in a fight between those who supported Oatly for their ethical and sustainable stance over food production, and those who saw Oatly’s marketing slogans as an attack on tradition and industry.

Oatly’s supporters wrote opinion articles, started Twitter campaigns and created fan pages on social media in their defence. This widespread reaction illustrates a shifting, unconventional kind of political engagement through commodity activism, facilitated by digital media. Through interviews with both Oatly consumers and employees, this paper explores political engagement located within a corporate environment. It addresses the multiple spaces where this engagement occurs to analyse the complexity of online/offline commodity activism.",Satire and Unconventional Forms of Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-1311,2018,Paper Session,“Every Joke is a Tiny Revolution”: The Use of Ridicule in the #HokKolorob Movement,1,"The Jadavpur University Hok Kolorob movement of 2014 was originally begun to protest police brutality against unarmed students on campus. As it evolved from a student movement to a nation-wide phenomenon, Hok Kolorob started relying extensively on humour, prank culture, and the political Carnivalesque to stage resistance to university bureaucracy and the state government of West Bengal.
This paper explores the movement’s use of ridicule as a rhetorical strategy, arguing that the Hok Kolorob activists used ridicule in three main ways in the movement. Firstly, ridicule was used to counter the mockery and moral policing of powerful state authorities, such as the Education Minister, the Chief Police Commissioner and the Trinamool Congress. Secondly, ridicule isolated government rhetoric from the discourses of power which surround it, and exposed the authorities’ incompetence in the face of an organized student movement. Finally, ridicule bolstered traditional methods of civic engagement, and provided brief moments of levity during a period of extended despair and anxiety. It dispelled the collective fear of state-sanctioned power and brute force, and allowed the activists to find collective joy in their protest movement. Therefore, Hok Kolorob demonstrates the effectiveness of ridicule as a rhetorical weapon for highlighting increasing totalitarianism of the Indian political climate.",Satire and Unconventional Forms of Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-1312,2018,Paper Session,From “Horizontal” to “Vertical”: The Institutionalization of the Indignados Movement,1,"As the 2011 “movements of the squares” fizzled out, a new generation of “techno-parties” emerged which try to compete in the electoral arena without abandoning the participatory ethos of “networked” activism. The Spanish Podemos, born on the heels of the Indignados movement, is a prominent case. In order to neutralize the Indignados’ suspicion of formal politics, Podemos presented itself as a participatory “method” where “the people decide.” Has it succeeded? Scholars have responded to this question mainly in two ways. Either Podemos is considered to have successfully integrated the movement’s “rhizomatic” logic, or it is defined as a “hybrid” party, combining participatory practices with vertical elements. This paper tries to show that both are wrong. Podemos is a vertical party, where participation serves to legitimize a course of action already decided by the leadership.

With the spread of right wing political ideology and the public outreach of subaltern groups in alternative right wing media outlets, however, the probing glance at activist movements needs adjustment. Populists increasingly make use of popular communicative means such as humor and entertainment, while criticizing political, media and economic elites and positioning themselves against an alleged establishment or mainstream. We investigate practices of Facebook articulation by right wing groups from four different countries (Austria, Canada, Germany and the United States) who disseminate their political agenda in the guise of satire. Our findings support that digital activism strategies and satire are neither good, nor bad nor neutral, but can be employed for various political ends while concealing the agenda in terms of style or aesthetics.",Satire and Unconventional Forms of Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

2018-1315,2018,Paper Session,Can We talk About Equal Pay?: Framing Gender Pay Inequity to Improve Public Policy,3,"This three-study paper answers the research question: Do individual demographic characteristics affect perceived acceptability of different frames describing gender pay inequity and perceptions of the social issue of gender pay inequity? First, the researchers identified 26 phrases used discuss gender pay inequity and narrowed the list down to 12 representing four frame categories. Next, we solicited sentiment reactions to those frames and gathered perceptions of gender pay inequity from both a regional and national sample. Taken together, the results indicated that although respondents had consistently positive reactions to the frames fair pay, equal pay, and pay fairness, perceptions of the acceptability of these terms varied considerably across demographic groups. The biggest effects were consistently for political party-related variables. One frame emerged as a potentially value neutral frame that could be used to reframe the social issue and re-engage those who do not perceive gender pay inequity as highly problematic.",A Potpourri of Framing Research,Political Communication

The interpretive frame contains functionally equivalent information and relies on applicability as the mechanism (in contrast to the emphasis frame), as well as manipulates the interpretation of the information beyond statistical information presentation or valence (in contrast to the equivalence frame). We then tested the effect of interpretive frame on people’s attitude, policy support, and behavioral intention. The results provided initial support for this new type of frame: Framing effect was stronger for people who read the frame resonant with their preexisting cognitive schema than those who read the non-resonant frame.",A Potpourri of Framing Research,Political Communication
2018-1317,2018,Paper Session,Metaphorical Framing and Political Decision-Making: A Meta-Analysis,3,"This study examines the impact of metaphorical framing in political communication. Previous research provides conflicting evidence for the idea that metaphorical frames influence how individuals reason and behave politically. As a possible explanation, we suggest that individuals can differ in their susceptibility to metaphorical-framing effects. We conduct a meta-analysis (k = 67, N = 24,678) to test this prediction because meta-analyses synthesize previous research based on strict selection criteria and statistical rules to produce precise estimations of effects. Our findings substantiate the claim metaphorical frames are more persuasive than non-metaphorical frames in political communication. However, the findings also show a lack of scholarly attention to participant characteristics, making it difficult to determine the explanatory value of differential susceptibility for metaphorical-framing effects. Therefore, we argue that framing research will not only advance when scholars pay more attention to metaphorical framing but also to the individual-difference variables that could moderate metaphorical-framing effects.",A Potpourri of Framing Research,Political Communication

We find that in both countries, the scandal leads to a frame contest and de-alignment of challenger and news media discourses. After the scandal, we find higher frame alignment in Germany, while in the UK de-alignment prevails. Second, we investigate how information flowed from challenger websites to media outlets in an online public sphere. In Germany, challengers rather disconnect from media websites during the scandal, while in the UK challengers connect mainly to socioeconomic actors. In both countries, challengers’ issue networks form stable opportunity structures for an online discourse without the news media as major players.",A Potpourri of Framing Research,Political Communication
2018-1319,2018,Paper Session,What the News Means to Me: Identity Cues in the News Affect Group Identity Salience,2,"Using the news allows citizens to make sense of their political and social reality. This sense-making functions in particular through social comparisons and group memberships. That is, we understand the world by actively identifying with actors and events in the news. Thus far, political communication research has only studied this phenomenon in inherently intergroup topics, like immigration, and party politics. Therefore, the psychological effects of other important identity cues in the news, such as age, gender, or social class, remain unstudied. This experiment (N=750) explores the effects of seven different identity cues in the news on the identity salience of seven corresponding group identities for a generic news topic. We find that identity cues can make a variety of group identities more salient, and that the strength of this effect depends on one’s identity strength, the group’s status and the group boundary permeability.",A Potpourri of Framing Research,Political Communication
2018-1320,2018,Paper Session,Forgive and Forget: A Typology of Hurtful Events and the Use of Forgiveness Strategies in Marital and Dating Relationships,2,"Forgiveness can play a powerful role in the healing and restoration of damaged relationships. Although recent studies have emphasized the link between forgiveness and positive communication, this study is among the first to examine differences in how married and dating couples communicate forgiveness. Two hundred and sixteen adults (123 married and 93 dating) completed a survey describing the role of forgiveness in their relationship, detailing relational transgressions that prompted forgiveness, the perceived severity of the transgression, and strategies that they used to express forgiveness. An inductive analysis of participant responses forms the basis to develop a typology of strategies that romantic couples use to communicate forgiveness. Specifically, dating partners tend to favor a minimizing strategy to forgive one another, whereas married couples tend to use the discussion and explicit strategies. The Discussion strategy was most commonly used to communicate forgiveness, especially following a severe transgression. For milder transgressions, partners tend to favor indirect strategies, including Minimizing and Nonverbal forgiveness. A new forgiveness strategy, pseudo-forgiveness, is also uncovered among married participants, and its implications are discussed.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

This sample consisted of 62 heterosexual, dual earning couples and one of their adolescents. All three family members completed a survey at the beginning of the week and the end of the week, as well as recorded their perceptions of daily stress throughout the week. They also collected saliva samples in the morning on two consecutive days in the middle of that week. When mothers and fathers received greater relationship maintenance from each other and adolescents received greater maintenance from their parents over the past month (at time one), it was associated with a healthier rise in their cortisol awakening response or CAR. It was also associated with better immune functioning (i.e., lower interleukin-6 or IL-6) in adolescents, and lower and more stable perceived daily stress throughout the week for fathers and adolescents. Finally, less relationship maintenance over the past month (at time one) predicted greater perceptions of conflict during the week for mothers, which, in turn, predicted less satisfaction balancing work and family. Fewer maintenance behaviors over the past month and conflict during the week also directly predicted loneliness for mothers and fathers.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Using Brunswik’s (1956) lens model as a guide, we conducted an experiment to examine the effects of identity cues concerning a support seeker’s responsibility for his or her distress and behavioral residue involving other online community members’ responses to the support seeker. Participants evaluated the support seeker more negatively, produced support messages containing lower levels of person-centeredness, and used fewer politeness strategies when the support seeker was more responsible for his or her distress than when the seeker was less responsible. These effects tended to be intensified when the quality of support from other community members was congruent.",Top Four Papers in Interpersonal Communication,Interpersonal Communication

Actor-partner interdependence modeling (n = 183 married couples; N = 366) revealed that husbands’ perceptions of their wife’s emotional support predicted their own and their partner’s mental health. Further, wives’ perceptions of their husband’s emotional support positively predicted their own relational satisfaction, as well as their husband’s relational satisfaction. Analyses revealed that the spouses’ emotional support discrepancy positively moderated the relationship between wives’ perceptions of their husband’s emotional support and wives’ relational satisfaction. These findings demonstrate that, despite occurring within the physically and emotionally traumatizing context of miscarriage, women may experience discomfort from being overbenefited by their husband.

2018-1324,2018,Paper Session,Media Freedom and Protest Events in the Global South,1,"Can media freedom encourage protest mobilization in the Global South? Compared with the burgeoning literature on digital media and protest, surprisingly few studies have directly addressed the relationship between a free media and offline mobilization, especially in countries without a mature democracy. Using event history analysis to study protests in Africa and Latin America from 1993 to 2015, this research discovers a consistent curvilinear relationship between media freedom and protest onset, with GDP per capita interacting with media freedom to magnify its effect. That is to say, only when media is severely restricted can it pose a significant threat to protest mobilization. Results also indicate that spontaneous protest events are more likely to be affected by changes in media freedom than organized protests. By exploring media freedom in these two continents, this study extends the scope of previous studies based on advanced democracies, and also calls for a more fine-grained analysis of different types of protest.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication

Studies that aim to analyze the relationship between the media and the formal arenas of deliberation, where most institutional policy discussions and decisions occur, are also rare. The purpose of this article is to help to fill this gap by investigating the different ways in which news media are embedded and appropriated by politicians, experts and citizens. Our focus is the public deliberation on the reduction of the minimal age of criminal responsibility in Brazil.

Through a literature review, it was possible to identify the communications practices of populist governments and differentiate them from other forms of administration. Aside from discourse style, populist leaders require a radical intervention in the media system. They build their own (or controlled) media system in confrontation with the external media system, which is identified as the opposition. In this context, direct communication assumes a radical importance to consolidate the saturation of the public sphere through the presidential voice and to reaffirm the process of symbolic representation between leaders and their people. The model contributes to the study of communications and populism by describing these elements and proposing an analysis that requires different dimensions than those of other forms of government communications.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2018-1327,2018,Paper Session,The Speciation of Electoral Debates On Television and The American Model: The Case of Chile (1989-2013),3,"Our objetive is to propose a model to deconstruct the setting-up, evolution and institutionalization of televised electoral debates in a specific political system. The approach, based on Anstead (2016) and his proposal on “speciation” (a concept drawn from biological science) assumes that events and trends specific to each social system, together with the changes in political and media systems, cause the format of debates to be adapted to the reality of each country's political communication system. Applying this model to the Chilean case, we concluded that the debates have “speciated” from the American model. The panel of journalists has remained from the original format - composed of representatives from the organizers channels - but adaptations have been made to allow for the participation of all presidential candidates (a common trend in Latin American countries).

2018-1328,2018,Paper Session,"Historical Remembrance, Nationalism and Populism in Authoritarian Contexts: Constructing ‘the People’ in the Cuban Institutional Press",1,"Eduardo Galeano (2015: 7) wrote of the historical leader of the Cuban Revolution: ‘Fidel Castro. His enemies say that he was a king without a crown and that he confused unity with unanimity’. However, the Uruguayan intellectual has also recognised the importance that Fidel’s quixotic ‘code of honour’, his old-fashioned 19th-century military values, played in Cuba’s achievements. In this paper, I analyse the discursive construction of ‘the Cuban people’ in times of national debate through the lens of the national newspaper Granma. The data suggests that a populist media articulation of ‘the people’ has provided stability to the hegemonic project, discursively constructing a heroic people able to fulfil a historic victory in the face of enemy-induced challenges. In order to do so, the official discourse articulates a very specific construction of ‘the people’, endowed with a set of inherited heroic roles and values, such as patriotism and sacrifice. I argue that the historical construction of Cubanness is at the roots of Cuban populism, a discourse of popular unity guided by people’s belonging to a revolutionary code of ethics.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2018-1329,2018,Paper Session,Does POV Overcome Racial Bias? Identification with Officers and Citizens and Evaluations of Their Behavior in Police Use of Force Videos,6,"Digital technology has made it possible to capture police-citizen interactions and disseminate them widely, which has increased public scrutiny of policing and calls for more departmentally sanctioned capture of these interactions via body-worn camera devices. However, the public outrage, emotion and subsequent calls for intervention that are often resultant from these videos, especially when they depict white officer on minority citizen interactions, may depend as much on video production features (e.g., camera point of view) as the actual interactions depicted in them. This study investigated this possibility in an experiment. Findings indicate that more biased individuals reported more identification with the officer and more belief that the officer behaved appropriately when dark skinned citizens were harmed from the officer perspective. These individuals also reported less identification with the citizen and less belief that the citizen behaved appropriately when dark skinned citizens were harmed from the officer perspective.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems

Thus, having a character face the camera and directly address viewers should increase the sense of parasocial experience but not affect the intensity of identification. An experiment compared the levels of parasocial experience and identification among viewers of clips from the show House of Cards that included or omitted direct address tested this prediction. Results provide support for the previously theorized conceptual distinction between parasocial experience and identification.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems
2018-1331,2018,Paper Session,A Laughing Matter? How Humor in Alcohol Ads Influences Interpersonal Communication and Persuasion,2,"Exposure to alcohol ads increases alcohol consumption. A potential explanation is that certain (e.g., humorous) alcohol ads trigger conversations which can, in turn, influence drinking behaviors. Therefore, we investigated the influence of humor in alcohol ads on conversational occurrence, length, and valence about alcohol and alcohol ads. 114 participants were shown one of three beer ads (humor; positive; no ad), after which participants could voluntarily discuss the ad and alcohol. Next, all participants discussed the topic and answered a questionnaire assessing conversational valence and ad, brand, and alcohol evaluations. Results showed that humor leads to more, longer, and often more positive conversations about the ad and alcohol. This interpersonal communication, and especially conversational valence, was subsequently related to ad, brand, and alcohol evaluations. These findings may explain the effect of alcohol ads on alcohol consumption, and provide important starting points for using humor as a potentially effective behavior change tool.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems
2018-1332,2018,Paper Session,Continuous and Summative Assessments of Musical Complexity and Intensity,2,"The present research addresses music listening from the perspective of dynamic human-centric communication systems theory (DHCCST; Lang, 2014), which makes a number of distinct assumptions about humans and communication. Drawing from previous work on the distinct concepts of musical complexity and intensity, this experiment will collect data both in real time and after each song is heard in order to compare dynamic, continuous responses to summative, retrospective assessments of the music listening experience. It is hypothesized that listeners will be able to dynamically track fluctuations in music complexity and intensity over time. It is also predicted that summative assessments of musical complexity and intensity will be most influenced by the peak and end levels of these qualities in each song.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems
2018-1333,2018,Paper Session,Can’t Remember But Like it: Towards Understanding of Mechanisms of the Humor Effect in Advertising,2,"The present study attempted 1) to identify prominent dimensions of humor in advertising and 2) and how advertisements high in these dimensions influence memory for the brand and its likability. 264 participants were provided with 9 humorous and 9 non-humorous still-image ads and asked to answer questions measuring humor dimensions, followed by a recognition test for the brand names and the measure of likability towards the products. The correlation analyses revealed that the dimensions high in humorous ads were cleverness, pleasantness, and positivity. Also, the results of repeated measures ANOVA showed that participants who watched humorous ads recognized the brand logos less, but liked the product more than those who watched non-humorous ads. These results indicate that humorous ads, compared to non-humorous ads, are seen as cleverer and trigger more positive emotions, and these, in turn, contribute to the poor memory of brand names and improved liking for products.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems
2018-1334,2018,Paper Session,With or Without “#sponsored” in Influencer Marketing: How an Advertising Literacy Intervention Can Help Mitigate Advertising effects,2,"Amidst the burgeoning surge of innovative marketing practices on social media, to ensure consumer protection, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued a series of enforcement policies that regulate sponsorship disclosures in social media advertising. Focusing on the phenomenon of influencer marketing, the current study revisited and reconsidered ad literacy as a potentially effective defense for consumers to cope with influencer marketing. Based on the results of three pretests (N = 369), the present study administered a 2 (ad literacy intervention vs. control) × 2 (disclosure: yes vs. no) × 3 (message repetition) mixed experimental design study (N = 279) to explicate the relationship among ad literacy intervention, persuasion knowledge, and advertising effects. Results suggest that, in the intervention condition, upon seeing disclosure (vs. no disclosure), participants tended to activate their conceptual persuasion knowledge, which, in turn, led to their coping behaviors, and ultimately resulted in lower eWOM and lower purchase intentions. In contrast, in the control condition (no ad literacy intervention), the presence of disclosure (vs. no disclosure) did not trigger the occurrence of such process.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems

Based on construal level theory, this study investigated whether the relevance of source and message variables in the processing of consumer reviews depends on the time frame of the decision. An online experiment on hotel reviews (N = 280) varied the planned time of the vacation (near vs. distant future), the similarity of the reviewer (same vs. other age group), and the provided arguments (feasibility vs. desirability). For bookings in the distant future, desirability-related arguments had a stronger impact on the likelihood of booking and dissimilar sources affected participants’ perception of the hotel style more strongly. Theoretical and practical implications on the persuasiveness of online reviews and the role of psychological distance are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: At the Intersection of Cognition, Emotion, and Message",Information Systems

What sort of news content garners more attention from social media users, however, is unclear. The purpose of this study is to analyze how emotion in Facebook news headlines affects three types of social media engagement: clicking on news articles, commenting on news posts, and using one of the reaction buttons (e.g. Like) available on Facebook. We analyze how anxiety, anger, and sadness affect Facebook engagement by partnering with a national news media organization with a strong reputation for political coverage to test how audiences respond to different news messages. Across 68 different tests with six to eight conditions each, we find that discrete emotions can influence the way in which people engage with social media, although not always in ways anticipated by prior literature.","Media, Emotion, and Public",Mass Communication

In this study, we test whether the presence of emotionality in social media news posts increases the likelihood that individuals will engage in these reaction behaviors. We analyze over 12 million Facebook posts from 446 news organizations between 2012 and 2017 for the presence of discrete emotions and engagement behaviors, including reactions, sharing, and commenting. We find that anger expressed in news posts is uniquely related to increases in commenting on and liking the post and that the influence of anger on social media news engagement has become significantly stronger in recent years.","Media, Emotion, and Public",Mass Communication

might change the way spiral of silence theory operates. An experiment (N = 1,126) found that
when people were confronted with uncivil disagreement online and they held a minority
viewpoint, they were less likely to speak, as the spiral of silence would suggest. However, if the
incivility provoked a burst of negative emotion, people were more likely to speak out even when
they held a minority viewpoint, counter to the spiral of silence. Thus, findings suggested an
extension to the spiral of silence that showed incivility and emotional response could interrupt

This study further builds on this literature by identifying another concept linked to eudaimonic media experiences – psychological empowerment. Employing a 2 (Nature of Content: Eudaimonic, Hedonic) X 2 (Message Frame: Episodic, Thematic) between-subjects design, this study tests the interactive effects of messages with either eudaimonic (meaningful) or hedonic (pleasurable) appeal and the episodic (focus on personal stories) and thematic (focus on a generalized context) framing of these narratives on empowerment while taking into consideration mediators, such as elevation and mixed affect, and self-efficacy as a moderator. This research also investigates the discrete emotions that underlie the process of media-induced empowerment by means of self-reported data and facial expression action coding. Implications for media-induced empowerment and content development for public policy, social welfare, health, and education purposes will be discussed.","Media, Emotion, and Public",Mass Communication
2018-1341,2018,Paper Session,Sensory Curation: Theorizing Media Use for Sensory Regulation and Implications for Parent-Child Media Conflict,5,"Sensory curation theory, introduced here, conceptualizes media devices as tools that help people maintain sensory regulation within the built and natural environments. This paper explicates the constructs of the theory and introduces the Child and Adult Media Sensory Curation Inventories (MediaSCIs), separate measures of child and adult media sensory curation behaviors. A survey of 789 parents of children aged 3 to 14 revealed moderate to strong correlations between general sensory processing and media sensory curation. Controlling time spent with devices, child media sensory curation was a strong predictor of problematic child media use and a moderate predictor of parent-child media conflict frequency. Media conflict was four times as frequent among parent-child pairs with high MediaSCI scores than with low MediaSCI scores. Discussion advocates awareness of children’s sensory needs to enable identification of attractive alternate environments that support sensory regulation.",Moving Us Forward: Pushing Our Theoretical and Methodological Boundaries,Children Adolescents and the Media

First, co-creation workshops with 24 children (8-11 years) were held to come to a selection of disclosure designs. Second, two eye-tracking studies among 32 children (6-12 years) were conducted to test which of these disclosure designs attracted the most attention. This lead to the selection of the final disclosure: a black rectangular disclosure with yellow letters ‘Reclame!’ (i.e., Dutch for ‘advertising’). Finally, a two (existing versus new advertising disclosure) by two (brand placement versus online banners) between-subjects experimental study with 157 children (10-11 years) was performed to test the effectiveness of the new disclosure. This study showed that children recognized, understood and liked the newly developed disclosure better than the existing ones, they were also better able to recognize advertising after exposure to this new disclosure.",Moving Us Forward: Pushing Our Theoretical and Methodological Boundaries,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1343,2018,Paper Session,Disclosing Advertising on Social Networking Sites: Explaining How and When a Heuristic-Based Disclosure Empowers Adolescents Through Descriptive Norms,4,"The use of an advertising disclosure has been considered to be an important tool to inform adolescents of an upcoming persuasive message in an online environment. Previous research on disclosures usually focused on explicit ones that require cognitive, systematic elaboration. However, adolescents are often unable and/or not motivated to allocate great cognitive resources to process an advertising disclosure. They usually adopt a heuristic processing mode. Therefore, in a series of three studies, we introduce and test a heuristic-based disclosure and compare its effectiveness to a traditional, explicit disclosure in a social networking environment. Results reveal that a heuristic-based disclosure is not only more effective in activating adolescents’ persuasion knowledge (study 1 and 2), but also in triggering adolescents to behave in a more critical and privacy-protecting way by selecting more restrictive ad settings (study 3). In all studies, the variable descriptive norms operates as the underlying mechanism.",Moving Us Forward: Pushing Our Theoretical and Methodological Boundaries,Children Adolescents and the Media

The questionnaire consists of five dimensions: satisfaction, companionship, help, intimacy and self-validation. Explorative and Confirmative Factor Analyses were applied on data of 1.695 friendships (offline-to-online, online-to-offline and online friendships) gathered from 1.087 adolescents. Results pointed to a five-factor solution, applicable to any kind of friendship on SNS and reflecting the proposed five dimensions of friendship quality. Multiple Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported measurement invariance across younger and older adolescents, and boys and girls at the levels of equal factor structure and factor loadings. Cronbach’s alphas indicated a good internal consistency of each dimension. Based upon these results, we can conclude that different friendship quality dimensions can validly and reliably be assessed using the FQSNS-questionnaire.",Moving Us Forward: Pushing Our Theoretical and Methodological Boundaries,Children Adolescents and the Media

Although content effects have been well-studied, individual differences (person effects) in responses to media are an important unsolved issue of communication science. This study investigated how four theoretically-relevant variables (need for cognition, affective empathy, sensation seeking, and sensory processing sensitivity) affect these responses to media entertainment. In a within-subjects design, 243 youth aged 7-15 years (49.9% female) responded to a positive and negative film clip using both self-report and physiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance), while parents reported on children’s individual differences. Multilevel analysis distinguished between content and person effects on responses. Results showed that more variation in responses was due to differences between participants than to differences between stimuli. Need for cognition, affective empathy, sensation seeking, and sensory processing sensitivity did not explain this between-participant variation in responses.",Moving Us Forward: Pushing Our Theoretical and Methodological Boundaries,Children Adolescents and the Media

More notably, the public for the first time encountered and confronted the increasingly secretive nature of the federal government. Relying on contemporary local and nationwide coverage, this paper examines the early cases of FOIA through the lens of newspaper stories that covered them and the government responses they provoked. The press was not a neutral conduit in reporting FOIA to the public; rather, journalists and editors actively participated both in Congressional hearings that led to the design of the ‘Information Bill,’ as well as in the coverage of the bill and its relation to the power of the executive and legislative branches.",Technologies and the Politics of Information,Communication History

Drawing on archival documents, newspaper reports, trade journals, and handbooks and manuals, this paper uses AT&T as a case study to examine how theater and closed-circuit television were taken up to coordinate and cultivate white-collar workers from 1953 to 1979. Both technologies operated as tools of logistical, cultural, and affective management, providing companies with faster, cheaper, and more efficient means of managing resources over expanding territories. As a distribution channel for training and management communications, television likewise became a crucial interface mediating relationships among workers and with the company, offering a test case for employers interested in borrowing employees’ affective relationship with leisure-time technologies to increase the efficacy of corporate messaging.",Technologies and the Politics of Information,Communication History

During the nineteenth century variants of Morse code evolved to represent the vernaculars of countries to which telegraphy was introduced; for international communication, this posed technical, cultural and social problems. When computer technology developed during the twentieth century, unification of code became crucial for communication across lingual and national boundaries, and for the ability to work with computers in local natural languages. The case of Hebrew presents a peripheral, non-Latin perspective, and points to alternatives which technological innovations eventually suppressed; it unveils the predetermined western configurations of media technologies, and exemplifies the ideological faces of code localization.",Technologies and the Politics of Information,Communication History

By employing a historical review on the literature, we analyze the development of the field of public relations as an academic discipline in Mainland China. Five distinct stages of turmoil have characterized this period. By showing divergent factors affecting academic legitimacy in Mainland China, this study contributes a historical review on public relations discipline in Mainland China within a glocalization context, responding to the call to hear “other” voices in crafting of PR history (L’ Etang, 2008; Watson, 2015).",Technologies and the Politics of Information,Communication History

Due to the massive amount of conversation data, however, it is a challenge to code these discussions manually and make valid claims about the prevalence and effects of uncivil comments. We therefore trained an automated classifier on more than 10,000 hand-coded user comments and used it to predict incivility in user comments in an extensive dataset of more than one million user comments collected on the Facebook sites of nine German news media outlets over a three-months-period in 2015.

Interactions are operationalized as political disagreement/agreement in a two-step flow. We attempt to measure how much disagreement is present in users’ initial reactions to a post and thereafter how much agreement they reach when reacting to each other’s comments. In order to test the method we manually label posts as either political or non-political. Our results show that users clearly position themselves politically when reacting to public posts on Facebook. The overall tendency is for the two-step flow to sustain a political polarization effect. However, we also show that reactions patterns range widely. Some posts elicit much initial disagreement with almost no subsequent agreement, while in other cases users are able to reach high levels of cross-political agreement in reacting to each other’s comments.",Online Discussion and Engagement,Computational Methods

Not surprising, most forums have some kind of moderation, publishing some comments and blocking others. Most plausible, the moderation depends at least partially on characteristics of the comment itself. However, little is known about linguistic characteristics of blocked versus published user-comments.
The current study sought to fill in this void and compared the characteristics of 651.988 published versus blocked comments in one of Germanys oldest newspaper forums (Spiegel online, SPON) using a series of automated content analysis methods (ACAs). Overall, the analyses revealed little differences between blocked and non-blocked user-comments, but the blocked comments were more strongly characterized by swearwords. Noteworthy, not all swearwords were treated equal. We discuss the results in light of the necessity to study published and blocked user-comments with ACAs to understand journalistic gate-keeping routines.",Online Discussion and Engagement,Computational Methods
2018-1355,2018,Paper Session,The Use of Social Media to Determine the Most Important Articles in an Online Debate,1,"When someone wants to study how an issue is portrayed in the media, a common strategy is to perform a content analysis: the researcher gathers a significant sample of the texts from the corpus of all published stories on that issue and scrutinizes those texts. A significant sample might mean a sample that is large enough to be representative of the overall media landscape and therefore useful to make statements that can be generalized. However, in Communication studies, the distribution of media attention is usually uneven: a few stories grab almost all the attention, while the remaining stories are barely noticed by the public. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that a significant sample for Communication studies is a sample that prioritizes the articles with more impact on public opinion. This paper argues that internet data can offer a very convenient and easily available solution for the problem of determining the most significant sample. An increasing amount of people access news pieces through social networks. Therefore, we can use social network data to identify those articles that people pay attention to (and therefore are more valuable when it comes to the influence on public opinion).

However, the discovery of causal chains among interlinked events and their participating actors within large corpora is not well understood. This study develops a novel type of textual features that identify Subject-Verb-Object triplets extracted from online news discourse surrounding climate change, by clustering them into higher-level concepts without drift. We start with a seed list of causal verbs and apply a concept generalization technique to extract causal chains and their participating actors. The advantage of our method lies in its ability to overcome surface variations in textual expression of causal relationships and uncover the domino effects among them. Unlike prior studies, the semi-supervised approach alleviates the need for labor intensive keyword list development and annotated datasets. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach achieves a precision of 82%. Qualitative assessments of top causal chains reveal that the results are consistent with the scientific literature illuminating causal mechanisms underlying the linkages between climatic anomalies and social instability.",Online Discussion and Engagement,Computational Methods

An Antagonistic Discourse of an Anti-Corruption Movement in Russia,1,"Many social activists today argue that we need to expand the frame of reference for democratic struggle from the local to the global. The globalization of outlook, they argue, should help us to stir up imagination so that suppressed possibilities of development can be imagined. But how would this “democratic” globalization differ from “global coloniality” if the conceptual grammar of the former is similar to that of the latter, as the omnipresent usage of such concepts as “modernization” and “development” suggests? Drawing on the discourse theory by Ernasto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, Mouffe’s agonistic model of democracy, and Nico Carpentier’s conceptualization of the antagonistic discourse, this paper analyzes the “progressive” articulations of Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption movement in Russia. It shows how the latter undermined democracy rather than promoted it by uncritically reproducing the discourse of development and modernization and presenting those opposing the suggested “progressive” reforms as “underdeveloped” “barbarians.”",Global Communication and Social Change Top Papers Session,Global Communication and Social Change

The oppressions occur on multiple levels, as results of the interaction across micro-, meso-, and macro-levels.

This study finds that female soldiers are considered as secondary irrespective of their talents, as they maintain feminine characteristics. Even if characters are assimilated into the military system without having physical and mental weaknesses, their bodies are sexually objectified by male voyeuristic gazes. Despite a recent trend of emphasizing strong women in media products, such representation of female soldiers emphasizes the gender hegemony in the society even if the concept of female soldiers is explained as independent and tough spirit that reflects values of neoliberalism, thereby reducing ideas of feminism to strengthening hegemonic masculinity and militarism.",Gendered Expectations and Womanhood: Challenges and Changes,Feminist Scholarship

The topic of the “leftover lady” phenomenon refers to unmarried women over the age of 27 in China. This video became controversial in terms of how female images should be portrayed. This paper explores the socially constructed image of the leftover lady in China and how family values in East Asia have contributed to the construction of the leftover lady image.

Emotional stress for the “leftover ladies” comes from both family and workplace. The research study also explores the participators’ expectation of reconstructing the standard for success in China and reconsidering the way of storytelling in communication practices.",Gendered Expectations and Womanhood: Challenges and Changes,Feminist Scholarship
2018-1365,2018,Paper Session,Phubbing Behavior in Conversations and Its Relation to Conversation Intimacy and Distraction: An Observation Study,3,"This study examines the occurrence, frequency and duration of co-present phone use (‘phubbing’) during a dyadic conversation and its association with conversation partners’ perceived conversation intimacy and distraction. Co-present phone use was measured by covertly observing students having a ten-minute dyadic conversation (N = 100). Afterwards, dyads were approached and asked to complete measures of perceived conversation intimacy and perceived distraction. Results reveal that co-present phone use occurred in 61 of the 100 observed conversations. In 31% of these conversations, the phone screen was shared. When phone use occurred, the average frequency was 3.38 times per dyad, for an average total duration of 194.33 seconds. At the person level, 87 individuals (43.5%) used their phone. Co-present phone use predicted perceived distraction of the conversation partner. Victims of phubbing also perceived the intimacy of the conversation as significantly lower. Few participants correctly recalled the occurrence of phone use during their conversation.",Mobile Communication Top Papers,Mobile Communication

30 million words less than their higher income counterparts (Hart & Risley, 1999; Hart & Risley, 2003). This paper explores parent perceptions and attitudes toward two mobile interventions (Text4Baby and Univision Contigo) designed to support parents’ engagement with their young children as a way of reducing the language gap and improving child outcomes. We conducted eight focus groups with parents who were users of either service. Using general inductive analysis of the transcript data, we found that parents enrolled in the Text4Baby service were relatively unaware of the video text messages and almost never clicked the links. Univision Contigo users, on the other hand, more frequently recalled seeing videos encouraging parent-child interaction and particularly liked that these videos came as multimedia messages (MMS). We interpret findings through a Social Cognitive Theory lens and provide recommendations for incorporating video into parent-targeted mobile interventions.",Mobile Communication Top Papers,Mobile Communication

However, there is a lack of theory-driven quantitative studies that examine factors associated with its use. This study aims to address this research gap by developing and testing a model based on theory of planned behavior, organizational support theory, and it consumerization theory. This model was tested using structural equation modeling based on survey data from 534 staff nurses employed in 19 tertiary-level general hospitals in the Philippines. Results showed that descriptive norm and perceived behavioral control were positively associated with intention while hospital provision of mobile phone was negatively associated with it. Moreover, intention was positively associated with nurses’ use of PMPs for work purposes. Interestingly, nurses’ use of PMPs for work purposes was positively associated with perceived work productivity and perceived quality of care.

2018-1368,2018,Paper Session,Disconnective Affordances: How Young People Disconnect From and Through Mobile Messaging,1,"Mobile messaging is typically understood as a medium that connects people. This paper argues that to better understand mobile messaging we must also attend to its disconnective affordances — the material properties of messaging platforms and mobile devices that enable people to reduce and restrict their availability to and through these technologies. Drawing on interview research into the mobile messaging practices of 24 young people, this paper proposes a typology five of disconnective affordances that participants used to modulate their connections to friends and family, and to mobile devices and platforms. In highlighting these affordances, the paper contributes to emerging literature on the significance of disconnection as a means of understanding digital communication technologies and practices. It also reflects the changing role of mobile communication which is no longer just a means of connecting, but is increasingly a site where connections must be carefully managed and negotiated.",Mobile Communication Top Papers,Mobile Communication
2018-1369,2018,Paper Session,Cue the Future: Bridging Computer-Mediated Communication and Human-Computer Interaction,2,"Since the advent of computing machines, scholars have theorized about the relationship between humans and computers, how people interact with computers, how people interact with one another utilizing computers, and the implications of these machines for the society. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) and human-computer interaction (HCI) are two fields that have made important contributions in understanding the role of computers in communication. With the rise of new multimedia, multisensory, and interactive computing systems, this paper suggests that theories from these fields need to be integrated to inform research about the new media environment. We first provide an overview of how CMC and HCI have evolved in the past few decades. Secondly, we propose a typology of how these fields have conceptualized key concepts like cues and social presence that can help researchers parse out ways of approaching new media technologies. Lastly, we examine several ways that new computing technologies illuminate a need to draw from both perspectives in the discourse regarding humans and computers.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

This study extends SIP to two dimensions of conversational interactivity—response latency and conversational contingency—in dyadic online chats. Numerous customer support chat systems employ techniques such as multicommunicating and the use of scripts that can affect interactivity, and potentially undermine interpersonal assessments, satisfaction, and organizational image. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment, observers watched one of four versions of an onscreen dialogue between a prospective customer and sales support agent. Dialogues differed with respect to the agent’s response latency and conversational contingency. Results supported hypotheses about the deleterious effects of latency and weak contingency on most outcomes, and mediation analyses showed indirect effects of interactivity via interpersonal judgments undermining organizational image.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

The current study investigates how the frequency with which citizens use Twitter and Facebook affects their knowledge acquisition, and how this effect is conditional upon people’s level of political interest. With this focus on social network sites, we shed new light on the “knowledge gap” hypothesis. Using a panel survey design (n = 3,240), results show that more frequent usage of Twitter positively affects learning about current affairs facts. The opposite effects is found for Facebook: Using Facebook more frequently causes a decline in knowledge acquisition. Analyzing the conditionality of this relationship, the negative effect of Facebook usage particularly occurs for citizens without much political interest: This social network site, thus, amplifies the knowledge gap in society.",Communication and Technology Top Papers,Communication and Technology

This research elaborates on the popular smartphone augmented-reality game Pokémon Go by proposing nostalgia as one particular reason for the game’s success. Two studies investigate nostalgia’s contribution to media selection, entertainment experiences, and well-being. Study 1 was conducted in Germany before the game’s release and shows that meaningfulness of Pokémon predicts nostalgia, which in turn motivates users to play the game. Study 2 replicates and extends these findings in an American sample after the game’s release. Again, meaningfulness of Pokémon predicted nostalgia, which mediated the effect of meaningfulness on media enjoyment. Media enjoyment in turn predicted subjective and psychological well-being. Taken together, these findings substantiate research regarding nostalgia’s benefits for well-being and place the phenomenon in the context of media experiences.","Game Effects, Out in the Open, From Persuasion to Emotion",Game Studies

Examining the Effects of Graphic Realism and Issue Proximity on Players’ Willingness to Forward and Donate and the Underlying Mechanisms,2,"Are newsgames appropriate to address serious issues? This study examined the effects of two important news elements, graphic realism and geographic proximity, on players’ willingness to help and the processes underlying these effects. One hundred and sixty-one participants played a modded newsgame in a 2 (realism: high vs. low) x 2 (proximity: high vs. low) experiment. The results showed a moderated mediation model in which suspense fully mediated the interaction effects of realism and proximity on intention to forward the game and donation amount. Realism had an indirect effect on game forwarding through appreciation and led to negative emotion and higher arousal. Realism and proximity did not affect players’ knowledge gained from gameplay, enjoyment, or subsequent behavior to read related news. Players underwent both hedonic and eudaimonic appraisals through newsgames. Realism and proximity are the “spice” in newsgames, and suspense is an important mechanism driving greater willingness to help.","Game Effects, Out in the Open, From Persuasion to Emotion",Game Studies
2018-1374,2018,Paper Session,Reconceptualizing Gameplay Experiences Through the Virtual Embodiment Process,2,"[Theoretical Paper] Abstract

Existing studies on video game experiences often highlight specific components of gameplay or explore specific psychological constructs during gameplay experiences. However, these studies do not adequately explain the processes behind the construction of gaming experiences among different types of players and across different games. Past literature also subsumes game mechanics as only a component that contributes to videogame experience. This paper argues that game mechanics are an integral enabler of gaming experiences and proposes refinements to the conceptualisations of what gameplay experiences entails, taking into consideration the facilitative influence of game mechanics. It proposes to conceptualize gameplay experiences as embodied virtual experiences formed by the interaction between players and game mechanics, facilitating the embodiment of the players within the virtual world of the game.","Game Effects, Out in the Open, From Persuasion to Emotion",Game Studies
2018-1375,2018,Paper Session,Procedural Arguments of Persuasive Games: An Elaboration Likelihood Perspective,4,"RESEARCH PAPER. Studies into the effects of persuasive games – games designed to change players’ attitudes – have not yet yielded insight into the psychological processes involved in persuasion through procedural rhetoric. As a type of non-verbal argument embedded in game systems, it is an open question whether procedural rhetoric leads players to elaborate on a message in the same way as traditionally delivered arguments do. The current study tested 241 participants in a 2 (rhetoric strength) by 2 (level of distraction) experimental setting, with game stimuli generated through analytical game design. Results indicate that procedural rhetoric strength meaningfully adds to persuasive effects. Participants in high-distraction conditions were not driven to process the games’ message differently. After this, we outline the empirical process required to further investigate effects of procedural rhetoric on elaboration, and conclude how the current study contributes to conceptions of arguments borne out through gameplay.","Game Effects, Out in the Open, From Persuasion to Emotion",Game Studies
2018-1376,2018,Paper Session,"Virtual Advertisements in eSports: Effects of Field of View and Animation on Viewers’ Attention, Memory Retention, and Brand Attitudes",5,"POSTER PROPOSAL
As the eSports industry is rapidly growing, eSports has been increasingly seen as an excellent advertising platform. In fact, its advertising revenue is expected to grow beyond that of traditional sports. While numerous big-name companies have started to capitalize on the emerging opportunities in this industry by sponsoring competitive leagues and major eSports events, research on how the design and placement of advertisements influence the effectiveness of virtual advertisements embedded in the broadcasting of eSports still remains limited. In this study, we report on an experiment that examined the effects of field of view (horizontal vs. vertical) and animation (animated vs. non-animated ads) on viewer experiences such as attention, memory retention, and attitudes towards the advertised brands. The results (n = 120) showed that horizontally placed virtual ads resulted in greater attention in terms of fixation count and fixation duration, and better memory retention among participants. There was also a significant main effect of animation on fixation duration. Implications for research in new media marketing as well as practical considerations for industry practitioners are discussed.","Game Effects, Out in the Open, From Persuasion to Emotion",Game Studies
2018-1377,2018,Paper Session,Attitude Extremity: A Force Against the Spiral of Silence,3,"The spiral of silence predicts that people will choose not to express their opinion if they think that opinion is not shared by a majority, leading to the silencing of minority opinions. This study identifies the conditions that motivate as well as inhibit this phenomenon. It categorizes people into four groups based on their attitude extremity and perceived opinion status. The survey data regarding two issues (same-sex marriage and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) showed that the categorical variable (four groups), compared to a binary variable (majority versus minority) and a continuous variable (the difference between one’s position and the perception about a majority), was the strongest predictor of willingness to express opinions. The findings suggest that if a majority does not hold extreme attitudes, minority opinion holders who hold extreme attitudes may be able to stop or reverse the spiral of silence.",Talking (or Not Talking) About Politics,Political Communication
2018-1378,2018,Paper Session,Hidden Voices of Citizenship: Political Dissent in Rural Texas,1,"Despite well-sorted regions across the United States (Bishop, 2009; Mason, 2016), there still exist members of the public who dissent from the majority in their community. Previous research has considered how one’s social context influences the extent to which one is politically expressive or active. Yet much of this work has focused on public forms of expression and organizing and not ones that occur outside the public eye. Rural contexts are one place where public dissent is especially risky because residents lack anonymity and rely on local patronage for livelihood. Instead, rural residents may organize outside the public eye. This study offers evidence that this is in fact the case. Through a series of in-depth interviews, this study documents the experiences of a hidden political organization in a rural community in Texas. More specifically, this study explores how the members organize in secret, why they do so, and the effect the organization has on their political participation and expression in public. Findings offer several implications. First, they suggest that rural communities face unique challenges in expressing dissent. Second, that hidden organizations in rural communities may serve as incubators, mobilizing members to take their opinions and political activity public. Finally, this study expands the scope of research on political expression and organizing to consider the role of hidden organizing, which grows increasingly likely in a polarized political climate.",Talking (or Not Talking) About Politics,Political Communication

Race and racism became particularly prominent in the 2016 presidential election campaign. This study employs nationally representative survey data (N = 600) from parents of school-aged (6 to 17 years old) children to understand the frequency of parents talking to their children about racism in a campaign media environment that highlighted issues of race. Moreover, we examine factors that predict race talk drawn from the ethnic-racial socialization, child development, and political communication literature. Our results suggest important associations between parents talking to their child about racism and: parent race and partisanship, general parenting styles, general interpersonal communication with the child, and campaign-related media and discussion measures. Future research should attend to matters of talk initiation, the content of these parent-child conversations, and their political implications.",Talking (or Not Talking) About Politics,Political Communication
2018-1382,2018,Paper Session,Catching Up On Crisis: Effects of Crisis Attributes on Emotions and Information Channel Preferences,2,"Incorporating crisis communication, emotion, and media choice literature, this manuscript explores the effects of crisis attributes on publics’ discrete emotions and information channel selection. An experiment was conducted (N = 1100) and the structural equation modeling was performed. The findings show that crisis attributes (uncertainty, urgency, severity) indirectly affect channel selection through crisis emotions. Crisis attributes collectively elicit more fear and anxiety (attribution-independent emotions) than anger and sympathy (attribution-dependent emotions). People who face more uncertainty in general require more concrete information and do not have channel preferences, while crisis urgency prompts individuals to seek out non-traditional media channels. People turn to more credible channels when the crisis is perceived severe. Attribution-dependent emotions play a significant mediating role between crisis attributes and information channel selection. These findings stress the heuristic value of the crisis attributes and the need to study publics’ communicative behavior on various channels during crises with crisis emotions as a key factor.",Feelings and Emotions in Crisis Communication,Public Relations
2018-1383,2018,Paper Session,Empathy as a Driver of Consumers’ Attitudinal Responses to Organizational Crises and Crisis Communication,4,"This study provides a deeper understanding of how organizational crises and crisis communication affect organizational reputation. Prior research emphasizes the importance of attributions of organizational responsibility in this process. By means of two experiments this study shows that the public’s empathy towards organizations in crisis provides an additional explanation for the impact of crises and crisis communication on reputation. The first experiment shows that responsibility attributions generated by the crisis type (victim vs. preventable) impact post-crisis reputation both directly and indirectly through empathy. Lower levels of organizational responsibility induce higher levels of empathy, which minimizes reputational damage. A second study illustrates that the outcomes of communication strategies can also be explained by empathy towards the organization. An organizational apology, contrary to denial, arouses empathy and subsequently increases reputation repair. These findings provide an explanation for the positive impact of apologies on post-crisis reputation, which was repeatedly established in prior research.",Feelings and Emotions in Crisis Communication,Public Relations

Situated in this major gap, the current investigation adopts a community-centered approach that combines insights from chaos theory, uncertainty reduction theory, and sensemaking theory. This study used a mixed method design to examine the role of a campus community in dealing with a variety of campus crises. The qualitative study gave an in-depth understanding of how a crisis is perceived and the underlying process of how a community helps to make sense of a crisis. The quantitative study tested and further illustrated this process through path analysis. The major contributions of this study to the current crisis communication literature are twofold: (1) a crisis-induced community building model that demonstrates a community’s role in helping community members self-organize, collectively make sense of a crisis, and reproduce community experiences; and (2) instruments to measure a crisis and community functionalities.

It proposes that stakeholders’ sympathy towards the corporations, feeling sorry for their failure, emerges under particular circumstances and will influence their reappraisal of the crisis situation, which may lead to attitude and behavior changes. Further studies need to define and measure sympathy towards the corporation as a discrete emotion and test the hypotheses related to its influence on stakeholders’ way of information processing. Accordingly, more investigations and test of hypotheses are needed to see if the sympathy will lead to expression of sympathy in the public sphere. It is also interesting to see how the prospective stakeholders perceive or react to this kind of sympathy emotion.",Feelings and Emotions in Crisis Communication,Public Relations
2018-1386,2018,Paper Session,Analyzing State-led Political Trolling Using Ground Truth Data From South Korea,4,"Political astroturfing has been regarded as a serious normative and practical challenge for communication on social media. Yet, due to the lack of a ""ground truth"", most research on this topic has so far relied on imprecise identification strategies that are difficult to evaluate. In this paper, we examine the behavior of over 100 South Korean Twitter accounts which, according to related court documents, were part of a secret astroturfing campaign launched by the National Intelligence Service in favor of the eventual winner of the 2012 presidential election, Park Geun-hye. We show that these astroturfing accounts exhibit behavior clearly distinguishable from regular Twitter users. Even though this reflects considerable coordination and resources involving many accounts manned by humans, our analysis shows only a limited impact of astroturfing within the overall network when considering metrics of Twitter influence. Furthermore, we used the identified astroturfing patterns to detect additional accounts, which confirms the limited impact of astroturfing. We presume that regular users are relatively immune to political messages by unknown accounts and discuss implications for the literature on astroturfing and social bots.",Elites and Social Media: The Nature and Effects of Political Leader and Interest Group Use of Social Media,Political Communication

By promoting their personal agenda, politicians increasingly profile themselves independent from their associated parties on the web (i.e., self-personalization). By focusing on self-personalization as a multilayered concept (i.e., professional, emotional, private self-personalization), this study investigates both the use and consequences of self-personalization on Facebook. A manual content analysis of politicians’ Facebook posts (N = 435) reveals that self-personalization is indeed often used as a communication style on Facebook, and is most often present in visual communication. Moreover, the study shows that the use of a more emotional and private style provides a beneficial tool for politicians’ impression management. Publishing emotional and private content yields positive effects on audience engagement, suggesting audiences’ demand for more intimate and emotional impressions of public figures on the web.",Elites and Social Media: The Nature and Effects of Political Leader and Interest Group Use of Social Media,Political Communication

Through multilevel negative binomial models, we find in first place that while the presence of elements of popularization in leaders’ messages boosts users’ bond engagement (number of likes), it actually depresses levels of bridge engagement (number of shares). Secondly, our research reveals that messages published by populist leaders, irrespective of their content, are more capable than those by non-populists to arouse users’ reactions, both in terms of bond and bridge engagement. Finally, we find that when populist leaders adopt popularization as communicative style on social media, they do not get any significant comparative extra gain or loss vis a vis non-populist actors.",Elites and Social Media: The Nature and Effects of Political Leader and Interest Group Use of Social Media,Political Communication

Our study focuses on male versus female politicians’ ability to engage social media users during an election campaign, using the Israeli 2015 campaign as our case study. Female politicians’ posts generated significantly more user engagement in terms of the number of Likes and Shares in comparison to male politicians, while generating the same number of participants in their discussions. The results remained significant in a multilevel analysis, while controlling for other factors such as the politician’s age, party, and ranking. The evidence strongly indicates that social media provides greater opportunities than traditional media for female politicians to promote themselves and improve their status in the political power-play.",Elites and Social Media: The Nature and Effects of Political Leader and Interest Group Use of Social Media,Political Communication
2018-1390,2018,Paper Session,An Effective Weapon for the Weak? Social Media and Interest Groups’ Media Success,3,"Interest groups increasingly use social media to influence news media coverage. We ask, to what extent groups’ activity on social media predicts their success in influencing media coverage and how this depends on groups’ resources. The study is based on a dataset of 1185 Finnish interest groups, combining a survey and an analysis of groups’ media appearances. We find that activity in social media predicts groups’ media success, but traditional ways of influencing the media are more effective. While resource-poor groups’ social media activity predicts their agenda-building success, only resource-rich groups gain access to news by being active in social media. We argue that resource-poor groups succeed in agenda-building because they benefit from the “network media logic”, where distribution of information depends more on popularity than professional gatekeepers. Gaining access to news, in contrast, depends on the “mass media logic”, where brands and resources, characteristic of collective action, matter more.",Elites and Social Media: The Nature and Effects of Political Leader and Interest Group Use of Social Media,Political Communication

It does so because space and practice reflexively account for each other. In other words, space may constrain or enable practice, as the literature abundantly illustrates, but practices also define and shape space. Rather than emphasizing either of these two options, they should be understood as integral to each other, and it is precisely their reflexive relation that contributes to organizing, as space participates in making practice recognizably similar through time.","Time, Space, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

Team cognition, a group property developed through iterative communicative interactions, has been found to be one of the most robust predictors of effective collaboration, but is often difficult to assess. We develop a text analytic approach of communication to intuit the underlying patterns of shared cognition within and between organizational groups. We leverage this approach to understand shared cognition among teams involved in the three manned missions to the Unites States’ first space station, Skylab. Text analysis of the communication networks within each 3-man crew and between crews and mission control reveal team cognition patterns that effectively distinguish the two successful, from the one problematic Skylab mission where the crew took an unscheduled day off remembered infamously as going “on strike in space.” This work suggests that textual analysis of communication networks provide a valuable diagnostic for large, distributed groups.","Time, Space, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

This unique qualitative case study focuses on the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team, an IOC set up to repair the city infrastructure after the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. Semi-structured interviews with internal stakeholders and direct observations provided the descriptive data that was analysed using an inductive approach to produce an explanatory model to account for the interplay between the sociality and collective identity (re)construction. This sociality was embodied in ongoing social interactions among members of the IOC and relationships with their home organizations. Moreover, it evolved over the lifespan of the IOC in concert with stakeholders’ identity trajectory.

Moreover, research indicates that self-transcendent media experiences can broaden our thought-action repertoires and build various personal resources associated with well-being and prosociality (e.g., sharing). The results from this study indicate that self-transcendent videos indeed elicit mixed affect indicated by both positive and negative emotional responses reflected by activation of the corrugator and orbicularis oculi major muscle regions (fEMG activation). Skin conductance, an indicator of psychological arousal, was also greater for these videos relative to funny videos. Further, when specific self-transcendent content (i.e., depictions of gratitude) appeared in self-transcendent videos, participant responses become more positive, less negative, and more arousing. The self-report data indicate that these emotions might indeed result in prosociality evidenced by greater intentions to share the videos with others.","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems
2018-1397,2018,Paper Session,"Personalization as a Process of Matching Identity: The Interplay of Message Valence, Identity Desirability, and Uniqueness",3,"The essence of personalized communication is to match a message to the message recipient’s self-identity. However, prior studies in the personalization literature mostly focus on matching a positive message to a person’s desired identity. No known research has discussed the possibility of matching a negative message to a person’s undesired identity. The current study aims to fill this theoretical gap by testing a three-way interaction effect between message valence, identity desirability, and uniqueness on attitude. Through a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment, it is shown that a positive message tends to generate a more favorable attitude when matched to the message recipient’s desired self-identity, whereas a negative message will generate a more favorable attitude when matched to the person’s undesired self-identity, and such an effect is especially pronounced when the identity is unique. Perceived message credibility is found to be the mediator of this three-way interaction effect.","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems

In this paper, selfies publicly posted on Instagram (N=1873) were analyzed to see if manipulative self-presentation, operationalized as the use of photo filters in selfies, is negatively related to social media users’ evaluation of the person in the selfie. The data showed that using photo filters in selfies was associated with fewer likes received from other social media users. In addition, use of social cues in selfies is positively associated with higher number of likes on Instagram. Theoretical and practical implications of these phenomena are also discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems
2018-1399,2018,Paper Session,Heuristic Credibility Perceptions of Social Media Content: The Effect of Self-Confirmation and Social Endorsement,3,"Users of social network sites face the challenge to evaluate the credibility of various types of content in their news feeds. Given the cursory exposure, we assume that this process takes place in a heuristic mode. Therefore, we examined the effect of self-confirmation and social endorsement on credibility perceptions. In an online experiment (n=359) participants were exposed to two fictitious ‘fact postings’ that contained either information consistent with, neutral to, or inconsistent with their pre-existing attitudes towards genetically modified food and gender mainstreaming. Additionally, the user comments below the postings were either challenging or not challenging the content’s credibility. Results confirm that attitude consistency has a direct impact on perceived credibility and, hence, support the assumption of a self-confirmation heuristic. User comments, however, had no direct influence on the credibility evaluation, but a minor interaction effect with attitude consistency.","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems
2018-1400,2018,Paper Session,Saving Face in Front of the Computer? Culture Influences Cardiovascular Reactions to Facial Emotion Recognition Software,2,"Display rules provide a useful concept to explain cross-cultural differences in emotional expressivity. According research suggests that cultures rooted in collectivism uphold norms of emotional suppression and “other-focused” emotions (e.g., shame), in contrast to ideals of unfiltered self-expression of “ego-focused” emotions (e.g., pride) in individualistic societies. Inspired by the advancement of digital technology, we investigate if similar effects apply to the interaction with emotionally aware computers. We introduce 47 Chinese and 42 German participants to emotion recognition software, claiming it would analyze their facial expressions during a cognitive task. Manipulating the analysis’ result to read “proud” or “ashamed”, we measure participants’ cardiovascular response and technology acceptance. Despite similar initial increases in heart rate, Chinese participants’ arousal declines significantly faster, highlighting adaptive suppression mechanisms. As we observe no influence by the allegedly recognized type of emotion, we infer that emotion-specific display rules are loosened when faces are read by computers.","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems
2018-1401,2018,Paper Session,The Influence of Personal Opinion on the Exemplification Effect,3,"When people estimate the public opinion regarding an issue, studies showed that base-rate information (i.e., statistics) about the distribution of opinions is less influential than exemplars (i.e., case reports) that are presented in media coverage. We assume that the effect of both, exemplars and base-rate information, depends on whether they are consistent or inconsistent with the personal opinion. In a 2 (base-rate information pro/contra the issue) x 2 (exemplars pro/contra the issue) between-subject experiment we tested whether the cues for public opinion are still influential when they are inconsistent with the personal opinion. Findings showed that exemplars and base-rate information are influential even when they are inconsistent with the personal opinion, but only under the condition that they are consistent with each other (i.e., the media coverage in itself is consonant).","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems
2018-1402,2018,Paper Session,Challenging the Self: Counter-Stereotypic Media Characters and Narrative Impact on Female Audiences‘ Gender Self-Concepts,2,"Past research shows that women tend to underestimate their cognitive abilities compared to men. Based on the proposition that gender stereotyped associations of instrumental traits (e.g., self-confidence) with masculinity partially account for this, this study investigates how counter-stereotypic female protagonists in narrative entertainment media may function as role models and strengthen instrumental self-concepts of female audiences. In a 2x2 (+1 control) web-based experimental survey, female respondents (n=276) viewed a video clip featuring a story about a counter-stereotypic female protagonist. Even though both manipulations (perceived expressiveness of the protagonist and level of appreciation) were unsuccessful, the study provides insights into the relationship between viewers’ perception of gender stereotypes in character representation and gender self-concepts regarding the role of narrative involvement (identification, transportation) and non-hedonic entertainment experiences. The relationship between perceived expressiveness of the protagonist and instrumental self-concepts was fully mediated by identification and moderated by appreciation, but not by transportation.","HIGH-DENSITY: The Role of Personalization, Disclosure, and Identity in Information Processing",Information Systems

We introduce several analytic dimensions and PHI governance models, and illustrate these issues in an emerging case, the current Google DeepMind Health PHI controversy in the UK National Health Service. Through our analysis, we address what governance structures (e.g., laws, technical protections, or organizations addressing data sharing arrangements) can help individuals effectively find voice in how their data are governed and (re)used, and the need for greater transparency in big data analytics with regards to AI/machine learning and intellectual property constraints.","Regulating the ""Personal"" in Communication Policy",Communication Law & Policy

2018-1405,2018,Paper Session,Regulation of Islamic Veils as Symbolic Politico-Religious Expressions: The Case of the United States and France,1,"The United States and France are e known for their different establishmentalities; ideological conceptualizations of the role and place of religion in the public sphere. The United States has a First Amendment, anti-establishmentarian creed, which forbids the government from establishing official state religions or interfering with the free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted the free exercise clause to mean the government must neither promote nor hinder religion. In France, the official dogma is secular republicanism, a regime of strict separation of church and state in which the state is a counter-Church whose task is to prevent the “seepage” of religion into the public sphere. These establishmentarian logics have, in recent years, been confronted with the problem of Muslim veils. This paper compares and contrasts American and French regulation of Muslim veils in public places. Though both countries are Western nations, their different postures towards Muslim veils shows that they have a lot of differences in their similarity.","Regulating the ""Personal"" in Communication Policy",Communication Law & Policy
2018-1406,2018,Paper Session,Legal and Illegal Listening: Considering Legal and Cultural Factors in Digital Music,1,"In late September 2017, a European Parliament member unearthed a study on piracy. Its findings revealed no certain connection between piracy and any sort of sales displacement. What is most likely is that a more complicated relationship between piracy and legal sales exists. This paper suggests that a balanced view that takes particular legal contexts, on one hand, and cultural factors, on the other, into consideration will provide a more effective framework than either legal studies or cultural studies tools on their own. As a media example, digital music will be explored from both angles: specific legal contexts within Europe and the U.S., as well as the important cultural roles of both legal and illegal online listening. The main conclusion of this exploration is that listening is reductively categorized because of current epistemological regimes, and that illegal and legal listening play an equally important role in the understanding of digital media consumption.","Regulating the ""Personal"" in Communication Policy",Communication Law & Policy
2018-1407,2018,Paper Session,Digitalization and Communication Rights: Finnish Challenges and Solutions,8,"The Nordic countries have been in the forefront of building digitalized media systems to serve their citizens. This development could be understood under the tradition of the epistemic commons that have recently been challenged by contradictions, between national and global, economy/competitiveness; security/secrecy, and accelerating polarization of societies. The role of the individual has become central, and with that, the concept of communication rights. However, little scholarly attention has gone into operationalizing rights in concrete policy contexts.

This paper introduces findings of our research project on Communication Rights, Digitalization, and the Finnish Society (2016-2017). We discuss rights as normative and employ them for understanding communication as four categories: Access, Availability, Dialogical rights, and Privacy. We operationalize each category in relation to: the regulatory-normative framework, the public sector, the commercial media and communications technology providers, and the citizen-consumers. We then reflect findings on “megatrends” such as technological convergence, globalization, and social inequality.","Regulating the ""Personal"" in Communication Policy",Communication Law & Policy

There is speculation that television exposure at young ages might harm children’s executive function (EF). We explored the relations between television exposure and EF among 12-18-month-old children, using parent reports of infant media exposure and observations of infant performance on EF tasks designed for infants. We found that exposure to the American public television network, PBS, was related to better EF performance. Exposure to more background television in the home and more viewing of commercial networks and videos aimed at babies were related to worse EF performance. We observed that infants displaying a fussier temperament during our assessment were less likely to watch PBS and more likely to watch entertainment, network television. These results are discussed in light of research showing similar trends among older children.","Early Years, Early Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

Two-year-olds (N = 88) played a hide-and-seek game in which they used information from a video (an animated bear hiding behind objects) to solve a real-life problem (finding a bear sticker on a corresponding felt board). To watch the bear hide, toddlers watched without touching the screen, touched a relevant part of the screen (the bear), or touched an irrelevant part of the screen (a star). Two-thirds of children (N = 58) were eye-tracked during each of four trials in order to record cognitive processing while the bear hid on the screen. Other games assessed vocabulary and working memory. Toddlers’ performance on the hide-and-seek game was moderated by age, working memory, media interactivity, and selective attention.","Early Years, Early Media",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1410,2018,Paper Session,The Effects of Exposure to Misinformation in Science TV on Children’s Science Knowledge,2,"Misinformation pervades popular media. Although much research has documented the detrimental effects of exposure to media misinformation on adults, few studies have examined children’s responses. The current project examines the presence and effects of scientific misinformation in children’s television. A content analysis (Study 1) revealed that various forms of scientific misinformation are prevalent in children’s educational science TV. However, there was reason to believe that the most common types of misinformation identified might actually benefit children’s science knowledge. Integrating predictions afforded by Fisch’s Capacity Model and Conceptual Change theory, an experiment (Study 2) found that children learned more from exposure to science content depicted with anthropomorphic visuals, but that they struggled to learn from narratives that attempted to explicitly correct their existing misconceptions. These results illuminate age constraints to previous conclusions regarding the effects of exposure to misinformation in media.","Early Years, Early Media",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1411,2018,Paper Session,Effects of Haptic Movement and Hotspot Salience on the Usability and Educational Effectiveness of Children’s Educational Apps,4,"Given the increasing popularity of literacy apps among young children, it is vital to take a closer look at the design of apps as well as their effects. Current theory suggests that when the design of an app is mismatched with the child’s abilities (e.g., the task is too easy or too difficult), educational content comprehension is likely to suffer as a result of poor usability. This study investigated how tactile and visual features affect children’s vocabulary learning as well as explore how usability plays a role this relationship. An experiment among 128 children aged 4-5 showed that, although children were able to learn words from the app in a relatively short time, the manipulation of both features did not lead to improved vocabulary learning. The findings did reveal that cognitively-easier visual (salient or non-salient hotspots) as well as tactile (tapping and dragging) features affected different attributes of usability.","Early Years, Early Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

Assessing the Bi-Directional Longitudinal Relationship between Gaming and Intelligence in Early Childhood,3,"This study investigated the bi-directional longitudinal relationship between children’s digital game use and their fluid intelligence (i.e., problem-solving skills). Specifically, this study tested whether digital games affect children’s fluid intelligence (effects hypothesis), whether children with higher levels of fluid intelligence are more attracted to digital games (selection hypothesis), or both (a transactional relationship). The study also investigated potential bi-directional relationships between games and crystallized intelligence (i.e., general knowledge). Using data from 943 children aged 3 to 7 years (52% girls) across four waves with one-year intervals, findings for fluid intelligence indicated partial support for the effects hypothesis and no evidence for the selection hypothesis. Digital game use was not related to children’s crystallized intelligence. Results suggest that digital games can move the needle for fluid intelligence, but more insight is needed to identify how this process occurs and in which situations this is most likely.","Early Years, Early Media",Children Adolescents and the Media

An Experimental Investigation of Using Smartphones During Face-to-Face Communication,2,"Previous studies of smartphone use during face-to-face communication produced contradictory results, either revealing it as a source of disturbance or as an enrichment to the conversation. This inconsistency can be explained in terms of insufficient differentiation regarding type of use. Therefore, an experimental 4×1 between-subjects design was conducted to investigate potential effects of smartphone use in moments of physical co-presence in a more differentiated manner. Participants (N = 402) were randomly assigned to four different experimental groups (integrating a smartphone into conversation, interrupting the conversation proactively or reactively, or not using a smartphone at all). Results indicate that when the main conversation was interrupted, the perceived attentiveness and politeness of the interlocutor as well as the conversational quality decreased significantly. Contrary to expectations, the interaction could not be improved by an integrative smartphone use as these three aspects were merely upheld.

Cultural beliefs, stereotypes are some of the social constructions used to perpetuate mental illness stigma. The purpose of this study was to describe the nature of stigma communication associated with mental illness, beliefs and stereotypes underpinning mental illness stigma. Generally, the findings indicate nature of mental illness stigma communication is an intersection of stigma messages, cultural beliefs, and stereotypes associated with mental illness. Cultural beliefs associated with mental illness are inextricably intertwined with the perceived cause of mental illness (which include curses, witchcraft, cultural misdemeanor, and possession by spirits or demons). Symptoms of mental illness (mainly aggression and nudity) mark the mentally ill as different and give them away for labelling by the rest of the community. Generally the mentally ill are stereotyped as aggressive, symbol of shame and unpredictable. The study findings evidences a notable form of silencing, discrimination, exclusion and marginalization of individuals suffering from mental illness across different cultural groups as a result of low levels of awareness about etiology of mental illness among many African communities. Culturally appropriate awareness campaigns focused at increasing the understanding about the causes of mental illness among African communities would greatly demystify and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.","Health Communication, Attributions of Responsibility, and Stigma",Health Communication

However, relatively little research has examined how individual message features of those representations may influence the development of parasocial interaction and, thus, the effectiveness of parasocial contact in the reduction of outgroup bias and health stigma. One message feature that may be of particular importance when examining health stigma is attribution of responsibility.

Two experiments mirror these phases to study intrapersonal and interpersonal OER, focusing on emotion intensity and feedback’s potential to elicit emotion regulation strategies. Additionally, the role of relational closeness is studied. Happiness and sadness downregulated after sharing and after feedback, with sadness downregulating more than happiness. Cognitive reappraisal was higher in case of cognitive feedback (S1,S2) while relational closeness had a main effect on expressive suppression (S1). Cognitive feedback was important to elicit happiness upregulation, while affective feedback downregulated sadness (S2).

Negative violations were associated with lower satisfaction compared to baseline for received likes, while positive violations were associated with greater satisfaction compared to baseline for received comments. We also found that having a mismatch between expected and actual responsive audience is related to lower satisfaction.

This study examines how providers at a pediatric clinic discussed WW with parents during medical visits, with an emphasis on identifying ways to improve the delivery and uptake of WW advice. We recorded 28 medical visits involving a patient with a diagnosis of AOM and discussion of a WW approach to treatment. WW advice was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, employing the AAP guidelines as a framework for evaluation. Quantitative analyses indicated that providers often omit discussion of one or more of the five elements specified by the AAP guidelines. Symptom monitoring was most likely to be discussed; adverse effects of antibiotics least likely. Qualitative analyses revealed several limitations in how providers address the five elements, such as attributing the choice of WW to the likelihood of the illness. Findings indicate that delivery of WW advice may need improvement to better educate and motivate parents and providers would likely benefit from greater clarity in AAP guidelines.",Competitive Papers in Patient-Provider Communication,Health Communication

This study focuses on how the quantity and quality of medic-patient communication influences their relationship, and how the relationship at individual level, institution level and society level influences patients’ medication adherence. The results of a survey (N=421) show that consulting time is positively associated with patients’ relationship with individual doctors and the whole medical system, as well as their satisfaction with hospital. Unpleasant experiences such as bribing the doctors or having disputes with medical workers, are negatively associated with the medic-patient relationship in a hospital and the whole society. The doctor-patient relationship plays a fundamental role in affecting patients’ unconditional adherence. Satisfaction with hospital is positively linked with conditional adherence.",Competitive Papers in Patient-Provider Communication,Health Communication

Initial research has demonstrated that they positively impact patient-provider communication and patients’ health knowledge, but little is known about their impact in the cancer setting, where highly complex and uncertain medical data is available for patients to view. To better understand communicative behaviors and perceptions of the patient portal and how it is utilized in oncology, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 participants: 35 patients and 13 oncologists. Thematic analysis identified that portals help to enhance participation during in-person consultations, increase patients’ self-advocacy and builds rapport with providers. However, patients’ comfort level with reviewing information via the portal depended upon the severity of the test. Oncologists worried about patient anxiety and widening health disparities, but acknowledged that the portal can motivate them to expedite communication about laboratory and scan results.",Competitive Papers in Patient-Provider Communication,Health Communication

The introduction of an opioid during surgical recovery is correlated with long-term opioid dependence, suggesting surgeons are gatekeepers to addiction. Surgeons must balance PCC directives, including shared decision-making, informing patients, and relationship building, with the societal imperative to safeguard opioids from misuse, abuse, and diversion. To understand surgical opioid-prescribing conversations, we interviewed trauma and surgery residents at an academic medical center. We employed qualitative descriptive analysis to generate four themes reflecting tension points related to the delivery of PCC during opioid-prescription communication in the trauma care context: a) shared decision-making and authority, b) providing information and managing patient expectations, c) relationship building and ethical boundaries, and d) balancing patient satisfaction with vigilance in opioid prescribing.",Competitive Papers in Patient-Provider Communication,Health Communication
2018-1434,2018,Paper Session,The Political Economy of Global Memory: Shared Memory of Global Conflict in Captain America: The First Avenger,2,"Recent scholarship explores the possibility of a global collective memory in which networked individuals transiting national, class, and ethnic boundaries create commonality from shared difference. Yet the public past's representation remains influenced by powerful entities such as governments and corporations, and resources made available, particularly by the popular culture industry, will likely shape globally shared memories. This study documents an instance of commercially mediated global memory, showing how Captain America: The First Avenger revised the original comic’s World War II backdrop to appeal to global audiences who would have been dire enemies during the period the film depicts. Scholars positing cosmopolitan memory might agree there is value in representing the world coming together to defeat a common enemy. However, the relativization of historical depravities gives cause for concern. Suggesting such acts are not truly our own but rather visited upon us by non-human strangers elides the uncomfortable history we share.","Political Economy, Culture and Media",Mass Communication

This paper studies how the news media’s partisan and commercial interests vary across different ownership models and how these interests relate to the proprietors’ values. Through a case study of commercially-run, mainstream newspapers’ coverage of anti-industrialisation protests in the east Indian city of Kolkata and drawing on the theoretical approach of political economy of communication, this study argues the importance of specific forms of power, wielded by individual owners, rather than specific models. This paper proposes a typology of the power of media ownership, based on the “extra-economic” interests of individual proprietors.","Political Economy, Culture and Media",Mass Communication
2018-1436,2018,Paper Session,The Media as Part of the Elite? Exploring Anti-Media Populism and its Relation to Political Populism,2,"Populist political actors do not only critize political elites for not representing the people, but often also count the established media among the elite. This paper aims at exploring such anti-media populist attitudes among the general public and how they are connected to political populism that focuses on criticism of political actors. A further goal is to propose a scale for measuring these anti-media populist attitudes and to estimate their prevalence in the general population. A representative CATI survey among the German population shows that anti-media populist attitudes are not held by a majority of the general public but rather apply to a specific group of society. Confirming a relation between political populism and anti-media populist attitudes, the results indicate that citizens who have developed a populist worldview do indeed evaluate the media in congruence with this overall ideology and include the media in their conceptions of an elite conspiracy by depicting them as part of an elite that betrays the people.","Political Economy, Culture and Media",Mass Communication

A Comparative Content Analysis of Online Populist Communication at Election and Routine Periods,2,"Despite the central role attributed to social media as a forum for populist communication, empirical research on its central content features is scarce. To move forward within this research field, this study aims to provide in-depth insights into both content and contextual factors shaping the expression of populist communication online. Specifically, this paper draws on an extensive comparative content analysis of the Twitter and Facebook accounts of 13 leading political parties in a six-weeks pre- and four-weeks post-election timeframe in Austria and the Netherlands (N = 1,300). The preliminary results suggest that the right-wing populist actors Geert Wilders and Heinz-Christian Strache expressed more populist rhetoric in their direct communication than non-populist actors. People centrality or “empty” populism was however also expressed by mainstream politicians and opposition parties. These findings have important implications for research on online populism, demonstrating which factors shape the expression of populist communication on Twitter and Facebook.","Political Economy, Culture and Media",Mass Communication

It is not clear whether people find fact checking (1) credible and (2) persuasive. These questions are particularly compelling for strong issue partisans who, in the face of a disagreeable fact check, may be motivated to protect their own opinions. The experimental design focused on the gun regulation debate and respondents were recruited from two prominent national organizations, one advocating for gun rights and the other for policies to reduce gun violence. Respondents filled out an online questionnaire which included manipulations of pro- or counter-attitudinal fact check reports. The questionnaire measured beliefs about gun-related issues as well as evaluations of media reports and the fact checks themselves. The data provide convincing evidence that, despite partisans’ perceptions that fact checks are hostile, fact-checking can have a narrow persuasive effect on substantive factual beliefs.",Misinformation and Correction,Mass Communication

Results from a mediated-moderation model show that political fact checks primarily operate through increasing fact-check-related anxiety (an affective mechanism) and not enhancing cognitive elaboration of the story or fact check content (a rational processing mechanism).

First, this paper uses techniques from linguistics to analyse over 200,000 articles mentioning migration-related terms in nine UK national newspapers between 2001-15. It identifies six second-level agendas associated with migration: economy; criminality; legislation/policy; sociocultural aspects; geographic origins; and the scale/pace of migration. Then, using these agendas as inputs for time series models, the paper assesses to what extent they have influenced British public concern about migration. It finds that mentioning the scale and pace of migration raises concern, but only among left-leaning outlets. Meanwhile, mentions of immigration’s sociocultural dimensions also raise public concern, but only in right-leaning outlets. These results hold among a smaller subsample of publications extending to 1997.","Immigration: Coverage, Rhetoric and Their Effects",Political Communication

But it is unclear whether such a function should also be attributed to counter-publics on the extreme right, which often do not support liberal-democratic values. This study aims at clarifying the (un)democratic character of right-wing counter-publics by way of a standardized multimodal content analysis of posts (n=716) and comments (n=649) found on the Facebook pages of six German right-wing media outlets, parties, and movements as well as two hyperpartisan Facebook-only “news pages.” Coding focused on textual and visual elements through which refugees are constructed as “enemies” as well as additional criteria of discourse quality. On the level of the Facebook posts, the construction of refugees as enemies became consistently more intense, the more extreme the respective page’s overall position was, indicating a heterogeneous actor set in the right-wing counter-public. On the level of user comments, however, constructions turned out more similar across different pages hinting at a more homogeneous right-wing discourse arena that binds moderate and extreme elements together. In conclusion, normative implications are discussed.","Immigration: Coverage, Rhetoric and Their Effects",Political Communication

This research finds that in the years leading up to Brexit, UKIP presented themselves as a rigid core-issue complete-populist party. Content analysis of party news releases shows how pervasive the EU was in much of party output and in contemporaneous newspaper coverage of the party. The party also utilizes complete-populist rhetoric, but with excluding populism as the most prevalent form. There is evidence that at election times the party turns more to populist messaging rather than policy discussion. The consistent concentration on the EU and populist messaging, relayed by the newspapers may have helped afford UKIP issue-eliteness in the referendum campaign. But this same work may have also ultimately contributed to make them irrelevant by 2017.","Immigration: Coverage, Rhetoric and Their Effects",Political Communication

This has made it more important to understand people’s attitudes towards immigration – including the effects of media use. Differentiating between attitudes toward different forms of immigration, immigration from different parts of the world, and perceptions of the impact of immigration, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of media use on attitudes toward different types of immigration and on perceptions of the impact of immigration. The study is based on a three-year, three-wave panel study, allowing us to investigate the effects of media use on the individual level. Among other things, results show that there are some, but limited, effects of using traditional news media but significant effects of using anti-immigration, right-wing alternative media as well as of using pro-immigration, left-wing alternative media.","Immigration: Coverage, Rhetoric and Their Effects",Political Communication

This article engages with the role of migration news in the emergence of the hostile media effect, by taking advantage of an experimental design set against the backdrop of the ongoing ‘migrant crisis’ in Macedonia. We demonstrate how prior opinions on migration affect the perception of media bias in individuals exposed to two overarching representations of migration: the humanitarian and the security frame. In addition, we investigate the influence of partisanship, both as a message feature and individual orientation, finding evidence of partisan motivated reasoning in frame processing. Most importantly, we discover that rejection of incongruent migration frames leads to increased media skepticism, especially among those with strong ideological identification. We discuss these findings in the context of the reinvigorated populist zeitgeist.","Immigration: Coverage, Rhetoric and Their Effects",Political Communication

Recently, with the advent of non-military Virtual Reality simulators and consumer grade VR technology, simulator sickness becomes more relevant. Previous research identified mismatches between visual perceptions and the vestibular system to be responsible for discomfort and sought measures to reduce the adverse effects of VR. However, these measures were mainly based on visual stability cues or resilience through repeated exposure to VR. In the current study, we investigate the mismatch between visual cues and vestibular feedback more directly: First, new VR technologies allow users to use natural walking movements to traverse the virtual environment. Secondly, virtual environments can be designed in such a way to avoid possibly conflicting movements. Using an omnidirectional walking platform and a gamepad controller as well as different elevation levels in an experimental virtual scenario, we analyzed the potentials to reduce simulator sickness.",HIGH-DENSITY: Embodied Cognition: Concepts and Measures,Information Systems

Using the concept of BIP allows to investigate specific episodes during virtual encounters, where the state of presence is interrupted. Orienting responses have been identified as a promising cognitive mechanism behind BIPs. However, the differences of orienting to narrative stimuli versus BIPs remains to be investigated.
In the current study, we combined established psychophysiological measures of orienting (ECG, GSR) with psychophysiological (pupil dilation) and behavioral measures (STRT) of attention. BIPs are considered to elicit stronger orienting responses and require more cognitive resources.

A between-subjects experiment (N = 48) examined whether 360-degree video elicited more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions than traditional video through greater cognitive absorption afforded by the interactive features of 360 video. The results demonstrate that 360-degree video is perceived as more interactive than traditional video, and influences attitudinal judgments via the mechanism of cognitive absorption. In addition, interactivity influenced psychological distance, such that 360-degree video elicited concrete construal thoughts related to the environmental issue, whereas traditional video produced more abstract thoughts related to the beauty of nature.

In the other condition, participants were asked to allocate 25% attention to the persistent activity and 60% to the intermittent activity. In both conditions, they were asked to allocate 15% to a distractor task. When the persistent task was treated as primary, self-reported allocation of attention was not different from what the eye-tracking data revealed. But when the intermittent task was treated as primary, self-reported attention to the intermittent task was significantly higher than observed eye fixations.

Our findings show that language models trained on Facebook posts are more accurate at predicting age, gender, stress and empathy, as measured by survey questionnaires, than those based on Twitter posts. These differences are at least partly due to the language differences -- we find that users are more likely to mention their family and personal concerns such as work and health, and express more negative and positive emotion on Facebook than on Twitter. On the other hand, they are more likely to express anxiety on Twitter than on Facebook. Consequently, we find that people are more deceptive on Twitter -- language models trained on users' language on Twitter, tend to fail at predicting their age, gender and other traits on Facebook.

In this study, we try to understand how status is constructed and maintained through cultural omnivorousness and authenticity seeking. We explore how two influential and common constraints – economic capital and availability of diverse products – affect the two consumptions styles, respectively and together. Studying people’s dining choices with Yelp dataset, our findings suggest that economic capital positively influence the two consumption styles. Availability of diverse restaurants, however, only positively influence cultural omnivorousness seeking. In addition, when the availability of diverse restaurants is low, the relationship between economic capital and authenticity is more salient than that between economic capital and cultural omnivorousness. Such difference is reversed when the availability of diverse restaurants becomes high. Post-hoc analysis shows that the observed effects are substantially explained by the availability of expensive restaurants.

Results also indicate that in the U.S., neither anger nor guilt predicts the use of any conflict style and compassion is the only effective predictor of all conflict styles except for avoidance, whereas in China anger predicts the use of the competing style, guilt the use of the avoiding style, and compassion the use of the integrating, compromising, and obliging styles. Relational satisfaction is found to have a positive correlation with compassion, a negative correlation with anger, but a nonsignificant relationship with guilt in both cultures.",Interpersonal Relationships in the Intercultural Context: Five Studies,Intercultural Communication
2018-1464,2018,Paper Session,How Gay Men and Their Straight Wives Manage Multifaceted Identity and Co-Cultural Communication: A Study of the Narratives of Tongqi in China,3,"Around 13.6 million women in China are married to gay or bisexual men, and they call themselves tongqi. Assuming both gay husbands and tongqi are simultaneously dominant and co-cultural group members, this paper examines the co-cultural communication strategies used by the two groups through a narrative analysis of 51 stories told by tongqi and finds that their multifaceted identities influence their co-cultural communication strategies within and outside of their marriages. Gay husbands and tongqi respectively pursue multiple goals in their communication and adopt different co-cultural communication strategies depending on which aspect of their identity is more salient. Furthermore, the study identifies two novel co-cultural communication strategies hitherto understudied: enduring and self-blaming. This study answers this convention’s call to theorize about voices and to give voice to hitherto muted groups.",Interpersonal Relationships in the Intercultural Context: Five Studies,Intercultural Communication

Sixteen marital partners participated in this interpretive study. A semi-structured interview method was employed and interview data were transcribed verbatim, interpreted, and analyzed. Guided by Ting-Toomey’s (2005) identity negotiation theory framework, the thematic analysis findings included the following: Negotiating turbulence at major developmental interfaith events, navigating symbolic identity placement and participatory worship decisions, and retrospective relationship assessment: Dialectics of mixed emotions. Based on the interview data of these marital partners, these thematic discoveries reflected the voices and lived experiences of various interfaith marital couples in navigating the dialectics of religious and relational identities in diverse situations and contexts.

With data collected from three MNE subsidiaries that operated in China for over 25 years, this study used structural equation modeling to demonstrate that employees’ metacognitive cultural intelligence is positively related to their perceived diversity climate, which leads to creative behaviors and citizenship altruism behaviors. In addition, this study found that one important interpersonal factor which is sensitive to the Confucius culture, harmony, significantly mediates the relationship between motivational cultural intelligence and employees’ altruism behaviors in the workplace setting. This study contributes to the literature by investigating how individual capabilities and contextual factors in the organizational setting co-influence organizational outcomes.",Interpersonal Relationships in the Intercultural Context: Five Studies,Intercultural Communication

Using content analysis on 116 crisis cases in the US (n = 56) and South Korea (n = 60) from 2014 to 2017 this study examines differences in organizations’ crisis response by cultures. Findings indicate that Korean organizations apologized for creating disturbances and offer corrective actions regardless of crisis responsibility. On the other hand, American organizations apologized only when they are responsible for crises. Interestingly, American organizations apologized for trivial crisis on social media. Finally, the paper extends our knowledge in how and under what conditions organizations in different cultures apologize differently.",Crisis Communication Research in an Asian Context,Public Relations
2018-1468,2018,Paper Session,Embedded Practitioners: A Study Exploring Institutional Logics in Corporate Crisis Communication in China,1,"What influences corporate crisis communication practice? Crisis communication studies have suggested that organizations should emphasize the public, stakeholders, media, and other related groups in crisis communication strategies, and to protect organizational reputation and business relationships have been stressed as the goals of crisis communication. However, it has been pointed out that crisis communication research emphasizes the autonomy of organizations and, to some extent, neglects the contextual environment of crisis communication in which the organizations and practitioners are embedded.

In this vein, this study attempted to explore the contextual influences in corporate crisis communication practices in China by exploring the institutional logics guiding and restricting the corporations and public relations practitioners in China. This study mainly adopted interview research method. Two primary institutional logics were identified in corporate crisis communication in China: market-oriented logic and authority-driven logic. The institutional logics and their influence to corporate crisis communication practice in China were elaborated in the study.",Crisis Communication Research in an Asian Context,Public Relations

The Role of Public Forgiveness in Crisis Communication,3,This study examines the mediating role of forgiveness in the relationship between organizations’ crisis communication strategies and the public’s post-crisis response. This study also investigates the mechanism of forgiveness seeking by testing whether the effectiveness of CCSs varies in different crisis situations. An experiment involving an information security crisis was conducted (N = 800). The results demonstrate that substantive accommodative strategies are more effective in winning people’s forgiveness than symbolic accommodative strategies. The effects of accommodative strategies on forgiveness vary in different conditions of severity and pre-crisis satisfaction.

Their differing psychological and socio-cultural context can affect the appropriateness and effectiveness of crisis communication efforts in numerous ways. Frandsen and Johansen’s (2016) Rhetorical Arena Theory is utilized to frame an analysis of Japan’s Olympus Corporation’s crisis communication efforts during its 2011 financial statement fraud crisis. Textual analysis reveals that Olympus lost the battle for definitional hegemony in a steadily expanding rhetorical arena where multiple voices managed to overwhelm Olympus’s crisis communication efforts. Poor cultural alignment of Olympus’s crisis communication efforts and overall crisis handling led to considerable reputational damage not only to the company itself but corporate Japan as a whole.,Crisis Communication Research in an Asian Context,Public Relations
2018-1471,2018,Paper Session,Does the Institutional Press Still Matter? Exploring the Hybrid Infrastructure,1,"The importance of the institutional press may seem self-evident, but while affirmed as a pillar of democratic society the transformation of the media eco-system has weakened professional boundaries and led to deinstitutionalization. Meanwhile, political populism and the counter-institutional media discourse have weakened public trust in the traditional values of the institutional press. Certain theoretical currents have suggested an unproblematic, underspecified view of the institution, leading to an overly optimistic view of institutional survival. This essay considers this question of whether the institutional press still matters and introduces a typology to help clarify conceptual definitions. Perspectives are described by level-of-analysis and level of presumed institutional coherence. Taken together I draw from Chadwick’s “hybrid media system” in arguing for a “hybrid institution” that takes into account more networked realignments and assemblages. I suggest how previous, current and proposed research cases can be posed as institutional questions with related normative concerns.",Evolutions in the News Ecosystem,Journalism Studies

Here, we synthesize the ecosystem literature, categorizing the broad contours of the research, and comparing the strengths and limitations of each type of study. A key contribution of this paper is the creation of a typology by which most, if not all, existing news ecosystem studies can be categorized: based on how ecosystems are construed (environmentally or rhizomatically), how ecosystem boundaries are defined (whether organically or by government-drawn lines such as municipal borders), and by scope (case study versus a scalable approach). We conclude that the most thorough - and thus difficult and rarely attempted - studies are rhizomatic, organic and scaled, and suggest methods for conducting such studies.",Evolutions in the News Ecosystem,Journalism Studies
2018-1473,2018,Paper Session,News Convergence in Legacy Media Organizations and Online News Start-Ups,3,"The multidimensional news convergence framework has been criticised for failing to keep abreast of the changes in journalism and neglecting digital news start-ups. This study applies an updated multidimensional framework to examine a legacy newspaper (The Straits Times) and a digital news start-up (The Middle Ground) in Singapore. Through in-depth interviews with 16 news professionals and a content analysis of 572 online news articles, results reveal that that the framework remains relevant in explaining news convergence as both organisations share largely similar characteristics. However, there are nuanced variations in specific practices, including allocation of resources to enhancing digital capabilities, platform publishing strategies and work processes, and requirements for journalists to be skills-polyvalent. This study also uncovers new characteristics that explain current journalistic praxes, such as incorporating new communication technologies in news construction, leveraging on novel social media features and mobile apps, and experimenting with intra- and inter-organisation collaborative journalism.",Evolutions in the News Ecosystem,Journalism Studies
2018-1474,2018,Paper Session,"Fields, Ecologies, Worlds: Meso-Level Spatial Approaches and the Study of Journalistic Change",2,"In recent years, the use of meso-level spatial approaches has increased dramatically in journalism scholarship. These approaches assume the existence of bounded social spaces -- fields, ecologies, worlds, jurisdictions, populations -- that are situated between the micro-level of individual agency, and macro-level structure and power. However, there has been little effort to compare the relative usefulness of these various approaches for our discipline. In this theoretical essay, ecological and field meso-level spatial approaches are compared systematically across five dimensions that we argue most clearly distinguish the approaches: (1) structural qualities, (2) boundaries, (3) the logic of the space; (4) concepts of change and reproduction; and (5) concepts of life cycle, time and history. To illustrate these comparisons, we use the case example of what we call “journalism professional associations” -- the rapidly growing space of non-profit associations, activist organizations and think-tanks that serve the journalism profession and industry.",Evolutions in the News Ecosystem,Journalism Studies
2018-1475,2018,Paper Session,An Evolved Media Landscape: A Network Exploration of the Incorporation of Partisan News Organizations into the Larger Media Ecosystem,3,"Media ecology studies often posit a linear evolutionary process of a new species from an instrumental to an institutional orientation. However, to explain the persisting multiplicity of species within the media ecosystem, we suggested an approach focusing on media ecology as a web of interactions (reliance) between different species rather than the evolution of one particular species. This study investigated how partisan news organizations survive in and transform the news ecosystem by relying on other news organizations. By analyzing hyperlinks from 163,947 news stories by 85 organizations, we found that senders’ institutionalization level is not an important predictor of reliance on other news organizations. On the other hand, receivers’ institutionalization level and partisanship between a sender and a receiver were more significant. However, less institutionalized media do introduce new information by hyperlinking to social media and thus raises a concern about the role of biased information disseminated from social media in the media ecosystem.",Evolutions in the News Ecosystem,Journalism Studies
2018-1476,2018,Paper Session,Beyond the ‘Now’ of News Audiences: A Process-Based Framework for Investigating News Repertoires Over Time,2,"The past decade has witnessed the appearance of a number of worrisome symptoms for journalism – from ongoing financial distress in the industry, to decreasing public trust and concerns over ‘fake news’ and ‘post-truth’ politics, to name a few – indicative of a potentially unhealthy relationship between journalism and the public(s) it aims to serve. For these reasons, scholars and journalists alike are understandably preoccupied with uncovering how people are being news consumers in a transformative, digital age. However, far less emphasis is placed on figuring out the processes of becoming. This paper aims to understand what causes news to matter to people, taking its point of departure from the development of news repertoires in everyday life and across the lifespan. Specifically, it aims to synthesize different process-based approaches for understanding media use to develop a more comprehensive analytical framework for investigating the emergence, maintenance, and (re)formation of audiences’ news repertoires over time.",Advances in the Study of Audience Engagement With the News,Journalism Studies

We developed what we called a two-sided video-ethnography that allows researchers and participants to look in and reflect on news use after the fact and thus without interrupting its flow. Consequently, we were able to uncover how news users actively create a sense of home through their news practices, how they learn to find their way through interfaces, lay-outs and content of news media, and how the way they physically handle and (fail to) master their devices co-shapes their news use.",Advances in the Study of Audience Engagement With the News,Journalism Studies

However, previous research has mainly focused on the United States and at specific points in time. Many European countries, however, have public service broadcasters that strive for a universal appeal that can mitigate political audience fragmentation. This study therefore examines which political preferences are more likely to facilitate selective exposure to public service news using a survey spanning 30 years in Sweden (n = 103,589). Using mixed-effects modelling, results suggests that differences by ideological leaning is minor, whereas support for parties outside parliament (and right-wing nationalist parties) accounts for the largest decline in public service news use over time. Moderate amounts of political interest are enough for individuals to sustain use of public service news, while those lacking political interest show the largest decline.",Advances in the Study of Audience Engagement With the News,Journalism Studies

2018-1480,2018,Paper Session,Do What You Love: The Paradoxical Effects of Meaningful Work Discourse in Women’s Digital Labor,2,"Women professional lifestyle bloggers mobilize the “do what you love” (DWYL) discourse in paradoxical ways. On one hand, DWYL is an empowering discourse that creates meaningful work. However, DWYL can also be used to create constraining work practices like working long hours, minimizing hard work, and lack of work life balance. This paper contributes to literature on meaningful work by exploring how meaningful work discourses are used in paradoxical ways within a cultural context. It also explores the relationship between work discourses and practices as blogging work is often publicly performed and such work performances have the potential to serve as anticipatory socialization for bloggers’ online followers. The paper also builds on existing literature on women’s digital labor by further exploring the hidden aspects of digital labor.","Tensions, Paradoxes, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

Conveners in one case engaged in communicative practices to proactively prevent tensions, while conveners in the other region used the same practices to promote and set the stage for tensions during collaboration. Based on a comparative analysis of why and how their different tension management practices led to contrasting collaborative environments—the latter more effective in accomplishing the collaborative objective than the former—this paper develops a robust, empirically-grounded theory of tensile structure, which highlights the crucial role that tensions play in maximizing collaborative capacity.","Tensions, Paradoxes, and Organizing",Organizational Communication
2018-1482,2018,Paper Session,Employee Perception of Dialectical Tensions in Company Supported Employee Volunteerism,2,"Existing research seems to suggest that contradictions may exist when implementing company support for employee volunteerism (CSEV). However, a full understanding of potentially existing contradictions on the matter is yet to be achieved. Attempting to fill in this research gap, this study adopts a tensional perspective to explore dialectics in employees’ perception of CSEV. Drawing on a qualitatively-informed study conducted in a Hong Kong company that performed practices of employee engagement in volunteering, this work found that employees perceived engagement-disengagement and openness-closedness tensions. The perception of these tensions was affected by organizational (work arrangements and communication climate), individual (sense of belonging and understanding of visibility), and relational (manager and co-worker potential responses/expectations) factors. This study contributes to research of employee volunteering by providing a tensional perspective, highlights the importance of considering different levels of factors in investigating tensions’ perception, and has implications for dialectical tension research and practice.","Tensions, Paradoxes, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

The research site was an 11-member state-wide interorganizational committee working to create change across all involved organizations. Data collection included prolonged observation of meetings over 18 months and interviews with committee leaders. Analytical procedures began with a modified constant comparative analysis that guided the research toward a tension-centered approach for ongoing data collection and analysis. Results include seven dialectical tensions representing three tension types: commitment-based, process-based, and outcome-based tensions. Participants used four strategies for discursively negotiating tensions: acknowledging, suspending, hedging, or deferring to authoritative texts. This study contributes to an increasing awareness of the nuances of collaboration as a particularly complex site of organizational communication and continues to refine our understanding of dialectical tension management in group interactions.","Tensions, Paradoxes, and Organizing",Organizational Communication

This study sought to examine the effects of adopting Facebook as a news distribution platform by proposing a theoretical model. An online panel survey was conducted. This study first theorized the concept of social media news engagement, which includes attention engagement and behavioral engagement. The results indicated (1) Facebook contributes to newspapers’ brand awareness. (2) Social media news engagement increases perceived news satisfaction.

The present study explicates the concept of immediacy and proposes a multidimensional notion of news immediacy that reflects physical and psychological closeness to the news. A scale for measuring multifaceted immediacy was developed and tested in a between-subjects design experiment. Validation was done through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Four dimensions were extracted from the analysis: transportation, involvement, vividness, and timeliness. The results reveal greater immediacy in online than print news contexts. Involvement is key to the experience of immediacy in both contexts; yet the feeling of being transported to the places of the news events was found stronger among online than print news users. The later relied more on vividness of the news presentation to attain closeness to the news. Implications of the study were discussed.",What’s New(s)?: Design Implications for Online News Platforms,Communication and Technology

Since empirical evidence for such effects is scant, this experimental study focuses on visual aesthetics as a signature element of news formats which are designed to attract attention in a highly competitive media landscape. Specifically, we draw on the theoretical framework of user engagement and show that the presence of visual aesthetics is indeed able to contribute to meaningful learning from news by initiating positive attitudes towards the interface, which in turn leads to deeper involvement with the content. However, contrary to our expectations, no moderation effects due to issue involvement or prior knowledge are found.",What’s New(s)?: Design Implications for Online News Platforms,Communication and Technology

In addition, selected examples of the publicly accessible archived content were analyzed and evaluated. The project highlights tensions between personal rights and collective interest in the process of creating cultural memory: One of the main transformations in archiving that digitization has brought about is the way in which the material is publicly accessed and the proportion of the material that is publicly accessible. However, digitization has also caused significant risks, particularly with regard to the legal and ethical challenges it causes.

Structural equation analyses were conducted on data from a national sample in the United States. Results showed that general SNSs can also afford the work-related use by individuals and benefit them via both direct and indirect pathways. SNS use exhibited indirect effects primarily through network composition and the perception of SNS occupationality.

2018-1490,2018,Paper Session,Ambient Awareness of Who Knows What: Spontaneous Inferences of Domain Expertise,2,"Being able to recognize the expertise of others (who knows what) is essential for knowledge exchange. A prominent idea among media and organization scholars is that browsing social media fosters such awareness, because people spontaneously register various cues to others’ interests and expertise they encounter online (ambient awareness). However, the central idea that ambient awareness develops without effort or intention has never been tested. In the tradition of spontaneous inferences research, we examined whether inferences of domain expertise are indeed spontaneous. In two experiments, participants inferred actors’ implied expertise after reading (Experiment 1; N = 91) or skimming through (Experiment 2; N = 269) domain-implying social media posts. Domain inferences under low attentiveness (skimming) were moderated by number of cues and participants’ own interests.

Results suggest that women employ strategies at multiple discursive levels (micro, meso, macro) to address and overcome marginalizing intergroup communication. Micro level strategies include resilience through (a) engaging with a network, (b) proving your worth, (c) gaining confidence, and (d) speaking up. One meso level strategy is resilience through organizational belonging. Macro level strategies include resilience through (a) resisting traditional gender roles, (b) using femininity to your advantage, and (c) accepting gendered discourse.

2018-1493,2018,Paper Session,Towards a Communication Theory of Intergroup Interedependency,3,"Responding to Taylor, King, and Usborne's assertion that intergroup communication theorizing is overly-dependent on Social Identity Theory (e.g., Tajfel & Turner, 1986) this paper responds to their plea “to expand the theoretical base of intergroup communication, not as a replacement for social identity, but rather to broaden the field and generate new insights” (p. 275). We propose that intergroup communication can be better understood through a framework that incorporates the effects of connections with other relevant groups. Accordingly, this paper introduces Intergroup Communication and Interdependence Theory (ICIT). ICIT proposes an explanation for communicative shifts that result from the interconnection between multiple groups, and outlines the circumstances under which these effects are accentuated and attenuated. Proposing new directions for intergroup communication research, the paper concludes by outlining possible opportunities to apply this framework in a variety of significant contexts for future research.","Theorizing Intergroup Dynamics in Families, the Workplace, and the Community",Intergroup Communication

Young adult participants (N = 181) completed an online survey assessing communication with parents concerning religious difference, self-concept (i.e., identity gaps), relational solidarity, well-being, and interfaith attitudes. Findings demonstrate positive effects for religious specific accommodative behavior and negative effects for nonaccommodative behaviors on the part of parents for most of the outcomes. Mediation analysis supports a pathway in which (non)accommodation amplifies or minimizes personal-enacted identity gaps in the family with implication for individual and relational outcomes.","Theorizing Intergroup Dynamics in Families, the Workplace, and the Community",Intergroup Communication

As members of distinct social groups, law enforcement officers’ and non-law enforcement officers’ interactions also can be understood as representative of intergroup communication. Therefore, this study explored the influence of memorable messages received from parental figures during childhood on perceptions of police officers. Adults (N = 210) were recruited to participate by completing an online questionnaire, which asked them about a memorable message a parental figure had given to them during childhood. Results indicated the emergence of themes regarding memorable message content, context, and effects. Furthermore, perceptions of police varied by race, for Black and White participants.

The research questions are: What types of participation of children and young people in the design of media literacy interventions are reported in the literature? And what types of media literacy interventions involve child participation in its design? The findings indicate that while numerous studies present evaluations of media literacy interventions, it is rare that the design processes behind these interventions are thoroughly described. Designs with high levels of child participation exist, even if they are a minority in the sample. The most popular form of media literacy intervention reported on is a school curriculum aimed towards tweens and teens. Furthermore, most of them have a perspective on media and communication close to the media effects studies tradition and aim at “behavior-relevant” outcomes, i.e. outcomes dealing with teen smoking, sexual behavior, alcohol or eating disorder. It is rarer to find media literacy interventions based in a critical tradition aimed at “media-relevant” outcomes such as helping children to become competent media consumers. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these findings for further research on child participation in media literacy interventions.

Drawing from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 40 parents and their 11- and 12-year-old children in the United States, findings suggest child behaviors and characteristics operate as important contextual factors influencing parental mediation strategies and children’s digital media use. Child-level factors such as gender, maturity level, sociability, agreeableness, executive functioning abilities, and perceived effects on children influenced parents as they sought to adapt their mediation strategies to accommodate their children’s expanding engagement with new media. Findings from this study suggest that parental mediation is a bi-directional, transactional process in which children operate as socialization agents exerting influence on parental mediation strategies which, in turn, further impact their own experiences with digital media.",The Child's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1499,2018,Paper Session,Giving Voice to Children: Exploratory Study on Children’s Perceptions of Effectiveness of Social Media Companies’ Cyberbullying Policies,1,"There is a paucity of research examining the effectiveness of social media companies’ anti-bullying tools from children’s perspective. This exploratory study offers evidence about whether children are aware of and whether they use social media companies’ mechanisms or tools against cyberbullying (e.g. various types of reporting, blocking, and companies’ safety and help centers). It also examines the extent to which children find these tools to be helpful, or why not. The study further investigates children’s perceptions of companies’ responsibility for providing assistance in bullying incidents. This research finds that levels of awareness of various companies’ tools, as well as their use, are low, and children have mixed perceptions as to whether companies are able to assist. Results are discussed from the theoretical frameworks of the privatized digital public sphere and children’s rights.",The Child's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media

The complexities of antibiotic resistance are best addressed through the socio-ecological model to explore the multilevel influences of individual, contextual, and national factors. This study analyzed how these multitude of factors are associated with identification and intention of proper antibiotic use using the 2016 European Commission’s Eurobarometer survey of 28 European Union members and candidate countries (final n= 1,508, 37.1% male, 47.9% middle class). Multilevel analyses showed that contextual (social class) and structural factors (access to information and communications and health and wellness) overrode the predictive power of individual factors (knowledge and source of information). Results demonstrate a need to consider these structural and policy-level influences to shed light on the process by which antibiotic resistance preventions and interventions might impact individuals’ cognitive outcomes and behaviors.",Novel Predictors of Health Behavior Intentions,Health Communication

Based on critical review on previous studies, we differentiated conditional risk estimates from unconditional and proposed that (a) behavioral intention is better predicted by conditional risk estimate for oneself than by comparative optimism; (b) conditional risk estimates are positively associated with intention for preventive behaviors, which is negatively associated with unconditional risk estimates; and (c) comparative optimism is greater with unconditional than with conditional risk estimates. The results of an online survey regarding Middle East Respiratory Syndrome raged in South Korea (N = 557) supported the proposed hypotheses.

The Effect of Anticipated Regret on Dating Violence Prevention Intentions,2,"Anticipated regret (AR) has been researched in health prevention messages as an affective component of decision making. Combining narrative processing theories and the health belief model, this paper examines how the effects of AR on prevention intentions are mediated by identification and perceived threat in dating violence stories. An experiment (control vs. AR targeting victims vs. AR targeting bystanders) was conducted with 474 college students. The results indicated the importance of identification regardless of AR targets. First, identification evoked by anticipated regret directly enhanced intentions to take preventive actions, and also indirectly increased intentions through perceived severity. However, without identification, AR rather reduced perceived severity. Second, identification increased perceived susceptibility, which unexpectedly led to a decrease in action intentions, but was positively correlated with information seeking intentions.

This relationship is proposed to be mediated by perceived social norms, attitude toward condom use, and self-efficacy. Findings indicate that self-efficacy and favorable attitudes toward condom use were predictive of intent, and that the significant predictive role of home culture on behavioral intent was fully mediated by familism. Future interventions should include strategies for enhancing Chinese women’s self-efficacy for safe sex practices, cultivate a favorable attitude toward condom use, and emphasize the home cultural values that might increase their intent to use condoms.",Novel Predictors of Health Behavior Intentions,Health Communication

By conducting a lab experiment (N = 86), we investigated how different usage of avatars (no avatar, assigned avatar, two types of customized avatar) affect group member’s self-disclosure, along with other group interaction outcomes such as group conformity and perceived social support. The results showed that having individual avatar itself (vs. no avatar) is not strong enough to trigger people’s changes in self-disclosure or group conformity in the discussion. However, as expected, customizing an avatar (vs. assigned avatar) significantly contributes to participant’s identification, which in turn increases their perceived self-disclosure and perceived social support. On the other hand, counter-intuitively, customization undermines member’s flow state in the discussion, while flow is positively associated with self-disclosure and perceived social support.","Online Group and Team Dynamics: Conformity, Prejudice, Effectiveness, and Exclusion",Communication and Technology

This study explores how customizing avatars to look like the self or like another person when in the presence or absence of group identity cues affects social distance toward Latinos in virtual environment (VE) interactions. Conversing with a Latinos in VE reduced social distance relative to pre-VE interaction scores. In addition, self customization increased similarity identification with one’s virtual self and, additionally, it reduced social distance toward Latinos relative to virtual other customization. In contrast, other customization in the absence of common group identity cues comparatively decreased embodied presence. The results were in line with the social identity model of deindividuation effects and provide initial evidence for how visual identifiability enhances VE intergroup contact.","Online Group and Team Dynamics: Conformity, Prejudice, Effectiveness, and Exclusion",Communication and Technology

By integrating social information processing theory (SIPT; Walther, 1992) into team effectiveness literature, this study extends SIPT to explain time-dependent effects of relational composition and anticipated communication on online team effectiveness. Using computational research methods, this study collected digital traces of 1,401 OHCTs that aimed for positive health behavior change. The results showed that number of prior online relationships among team members had a positive but decreasing effect on team effectiveness over time, whereas cohesion of prior online relationships among team members had an increasing positive effect over time. Moreover, anticipated frequency of communication with team showed a negative effect at the beginning stage but a positive effect at the end stage on the effectiveness of OHCTs.","Online Group and Team Dynamics: Conformity, Prejudice, Effectiveness, and Exclusion",Communication and Technology

We sought to replicated and extend these findings by exposing 110 participants to real time social exclusion signals operationalized as transcripts of conversations between their friends in which they are not included. Participants completed tasks that required complex thought (GRE test questions) or simple, automatic processing (memory recall tasks). After exposure to the stimuli, we measured participants performance and mood. Results demonstrated no significant differences between exclusion condition on performance and mood. Further, we found that the trait need to belong was a significant negative predictor of performance for individuals experiencing social exclusion. Individuals who desire acceptance and belonging from others performed worse on the complex task when exposed to the exclusion stimuli.","Online Group and Team Dynamics: Conformity, Prejudice, Effectiveness, and Exclusion",Communication and Technology
2018-1509,2018,Paper Session,Comparing Self-Report Data and Program Analytic Data as Measures of Engagement in an Active Involvement Intervention to Reduce Substance Use Among Adolescents,6,"Background: The Theory of Active Involvement (TAI) posits behavior change through user engagement. TAI suggests that a program’s ultimate impact on substance use depends on how involved and engaged participants are in a given program, with more engaged youth likely to report better outcomes. In practice, operationalizing engagement is a challenge and has relied primarily on self-report measures. However, the emergence of e-learning delivery platforms offers new and promising options for assessing user engagement in real time via program analytics captured for each individual user; these platforms may capture users’ activity and interaction with interventions and store data such as engagement pattern and duration. The present study uses both self-report data (agree-disagree and free response) in combination with program analytic data collected via a pilot-study of the REAL media program, a media literacy based youth substance prevention e-learning program, to examine whether program analytics are useful indicators of engagement and how they relate to several types of self-report measures.

2018-1510,2018,Paper Session,The Many Forms and Meanings of Illness Uncertainty: Processes of Problematic Integration among Patients with Chronic Illness Conditions,1,"Uncertainty is a prevalent condition in most illness experiences (Cohen, 1993). Extant research seeks to understand illness uncertainty and explicates the processes of illness uncertainty management from post-positivist perspective (Babrow & Striley, 2014), while there is still a need for more sophisticated understandings of the nature and challenges of illness uncertainty from an interpretive perspective. Drawing on the problematic integration theory (Babrow, 1992, 1995; Babrow & Striley, 2014), this study analyzed 32 in-depth interviews with patients to unpack 1) the many meanings of illness uncertainty and 2) how communication serves as a medium, source, and resource of problematic integration. Understanding the distinctive forms of illness uncertainty and form-specific adaptation of communication has important theoretical implications for a systematic account of differences in illness uncertainty and practical implications for healthcare providers’ effective communication in response to each specific form.

The current research aims to find out what kind of Cardiovascular Disease health information Hui people obtain from different sources and establish what needs Hui people have related to CVD health information. The authors conducted six focus groups in Shenyang City. The U&G analysis revealed that a need for information was prominent. An unexpected result was that the Hui participants felt ignored by mainstream media and society at large. Besides, they experienced obstacles in getting CVD health information, in particular with respect to the credibility of information. Overall, the participants expressed a need for credible and professional CVD health information from different sources, and they thought there should be mediated health communication programs specifically targeted at Hui people.","HIGH-DENSITY: Health Information Needs, Seeking and Engagement",Health Communication
2018-1512,2018,Paper Session,Pathway Linking WeChat Health Information Engagement to Psychological Well-Being: A Moderated Mediation Study,2,"Thanks to the thriving public accounts, WeChat has become the digital source of health news and health information. Given the information-rich environment on WeChat, a large amount of health information shared on the site, through individual’s active engagement (e.g., liking, sharing, commenting). However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie the potential impact of one’s active engagement of healthcare information on one’s health outcome, especially the psychological well-being. This study empirically tested a moderated mediation pathway model through a national survey with 522 WeChat users. The results showed that the effect of bonding and bridging social capital on one’s psychological well-being was completely mediated by respondents’ active engagement of health information (liking, sharing and commenting). In addition, user’s perceived health information quality positively moderated this mediation path. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for mobile social media health promotion resources to improve health communication and public’s psychological well-being.","HIGH-DENSITY: Health Information Needs, Seeking and Engagement",Health Communication

Paying attention to health notices is an important part of health information-seeking behavior (HSIB) that can prevent negative health consequences. Since the Internet is the most commonly used source for health information, it is important to understand how this online activity influences people’s attention to health-related information provided by authoritative sources such as the FDA. Hence, we examined how the level of attention people pay to FDA investigation on food and drugs is associated with and predicted by (1) health information seeking behavior in general, (2) health information seeking from the Internet and its barriers; and (3) exposure to different types of media for health information.","HIGH-DENSITY: Health Information Needs, Seeking and Engagement",Health Communication

The present study addresses this gap and furthers the literature by examining selective exposure (time spent) with messages that vary in levels and sources of efficacy. Investigating a preference for or avoidance of efficacious messages more appropriately captures one’s drive to control a threat versus a fear.","HIGH-DENSITY: Health Information Needs, Seeking and Engagement",Health Communication
2018-1515,2018,Paper Session,The Beneficiaries of Surrogate Cancer Information Seeking,6,"Cancer information services provide valuable advice for patients as well as for their family members, who often seek information on behalf of the patients. Although it is known, that female carers and middle-aged adults are more likely to seek for cancer-related information or contact cancer information services on behalf of a patient, it is still unclear who the beneficiaries of their surrogate seeking are. To provide insights into this we analyzed the complete dataset of requests in 2016 (N=20.149) to the largest provider of cancer information in Germany. Results indicate that surrogate seekers are significantly younger (M∆=-10.1, p < .001) than the patients on whose behalf they are calling. Although the surrogate callers as well as the self-seeking patients are more likely to be female, there are no gender differences for the beneficiaries of surrogate seeking. Consequenses for the transmission of cancer information between family members and the gender-specific provision of information are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Health Information Needs, Seeking and Engagement",Health Communication

We propose a theoretical model in which narrative perspective (first- versus third-person) enhances feelings of togetherness with a protagonist (i.e., social presence), which—in turn—increases perspective taking and reduces counterarguing, ultimately influencing outgroup attitudes. We test this model relying on two original experimental studies (Study 1 N = 503, Study 2 N = 410) in which participants read a short story narrated either by an outgroup protagonist (first-person perspective) or by an unidentified observer (third-person perspective). We find support for our model. These findings advance alternative mechanisms explaining the persuasiveness of first-person narratives and help explain prior inconsistencies in the literature.","Presence, Parasocial Experience, and Narratives",Mass Communication

We advance a concept of an optimal reception condition: imagining a positive interaction with a stigmatized immigrant before reading a narrative written by an immigrant with greater similarity to the native audience. In both studies, participants received instructions of imagined inter-group contact (versus control instructions) immediately before reading a first-person narrative of an immigrant with higher or lower similarity. The optimal reception condition induced greater identification and narrative transportation than the reference condition (without imagined contact and a low-similarity protagonist), in turn causing a more positive attitude towards immigration, a higher intention of inter-group contact, and a greater desire to share the message. The findings are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and prejudice reduction through indirect contact.","Presence, Parasocial Experience, and Narratives",Mass Communication

The current study goes towards closing the presented research gap with new findings based on a 2x1 experiment (N = 192) examining romantic and amicable parasocial relationships (PSR) in books versus movies and television. Media characters from movies and television were perceived to be physically more attractive than media characters from books which in turn led to more intensive romantic PSR. In contrast, the assumed dominance of media characters from books with regard to mental attractiveness was only marginally significant, although the positive link between mental attractiveness and amicable PSR was supported by the data. Briefly summarized, PSR in books are rather of an amicable nature, whereas PSR in television and movies can rather be classified as romantic parasocial phenomena.","Presence, Parasocial Experience, and Narratives",Mass Communication

Using an online survey, data were collected from 210 college students in the U.S., who engaged in social TV viewing for March Madness, the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. Primary findings indicated that entertainment and communication motives were stronger in the public platform of social TV viewing, while social motive was slightly stronger in the private platform. Entertainment motive was the strongest predictor for enjoyment in the public platform, while communication motive was the strongest in the private platform. Further, social presence was a significant psychological mechanism that affected social TV enjoyment. Overall, the current study provides important theoretical and practical implications for research in social TV.","Presence, Parasocial Experience, and Narratives",Mass Communication
2018-1520,2018,Paper Session,Order Effects in Competitive Framing: An Attitude Congruence Perspective,2,"Using self-affirmation theory, the present study examines how the ordering of balanced, two-sided news frames can interact with audiences’ preexisting attitudes to impact information elaboration, perceived credibility of the message, and attitude strength. The study used a 2 (pre-existing attitude: positive vs. negative) x 2 (message order: congruent-first vs. incongruent-first) x 2 (issues) mixed-design experiment (n=125). The findings showed that when people encountered attitude-incongruent arguments that threatened their identity, they responded defensively by elaborating more attitude-congruent thoughts to affirm their preexisting attitudes. However, affirming the users’ identities by showing congruent arguments first did not lead to more elaboration of attitude-incongruent thoughts. The study fills a gap in framing studies by providing evidence that the effects of a mixed-frame message on people’s attitudes and cognitive processing can be influenced by differences in the sequencing of attitudinally congruent and incongruent arguments within the message.","News, Agenda-Setting, and Framing",Mass Communication

In this article, we use the network agenda setting theory to analyze how these tragedies were covered by different types of mass media: on 11 federal TV channels, in 1,974 print newspapers, in 34,905 online newspapers and on 2,574 blogs. We show that ties between the tragedy and a network of other acute issues are more important than objective circumstances, such as the number of victims or the geography of the event. The context in which the events were examined led to greater attention to the killing of the ambassador and less attention to surrogate alcohol poisoning. Berlin terror attack was used as a supplement to demonstrate the importance of the fight against terrorism. Simultaneously, we believe that indirect control of the agenda by the state can be exercised by creating a network of events that will correctly guide discussions about tragedies.","News, Agenda-Setting, and Framing",Mass Communication

Using images embedded in the news links of the two sites, the study investigates the prevalence of six visual frames: people, weaponry type, weaponry ownership, destruction, casualties, and other. The visual content analysis of 250 photographs shows that the people visual frame was the most-prevalent, and was dominated by images of the rebel fighters. While guns dominated the weaponry type frame, casualty and destruction images were rare. Findings also indicate statistically significant differences between the two news sites where images of rebel soldiers, foreign leaders, and weaponry type were more common on Al-Jazeera. Four aspects of the visual frame coverage of the conflict come out strongly, however: the reportage of the Libyan conflict encapsulates support for the military intervention, overall Al-Jazeera offered more visual coverage than BBC, the conflict was visually framed as a “Libyan affair”, and as a “bloodless”.","News, Agenda-Setting, and Framing",Mass Communication

This experiment investigates the influence of recommender characteristics (tie strength, political knowledge, political similarity) and different media sources (tabloids, legacy and digital-born outlets) including multiple mediators (e.g., social pressure, outlet credibility) on incidental exposure to political news on Facebook. A 3x3 multi-stimulus between-subjects experiment with two additional quasi-factors and 135 different stimuli was conducted using a representative sample (N = 507). Results showed that strong ties and recommenders with high knowledge increase news exposure, but the impact of knowledge is limited to recommenders with similar political opinions. Similar effects occur for different media types, which also have an independent impact on news exposure. Structural equation modeling reveals that media source effects are mediated through media perceptions, whereas recommender effects work via the desire for social monitoring and perceived issue importance.",News Exposure on Social Media,Political Communication

Given the centrality of news brands for the business of journalism and for news navigation, it is important to investigate whether people recognize the original content producer when they access news via such channels. In this paper, we measure “news brand attribution”: whether online news users correctly attribute stories they consumed to the brands that have produced them. Based on a unique combination of passive tracking of a panel of users over a four-week period followed by surveys, we find that news users are far more likely to correctly attribute a story to a news brand if they accessed it directly rather than via search or social media. We further find that correct attribution is significantly higher when people access stories from their main source of news, and spend more time with the story.",News Exposure on Social Media,Political Communication

Using an online survey that exposes respondents to multiple news articles on the same issue, this study found that perceptions of issue frame believability, frame importance, article bias and article influence affected reader's willingness to share a news article. Moreover, these article perceptions are formed through the lens of one’s political ideology.

Particularly, their news selection is not based on traditional principles but rather on algorithmic filtering. Besides, as users highly trust in search engines and mostly click on the first ten results at the maximum and often only rely on the first result – search engines strongly influence news exposure and with it exposure diversity, a core principle of democratic theory. Despite a large discussion about this influence, empirical results are still rare. Our study therefore compares information diversity and diversity of speakers of the first ten and the first results of five search engines on ten political issues. Results show that while the first ten results are highly diverse, the first results – on which many users confine themselves – often fail to diversely inform the user. That is, the largest power of search engines lies in their ranking.",News Exposure on Social Media,Political Communication

In order to fill in this gap, this essay develops a theoretical account that proposes comparing not authoritarian media systems but “authoritarian publics”. Drawing on recent theories of the multiple public sphere, it posits that three types of partial publics operate within the multiple publics-at-large of contemporary authoritarian regimes: (1) uncritical, (2) policy-critical, and (3) leadership-critical publics. With reference to political science literature about the emergence of formally democratic institutions in authoritarian regimes, critical publics are interpreted as institutions that help autocrats carry out important tasks. As is argued, the benefits and risks associated with critical publics for autocrats are broadly comparable to those of other pseudo-democratic institutions, such as semi-competitive elections or semi-independent legislatures. Consequences for the study of the emergence, consequences, and management of authoritarian publics are discussed.",Political Communication in Authoritarian and Non-Democratic Contexts,Political Communication

Findings suggest that while new media was overwhelmingly the focus of most studies, there is little research on the new media’s role as Arab Spring morphed from peaceful protests to sectarian strife and civil war, especially in places like Syria. We conclude that while scholars have been more than eager to explore how and why Twitter, Facebook, and other new media technologies were bringing about democratic change in Arab countries, they apparently have had little interest in figuring out why the same technologies failed to sustain the protest movements, or what role they might have played as violence erupted in various parts of the region.

Over the last few years, digital media played an increasingly important role in destabilizing discourses and boundaries regarding taboo issues among Israel’s Ultra-Orthodox communities. One such taboo, which has a long history in the Ultra-Orthodox community, concerns the prohibition of discussions about LGBT and Queer issues. In July 2015, however, a lethal attack of one member of the Ultra-Orthodox community on the 2015 Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade forced the community to address its hateful attitudes towards LGBT and Queer communities. While traditional community media attempted to ignore the debate, two major Ultra-Orthodox news websites fell outside the control exercised by the community leadership, and enabled subversive discussions within the Ultra-Orthodox community. Through a process of negotiating the meaning of the attack, these discussions resulted in a reframing of the boundaries of the community, breaking a path for further contestation and debate. Using grounded theory analysis, this article contributes to a better understanding of the role of digital media in undermining established power structures within closed communities, such as the Ultra-Orthodox community in Israel.",Political Communication in Authoritarian and Non-Democratic Contexts,Political Communication
2018-1532,2018,Paper Session,Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Anti-Tobacco Messages and Cognitive and Emotional Responses: Role of Smoking Status,8,"At a laboratory session, participants (N = 48 adult, nicotine-dependent smokers and N = 51, adult, non-smokers) were tested for cognitive and emotional processing using psychophysiological measures (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance, and facial electromyography) and recognition memory of six secondhand smoke anti-tobacco advertisements depicting either both smoking cues and threat content, or neither. Self-report negative emotion, arousal, and counterarguments were measured following exposure to each message. The results from this study indicated that the presence of smoking cues and threat content in the same message resulted in defensive processing by smokers indicated by increased counterarguing and arousal, less heart rate deceleration over time, and less recognition accuracy and sensitivity of message content compared to non-smokers. These data suggest that the smoking status of the message viewer influences whether a secondhand anti-tobacco message containing smoking cues and threat content is received or rejected.","HIGH-DENSITY: Emotion, Cognition, and Health: Automatic and Controlled Processes",Information Systems
2018-1533,2018,Paper Session,Food Ad Tricks: An Investigation of the Cognitive Processing of Cues in Food Advertisements,1,"Our food choices and food preferences are not only influenced by homeostatic energy balance requirements, but also by hedonic eating. Though it has been commonly accepted that the effects of hedonic properties of food related cues in general on appetitive motivational activation, emotional, cognitive and subsequent behavioral responding, it is unclear how the co-presentation of different types of food-cues in food ads will function to alter motivational reactivity, emotional, cognitive and behavioral responding. The purpose of the current research is to explore the cognitive resources required for encoding and storing information in food ads containing different types of cues, utilizing secondary task reaction measures. Specifically, this study proposes to investigate the effects of two types of cues, including social cues (individual vs. group cues) and use cues (absent vs. present) on food cue reactivity during food advertising processing and how they are moderated by individual and group differences.","HIGH-DENSITY: Emotion, Cognition, and Health: Automatic and Controlled Processes",Information Systems

In 2015, the Health Promotion Board of Singapore conducted a public consultation on enhancing tobacco control policies, and many advocated enforcing plain cigarette packaging. To provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of plain packaging in Singapore, the current study aims at examining the effects of plain packaging on Singaporeans’ (including smokers and non-smokers) package perception, attitudes toward the cigarette brands, demand for cigarettes, and visual attention to the warnings. The current study adopts the discrete emotion approach to understand the process through which fear and disgust (vs. fear only) elicited from plan cigarette packaging influence Singaporeans’ related perception and tobacco use. To this end, the current study will administer a 2 (current cigarette packages vs. plain packages) x 2 (warning elicit fear only vs. warning evoking fear and disgust) between-subjects lab experiment.","HIGH-DENSITY: Emotion, Cognition, and Health: Automatic and Controlled Processes",Information Systems

A two-mediator model showed that apprehensive threat and motivational threat both significantly intervened between the experimental inoculation treatment and message derogation, with motivation leading to less and apprehension leading to more derogation of the health appeal. The inconsistent mediational effects were of equal magnitude, resulting in a misleading null total effect of inoculation on message derogation.

2018-1537,2018,Paper Session,Testing the Effect of Vapor in E-Cigarette PSAs on Current Smokers and E-Cigarette Users' Psychophysiological Responses and Urge,4,"Electronic cigarettes are increasingly popular, especially among young adults. Many e-cigarette messages (both advertisements and anti-e-cigarette public service announcements (PSAs)) contain portrayals of e-cigarette use or vaping cues. Though it is plausible that e-cigarette-related cues would be processed in similar ways to traditional combustible cigarette-related cues, this has not been consistently established. Therefore, in a sample of young adult smokers, we test the effect of the presence of e-cigarette vapor within anti-vaping PSAs. We anticipated that, based on the predictions of the LC4MP, vapor would elicit appetitive activation and improve message processing while increasing craving. Though we did find activation of the appetitive system and increased message processing, we found no effect of the presence of vapor on urge to smoke traditional combustible cigarettes. However, there was a significant effect on urge to vape such that the decline in vaping urge was larger in the no-vapor condition vs. the vapor condition. Implications for these results are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Emotion, Cognition, and Health: Automatic and Controlled Processes",Information Systems

Recent research notes that one reason CM parenting is resistant to many interventions is due to the specific mental processing that is unique to those with self-regulatory deficits. To reach these parents via media, PSAs about CM prevention are needed to account for the message avoidance that may arise as a result of self-regulatory deficiencies. This project is the first of its kind to examine empirical evidence for three diverse methods of communicating about CM in a way that is meant to “reach” those with self-regulatory deficits and support positive help-seeking behaviors.","HIGH-DENSITY: Emotion, Cognition, and Health: Automatic and Controlled Processes",Information Systems

Technology developers have leveraged the common design industry language of inspiration to describe the ways that these platforms and applications could fit within, perpetuate, and ultimately direct this design labor practice to happen among and within these sites. This empirical study zooms out to take a broader look at the continual shaping and reshaping of what I term the digital inspirational economy, where one designer's creative content becomes another designer's inspiration. As emerging systems for the distribution of design content, these platforms and the practices of enterprising designers illuminate the contours of evolving work practices and the ways in which designers are continually challenged to assert their economic value in the creative economy.",Labor Studies in the Digital Media Economy,Media Industry Studies

On the one hand, creators of Israeli reality TV operate in an unstable and competitive environment, and on the other, their work is criticized as inferior and culturally corrupting. Here we combine Luc Boltanski’s pragmatist sociology, which studies the rationale of social agents, and the cultural industries approach to explore the regime of justification employed by reality show creators in Israel.

2018-1544,2018,Paper Session,"Dialogue in Online Corporate Social Responsibility Efforts: Interactivity, Deliberation, and Dialogic Communication",1,"The three generations of corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework (M. Stohl, Stohl, & Townsley, 2007) envisions a normative era of CSR, in which corporations take on political roles for the betterment of the global society. In this normative era known as the third generation of CSR, corporations that want to appear morally legitimate need to engage their stakeholders in dialogue. To this end, two theories of dialogue can guide corporations’ communicative CSR efforts: deliberative democracy and dialogic communication. Both theories are about reasoned, respectful debate, but deliberative democracy focuses on making legitimate policy decisions while dialogic communication focuses on building relationships. This paper suggests that research on CSR-related dialogue should aim to make a distinction between policy-making and relationship-building. Furthermore, researchers should ensure that the dialogue is interactive, in that latter messages should be topically or functionally related to earlier messages.","Dialogue, Motives, and Strategies in CSR Communication",Public Relations
2018-1545,2018,Paper Session,Doing Business in a Politically Polarized Society: An Expectation Violation Theory Approach to CSR-Based Challenge Crises,3,"In a polarized society, organizations are increasingly forced to take sides on controversial CSR issues. In recent years, we have witnessed an uptick of CSR-based crises where organizations are challenged for their CSR wrongdoings, inactions, or misinterpretations of societal expectations. However, CSR-based crises are the least researched crisis types (Coombs, 2010). As such, the current study draws upon Expectation Violation Theory to examine how stakeholders’ perception of organizations reputation, accountability, CSR expectations, and political ideologies influence two aspects of expectancy violations: violation importance and violation expectedness (Afifi & Metts, 1998). Findings indicate that stakeholders’ perception of reputation and accountability could indeed lead to favorable evaluations of an organization’s crisis response. Furthermore, the effect of CSR expectations is moderated by stakeholders’ political ideologies. These findings broaden the scope of Expectancy Violation Theory to include new variables in the crisis context. The study also highlights the influence of stakeholders’ ideologies on politicalized CSR issues.","Dialogue, Motives, and Strategies in CSR Communication",Public Relations
2018-1546,2018,Paper Session,Tracing the Multinational Corporate Citizen: Deliberative Corporate Social Responsibility in Global Public Relations,2,"Public relations must communicate corporations’ socially responsible behavior through various means. But corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication may go beyond publicizing the good deeds of the organization and actually work to shape social discourses. Scherer and Palazzo’s (2007) notion of deliberative corporate social responsibility (CSR) suggests that multinational corporations (MNCs) can make contributions to public discourse regarding pressing societal challenges at local, regional and national levels. That said, it has only been proposed as the theoretical, normative concept. This study uses framing theory to interrogate the CSR reports of ten MNCs to seek deliberative elements, connect deliberative CSR with deliberative systems research in public relations, and point toward new questions regarding the role of MNCs in transnational discourse regarding the challenges facing global civil society.","Dialogue, Motives, and Strategies in CSR Communication",Public Relations

Additionally, differences in audience responses to proactive and reactive CSR strategies were investigated in combination with these two different CSI types. Findings from an experiment revealed that the socially responsible business practices type of CSIs were largely received more positively than the philanthropic type of CSIs, in regard to attitudes and supportive intentions. Likewise, greater public-serving motives were attributed to the socially responsible business practices type of CSIs compared to the philanthropic type of CSIs. While reactive philanthropic CSIs were perceived more negatively that proactive in terms of attitudes or supportive intentions, there were no significant differences between proactive and reactive socially responsible business practices CSIs, indicating that these practices were received more positively, regardless of whether they were proactive or reactive.","Dialogue, Motives, and Strategies in CSR Communication",Public Relations

The study draws upon a year of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2011 and 2012 in the newsrooms of two mainstream national television channels in Turkey. Viewing performative action as a purposefully staged form of symbolic communication, the study examines the ways in which journalists with competing values and beliefs mask or modify ‘undesired’ aspects of their individual interpretations within a power network immanent to the newsroom structure. The findings contradict the classical texts on the sociology of journalism, which over-emphasize the unanimous re-production of a single and dominant media perspective.

The study of actors in the news is consequently an enduring topic in news media research. However, little systematic knowledge exists about differences between news issues in the occurrence of speaking actors. Based on a new fourfold classification of actors in the news, we study differences in actor prevalence over time, between broadcasters and issues. To do so, we analyze the entire population of Dutch speaking television news items in Belgium from the two main broadcasters from the period 2003-2016. While we do not find large changes over time, significant differences exist between issues in the actors that get to speak in the news.

2018-1552,2018,Paper Session,Eurosceptic Voices in the Media Coverage of European Parliament Elections 2014,2,"The present study investigates whether national media discourses about Euroscepticism are Europeanized. A discourse is considered Europeanized when an issue involving non-national or EU level actors is discussed in a similar fashion within different Member States. we ask:
To what extent are national media discourses about Euroscepticism Europeanized?
What factors explain the presence of a Europeanized media discourse about Euroscepticism?
To answer these questions we employ a two-phase research design. In the first phase, we uncover the content of media reporting relating to Euroscepticism in 2014 across six countries: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France, Denmark, and Sweden. Using LDA topic modeling, a natural language processing method, we identify the primary topics in connection with the words ‘Eurosceptic’ and ‘Euroscepticism’ across each of the six cases and compare them in terms of their content (what is discussed) and their scope (national or European). We find that the topics associated with Euroscepticism are remarkably similar across all of our cases, with the exception of the UK, and therefore find substantial evidence that the discourse about Euroscepticism is Europeanized. We explain the Europeanization of media discourses about Euroscepticism with three factors: broadsheet versus tabloid coverage, the success of a national Eurosceptic party, and
whether the country is a net contributor or receiver of EU funds.",The Voices Represented in the News: Inclusion and Contention,Journalism Studies
2018-1553,2018,Paper Session,New Technologies: New Voices? Digital Sources in Legacy Media,1,"New technologies provide journalists with endless possibilities to refresh their sourcing habits and access new social actors. This entails great opportunities for a new and diverse source mix that will give voice to those that were formerly deprived news access, alongside risks to journalist’ epistemic standards. Previous studies found contradicting findings when exploring whether reporters increase their reliance on digital sources, and how this effects source diversity and journalists’ practices – possibly a result of a lacking coherent definition for what ‘digital sources’ are. Hence, in this paper we start by suggesting a two-conditions operational definition for digital sources. To systematically and holistically examine the somewhat elusive and hidden aspects of sourcing, we employed a mix method study: quantitative interviews with a representative sample of Israeli news reporters, which reconstructed the practices behind their recently published news items (N=480), accounting for all their sources (N=1,307); Follow-up qualitative reconstructions with 21 of these reporters; and a content analysis of the qualitatively reconstructed items (N=45). Our findings provide for the first-time longitudinal evidence of a dramatic increase in digital sourcing among legacy news reporters. In addition, our data further supports the democratization approach, according to which this trend is associated with higher diversity of non-official actors and better representation to alternative voices. Yet, we do not suggest a celebration of democratization of news work yet. First, even with the significant increase, digital sourcing is not yet a full routine and is limited to only third of the items. Second, our findings also raise a concern, as the information these sources provide is treated significantly less critically by the journalists, which employ lower epistemic standards for these sources.",The Voices Represented in the News: Inclusion and Contention,Journalism Studies

Conclusions include 1) development of the scribe-physician relationship is a time consuming process; 2) implementation of scribes differed substantially between departments; 3) physicians have idiosyncratic workflows they do not document; 4) scribes’ work is an extension of physicians’ work depending on the scribe’s tacit acquiescence; 5) and stable routines depend on the existence of prior work arrangements.

I then introduce a measure for PAS and show its uses: I examined the distribution of political orientation and gender among groups with different levels of PAS. Politically centrist participants were low in PAS, and female participants were high in PAS. This research enhances understanding of political sophistication by elucidating the contributing role of media knowledge.","How Media Shape What We Know, How We Think, and What We Do",Communication and Technology

A Comparative Qualitative Analysis of Online Political News and Responses in the U.S., U.K., and the Netherlands",1,"Journalists in the U.S. are frequently accused of articulating partisan biases in political reporting. In Europe, the media and citizens are assumed to interpret reality from similar social-identity driven polarized and populist mindsets. To date, however, empirical research has not explored how such interpretations are constructed in online journalism. Important questions remain unanswered: How are online media constructing partisan biases? And how do citizens respond to such news? To answer these questions, this paper draws on a comparative qualitative content analysis of online political news and responses in the U.S., U.K., and the Netherlands (N = 1,179). Results reveal that citizens respond to partisan news with congruent polarized interpretations. These findings provide important foundational evidence for the congruence between partisan media and polarized interpretations on social network sites.","How Media Shape What We Know, How We Think, and What We Do",Communication and Technology

In terms of digital media use and youth, the advice has been to monitor and limit access to minimize the negative impacts. However, this advice would also limit the positive impacts of digital media. One such positive impact is increased engagement in civic and political life. This paper uses meta-analysis techniques to summarize the findings from 91 survey-based studies (751 coefficients) about youth, digital media use, and engagement in civic and political life. It examines what types of digital media use increase engagement and what mechanisms connect digital media and engagement. We find little evidence of a time displacement effect and a strong relationship between online and offline political activities. We point out several limitations in existing research. These limitations may lead to ineffective interventions in addressing youth’s levels of engagement in civic and political life.","How Media Shape What We Know, How We Think, and What We Do",Communication and Technology

Eighteen studies were used in the final literature synthesis and a separate group of ten studies related to social robotics were investigated in the meta-analysis. In general, the application of the concept of social presence to robots is sometimes underdeveloped, demonstrating inconsistency in definition, operationalization, and topical constraint. Yet social cues do indeed influence the experience of social presence while interacting with a robot. The average correlation of the studies is .47 (p < .001). This is consistent with the assumptions of many human-robot interaction researchers, and with existing models of human behavior towards technology. In addition, it demonstrates that, even with the varying definitions of social presence and the diversity of methods to manipulate social cues, the effect is strong enough to transcend these problems.","Thinking About Robots, Avatars, and Science: New Directions in Communication Research",Communication and Technology

Results from a 2 (Human-likeness: A cartoonish avatar vs. A hyper-realistic avatar) x 2 (Animacy: Still vs. Animate) between-subjects experiment showed that the feeling of eeriness, induced by the human-likeness of an avatar, decreases the amount of deliberative information processing invested on thin slicing, and, in turn, negatively affects the accuracy of thin-slice judgments. However, animacy had no effects on the mount of deliberation and the accuracy of thin-slice judgments. The results of mediation analysis revealed that perceived trustworthiness, together with a feeling of eeriness and the amount of deliberative thoughts, significantly mediated the effects of human-likeness and animacy on the accuracy of thin-slice judgments.

The emergent metric is reliable and valid, and exhibits predictive utility.","Thinking About Robots, Avatars, and Science: New Directions in Communication Research",Communication and Technology
2018-1565,2018,Paper Session,Down to a r/science: Integrating Computational Approaches to the Study of Communication on Reddit,4,"As communication moves online, digital traces enable researchers to study communication processes at a scale previously not possible. In this paper, we combine social network analysis and automated content analysis to study how presenting oneself as an expert, the position a user occupies in the network of comments, and the content characteristics of messages posted to a large-scale online messaging website are evaluated by the audience. Specifically, we look at how individuals interact with science on Reddit. We find that posts made by expert users and by users that occupy more authoritative network positions are more likely to be positively evaluated, that posts which contain positive emotion are less likely to be positively evaluated, and that users with greater degrees of expertise are more likely to use complex language. We conclude by discussing the opportunities for further research using large-scale online sources to understand complex communication phenomena.","Thinking About Robots, Avatars, and Science: New Directions in Communication Research",Communication and Technology
2018-1566,2018,Paper Session,Digital Traces of Political Interest and Exposure to Political Content on Facebook,4,"Facebook serves as a primary venue for political news and information. The platform also plays an increasingly complex role in politics as mechanisms for targeting constituents become more sophisticated. This paper reports the results of a pilot study using a novel approach to investigate the role of digital trace data in shaping individual-level exposure to news and political content on Facebook. By weaving together survey data and data from users’ Facebook archive, we investigate the network of customization-related factors that impact what users see on Facebook. The results suggest that exposure to news and political content on Facebook depends not only on user preferences or posting habits of friends, but also the algorithmic translation of digital trace data into information about individual users’ interests and content preferences. This study provides a crucial “proof of concept,” which may be applied in future research to expand upon the selective exposure framework",Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles: Networked News Dynamics,Communication and Technology
2018-1567,2018,Paper Session,Exposure to Diverse Viewpoints on Social Media and Democratic Citizenship: The Role of Partisanship,1,"In a democratic society, people are expected to value and consume diverse viewpoints in order to become good citizens. Achieving diversity in citizens, however, has been difficult under the digital media environment with many partisan media outlets and “filter bubbles” on social media. Using a two wave national online survey, this study investigates what leads people to be exposed to diverse viewpoints on social media, and what influence such diverse exposure has on informed and engaged citizenry. Furthermore, this study examines whether the effect of diverse exposure on citizenship is moderated by strength of party affiliation in light of social identity theory. Results suggest that people holding diversity values actually consume diverse viewpoints on social media. Through such diverse exposure, partisans garner the most democratic benefits; they become more politically engaging online without sacrificing political knowledge or refraining from political expression on social media as non- or weak partisans do.",Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles: Networked News Dynamics,Communication and Technology

We review the literature on filter bubbles, echo chambers, and polarization to test five hypotheses positing that echo-chamber communication is associated with homophily in the physical world, chiefly the geographic proximity between users advocating sides of the campaign. The results support the hypothesis that echo chambers in the Leave campaign are associated with geographic propinquity, whereas in the Remain campaign the reverse relationship was found. This study presents evidence that geographically proximate social enclaves interact with polarized political discussion where echo-chamber communication is observed. The article concludes with a discussion of these findings and the contribution to research on filter bubbles and echo chambers.",Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles: Networked News Dynamics,Communication and Technology

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) proposes that external factors that allowing people to make personal choices satisfy their basic psychological needs for autonomy and enhance their enjoyment and engagement in an activity. At the same time, research has also shown that the burden of making constant choices can reduce people’s satisfaction and motivation. The result of experiment 1 indicated that although customization features could support news readers’ need for autonomy and enhance their engagement in the news, asking people to make choices constantly could have a detrimental effect on their perceived enjoyment in reading. Experiment 2 showed that, news readers’ own locus of control type (internal or external) moderate their perception of customization features.",Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles: Networked News Dynamics,Communication and Technology

The Impact of Character Attacks on Images of and Identification With Athletes in Football,3,"This paper analyzes the impact of attempts of character assassination (CA) on the brand image of and the identification with athletes. In professional sports, where athletes are increasingly brands in their own rights, brand management has become more and more important. While much focus has been laid on the creation and buildup of brands, we are interested in the deliberate efforts to harm an individual brand. The case around former SF49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick is perhaps the most prominent example in recent times. To research CA in that context, a 2x2 online experiment was conducted, in which two world-class football players, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, were exposed to character attacks. Since CA is a hardly researched concept from the field of political marketing, we wanted to explore whether it also applies in modern sports. Results show slight impacts of CA on athlete and brand identification and in one dimension of brand image.","Sports Communication, Marketing, and Management",Sports Communication

This is first study that suggests the steady rise in female sports journalists around the country could be positively affecting how people view them. This study also found that people rate sports journalists, regardless of gender, as more credible and knowledgeable when delivering fact-based vs. opinion-based stories.

The first study found that both team performance and sports fandom yielded main effects on brand connection. Specifically, sports fans with higher fandom reported highest brand connection after wins, while others with lower fandom exhibited lowest brand connection after losses. The second study suggested that team performance and game venue yielded both main and joint effects on brand trust and loyalty. Moreover, team identification mediated the joint effect of team performance and game venue on brand trust and loyalty. Practical implications were also discussed.","Sports Communication, Marketing, and Management",Sports Communication
2018-1573,2018,Paper Session,"Sports Diplomacy Opportunities, Challenges, and Strategies: The Case of Qatar World Cup Football 2022",1,"The current study conceptually explored the possible opportunities, and challenges faced by sports and mega events and suggested strategies to overcome such challenges. This study used the Qatar World Cup Football 2022 as a guiding case. The current study presented that due to lack of proper strategies and public relations expertise Qatar is failing to gain proper advantages from the mega event. The study then suggested how to utilize public relations and public diplomacy strategies to minimize the damage already done to the game and the country. Theoretical implications and limitations are also discussed.
Sports diplomacy is considered as an important country branding and ""soft power"" tool (Ginesta & de San Eugenio, 2014; Ndlovu, 2010). Sometimes, hosting such big sports events become a ""power"" and ""prestige"" issue for a nation that they put their every effort to make it successful (Grix, & Houlihan, 2014; Knott, Fyall, & Jones, 2015). Despite several controversies and criticisms, Qatar secured the bid to stage the World Cup Football 2022 which is considered as one of biggest sports event in the world. However, due to lack of proper strategies and public relations expertise, Qatar is failing to gain proper advantages from the mega event. Even though Qatar shows many promising aspects of hosting the World Cup Football 2022, it is also surrounded by multiple criticisms and challenges. In fact, the challenges are a lot more than the opportunities it prospects. Therefore, Qatar may damage its national image rather than improving it by staging the event. The current study thus proposed strategies that can be used to overcome such strategic challenges from public relations perspective.
The study has some theoretical implications to the field of public diplomacy. The main argument that can be made from the discussion that the idea of offsetting the negative impact of hard power with soft power does not always work (Samuel-Azran et al., 2016). Another aspect that emerged from the case of Qatar is that only money cannot buy diplomatic success. Despite having enough flow of capital and wealth, Qatar is facing challenges from inside and outside of the country. The study has limitation. This study is conducted based on conceptual framework only. A rigorous empirical study would generate more insights about the case of Qatar and also public diplomacy as a whole.

The project analyses patriarchal capitalist structures of sex tourism, inequalities of racialised and classed sexuality, and commodification of women’s bodies as international currency in post-colonial socio-political contexts. Complex negotiations between FBOs and men who pay for sex in Costa Rica lead to intersecting research foci of masculine identity, post-colonial politics, whiteness, and power. The project analyses complex connections of risk perception surrounding sex tourism in Costa Rica and men’s participation in sex tourism in this nation. As a unique project that straddles humanistic and social scientific research, the project has wide implications for increasingly important areas in scholarship and policy-making, most notably sex trafficking of women and minor children.",HIGH-DENSITY: Interrogating Abuse Against Women,Feminist Scholarship

The paper investigates the ways in which the news media discursively constructed domestic violence to the broader public, and engaged them emotionally and morally to the victim's suffering. By analysing a so far under-researched case from a Central-Eastern European country, the paper intends to address 1. the power of the news media to raise social awareness to issues previously treated as taboo (like domestic violence), 2. the lack of attention to media and their potential to facilitate social change in previous literature on Central Eastern-European anti-domestic violence activism. An earlier version of this paper has been submitted to the IAMCR conference this year, but since then the paper went through modifications.",HIGH-DENSITY: Interrogating Abuse Against Women,Feminist Scholarship

More specifically, the article interprets comments made by Spanish fans of the series about the reactions and behaviours of the leading couple. When evaluating how the couple in the series behave, forum participants respond according to gender stereotypes. They do this by justifying contempt shown by the male character and blame placing for treatment received by the female character. From these differences, a reflection is made on the perpetuation of myths justifying violence in a romantic relationship.",HIGH-DENSITY: Interrogating Abuse Against Women,Feminist Scholarship

2018-1579,2018,Paper Session,The Politics of Pity in Celebrity Anti-Trafficking Discourse,1,"In this paper I draw on Boltanski’s (1999) notion of politics of pity to explore the representations of women trafficked for prostitution in celebrity advocacy. My aim is to analyse how trafficked women are constructed through language and visual depictions of celebrity advocacy and how they are established as worthy of public pity and action. Using feminist critical discourse analysis and visual analysis, I analyse the performances of Emma Thompson and Jada Pinkett-Smith, examining the discourses they use to variously construct trafficked women as subjects of pity. I propose that celebrity anti-trafficking discourses displace trafficked women’s subjectivities and fail to identify a clear perpetrator of suffering, and therefore argue that, although celebrity is an important way to bring trafficked women into public view, advocacy projects analysed here evacuate the politics of pity of its political potential, which should compel us to reconsider how we depict this vulnerable group.",HIGH-DENSITY: Interrogating Abuse Against Women,Feminist Scholarship

Xinhuanet Co. Ltd., the business entity running the website, went public in October 2016 in Shanghai. This has marked the first step in the state news agency’s financialisation. Two main questions are addressed. First, what were the main driving forces behind Xinhuanet’s transformation from a governmental cultural organisation to a publicly traded enterprise, the majority shareholder of which remains Xinhua? Second, how to understand the nature of this transformation in relation to Xinhua’s wider marketisation process and that of the Chinese media sector as a whole? The paper argues that Xinhua’s financialisation via Xinhuanet is best understood as part of a state-administrated initiative in accord with Xinhua’s own business ambitions. The financialisation of news by state players such as Xinhuanet does not alter the underlying ownership structure of Chinese news media, which remain ultimately state-controlled.",EXTENDED SESSION PART 2: Global Communication and Asian Contexts,Global Communication and Social Change

Based on findings, we assume the nature of political talk is more deliberative when the everyday life experience is sufficiently transferred into the public and when the political space is embedded with personal connections. Comparing to the political space closely connected with the government, the potential spaces of everyday life located outside of conventional politics are more open and inclusive. Everyday political talk in such spaces opened up multiple opportunities for the disengaged citizens to be self-empowered and self-energized in their lifeworld, thus acquiring civic competency to engage in the political process in the context of China.",EXTENDED SESSION PART 2: Global Communication and Asian Contexts,Global Communication and Social Change

2018-1584,2018,Paper Session,Character-Audience Similarity in Comic Strip Messages and Intentions to Use Electronic Cigarettes among Young Adults: Implications for Narrative Message Design,6,"College students are a particularly vulnerable population for electronic cigarette use. We propose narrative communication as an effective way to communicate information on e-cigarettes and health to this population. Narratives that utilize characters similar to audience members on personal characteristics have been found to be effective. The present study employed an online experiment to test dimensions of character-audience similarity on intentions to use e-cigarettes, talk to peers about e-cigarettes, and seek information about e-cigarettes. The race, gender, and social role (i.e., identifying as a college student) of the target characters were manipulated in comic strip narratives about e-cigarettes. A diverse sample (N = 674) of Non-Hispanic White, Black, and Hispanic young adults (18-24 year olds) was recruited to test the effects of alignment on these characteristics. The results indicated that similarity of race and gender significantly predict lower intentions to use e-cigarettes, while social role similarity predict significantly lower intentions to talk to peers and seek information. This study demonstrated that different dimensions of similarity can predict different intentions and implies that health practitioners should align characters with audience members based on the specific objectives of a narrative intervention.","Narrative Motifs of Gendered Stereotypes, Health, Cigarettes, and Other Entertainments",Visual Communication Studies

Several approaches exist, with most of them focusing on how differences in content might influence enjoyment versus appreciation. The current study examines whether the same content presented in differing narrative structures elicits enjoyment versus appreciation. A 2 (Film: Memento vs. Pulp Fiction) X 2 (Narrative Structure: Chronological vs. Nonchronological) between-subjects experiment was conducted. Results showed that nonchronological narratives are more likely to be enjoyed and appreciated than chronological ones. Also, individual characteristics such as cognitive ability and need for cognition did not exert moderation effects on the responses.

The codebook outlines situations where gender practices and norms are made visible with the purpose of sustaining, rather than challenging, inequalities through three areas of interest: apparel, sexual advances, and gender in the work place. The research question asks: are the female protagonists of crime drama television representations of progressive gender politics or affirmations of gender inequality? This study has found that women detectives are exploited for their gender more often than the men who hold the same vocation. However, there are clear elements of progressive gender visibility that are emerging in newer shows, which indicate the potential for a trend.","Narrative Motifs of Gendered Stereotypes, Health, Cigarettes, and Other Entertainments",Visual Communication Studies

It draws on work suggesting that humans and news media prioritize outlying information, and argues that one reason for a negativity bias in news consumption and pro- duction is that negative information is more ‘outlying’, i.e., further away from expectations. Expectations change over time, however, and so too do negativity biases. This dynamic is explored using some simple simulations, followed by an empirical explication using data on the US economy alongside media coverage of the economy and public economic expectations. The end result is a broadly generalizable account of the shifting prominence of ‘outlying’ information.",Attention and Diffusion Processes,Computational Methods

The results revealed that developed countries were early adopters and the primary actors in the innovation of GM technology, while only 7 developing countries have appeared in the country citation network. Most developed countries were reluctant to apply GM technology to commercial cultivation of GM crops. In the organization citation networks, private businesses have stood out among the social entities involved in the patent citation network.

2018-1591,2018,Paper Session,"Impact of Self-Interest, Peer Influence and Global Popularity on Blogging Activities",3,"Previous studies explained users’ online information exposure from three basic perspectives: self-interest, peer influence and global popularity (Knobloch-Westerwick & Meng, 2009; Wang, 2014; Winter & Krämer, 2012). However, there’s still no clear answer about the dominance of the three mechanisms on information exposure. This study, using the clickstream dataset of CSDN.net, aimed to compare the effect size of these three motivations on user’ selective exposure. Furthermore, this study also paid attention to the further steps of information consumptions: continuous consumption after the first-time exposure and consumption activity types (browsing only, or having interactions with messages such as commenting, thumb-up, thumb-down, favorites, etc.). Finally, we found that peer influence was the most dominant factor that facilitated users to browse a blog, among these three mechanisms. Self-interest did not have a significant impact on user’s continuous consumption decision. In addition, among the three, only global popularity showcased strong explanatory power for decision on consumption types as browse only or with interactions.",Attention and Diffusion Processes,Computational Methods

To better understand the flow of collective attention, we construct the attention flow network using anonymous smartphone data of 100,000 users in a major city of China. In the constructed network, nodes are websites visited by users, and links denote the switch of users between two websites. We quantify the flow of collective attention by computing the flow network statistics, such as flow impact, flow dissipation, and flow distance. The findings reveal a strong concentration and fragmentation of collective attention for smartphone users, while the duplication of attention cross websites proves to be unfounded in mobile Internet environment. We further confirmed the law of dissipation and the allowmetric scaling of flow impact. Surprisingly, there is a centralized flow structure, suggesting that the website with large traffic can easily control the circulated collective attention. Additionally, we find that flow network analysis can effectively help explain the page views and sale volume of products. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of using the flow network analysis for computational communication research.",Attention and Diffusion Processes,Computational Methods

The present study argues that the diffusion patterns of political messages can influence the degree of selective sharing. Using a large-scale diffusion dataset from Twitter, this study found that messages that spread using multiple steps are more likely to involve cross-ideological sharing. Furthermore, the study found that this positive relationship is mediated by the distance between the sharers and the originators of the messages and suppressed by the number of connections among the sharers. Overall, the study found that the viral diffusion model, in contrast to the broadcast model, increases the likelihood of cross-ideological sharing and thus increases political diversity on social media.",Attention and Diffusion Processes,Computational Methods

However, despite agreement that the construct’s measurement should be context specific, self-efficacy has been examined extensively for its influence on routine but not crisis health behaviors. Performance of safeguarding behaviors during a health crisis challenges people in unique ways from routine health behaviors. Using a validated crisis self-efficacy scale, a national survey (n=370) was conducted in the late summer of 2016, when Zika virus was emerging as a global health threat, to analyze crisis self-efficacy and the importance of different considerations in decisions on whether to perform recommended safeguarding behaviors. Results position crisis self-efficacy as a significant predictor of evaluations of preparedness but not of perceived Zika risk. Also, advisories issued from state and federal health agencies influenced perceived preparedness. Implications for public health crisis theory and practice are discussed.","Zika and Ebola and Measles, Oh My! Diffusion of Information About Infectious Disease Outbreaks",Health Communication

Unfamiliar risks such as Zika are riddled with uncertainty and the subject of extensive media coverage, which may impact the fit of major information seeking models. We propose three major model modifications to PRISM: risk perception as a distal predictor of information seeking, the inclusion of media exposure as a predictor of risk perceptions, and perceived seeking control as a moderator of information insufficiency on seeking intention. A cross-sectional, online study of men and women of childbearing age (N = 494) residing in the state of Florida was conducted. Although perceived seeking control was not confirmed as a moderator of information seeking, we found support for the majority of our hypotheses.","Zika and Ebola and Measles, Oh My!

Using a cross-sectional survey, Study 1 examined the relationship between neuroticism and use of mediated channels to procure information about the virus. Study 2 used Google Trends Service and showed that aggregate-level neuroticism was positively associated with aggregate-level information seeking behavior. This association between neuroticism and public information seeking behavior was stronger as the volume of media coverage about Ebola virus increased. These findings contribute to a better understanding of personality-based predictors of health information seeking behavior in the face of a global public health crisis.","Zika and Ebola and Measles, Oh My!

2018-1599,2018,Paper Session,“Dey Say Teachers Are Pay Agents to Contaminate Children With Ebola”: Rumor Spread and Control During the Ebola Crisis in Liberia,5,"The severity of the 2014-2015 Liberian Ebola epidemic coupled with widespread misunderstanding about Ebola among Liberians, led to exponential growth of rumors. Rumor control during outbreaks is imperative to reducing public fears about a disease. In Liberia, a rumor tracker system was developed to detect rumors as quickly as possible through SMS messaging. The study focus was to assess rumor circulation and rumor control over time. The analysis relied on a content analysis of SMS messages, print and audio communications collected from Liberian newspapers, messages from the “Dey Say” tracker, and radio programs, from January 2014 to March 2015. Findings show that rumor circulation had a higher frequency in newspapers, but radio displayed higher frequency of rumor refutation. The “Dey Say” rumor tracker accurately predicted rumors before they appeared in radio programs and newspaper articles, indicating its effectiveness and usefulness in future health epidemics and emergency response plans.","Zika and Ebola and Measles, Oh My!

2018-1600,2018,Paper Session,Comparing Virtual Tourism to Real Life Experience: Effects of Presence and Engagement on Attitude and Enjoyment,2,"With the advent of 360-video technology, virtual reality (VR) devices can also take users to locations in the real world. Despite the increasing number of virtual tourism opportunities using VR technology, little research has assessed the extent to which a virtual tour approximates the experience of being physically present in the location. This study took users on a guided audio tour of a state Capitol building. Users either took the tour via two-dimensional video, immersive 360-video using a VR headset, or physically went to the location and walked around the grounds. Users were measured on their presence, engagement with tour, attitudes toward the tour and recall of content mentions and facts within the audio tour. Results indicate that users in the two-dimensional viewing condition scored low on all measures relative to the other conditions, but that individuals in the physically present and 360-video condition had little differences between them.","Virtual Reality: Empathy, Presence, and Immersion",Communication and Technology
2018-1601,2018,Paper Session,"Voices of the Unsung: Social Presence, Interactivity and Empathy-Building Empathy in 360 Video",6,"360 video is considered an “empathy machine,” in part because it places audiences in the perspective of the other. Despite its popularity, its influence on empathy is not fully understood. Two possible mechanisms driving empathy within 360 video are social presence (sense of being with others) and interactivity (degree of control over media content). To elucidate how 360 video may influence empathic outcomes through these factors, a 2 (presence of people: high/low) x 2 (interactivity: high/low) between-subjects experiment (N=100) was conducted testing 360 videos about climate change refugees. Results demonstrate that presence of people contribute to prosocial behaviors (donations) through empathic concern, whereas interactivity did not increase empathy or behaviors. However, presence of people led to significantly higher perceptions of user control compared to videos without people. Results are promising and elucidate the role of social presence and interactivity in 360 video. Findings and avenues for future research are discussed.","Virtual Reality: Empathy, Presence, and Immersion",Communication and Technology
2018-1602,2018,Paper Session,Two Birds With One Stone: An Explorative Analysis of the Interplay Between Narrative and Technical Immersion in 360-degree Videos,3,"360-degree videos are an innovative video format, and due to various narrative and technical aspects, it allows audiences to be deeply immersed in its content. These elements have not been investigated in detail yet. Through using an explorative, qualitative content analysis, and elements of narrative analysis, aspects of immersion were explored from various 360-degree videos. The results give an overview of multiple immersive factors in 360-degree storytelling and the interplay of narrative and technical aspects. Technical immersion, manifests through cues to direct the viewer’s attention and cues to acknowledge the viewer as a part of the virtual environment. Narrative immersion, on the other hand, is influenced by the setting, as well as the interplay of story, characters, and viewer integration. Our findings also indicate that narrative and technical aspects support each other to strengthen immersion.","Virtual Reality: Empathy, Presence, and Immersion",Communication and Technology
2018-1603,2018,Paper Session,VR and Empathy: Large-Scale Comparison of Non-Mediated and Mediated Perspective-Taking Tasks,5,"Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the “ultimate empathy machine” since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking (i.e. imagining what it is like to be someone else) is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). The combined results show that participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes and performed more prosocial behaviors toward the homeless than participants who just imagined becoming homeless or performed a less immersive mediated perspective-taking task.","Virtual Reality: Empathy, Presence, and Immersion",Communication and Technology

Guided by literatures in persuasion knowledge model (Friested & Wright, 1994), advertising disclosure (Wojdynski & Evan, 2016), and health message frames (Lee et al., 2013), this study proposes to conduct a content analysis of health native ads in popular digital news media. Preliminary findings suggest that while disclosure language is present, they are ambiguous (e.g., Custom Studio) and placed in small fonts in less recognizable areas (e.g., as a footnote). Further, multiple sources were quoted in the advertisements, with specific health products or services rarely being mentioned.

The first goal is to gain insight into the frames applied by the Dutch news media in their reports on euthanasia since 2016. The second goal is to develop alternative ‘counter-frames’: they can widen the imaging, allowing a more balanced view on euthanasia. The (counter-)frames were reconstructed by means of an inductive frame analysis of the Dutch news media and validated through a number of interviews with key stakeholders in the social debate. The findings identify four problematizing frames that are prevailing in the discussion on euthanasia. Complementary to each frame a deproblematizing counter-frame was defined. The paper concludes with a discussion on the practical implications of the results. The findings can offer a variety of stakeholders guidance in their line of thoughts and acting on euthanasia.",HIGH-DENSITY: Media Framing of Controversial Health Issues,Health Communication

This study fills these gaps in the literature by employing a 2x2x2 experimental examination (N = 800) of IPV composite news stories where sex of the perpetrator (male vs. female), sexuality of the couple (heterosexual vs. homosexual), and news story framing (episodic vs. thematic) were manipulated to examine differences in qualitative and quantitative outcomes. Dependent variables included perpetrator responsibility, sympathy for victims, and seriousness of IPV as a public health issue. Quantitative results show main effects for news story framing on all dependent variables, and two-way interactions of perpetrator sex and sexuality of the couple on all dependent variables. Qualitative open-ended offer insight into the nuances of IPV perceptions across conditions.

The current study therefore draws on content analytic data from four discrete media events across 2009-2016 to address our research question: To what extent has media coverage of mammography controversy evolved, as evident in both explicit mentions of conflict and/or controversy and the relative attention given to the risks and benefits of screening? Results suggest that while the number of stories using on-screen words to underscore conflict and/or controversy declined over time, stories covering screening recommendations remained largely controversial in tone. Moreover, the evolution of mammography controversy was reflected in shifts in the relative attention given to screening’s risks and benefits.",HIGH-DENSITY: Media Framing of Controversial Health Issues,Health Communication

Data were collected from three major Chinese media platforms which systematically archived widespread health misinformation and delivered corresponding corrective message since 2010. Specifically, information sources, title vividness, title certainty, emotional tone, theme, encoding system, content frame, narration frame, and behavioral suggestion were coded. Preliminary analyses revealed that health misinformation included more information from unspecified sources, whereas corrective messages had more information from scientific sources. Corrective messages utilized more hybrid encoding system (i.e., words, numbers, and pictures) and misinformation was more likely to be purely represented in words. It was also found misinformation had more emotional appeals than corrective messages.",HIGH-DENSITY: Media Framing of Controversial Health Issues,Health Communication

In Australia and New Zealand there are differing policy approaches towards vaccination (incentivization versus education respectively) making these countries an interesting case study.
All vaccination stories in three Australian newspapers and four New Zealand newspapers from 1 January 2016 to 31 October 2017 were collected. The data set comprised 256 articles that were thematically analysed.
Preliminary findings show articles framing pro-vaccinators as voices of reason and authority and protectors of health. In contrast, voices of anti-vaccination advocates are labelled as a dangerous threat to health. The newspapers provide for the expression of pro-vaccination voices, while silencing and suppressing anti-vaccination voices.

For this we tested a multiple mediation model, with the following components: (1) terrorism news media exposure (IV), (2) a state of hypervigilance, i.e. terrorism catastrophizing, (3) levels of suspicion, i.e. non-clinical paranoid thinking, and (4) Islamoprejudice (DV). All analyses were performed on cross-sectional data from a sample of Belgian young adults (n=704; age range =16-35). Our results were three fold. First, exposure to terrorism news coverage was significantly associated with a state of hypervigilance. Subsequently, a state of hypervigilance was associated with increased paranoid thinking. Third, the relation between media exposure and Islamoprejudice was fully mediated through the a state of hypervigilance and increased paranoia.

Mutual Influences Between Selective News Exposure and Ideological Leaning,3,"The growth of partisan news sources has raised concerns that people will increasingly select attitude-consistent information, which lead to increasing political polarization. Thus far, there is limited research on the long-term mutual influences between selective exposure and political attitudes. This study therefore investigates the reciprocal influences between selective exposure and political attitudes over several years, using a three-wave panel survey conducted in Sweden 2014–2016. More specifically, we analyse how ideological selective exposure to both traditional and online news media influences citizens’ ideological leaning. Findings suggest that (1) people seek-out ideologically consistent print news and online news, and (2) such attitude-consistent news exposure reinforces citizens’ ideological leaning over time. In practice, however, such reinforcement effects are hampered by (3) relatively low overall ideological selective exposure and a (4) significant degree of cross-cutting news exposure online. These findings are discussed in light of selective exposure theory and reinforcing spirals model.","Selective Exposure, Identity, Polarization",Mass Communication
2018-1613,2018,Paper Session,Polarizing Communication as Media Effects on Antagonists. Understanding Communication in Conflicts in Digital Media Societies,1,"In many democracies, political discourse has polarized and become more confrontational. This discourse is shaped by few highly active opinion leaders who are also heavy news consumers. This paper is a theoretical contribution and proposes to investigate media effects on opinion leading antagonists’ communication in political controversies. Integrating several media psychological mechanisms, it proposes that antagonists watch mainstream news on their cause closely and perceive it as hostile. This triggers certain cognitive, affective and behavioral reactions – certain presumptions of media effects on others as well as on the conflicting parties, motivated cognitions and information seeking behaviors as well as anger and indignation – all of which encourage antagonists to intensify their discursive participation and to use polarizing communication styles, such as exaggerations, incivility or lies. The basic claim of the paper is that effects of mainstream news on antagonists’ communication can explain the polarization of political controversies in digital societies.","Selective Exposure, Identity, Polarization",Mass Communication

Across all types of aggressive content, there was a small positive effect (r = .15) on relational aggression. However, the effect was strongest when exposure to relationally aggressive content (as opposed to overall exposure to media or exposure to physical aggression) was specifically examined ( r = .21).

Violent media use was assessed via children’s daily media diaries. Externalizing behavioral problems and peer rejection were assessed via parent reports. Peer rejection had both short-term and long-term consequences on externalizing problems, and violent media consumption amplified these effects, especially for heavy viewers. These moderating effects remained significant even after controlling for prior behavioral problems and later peer rejection, as well as other relevant variables. These findings are consistent with social cognitive theories and have important theoretical and applied significance.",Media Violence and Aggression,Mass Communication

To seek a deep understanding of how violent videogames affect Chinese players, this study examines how the presumed influence of violent videogames will have some real consequences for behavior. The mediating role of perceived telepresence and the amount of time spent playing violent videogames in influencing people’s beliefs about the effects of such games were hypothesized and tested. Results of data collected from a random sample of 528 respondents in China showed that playing violent videogames was indirectly related to taking restrictive and protective actions. The relationship was mediated by the level of perceptual realism and spatial presence as well as the presumed effect of violent videogames on others. Finally, the presumed influence of violent videogames was found to be a positive correlate of intention to take actions to protect others from the harms of such games.",Media Violence and Aggression,Mass Communication

The results reveal notably different repertoires, some defined by ideologically driven selective exposure, others defined by political interest selective exposure (preference/disinterest in the news), and others that are seemingly neutral. In turn, exposure diversity predicts voting behavior. While the impact on general election turnout was relatively weak, the findings indicate that greater exposure diversity predicts voting in the Democratic primary.

The milieu concept takes up this notion: According to this meso-level approach, basic political orientations and political efficacy are aligned with specific information repertoires and modes of communication. Aggregations of individual data display group-specific patterns of heterogeneous political communication practices. First, this paper aims to characterize milieus within the German citizenry. Based on a representative online survey (n=1.488) and a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified 12 distinct milieus. Second, we analyze the status of two citizen-level conditions of political integration. These include overlapping information repertoires and milieu-specific issue agendas.

Thus, we analyze what people actually search for with search engines during an election campaign, what results they encounter, and how these results reflect people’s issue-ownership attributions.
During the 2017 German Federal Election, we followed a multi-method design consisting of search volume data from Google Trends, survey data about ascribed party-issue links, and search results obtained from Google Search by agent-based testing. The highest search volume was found for queries related to general election facts. Search results originated mainly from established news outlets and reflected existing power relations between political parties.

Using RSiena, UCInet, and ORA, we found that, at a macro level, the forum’s structural qualities tended to become similar over time throughout the 13-month period. At a micro level, discussants’ network size was around three in average, and one out of five people was present in one’s discussion network after more than a year. Those who had a larger discussion network tended to share many conversations, rather than staying longer or showing up frequently in the forum. Reputation did not influence one’s network size. To maintain existing ties or create new ties, reciprocated relationships and popularity were important than other network parameters. These findings have theoretical and methodological implications for core discussion network literature.","HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Predictors of Online Behavior: Time, Motivation, and Content",Information Systems

This study extends that research and applies it to consumer engagement with media brands on social network sites. Behavioral commitment is tested as the driving force behind the impact of sharing or liking a branded post on attitudes toward that brand. Using an experimental design (N = 150), the study compares the effects of commitment versus mere thinking on attitude change, by assigning participants to share or like a brand’s post with their Facebook account. This allowed us to test “share” versus “like” affordances as different modalities of sharing. Findings show no significant differences between behavioral commitment and thought. However, Facebook users were more cautious in sharing posts, and more likely to be influenced by their own sharing (or thoughts about sharing) if they were relatively infrequent social media sharers.","HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Predictors of Online Behavior: Time, Motivation, and Content",Information Systems

The influence of media exposure, attitude toward technology, and knowledge on judgment and decision-making regarding communicative AI was examined. Analyses were based on data collected from 152 Japanese people. Results suggested that positive attitude toward technology can greatly increase perceived benefit of communicative AI, which would consequently lead to searching AI-related information, directly interacting with AI, and possessing AI products. Familiarity of communicative AI, which can also be contributed by positive attitude, can not only increase perceived benefit but also reduce perceived risk of the technology. Concerning the influence of media information, the more people read newspapers and use the Internet, the more likely they are to show positive attitude toward technology. Implications for science communication and promoting acceptance of AI technology are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Predictors of Online Behavior: Time, Motivation, and Content",Information Systems

Apart from paid crowdsourcing, unpaid crowdsourcing has also emerged, where volunteer crowd workers are recruited to contribute to crowdsourcing tasks for enterprises. While prior research efforts have clarified many issues related to participation on crowdsourcing, the reasons behind volunteer’s participation in enterprise crowdsourcing are still unexplored. Integrating perspectives from the uses and gratification theory and self-determination theory, this paper investigates the motives and underlying needs behind participation in a voluntary global crowdsourcing community. Interviews were conducted with 21 volunteer crowd workers to understand the factors driving them to spend time and effort contributing to the community. Responses were qualitatively analyzed and indicates that the autonomy, competence and relatedness needs were the underlying needs of the volunteer crowd workers. Furthermore, we found diverse motives consisting of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations driving users to contribute to enterprise crowdsourcing voluntarily.","HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Predictors of Online Behavior: Time, Motivation, and Content",Information Systems

It is crucial for audiovisual industry players, the incumbents or new entrants, to understand specific engagement types and their effects on user commitment to program or channel branding. This study conducted a national web survey to investigate 600 Singaporean social media users with prior experiences of engaging in online video discussions. The proposed model aims to investigate the relationships and mediation effects between Social TV users’ motivations, engagement types, and content commitment. Based on structural equitation modelling results, both hedonic and utilitarian motivations are positively associated with three types of engagement (functional, emotional and communal engagement). However, only communal engagement can predict Social TV commitment. As for mediation analysis, hedonic and utilitarian motivations can only have positive effects on commitment if respondents experience communal engagement. Theoretical and practical implications for Social TV are discussed.","HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Predictors of Online Behavior: Time, Motivation, and Content",Information Systems

A Model of Social Utility Over Time,2,"Work on the two-step flow of information from media to discussion networks is well established. However, there has been little research determining to what degree – and when – networks may drive information seeking. To address this gap, we explore the relationship between networks and media use before, during, and after a presidential election. Because media are often used for social utility, we hypothesize that discussion network size predicts media use. The more individuals for whom information may have social utility an individual is in contact with, the more he or she will be likely to seek out information. However, we also expect that this effect is constrained to periods of high salience – and usefulness. The findings presented here support our hypotheses. We also show that spikes were concentrated in news consumption via TV and internet.","HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Predictors of Online Behavior: Time, Motivation, and Content",Information Systems

Findings also revealed significant differences in how participants perceived the ethical climate and the presence of resistance influence behavior within their organization. Content and contingency table analyses did not demonstrate significant differences in injustice types among resistance stories.

2018-1633,2018,Paper Session,How Anonymity and Visibility Affordances Influence Employees’ Decisions about Voicing Workplace Concerns,2,"Employees can provide invaluable input to organizations when they can freely express their opinions at work. Employees, however, may not believe that it is safe or efficacious to voice their concerns. How features of communication channels affect employees’ safety and efficacy perceptions is largely ignored in existing voice models. Therefore, this study seeks to understand how the anonymity and visibility affordances of a communication channel influence employees’ safety and efficacy perceptions, and thus their intention to engage in prohibitive voice at work. Two between-subjects experiments were conducted to test how these channel affordances affect voicing behavior in organizations. The results indicate that the more anonymous and less visible participants perceive a voicing channel to be, the safer and the more efficacious they evaluate the channel. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.",Agency and Influence in Organizational Contexts,Organizational Communication

Drawing on six months of fieldwork at two homeless shelters for women, I argue that organizing Discourse can be used to explain how organizations create agency for themselves in vastly differing manners. By comparing how agency is understood and enacted in one neoliberal and one anarchist nonprofit organization, I argue that tensions, contradictions, and confusions around the institutional logics perspective may be resolved by examining the underlying systems of knowledge that make those logics rational. The findings from this paper have implications for scholars studying alternative organizing, nonprofit organizing, and institutional theory.",Agency and Influence in Organizational Contexts,Organizational Communication

Cancer patient magazines are associated with particularly high expectations in this regard. Against the theoretical background of the framing concept, we therefore conducted a quantitative content analysis of the portrayal of 137 CAM treatments mentioned in 39 articles of four highly circulated German cancer patient magazines. Results show that the portrayal of CAM focuses on nutritional and metabolic approaches and mostly takes a scientific perspective. CAM is mostly described as being applied in curative contexts and evaluated predominantly positively. However, explicit recommendations are hardly given. The study may foster adequate health communication in this field of medical uncertainty by critically reflecting CAM coverage, informing medical practice and advising health communication research to improve patients’ informed decision-making.",Mass Media and Website Portrayals of Health Issues,Health Communication

This content analytic study evaluated how sexual health is communicated on SHC websites. Utilizing a stratified random sample of 400 U.S. colleges/universities, we coded the sexual health topics, depth, and resources on SHC websites. Our findings revealed three themes. First, although few websites (9.0%, n = 36) had an explicitly labeled sexual health area, most of the remaining websites mentioned sexual health (80.2%, n = 292), suggesting that for many SHCs, sexual health is covered in a perfunctory way. Second, sex is framed as risky as evidenced by the emphasis on health prevention and risk topics, as compared to more sex-positive and relational topics. Third, sexual health is presented as a woman’s responsibility; women’s health areas far outnumbered men’s health areas, and demonstrated greater depth and greater number of resources.

An analysis of their presence, use and characteristics confirms that journalists and radio owners are not rigorous in the application of the legislation that regulate this advertising feature in Spain. This work focuses on these rules and establishes differences with other formats in order to conceptualise CP and propose a matrix of variables that identifies these illicit practices in the sample under study. The results show that CP are more prevalent during time slots with highest audience ratings and in programmes hosted by well-known radio personalities. Also, that most CP are embedded within the editorial contents of programmes without separation signals, are formatted as interviews and that their copy style is informative.","Regulatory, Normative and Structural Changes in Communication: Past and Contemporary ""Histories""",Communication Law & Policy
2018-1642,2018,Paper Session,Changing Roles of Broadcast Journalism: A Fresh Look at Legal Texts Concerning Broadcasting,2,"Starting with considerations on the ongoing transformation of broadcast journalism, the study aims at clarifying the role of community media in relation to the public and commercial sector. Taking Austria as an example and setting out from the assumption that legal documents codify social change, and hence are barometers for collectively recognized norms and of the changes they undergo, all Austrian legal texts and funding guidelines concerning broadcasting were subject to a comparative analysis with respect to their underlying perceptions of the societal role of broadcast media. The results show that there is no longer a broadcast journalism as such, but rather that several images of the role of broadcast journalism exist side by side. These role perceptions reflect the current changes in the conception of democracy. Community broadcast journalism is acquiring greater significance as it no longer treats media communication as one-directional, but rather as fundamentally participatory offerings.","Regulatory, Normative and Structural Changes in Communication: Past and Contemporary ""Histories""",Communication Law & Policy

2018-1644,2018,Paper Session,The Emerging Institutionalization of Global IoT Governance: A Network Approach,1,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been one of the buzz words evoking numerous issues regarding policy and governance, especially in the global level. Previous literatures on the Internet and IoT governance have embraced the ideology of “multistakeholderism” and the notion of “network”. However, the use of the network concept remains metaphorical, lacking further empirical investigation. In this sense, current study strives to achieve both theoretical and practical contribution to literature by incorporating institutional theory, network theory, as well as network analysis method. The study will address questions such as: who are the stakeholders in the institutionalization of global IoT governance? Are there networks of relationships? What are the dynamics? By conducting preliminary network analysis of five institutions involved in the IoT governance (i.e., OCF, oneM2M, Thread Group, ITU, IEEE) a crude map of the current global IoT governance was generated bearing several implications regarding “power”, industrial and regional diversities.","Regulatory, Normative and Structural Changes in Communication: Past and Contemporary ""Histories""",Communication Law & Policy

2018-1646,2018,Paper Session,Access Through Strategic Adaptation: An Ethnography of Mobile Phone Subsidies in the Digital Era,1,"Why subsidize mobile phones in an era of apparently universal access? Against the backdrop of sustained critique of mobile phone subsidies in the U.S., the current study questions the prudence of abandoning investments in mobile welfare. Typical evaluations of the Lifeline subsidy program emphasize high phone penetration and provider and beneficiary malpractice. Yet a view “from the bottom up” (Mueller and Schement, 1996) has consistently shown pronouncements of equal opportunity in phone access to be premature. Drawing on advances in mobile communication research and the lived experiences of subsidized phone users, the current study argues that “government phones” are critical to the social and economic wellbeing of the extremely poor, if not in ways recognized from the top down. The results cast the adoption of multiple phones as strategic responses to the “dependable instability” of technology access in the context of poverty (Gonzales, 2016), rather than as excess or criminality.","Regulatory, Normative and Structural Changes in Communication: Past and Contemporary ""Histories""",Communication Law & Policy

The question arises whether exposure to sexualization in mainstream media relates to the way youth present themselves online. The current study used a multi-method approach by combining survey research with content analytical data of Facebook profile pictures. Results showed that exposure to MTV reality shows, but not magazines, related to adolescents’ sexualized self-presentation on Facebook. Furthermore, internalization of appearance ideals mediated this association in two opposing ways. Specifically, internalization of appearance ideals was positively related to sexualized self-presentation Facebook. However, internalization of appearance ideals was negatively associated with online self-sexualization through body dissatisfaction.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1648,2018,Paper Session,The Male Gaze in Tween TV: A Longitudinal Exploration of the Impact of TV Exposure on Sexual Socialization in Early Adolescent Boys,2,"A sample of 496 boys aged 11.18 years (SD = 1.06), participated in a longitudinal study and completed measures 3 times at 6-month intervals. Finding from structural equation modeling revealed that the longitudinal model was moderated by parental socialization such that exposure to tween TV was associated with increases in views of males as sexually dominant, which in turn was associated with increased objectification of women’s bodies among adolescents who experienced high levels of gender-typical socialization from their parents. These findings suggest that media exposure among early male adolescents may contribute to the development of sexually objectifying attitudes towards women. In addition, they highlight the critical role of parents in modulating the effect of media exposure, and suggest the usefulness of engaging parents in interventions aiming to decrease these deleterious effects.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1649,2018,Paper Session,"“Who Does Not Dare, Is a Pussy.” A Textual Analysis of Media Panics, Youth, and Sexting in Print Media in Northern Belgium",3,"This article explores how print media in Northern Belgium represents sexting as related to youth culture. Drawing on a textual analysis of 232 news articles published between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2016, this article examines the discourses in news stories covering sexting. The results show that public discourses in newspapers and magazines mainly articulate youth sexting as a deviant behavior. This deviance discourse is strongly linked to a gendered representation of youth who are engaging in sexting. Young girls are portrayed as ‘sexually promiscuous,’ yet ‘thoughtless victims,’ and young boys as ‘sexually aggressive predators,’ resulting in a victimization of girls and criminalization of boys. Print articles in Northern Belgium pay little attention to consensual sexting, leading to stigmatizing youth sexting and denying the agency of young people. The article concludes that the binary discourse in print media does not only reinforce sexual double standards, but also leaves little space for a more diverse and active comprehension of sexting.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1650,2018,Paper Session,Sext-ual Double Standards: Gender Differences and the Gender-Related Consequences of Sexting for Adolescents,1,"This study explored a possible sexual double standard for adolescent boys and girls regarding sexting through a survey of 201 girls and boys aged 14-17 in the Midwestern region of the United States. The results showed that even though girls felt more negatively about sexting than boys, they felt a strong pressure to sext and thus intended to sext, while boys were more likely to request sext messages than girls. Furthermore, girls reported experiencing more negative consequences of sexting while boys reaped more benefits of sexting, and the acceptance of women as sex objects predicts attitudes about sexting and intention to sext for both boys and girls. Thus, the results confirm that at least in this sample, sexting functions on a system of sexual double standards. The results of this study can inform parents, teens, practitioners, and researchers about sexting double-standards, and can aid targeted intervention programs.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1651,2018,Paper Session,Investigating the Juncture Between Injunctive and Descriptive Norms of Parent-Child Communication About Pornography Among Parents of Middle Schoolers,1,"Previous research postulates parent-child communication about pornography as a protective factor to adolescent pornography engagement. However, to date, little is known about parents discussing pornography with adolescents. The present study explores the juncture between previously described descriptive norms of parent-child pornography communication to emergent peer-oriented and authoritative injunctive norms. The theory of normative social behavior was integrated to identify injunctive norms related to parent-child communication about pornography, or perceptions of what influential others suggest individuals “ought to do.” Findings from a multi-case, qualitative analysis of 33 in-depth interviews from parents of middle schoolers revealed several injunctive norm patterns. Observations include disparities within messages shared by influential peers concerning parent-child pornography communication, insights regarding peer judgement versus peer support, and tensions between closed communication family patterns conveyed by previous generations and the need for open parent-child communication about pornography. Suggestions are offered to encourage parent-child pornography communication that intersects with articulated injunctive norms as a means to greater influence parental behavioral practices.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media

As an explanatory mechanism, social learning processes were combined with the internalization mechanism of appearance ideals. Results showed that some media, in some countries, were related to the internalization of rewarded appearance ideals and self-sexualizing appearance behaviors. Interestingly, some similarities in the examined relations emerged across adolescents from Spain, Austria, Belgium, and South-Korea. First, social media use was significantly related to engagement in self-sexualizing behaviors among girls and boys from Belgium, Austria, and South-Korea. Second, the internalization of rewarded appearance ideals was related to girls’ engagement in self-sexualizing appearance behaviors, in all countries. The current study thereby provides an interesting cross-cultural perspective on the role of traditional and social media in adolescents’ (self-) sexualization.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1653,2018,Paper Session,Predicting Non-Consensual Forwarding of Sexts among Youth: The Role of Pornography and Instrumental Notions of Sex and Women,2,"Although (non-consensual) forwarding of sexts is an important aspect of sexting, the predictors of this behavior are currently understudied. The present study aimed to fill this gap by investigating online pornography use, and the subsequent endorsement of sexual objectification of women and instrumental attitudes towards sex, as predictors of whether adolescents and young adults have forwarded a sexually explicit image of someone to others without that person’s consent. Using data from a two wave short-term longitudinal survey among 1,947 participants (aged 13-25) we found that more frequent exposure to pornography significantly increased the odds of non-consensual forwarding of sexts. In addition, an increased acceptance of sexual objectification of women, as a result of more frequent pornography use, was associated with higher odds of non-consensual forwarding of sexts. These findings have implications for preventing non-consensual forwarding of sexts, by increasing our knowledge on which underlying mechanisms need to be targeted.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1654,2018,Paper Session,"Music Television, Online Pornography, and Sexual Stereotypes: Examining Short- and Long-Term Associations in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood",2,"Entertainment media consumed by adolescents have been criticized for their stereotyped depictions of sexual relationships. The current longitudinal study (N = 400) tests the reciprocal relationship between adolescents’ acceptance of gendered sexual roles and their exposure to either a moderately explicit (music television) or a highly explicit (online pornography) media type over three waves. The study innovates by including a fourth wave, approximately five years after wave three, when the respondents have reached emerging adulthood, allowing to study long-term associations across the two developmental stages. Results show that adolescent boys’ exposure to music television indirectly predicts their rape myth acceptance as emerging adults through an increase in the acceptance of gendered sexual roles during adolescence. However, unexpected results also occur. Most notably, younger adolescents’ use of online pornography negatively predicts their rape myth acceptance in emerging adulthood. Implications of the long-term consequences of adolescents’ media use are discussed.","Hybrid High-Density: Sex and Sexting and Pornography, Oh My!",Children Adolescents and the Media

We carried out a literature review of adolescent pregnancy in Jamaica, applying the dimensions of the PEN-3 Cultural Model, in order to categorize the emergent cultural factors that predict the phenomenon. Then, we examined the applicability and validity of that initial taxonomy by comparing it with cultural factors that emerged from semi-structured focus-group interviews with Jamaican adolescent mothers. Emergent cultural factors identified in the initial literature review were largely confirmed and extended after primary data collection, such as parental interaction and control, intergenerational transmission of adolescent pregnancy and experiences of sexual abuse. Results index a unique entry point for a health communication intervention through self-efficacy and resilience, positive cultural factors that emerged as predictors of the phenomena.","Perspectives From Jamaica, Canada, Malaysia, and Iran: Four Intercultural Studies",Intercultural Communication

2018-1659,2018,Paper Session,Reflective Action in the Digital Age,2,"In digitalization some see great opportunities for democracy while others see it as a threat to a free opinion-forming process. The way we collect information, as well as the effects of new technologies on our brain and on our information processing as well as the possibilities of manipulation through algorithms are seen as a danger for reflective opinion formation and thus for democracy. Reflective judgements are more likely if different and qualitatively high information is included in a decision and if divergent viewpoints and positions have been weighed against each other. Especially the elites play a central role when it comes to the shaping of a nation's political structure. It is thus essential that they form reflective opinions with the inclusion of divergent positions. In order to find out how broadly based the opinions of these key players are in the digital age, qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 Swiss decision makers from politics, business, administration, science, media and the IT sector. The study finds that the decision makers rely on the offline world to meet different viewpoints and abstain from discussing key issues in new media channels with an unknown public. Their position gives them a decisive advantage, since they do not have to actively search for other views, but are automatically confronted with other perspectives in public talks. The omnipresent availability of information is often and willingly used, but the overload of information leads to the fact that in the end only a few familiar sources will be relied upon.",Thinking About Technology,Communication and Technology

Remarkably, positive and negative perceptions of such ICT use are significantly positively correlated. This study questions the presumption of a dichotomous ICT effect in the extant literature and the perspective of technological determinism much of that literature adopts.
Situational strength factors, including perceived organizational support and supervisor support, are significant predictors of WLC. Furthermore, these situational strength factors moderated the relationship between positive perception of ICT use and WLC. When supervisors are were very supportive and when organizational norms assumed that work should always take priority, positive ICT perception had a greater effect on WLC reduction.

The model received good support. Metacommunication was associated with all four dimensions of behavioral evaluations (i.e., functional, symbolic, normative, and restrictive) and those evaluations had varying associations with actual usage patterns (i.e., functional and symbolic) of mobile phones. These results are discussed in relation to the MPA theoretical framework and mobile communication research, in general.

By no means mutually exclusive, these different bodies inform the design process in different and oftentimes contradictory ways. This paper suggests first, that the study of the body is a useful lens through which to consider the nexus of representation, commemoration, collective memory, and national identity and second, that the concept of “the body” is key for understanding the communicative power of memorials.","The Body, Memorial Culture and Alan Kurdi",Visual Communication Studies
2018-1668,2018,Paper Session,Separate Centenaries: New Visual Memory of the Somme and the Easter Rising in Belfast,1,"This paper explores the recent transformation of political murals in Belfast, Northern Ireland, amid a range of projects marking the 2016 centenaries of two events: the Easter Rising, and the Battle of the Somme during the First World War. Following other “re-imaging” public-art programs in this post-conflict city, some centenary murals have replaced violent imagery representing the more recent events of the Troubles, yet the new tributes resituate that conflict within a broader historical drama that is not over. In the city center, long-planned public-history exhibitions attempted to interpret the two events together as a “shared history”; in the outlying, sectarian neighborhoods, two separate histories unfolded anew on gable walls. This paper explores the ways in which this public embrace of a distant past, out of living memory, offered a set of new visual narratives that revivify events of living memory, rhetorically continuing conflict in a still-divided society.","The Body, Memorial Culture and Alan Kurdi",Visual Communication Studies

The users that create, disseminate and engage with this visual content, constitute a networked public that is rendered through expressions of shared solidarity. danah boyd (2010) presents four properties of networked publics in social media: persistence, replicability, scalability and searchability. Instagram is a platform where all four are in evidence, however, this study particularly zooms in on the replicability of discursive material and adds to this the re-appropration of images as a user practice to connect with an online public that mourns collectively.","The Body, Memorial Culture and Alan Kurdi",Visual Communication Studies
2018-1670,2018,Paper Session,"The Temporality of “Awareness-raising” Memorials and the Making of the ""Always-Already Lost""",1,"This article considers contemporary public art representations of displacement looking at how three artworks produced since the summer of 2015, to “raise-awareness” of the crisis of forced migration and the deaths that resulted from it, function to constitute both their audiences and the refugees on whose behalf they claim to speak: Ai Weiwei’s re-enactment of the image of drowned Syrian-Kurdish toddler and subsequent installation of 14000 life jackets on the façade of the Konzerthaus in Berlin, and Jason deCaires Taylor’s underwater sculpture installation off the coast of Spain, The Raft of the Lampedusa. Situated at the intersection of feminist critiques of humanitarian visualities and visual/cultural studies, and owing much to theories of biopolitics, of memorials, this paper argues that as international artworks that memorialize in “real-time”, these projects, work, often in opposition with their stated intentions, to silence voices of displacement.","The Body, Memorial Culture and Alan Kurdi",Visual Communication Studies
2018-1671,2018,Paper Session,Social Media and Global Activism: A Survey of Transnational Nonprofits,2,"Based on a survey of 146 communications professionals from 146 U.S.-based transnational nonprofit organizations, this research examines how organizational characteristics and attributes of individual communicators influence nonprofits’ adoption and use of social media. Our results show that the organizational leadership’s support for social media activities—overall, resource, and policy—was the most significant factor in the organization’s adoption and use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram even when considering other factors at the organizational and individual levels. The size of the communication team was negatively associated with importance of social media for fund-raising. However, communications professionals’ individual attributes (e.g., age, gender, years in the current position, and perceptions of technology) were not significantly related to their organizations’ social media efforts. These and other findings provide scholarly and practical implications for social media in global activism and advance research on technology adoption and use by nonprofit organizations.",Social Media and Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-1672,2018,Paper Session,The Appropriation of Traditional Media Contents in Online Contexts: A South Korean Textbook Case,2,"This study explores the relationship between the use of social media messaging and traditional protest movement communication in the global context. It focuses on the recent South Korean protest movement that arose in opposition to the government’s October 2015 decision to issue a single state-history textbook in all secondary schools across the country. Specifically, the study addresses activists’ appropriation of traditional media contents – eg. the transference of content from media such as news outlets into social media messaging. The results suggest that activists utilize traditional media content rather than personalized action frames in order to increase responsiveness in the volatile protest environment, be competitive amongst the large and rapid flows of information, and enhance their own credibility and legitimacy. A primary force behind the appropriation was activists’ motivation to legitimize their messages. Also, platform type and content type were closely associated with the frequency and choices of appropriation.",Social Media and Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

The hazards of democracy in Indonesia appeared after the conflict between the Indonesian national police (POLRI) and the KPK (Clough 2015; Tapsell 2015a). The Save KPK movement showed that the Indonesian public were capable of civic engagement and participation in a bottom-up relationship, and one example of a creative grassroots campaign to support democracy in Indonesia. Digital media practices in Indonesia have promoted participation of more young people than ever before to engage in political and civic activism. This paper focuses on Indonesians (activists, politicians, and government staff) as the coalition group and Indonesian students that were involved in the Save KPK Movement. The coalition group used voluntary based participation like in the connective logic (Bennett and Segerberg 2012), however, the maintenance issues, continuity actions, and mobilization of people for the Save KPK required leader, commitments, and resources from the coalition group.",Social Media and Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

While social media present new opportunities for youth who were previously excluded from formal channels of political participation, increasingly, these platforms also subject youth to surveillance, censorship, and other forms of repression.

In this study, I examine digitally active, young civic actors in Cambodia, an authoritarian regime with a demographic youth bulge and rapidly increasing uptake of social media. Specifically, I focus on social media tactics employed by youth to navigate contentious politics and express dissent under state control and surveillance.

The findings show how young activists rely heavily on hidden tactics to exert influence on public issues using social media in highly contentious, high-risk political climates.

2018-1675,2018,Paper Session,Stitching the Campaign Against the Disjunctures of the WeChatsphere,1,"A new approach of studying activism, connective action, suggests that digital media platforms now serve as non-human organizers and substitute formal organizations in connecting and birthing activist collectives. This approach ignores that digital media platforms may be engineered to erect walls and isolate individuals, information, and resources and hence hamper activism organizing. A China-based digital media platform—WeChat—is an example of a closed system that disintegrates more than it connects. Using a case study to examine how the recent generation Chinese Americans organized a campaign in and through WeChat, I demonstrate how individual activists leveraged organizational resources to cross boundaries, bridge gaps, and weave scattered networks of persons and resources together in a unique way of hybrid organizing, i.e., individual-driven organizational participation. This study challenges connective action’s tacit endorsement of automated sociality; I argue that activist communities come from human agents’ interaction with digital platforms’ socio-technical designs, be they connective or disconnective.",Social Media and Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

However, the precise relations between psychology and online nationalist protests are still hardly considered. The study investigates the role of three psychological underpinnings, including emotion, moral conviction, and identity in shaping online nationalist protests by contrasting two cases in China: the 2012 anti-Japanese movement and the 2017 anti-Korean movement. Based on the data obtained from posts on Weibo (n = 1330), a content analysis provides rich evidence for similarities and differences of the activists’ psychology in the two protests. From the comparative perspective, the analysis reveals larger-than-commonly-assumed psychological differences in different online nationalist protests, and develops a new typology to separate the anti-Japanese movement -- as a mixed outcome of both the state nationalism and the heritage of the anti-colonial nationalism -- from the rest of nationalist movements.",Social Media and Political Participation,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-1677,2018,Paper Session,An Extension and Application of Intergroup Principles to Multiple Co-Present Online Social Identities,1,"Research on intergroup interaction in online contexts has expanded in recent years, as the Internet and social networking sites (SNS) become ubiquitous and commonplace forms of mediated interaction. SNS present an additional challenge for researchers interested in studying group dynamics due to the co-presence of multiple (often overlapping) social groups in an individual’s network. While this phenomenon has been examined in relation to its effects on self-presentation and privacy—dubbed “context collapse” there is a notable lack of integration between long-established principles of intergroup communication and context collapse research. This paper provides several areas where intergroup principles and context collapse research mutually inform each other, and presents avenues ripe for research to expand understanding of this complex identity environment from an intergroup perspective.",Exploring Intergroup Dynamics Online,Intergroup Communication

Despite the growing number, domestic and international students rarely engage in meaningful intergroup contact. The literature shows that language proficiency plays a central role in inhibiting intergroup interaction. Based on this literature and intergroup contact theory, we examined language proficiency’s effects on US students’ desire to engage in future interaction with international students. We found that observing a high language proficiency international student on Facebook positively predicts desire for future contact with the outgroup member online. Additionally, identification with the outgroup member significantly mediated the effect of English proficiency on the desire for future interaction with the outgroup member in person and online. Lastly, we showed that English proficiency can affect desire for future interaction with the outgroup as a whole through identification with the outgroup member and desire to further interact with that outgroup member.",Exploring Intergroup Dynamics Online,Intergroup Communication

We conceptualize online contact as occurring through users’ comments online, an easy and accessible venue for intergroup encounters. We test two forms of online contact: encountering an outgroup member directly (direct online contact) or through an ingroup member (extended online contact) and their effects on various forms of perceived threat and social distance. We also examine the emotional mechanisms through which these effects emerge. We rely on an online experiment (N = 396) testing online contact with two distinct outgroups, an undocumented immigrant or a gay person. Compared to the control, direct online contact decreased perceived threat and social distance toward gays and lesbians, but not toward undocumented immigrants. Direct online contact improved attitudes toward both outgroups through positive and negative emotions, whereas extended online contact reduced negative emotions, improving attitudes towards undocumented immigrants.",Exploring Intergroup Dynamics Online,Intergroup Communication

Sexual selection theory and ambivalent sexism theory were used to formulate hypotheses to predict men’s self-reported gazing behaviors and attitudes about gazing. Five factors of male gaze were identified, pilot tested, and operationalized: frequency of gaze, unacceptability of gaze, male enjoyment while gazing, perceived female enjoyment while receiving gaze, and awareness of gaze. Heterosexual men (N= 236) completed an online survey. Results suggest that higher self-reported acceptability of short-term sex, desire for short-term sex, and higher hostile sexist beliefs all predicted frequency of gaze, unacceptability of gaze, and male enjoyment while gazing. Implications for identifying men who engage in the objectification of women are discussed.",Nonverbal Elements of Communication,Interpersonal Communication

This paper identifies if distinct facial features relate to higher perceived intimidation— in particular, contours of the eyebrows. A set of 12 gray-scaled photographs compromising of manipulated eyebrow contours was used for this study. 104 participants viewed these photos before indicating the level of intimidation evoked by each photo. A six-item novel instrument that was created to measure intimidation. Repeated measures ANOVA suggest partial significance between contours of the eyebrows and perceived intimidation. This study proposes an importance for noting how facial features could possibly alter the outcome of different face-to-face interactions in both professional and interpersonal relationships.

2018-1684,2018,Paper Session,Immediate and Durable Susceptibility to Emotional Contagion Among Peer Health Educators,1,"Peer Health Education (PHE), defined as teaching and/or sharing health information by trained college students, has long been found to enhance health-related behaviors (e.g., physical activity, smoking, safe-sex practices) in college-aged students (Milburn, 1995; Webel, Okonsky, Trompeta, & Holzemer, 2010). The nature of PHE requires that peer educators frequently engage in emotionally laden and potentially burdensome conversations, which leaves them highly susceptible to emotional contagion, or the transfer of emotion between people (Kornman, 2001). This paper examines associations between communicative factors, including behavioral mimicry and emotional energy, and peer educators’ immediate and durable emotional contagion following one-on- one sessions with peers. Upon communicating with a peer seeking help, peer health educators (N = 145) completed a survey. Analyses revealed significant positive associations between conversational factors of one-on-one PHE interactions (e.g., mimicry and emotional energy) and emotional contagion. Further, topic severity predicted durable emotional contagion two weeks following PHE conversations.",Nonverbal Elements of Communication,Interpersonal Communication

This time period saw a proliferation of media outlets that represented alternative voices or engaged in alternative publishing strategies. Adopting the theoretical framework of media ecology, I analyzed the political economy of the alternative media niche. It was argued that the emergence of an alternative media niche was facilitated by digital technologies, but technological development was not the sole driving force. The centralization of media ownership collided the ability of mainstream media to represent a wide spectrum of opinions. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of institutional politics was challenged by street politics, and the loosening of institutional control over dominant ideology opened up a new space for political discussion and civic engagement. Alternative media utilized digital communication technologies to respond this decreased supply and increased demand for media products that articulate different voices of Hong Kong society.",Media Institutions and Content: Studies of Traditional and Emerging Forms,Media Industry Studies

However, lack of formal or informal support in the workplace could undermine the positive impact of the ACA. For example, supportive or harmful messages sent by supervisors or coworkers may impact nursing mothers in positive or negative ways, respectively. This manuscript presents data collected from women who recently or currently pumped breast milk at work.

First, with survey data (n = 91) collected from users of social network sites and online communities, hypotheses regarding positive associations between intensity of an individual’s engagement in social media and four different types of social support—emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal support—were tested as well as hypotheses regarding mediation effects of the social support variables in the association between social media use and depression. Second, through focus group interviews (n = 15), influences of social media use on social support were more thoroughly explored as well as their influences on general psychological disposition. Results from hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that both intensity of SNS use and online community use significantly predicted instrumental, informational, and appraisal support, while they did not predict emotional support. Further regression and Sobel tests showed that higher levels of intensity of SNS use and of online community use both led to lower levels of depression through the mediation of instrumental and informational support. Analysis of the interviews further revealed the positive roles of social media use in building social support and healthy psychological dispositions. However, analysis also revealed some negative consequences of and limitations to social media use for those with physical disabilities.

The current study aimed to explore the answer. Through interviews with mothers who have experienced postpartum depression, different types of social support sought and provided are observed, but not all types of social support. Initially engaged in online communities to seek informational support, as they became comfortable with their membership in these groups, users began to share not only informational and tangible but also emotional and esteem support. Findings also suggested that affirming normality while coping with postpartum distress was an integral part of the social support sharing among postpartum mothers.

Often times, family members operate as interpreters. However, little is know about when HPs decide to use family members as medical interpreters (FMIs), and the extent to which these decisions comport with government and hospital policy. To understand how HPs make these decisions, 71 healthcare practitioners in neonatal and pediatric units in a large tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia were interviewed using a verbal protocol analysis. Results showed that HPs considered some ideal characteristics of an FMI, and the situational context as the main decision factors. Ultimately, situational necessity determined that an FMI would be used. Results generally comported with government and hospital policy. However, HPs lacked knowledge of those policies. Educating HPs about hospital policies for FMI use could help them confidently deliver better care for patients with LEP.","HIGH-DENSITY: Interpersonal Communication Between Doctors, Patients, and Family Members",Health Communication
2018-1695,2018,Paper Session,Socially Constructed Medical Encounters: Exploring the Landscape of Doctor-Patient Communication Through Experiences of Indian Women Living in Singapore,2,"Critical health scholarship (Nettleton,2006) has in the past highlighted the influence of broader structures such as biomedicine in health contexts, emphasizing equally about the utility of seeing meanings of health as social constructions by social actors (Lupton, 2014). However, in exploring medical encounters (medical conversations in a clinic), such as how patients as social actors negotiate and interpret medical conversations, much less has been discussed from a critical and/or social constructivist view point. This study attempts to address this gap, examining medical encounters as social constructions. The context of research is Singapore and the study employs in depth interviewing as its data collection tool, with participants being women residing in the country. Preliminary results suggest how meanings of medical encounters surround biomedical expectations (such as the flow of medical conversations) and biomedical experience (such as the lacking phenomenon of medical relationship building), with both influencing each other.","HIGH-DENSITY: Interpersonal Communication Between Doctors, Patients, and Family Members",Health Communication
2018-1696,2018,Paper Session,How Physicians Perceive Patients Disclose: Access to Sensitive Psychosocial Information,2,"Multiple models in communication literature explicate how information is disclosed to different individuals within their network. However, a gap exists in describing the disclosure of private, personal, and sensitive health information from the patient (sender) to the primary care physician (PCP) (receiver) and understanding the disclosure process from the perspective of the receiver (PCP). Through a qualitative research approach, we conducted individual, semi-structured interviews (n=17) with PCPs to understand their perceptions of situations when patients disclose sensitive, personal health information in the course of supporting diabetes care in the primary care visit. Key findings include that PCPs (receivers) perceive how they facilitate patient (senders) disclosure of personal, sensitive health information during the primary care consultation. This paper contributes to the existing disclosure literature, specifically DD-MM, to depict disclosure from the perspective of the sender (discloser) but does not address how the receiver (PCP) may perceive facilitation of disclosure.","HIGH-DENSITY: Interpersonal Communication Between Doctors, Patients, and Family Members",Health Communication

For American youth, the second leading cause of injury-related death is due to firearms. A survey of parents found that one in three homes contain a firearm, and at least 25% were stored loaded. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests communicating steps to protect children from guns, including asking if a firearm is in the home, counseling parents about gun-related dangers, and safe gun storage. Despite these recommendations, only 13% of parents reported discussing firearm risk with their pediatric providers. This research interviewed 16 providers and 20 parents about their experiences communicating about firearm risk in well-child exams.

However, care coordination organizations offer an intriguing opportunity to research how patient-provider communications and relationships unfold in non-clinical contexts. This exploratory study investigated the communication experiences and relationships between patients and providers/staff involved in a community-based care coordination organization (CCO). Nine chronically ill patients and five providers/staff participated in semi-structured interviews which were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Three themes related to patient-provider relationships in the CCO emerged: 1) Participants viewed compassionate caring as central to their experiences with the CCO, 2) Participants felt that strong patient-provider relationships encouraged patients to follow through with treatments, and 3) The CCO context facilitated the formation of strong patient-provider bonds. These findings suggest that home-based care coordination organizations may improve providers’ abilities to engage in patient-centered communication practices.","HIGH-DENSITY: Interpersonal Communication Between Doctors, Patients, and Family Members",Health Communication
2018-1699,2018,Paper Session,Do Expectations or Intentions Better Predict Whether Patients Communicate Genetic Carrier Results With Biological Family Members?,5,"Behavioral theories in health communication research posit intention as an upstream predictor of behavior. However, the intention-behavior gap is a concern when modeling behavior in novel health contexts, and additional constructs may be needed to effectively predict behavior. This study investigates the comparative ability of expectations vs. intentions to predict family communication in the context of genetic carrier testing. Using data from the NIH ClinSeq cohort, we conducted multivariable logistic regression to predict family communication. Expectation predicted communication one month after genetic test results were returned. Both intention and expectation predicted communication at 6 months. Results have implications for theorizing and predicting family genetic communication. Findings inform the adaptation of behavioral health theories to include expectations in genetic communication research. Incorporating appropriate intermediate behavioral measures can help researchers and clinicians to identify patients who may benefit from additional intervention support to facilitate family communication about inherited genetic risk and health.","HIGH-DENSITY: Interpersonal Communication Between Doctors, Patients, and Family Members",Health Communication

Using a mixed methods design, we examined relational openness, masculinity, cancer severity, and family history of PCa as possible predictors of openness with sons about PCa, familial risk, and screening. Preliminary survey results (n = 135) show that relational openness is a particularly strong predictor of openness with sons about PCa and screening, though family history of PCa and being from the U.S. also predict openness about PCa topics. Preliminary results from interview data (n = 33) suggest that fathers are open about screening with their sons regardless of PCa severity. Fathers whose fathers were also diagnosed but didn’t talk about their PCa voice a commitment to informing their sons about familial risk and screening.

The current study investigates the ways in which local anti-Muslim crime news transforms into a globalized public agenda. To expand the boundary of crime news audience to a global scope, the study used unsupervised machine learning, i.e., structural topic modeling, and analyzed globally generated, large-scale Twitter conversations surrounding the Quebec mosque shooting in 2017. The results uncovered nine multi-news frame clusters, together reflective of complex processes of responsibility attributions. Moreover, global geographic, cultural, and source proximity influenced the prevalence of these frames. Considering potential resonance of Islamophobia across different societies, local crime news, which are seemingly an isolated incident at a single place, can have ripple effects on faraway global audience’s political lives in their own places.",When Media Meet Computational Methods,Mass Communication
2018-1702,2018,Paper Session,Virality of Swearing Utterance Online: The Case of Mainland-Hong Kong Controversial Issue on Weibo,2,"Increasing scholarly attention has been given to the prevalent swearing on the internet. Text-based computer-mediated communication arguably invites more aggression and hostility than offline setting because of the loosening social regulation and anonymity. It is argued that swearing and cursing in online communication has severe consequences on the process of democratic deliberation. As documented in the literature, swearing would prevent the discussants to construct solid argument and then harm the political discussion. Nevertheless, few have concerned that incivility which occurs in social media is pure individual behavior or has the potential to facilitate collective practice. The current study addressed the factors that contribute to the contagion of swearing in the Social Networking Sites. We used the case of Mainland-Hong Kong controversial issue on Weibo (a Twitter-like social media in China). We found that in a post, linguistic context including emotion words and pronouns played an important role on the spread of swearing utterance. On the contrary, source cues in terms of authority and bandwagon cues had limited influence on virality of the cursing words.",When Media Meet Computational Methods,Mass Communication
2018-1703,2018,Paper Session,Exploring the Effects of Social and Political Influences on Immigration News Coverage: A Historical Analysis of The New York Times (1947-2005),5,"Abstract

In this project, we seek to understand the evolution of the public discourse about immigration and immigrants as a function of changes in the social, political, and economic conditions in the United States. Using machine assisted content and sentiment analyses, we first examined nearly 100,000 articles related to immigration issues published in the New York Times from 1947 to 2005. Then, we analyzed the impacts of demographic shifts and economic and political cycles on the quantity, sentiment, and topical interest of immigration related news reporting.",When Media Meet Computational Methods,Mass Communication
2018-1704,2018,Paper Session,Mining Media Topics Perceived as Social Problems by Online Audiences: Readers’ Perception of News Agendas,2,"Media audiences that represent a significant part of a county’s public may hold opinions on media-generated definitions of social problems different from those of media professionals. The proliferation of user-generated content makes such opinions available, but simultaneously demands new automatic methods of analysis that media scholars still have to master. In this paper, we show how topics regarded as problematic by media consumers may be revealed and analyzed by social scientists with a combination of data mining methods. Our dataset consists of 33,877 news items and 258,121 comments from a sample of regional newspapers. With a number of new, but simple indices we find that issue salience in media texts and its popularity with audience diverge. We conclude that our approach can help communication scholars effectively detect both popular and negatively perceived topics as good proxies of social problems.",When Media Meet Computational Methods,Mass Communication
2018-1705,2018,Paper Session,"The Dark Side of Morality? How Gender, Moral Identity and Ideological Orientation Influence the Response to Hate and Counter Speech Comments and Induce Backlash Effects",2,"Hate speech in user comments is often targeted towards out-groups such as immigrants, women but also homosexual or transgender persons. Besides the general severity of such offenses, social media users’ personal characteristics influence the evaluation of hate comments. This paper focuses on the flagging of hate comments aimed towards women and sexual minorities. We investigate the influence of user’s inherent morality (moral identity and moral foundations) on the flagging of such comments. Relying on social role and backlash theory, we scrutinize in how far gender plays a role in flagging behavior and in how far people perceive hate comments by females as an act of double deviance. Online survey data indicate that moral judgments are to some extent gendered as females are more concerned about fairness and avoiding harm to others than males. Deviant and agentic online behavior by females is judged more strictly than such behavior by males.",Morals and Media,Mass Communication
2018-1706,2018,Paper Session,Moral Panic or Moral Failing? Contested Construction of Cyberbullying in Newspaper Opinion Pieces,1,"This study uses the lens of moral dyad theory to analyze construction of cyberbullying as a contested social issue in newspaper opinion pieces. Moral dyad theory posits that when we perceive harm, we are motivated to identify a cause of harm and a suffering victim. Analysis of opinion pieces identified a tension between perception of cyberbullying as harmful and epidemic, and the belief that some aggression was normative and that harm from speech was suspect. Construction of cyberbullying was also contested around who or what was held responsible for cyberbullying, namely adolescents themselves, their parents, or the technologies that were seen as catalyzing cruelty. These findings suggest that, depending on ideological orientation, cyberbullying serves as an exemplar for how technology is shaping adolescent social life and mental health; how marginalized identities put individuals at risk of aggression; or how claims to victimhood and identity politics are threats to free speech.",Morals and Media,Mass Communication
2018-1707,2018,Paper Session,Corresponding Morals Featured in Media Content to Moral Intuitions in Media Users: A Test of the MIME in Two Cultures,2,"The model of intuitive morality and exemplars (MIME, Tamborini, 2013) adopts a framework which focuses on media’s influence on moral intuitions described in moral foundations theory (Haidt & Joseph, 2007). It predicts that moral representations in media content make certain moral intuitions stronger in audiences and vice versa. This proposition was tested in a two-phase study. Content analyses measured the frequency of moral domain representations in top-watched TV serials from India and the U.S, while an implicit measure (MF-AMP) gauged the strength of corresponding moral intuitions in viewers of these shows. Findings reveal strong relationships between patterns of moral representations in content and patterns of moral intuition strength in viewers (as compared to non-viewers) of the TV serials in both cultures.",Morals and Media,Mass Communication
2018-1708,2018,Paper Session,Gratifying Ambiguity: Investigating Predictors of Enjoyment and Appreciation of TV Series Featuring Morally Ambiguous Characters,2,"Morality plays an integral role in perceiving and judging fictional characters since morally good characters are liked which is important for the enjoyment of a narrative. However, some fictional characters frequently violate moral standards but are very popular anyway. While previous studies have primarily explored viewers’ enjoyment of these characters, other entertainment gratifications like appreciation have only initially been investigated. The present study offers a two-process model on the appeal of morally ambiguous characters, proposing psychological mechanisms leading to either enjoyment or appreciation. This model was tested by means of an online survey (N = 429) that examined four different television series featuring morally ambiguous protagonists. Findings largely supported the notion that while liking the character leads to enjoyment, social comparison processes (based on moral principles) were associated with appreciation. This study combines and extents findings of previous investigations shedding further light on enjoyment and appreciation of morally ambiguous characters.",Morals and Media,Mass Communication

This study investigates, instead, whether Dutch satire program Zondag Met Lubach (ZML) triggered first-level agenda-setting effects regarding the EU-US trade agreement TTIP. For that purpose, three studies have been conducted. First, a panel survey shows that consumption of the satire program positively affected knowledge acquisition about TTIP, which is the first step in the cognitive process underlying agenda-setting. Second, a three between-subjects experiment found that exposure to satire increased perceived understanding of TTIP, which had a positive impact on three indicators of the public agenda (i.e., importance, discussion intention, political participation). Third, analyses of longitudinal time-series data showed how the public agenda –on the short term– and the political agenda –on the long term– were affected by the satire; the media agenda was affected indirectly via ZML’s influence on the public agenda.",New Research on the Effects of Entertainment Programming,Political Communication
2018-1710,2018,Paper Session,"Does Political Entertainment Produce Efficacious, Engaged Citizens? A Mediation Analysis Using Three-Wave Panel Data",3,"For two decades, researchers have investigated the impacts of entertainment media that frequently feature political content. In spite of a great deal of empirical research, much about these effects remain uncertain. One particularly promising line of work has focused on increased internal political efficacy—the sense that one is competent to understand and participate in politics—as a potential outcome of exposure to political entertainment programming. This study uses a nationally representative, three-wave panel survey to show strong support for this relationship. It then provides evidence of an indirect causal relationship between political entertainment consumption and political participation with internal efficacy serving as mediator. These effects are also observed for exposure to political entertainment content on social media. The analysis compares these effects with (and controls for) those from news consumption, which has generally been considered a more appropriate format for stimulating engaged citizenship, and finds similar effects for news.",New Research on the Effects of Entertainment Programming,Political Communication
2018-1711,2018,Paper Session,The Normative Value of Political Entertainment: Deliberative Antecedents and Consequences of Media Users’ Entertainment Experiences,1,"This paper aims to explore the normative antecedents and consequences of media users’ entertainment experiences during exposure to political media content. More specifically, it builds upon two-process models of entertainment and deliberative democratic theory in order to conceptualize how certain normative content criteria of political media might contribute to entertainment experiences of media users on the one hand. On the other hand, it investigates how these experiences might contribute to internal deliberative thought processes. The suggested effects and relationships are tested through two empirical studies relying on survey data, one with an experimental and one with a correlational design. Taken together, the studies offer mixed results with regard to the effects that deliberative content criteria may have on entertainment experiences. However, both studies show that eudaimonic entertainment experiences, in particular, have positive effects on deliberative thought processes of citizens.",New Research on the Effects of Entertainment Programming,Political Communication
2018-1712,2018,Paper Session,The X Factor of News Broadcasting: Grab and Wrap Effects of Entertainment Shows over Time,3,"Abundant media choice has reduced the potential for inadvertent news audience. This study investigates the degree to which inadvertent news audiences can be increased through scheduling entertainment directly before and after a newscast. To investigate such “grab” and “wrap” effects of entertainment shows, we draw on TV meter data from Denmark, covering a nine-year time span. Specifically, we utilize the scheduling pattern of the talent show X Factor, which aired immediately before and sometimes also after the evening newscast. Our results confirm that the broadcasting of X Factor did indeed increase news audiences dramatically, particularly among younger people and people with a low level of interest in news. In addition, these effects became stronger rather than weaker over time. Thereby, our study shows how popular entertainment is key in creating opportunity structures conducive to inadvertent news exposure that helps secure a broadly informed citizenry in today’s high-choice media environment.",New Research on the Effects of Entertainment Programming,Political Communication

This study employed a national panel study of millennials to explore the extent to which citizens who cultivate homogeneous information flows from news, social media, and interpersonal channels express lower levels of institutional legitimacy and social trust. Our analyses reveal that Democrats with ideological homogeneous communication flows exhibited reduced institutional trust, but greater trust in dissimilar social groups, while Republicans with homogeneous communication flows indicated greater trust in police, but lower trust in news media and dissimilar social groups.","Polarization: Causes, Consequences and Remedies",Political Communication
2018-1714,2018,Paper Session,How is Online News Consumption Changing News Audience Polarization? A Comparative Analysis of Eight Countries,3,"Polarization is key area of interest for media and communication scholars. In this paper, we develop a way of measuring cross-platform news audience polarization at the national level. Then, we analyse survey data from eight countries and find: (i) that cross-platform (online and offline) news audience polarization is lower in democratic corporatist countries, even when online data are considered for the first time, and (ii) that in some countries – particularly those where the use of search engines and social media for news is more widespread – online news audience polarization is actually lower than offline polarization. Taken together our findings highlight that, despite the well-documented fears associated with algorithmic selection, news audience polarization is not inevitable in environments that are increasingly characterised by digital news consumption, and that the historical, economic and political factors emphasised by the comparative tradition remain critically important for our understanding of global trends.","Polarization: Causes, Consequences and Remedies",Political Communication
2018-1715,2018,Paper Session,Overtime Effects of Media Exposure on Polarization in a Multi-Party System,2,"This study adds to the literature on polarization and media effects by systematically comparing different ways of operationalizing partisan in- and out-groups in a multi-party system, and their consequences for polarization, and testing whether it’s exposure to media coverage of partisan in-groups and out-groups and/or exposure to pro- versus counter-attitudinal messages about one’s in- and out-group that triggers polarization. We rely on a four-wave panel survey (N=461) linked to data from an automated content analysis of newspaper coverage at the level of the individual respondent, thus testing media effects on polarization in a natural setting. We find that in multi-party systems the partisan in-group includes ideologically close party above the one party someone intends to vote for, and an increase in mere exposure to both partisan in-group and out-group – rather than exposure to pro- and counter-attitudinal exposure – leads to an increase in polarization. We discuss the implication of our findings.","Polarization: Causes, Consequences and Remedies",Political Communication
2018-1716,2018,Paper Session,Social Media Effects on Opinion Polarization and Political Participation During the 2015 European Immigration Movements,1,"The selective exposure to likeminded political viewpoints on algorithmic social media platforms is seen as a potential source for opinion polarization. But so far, little is known about how realistic this proposed mechanism is. It is furthermore an open question, what effects a potential opinion polarization invoked by social media use has on citizens’ democratic behavior, especially in a non-electoral context. Focusing on the issue of immigration during the refugee influx to Europe in autumn 2015, this study investigates the effects of social media usage on attitude polarization and connects it to political participation in refugee-related activities. A panel study conducted among Danish citizens (n=847) reveals that frequent social media usage contributes to a reinforcement of existing attitudes and at the same time mobilizes political participation. However, citizens who become more extreme in their attitude towards immigration are found to be less likely to become politically active about it.","Polarization: Causes, Consequences and Remedies",Political Communication
2018-1717,2018,Paper Session,Social Norms and Selectivity: Effects of Norms of Open-Mindedness on Unbiased Content Selection and Affective Polarization,4,"Given the polarizing effects of exposure to like-minded political information and the alleged societal benefits of exposure to diverse and dissimilar political perspectives, this study examines how to promote more unbiased content selection and thereby minimize affective polarization. We focus on social norms promoting open-mindedness. Using an online experiment on a systematic sample of American partisans (N = 389), we demonstrate that highlighting the social norm of open-mindedness can promote greater attention to balanced news about divisive political issues than highlighting close-mindedness and than not offering any information about social norms. It does not, however, influence counter-attitudinal exposure. Also, contrary to expectations, exposure to balanced news does not lower affective polarization toward the political out-group. Results also show that highlighting close-mindedness tends to encourage attention to pro-attitudinal news among Trump supporters. Theoretical and practical implications for an informed citizenship in an era of abundant media choice are discussed.","Polarization: Causes, Consequences and Remedies",Political Communication
2018-1718,2018,Paper Session,Social Media Bullsh*t? What we Don’t Know About Facebook.com/peace,1,"Critical internet scholars have developed an array of challenges to research based on big data. An important issue raised has been that of the opacity of social network sites: how can it be that institutions that play a part in many aspects of many people’s lives are so unknowable? It is in this context that I analyze www.facebook.com/peace, a page that claims to show “how many new friendships formed just yesterday” between Facebook users from the opposing sides of three different protracted conflicts. However, the numbers seem unlikely, leading me to try and understand them independently, as well as to ask Facebook if they could explain them. This paper presents my failed efforts to verify the numbers published by Facebook, and my subsequent conclusion that they are, technically speaking, bullshit. It is in reaching this conclusion that the paper contributes to theoretical discussions around data, social media, and knowledge.",Social Media and Other Bullsh*t,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2018-1719,2018,Paper Session,Big Data and Political Subjectivity: The Affordances of Subjective Dscontinuity and Ambivalence,1,"Interpellation refers to the incited enactment of prescribed performances of selfhood judged according to criteria over which an individual has no control. In the age of big data it is argued that the sheer proliferation of coercive subjectivities is damaging insofar as it obviates meaningful consent, and because it comprises so many incited performances as to render the notion of a stable, autonomous self unviable. This paper begins from the proposition that political subjectivity does not consist in the expression of one’s core identity in an established public space, and nor is it clinched in decisive moments like elections. Instead it consists in discontinuous, inconsistent and ambivalent practices of thinking, talking and acting that mostly do not look obviously political at all. The upshot is that big data cannot call one forth fully formed and deeply implicated in its reductive logics, and nor does it threaten an otherwise inviolate self.",Social Media and Other Bullsh*t,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

By a “Baudrillard World,” we mean the post-truth era that was first announced by postmodernist theorists like Jean Baudrillard. By a modernist project, we mean that the late-night comedians are making various rhetorical moves to reassert a commitment to truth incompletely secured by conventional, cool-style journalism. We identify a number of offenses against truth that the late night comedians counter in an attempt to rescue not just particular facts but the very notion of truth.",Social Media and Other Bullsh*t,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2018-1721,2018,Paper Session,Workfulness: Governing the Disobediant Brain,2,"The Scandinavian telecommunication company Telenor recently introduced the notion of Workfulness adapting the well-established idea of mindfulness to the workplace. Workfulness is a management program encompassing strategies of digital disconnection for the employees, to enhance focus and efficiency. The paper seeks to investigate Workfulness as one prominent example of managerial approaches that are based on neuroeconomic assumptions about human decision-making. Using textual materials and interviews, the analysis uncovers managerial control that considers emotions and unconscious behavior to explain short-term decisions. It is the disobedient brain that needs to be governed to become an efficient and healthy employee. However, focusing on the brain as the major source of ‘wrong’ technology usage is not about transforming negative working conditions in a constantly connected environment, but transforming how employees relate to these conditions and consequently distracts from larger, more structural problems with the expansion of the digital economy.",Social Media and Other Bullsh*t,"Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2018-1722,2018,Paper Session,"Diversity of News Sources, Pathway to News and Filter Bubbles: A Comparative Study of Australia, Japan, Korea, UK, and US",2,"With increased digitalisation, news media have transformed the way news content is disseminated to news consumers. There has been a growing concern of filter bubbles and the resulting segmentation and polarisation in the digital news environment. Drawing on Reuters Digital News Report 2017, a global survey of 36 countries, we selected Australia, Japan, Korea, UK, and US to compare the consumption behaviour of Western and Asian digital news consumers (N= 10,377). The study reveals that, although it is a global trend that news consumers are increasingly turning to digital channels to access news, the ways in which they discover and consume news differ between countries. There are differences in pathways to news consumption, sharing behaviour and the likelihood of encountering a diverse range of ideas between the Asian and Western news consumers. Americans are most actively engaged in sharing news, whereas Japanese are least likely to share news with others. Western news consumers are more likely to directly go to a news website to access news, while Asians tend to search for news or use news aggregators. Asian news consumers are less likely to be actively selecting news that are similar to their own viewpoints. A significant correlation between the inclination to stay in filter bubbles and the tendency to avoid news was commonly observed. Political efficacy was positively related to the exposure to different ideas while consuming news. By looking at the pathways to news, this study attempted to link the structural factors to individual characteristics that are shaped by the culture and societal factors.",Consuming and Sharing News in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies
2018-1723,2018,Paper Session,News Duds and Hits: Sharing on Facebook,3,"Previous studies on news sharing highlight news properties that contribute to widely-spread news items, but have not focused on items that have never been shared. The present research, based on a quantitative content analysis of 3144 shared and non-shared items, shows that different processes are at work when sharing items for the first time versus them being widely shared. In the modern context of layered gatekeeping where news organisations, the public, and media platforms each play a role in sharing, we highlight the different logics at work within and between each layer. Our findings suggest that earlier research on news distribution has focused too much on intrinsic news properties and too little upon the networked context of distribution.",Consuming and Sharing News in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

In this situation the content is local, but the audience may not be. Drawing on the sociological concept of translocality, the communicative linkage of dispersed geographic locations, this study investigated these emerging long-distance audiences. We combined automated and manual content analyses to (a) investigate the Twitter followership of 146 regional German newspapers and (b) explain the proportion of translocal followers they attract.
Roughly one third of followers came from a different German federal state than the newspaper they followed. Papers with a high percentage of translocal followers tended to have older Twitter accounts and came from larger cities than those with fewer translocal followers. Furthermore, they covered regional sports and human-interest stories more, while those with fewer translocal followers placed greater emphasis on infrastructure, event notes, and traffic news.",Consuming and Sharing News in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

So, why do some individuals—half the U.S. population by some estimates—avoid news consumption of any kind? This study takes a closer look at the practice of news avoidance among young adults during the 2016 presidential election. Using survey data collected from a nationally representative sample of young adults (18-34 years of age) during two points during and after the election, an attitude-based model of news avoidance is tested. Results show that several attitudes about the news media (and the content they provide) are related to overall levels of news consumption, and predict shifts in news consumption over time. Additional evidence suggests that news avoiders have lower levels of incidental news exposure, but are no different from high news consumers in reliance on family and friends for news.",Consuming and Sharing News in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies

Starting from the widespread but unrealistic ideal of the informed citizen, and its more realistic development through notions of the monitorial citizen, we then analyse comprehensive qualitative data on news users’ experiences. We describe these news users as approximately informed, occasionally monitorial. This description emphasises the limited, shifting and partial figurations of societal information that citizens are able to obtain through their use of journalistic and social media, and thereby challenges normative ideals. How do monitorial ideals function when the citizens are only occasionally on guard? By zooming in on three key gaps between even a less-demanding ideal and actual practices in news use, we underline the need to further re-conceptualize normative ideals for news use in democracy.",Consuming and Sharing News in the New Media Environment,Journalism Studies
2018-1727,2018,Paper Session,Cueing Components of an Animation enhances Knowledge of Terms at the Cost of Transfer to New Problems,1,"Instructional animations are often used to teach learning contents containing causal chains as for example in mechanical systems like a gasoline engine. Cueing can be used to direct learners’ attention to the crucial parts of the animation and to support the construction of a dynamic mental model of the learning content, particularly the building of referential connections between components of the animation and the respective terms that are mentioned in a synchronously spoken text. In total 55 participants watch either an animation about cylinder deactivation in a gasoline engine with or without cues that are used to highlight components of the engine when they are named in a spoken text. Using a pre-post-design results indicate a higher increase of performance in labeling the parts of the engine in a static picture for the cued group compared to the non-cued group, but a lower increase of solving transfer problems. Based on these results one practical advice could be to use pre-training to learn the terms of the components of the engine instead of cuing them throughout the animation. Further research should investigate if a trade-off between knowledge of terms and transfer can also be found for cues that promote understanding the functioning of the engine.",Instructional Communication in the Digital and Gaming Age,Instructional & Developmental Communication

The goal of this study is to examine the conditions in which learners are more likely to benefit from a digital training game in comparison to others. It is hypothesized that a student’s individual pre-existing perceptions (student-centered factors) related to digital games may influence their motivation to learn when playing a digital game. Key results indicate that higher student interests, beliefs, and needs satisfied in relation to digital games are more likely to contribute to students exhibiting a higher level of means-focused motivation; at least to a small degree. By seeking to understand the relationship between student-centered factors, learning, and motivation, scholars can better design games to serve diverse students in our evolving digital age.",Instructional Communication in the Digital and Gaming Age,Instructional & Developmental Communication

This article aims at gaining an in-depth understanding of the power of gamification as shaping motivation based on the principles of basic psychological need satisfaction derived from Self-Determination Theory. This study is based on the qualitative analysis of 125 surveys (n = 40) and two focus group interviews (n = 7) gained throughout a 15-week master course in which students voluntary interacted with a gamified platform.

The pedagogical approaches of a flipped classroom, collaborative inquiry, and communication in the disciplines guided the planning and implementation of the course. A mixed-methods approach was used, and data were collected through online questionnaires, course feedback forms, and essay assignments. The key findings include students’ positive evaluations of the pedagogies utilized. Independent writing tasks and the final course essay, in particular, provided major challenges for students. Moreover, a wide variety of learning outcomes was reported, particularly in the fields of crisis communication and workplace communication.

2018-1732,2018,Paper Session,API Bias: How the Means of Twitter Data Collection Impact Scientific Inference,2,"Though Twitter research has proliferated, no standards for data collection have crystallized. When using keyword queries, the most common data sources—the search and streaming APIs—rarely return the full population of tweets, and scholars do not know whether their data constitute a representative sample. This paper seeks to provide the most comprehensive look to-date at the potential biases that may result. Employing data derived from four identical keyword queries to the firehose (which provides the full population of tweets but is cost-prohibitive), streaming, and search APIs, we use Kendall’s-tau and logit regression analyses to understand the differences in the datasets, including what user and content characteristics make a tweet more or less likely to appear in sampled results. We find that there are indeed systematic differences that are likely to bias scholars’ findings in almost all datasets we examine, and we recommend significant caution in future Twitter research.",New Directions and Reflections on Computational Methods,Computational Methods

Ongoing advances in machine vision and the ability to automatically detect objects, concepts and features in images provide a promising opportunity to address this challenge, yet it is often not feasible for communication researchers to develop their own custom classifier given the volume of images, the resources and technical expertise needed.

This paper recasts this conversation in terms of the specialized role computational research can play in symbiosis with different methods in the field. In this context, computational communication research can contribute by doing things that other methods do not do as well, in particular, testing the explanatory power of existing theories and generating novel hypotheses in a manner less biased by researcher’s personal experience. These arguments are then used to develop three guidelines for evaluating the “worthiness” of a piece of computational research based on its ability to make this contribution.",New Directions and Reflections on Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-1735,2018,Paper Session,Beyond #covfefe: A Critical Look at Twitter as a Scientific Base,1,"Numbers of studies with Twitter data show that tweets are a popular scientific data source. However, the microblogging service is only suitable for research to a limited extent: Its bounded representativeness and explanatory power, a limited data availability concerning time span and volume, and a low data quality diminish scientific benefits. Specific characteristics of Internet language as well as missing metrics are additional obstacles to the content analysis of tweets. Furthermore, the increasing number of bots, which already generate a large amount of twitter communication traffic, is an issue of major concern. Based on two datasets, this work emphasises the challenges with Twitter data by illustrating problems in data collection, analysis and interpretation. This does not only contribute to a more deliberate und critical handling of Twitter data, but also raise the question to what extent Twitter can be significant for future research.",New Directions and Reflections on Computational Methods,Computational Methods

We provide evidence that computational methods are not only a natural fit for the field of Communication, but that the emerging empirical and computational possibilities should motivate Communication scholars to develop new methods in order to assure the relevance of our field in a communicative landscape that is currently mainly designed by computer scientists and commercial interests. We review recent development, examples and proposals in four different fields:
• Observational research (i.e. digital footprints).
• Theoretical research (i.e. simulation models).
• Experimental research (i.e. virtual labs).
• Mixed methods research (i.e. content analysis).",New Directions and Reflections on Computational Methods,Computational Methods

We demonstrate the feasibility of GDELT for various data and theory-driven analyses. Additionally, we highlight challenges associated with accessing and downloading this data, and suggest novel methods for its analysis. We analyzed entities, themes, language, and tone in the database over a one-year period from January 2016 to December 2016. Our analysis is based on a total of 355,609 news documents from twenty US-based news outlets. Results indicate GDELT’s utility for analyzing news reporting in response to real world events, locating diﬀerences in reporting across outlets, and creating entity networks for the examination of mediated associations in the news. Finally, we provide suggestions and future directions for future theory-driven analyses of this dataset in journalism and communication research.",New Directions and Reflections on Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-1738,2018,Paper Session,Online Ballot Stuffing: Influence of Self-boosting Manipulation on Rating Dynamics in Online Rating Systems,4,"Will temporal self-boosting rating manipulation change the follow-up dynamic pattern of online rating? By extracting the rating records of more than 30,000 restaurants from the server log of a restaurant review website, this study empirically identifies manipulated ratings and examines how this manipulation influences the evolution of follow-up ratings over time. Results show a slight but statistically non-significant difference in the average rating scores before and after manipulation, which indicates that manipulation does not influence follow-up rating dynamics. In addition, the difference in average ratings before and after manipulation decreases within a long time window, which indicates that the long-term effect is even weaker than the short-term one. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of this study by focusing on the rating manipulation as exogenous factor of rating dynamics and the adoption of the moving average method to identify vendors with rating manipulation. Lastly, managerial implications and limitations are discussed.",New Directions and Reflections on Computational Methods,Computational Methods

The Effects of Social Pressure on Self-Control, Need Satisfaction, Well-Being, and Perceived Stress",4,"Previous research suggests that while many smartphone users experience social pressure to be available, only some of them perceive this as a burden. This two-study investigation examines the underlying processes through which this form of social pressure influences well-being and perceived stress. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of the intrinsic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness during mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and competence, but that it was not linked with relatedness. Study 2 applied a repeated-measures design to verify these findings. It further examined the role of media-related goal conflicts. Results suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which, in turn, is associated with reduced competence need satisfaction. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure on self-control and intrinsic need satisfaction during mobile communication.",From Mobile to Social Life,Mobile Communication

Phubbing can affect interpersonal relationships and personal well-being. This study investigates the associations between inter-generational family phubbing and personal well-being, among older adults. Survey data was derived from a sample of United States Internet users, age 65 and above (n = 475). The results suggest that the more inter-generational family phubbing behaviors disrupt feelings of copresence the more likely older adults are to report lower levels of interpersonal mattering (b = -0.31, SE = 0.04, p < .001). In addition, results support the notion that interpersonal mattering mediates the relationship between inter-generational family phubbing and life satisfaction, among older adults. The findings are interpreted to suggest that inter-generational family phubbing may decrease feelings of mattering and subsequently personal well-being, among older adults.

2018-1743,2018,Paper Session,College Students and Mobile Games: An Exploratory Look at Factors Predicting Problematic Gaming,11,"The purpose of this study is to explore causes of pathological mobile gaming that may result from mobile game features in conjunction with particular personality traits of game users. Using a survey of 312 undergraduate students, a series of questions measured variables that were hypothesized to predict pathological gaming: frequency of mobile gaming, flow-like mobile gaming experiences, in-app purchases, sharing of mobile gaming progress on social media, impulsivity, and trait transportability.

Results suggest frequency of mobile gaming and flow-like experiences were potential factors that directly predicted pathological mobile gaming symptoms. Frequency of mobile gaming mediates the relationship between sharing on social media and pathological symptoms, and the relationship between in-app purchases and pathological symptoms. However, impulsivity was not a predictor of pathological symptoms. The study also found transportability is positively indirectly related to pathological symptoms through flow-like experiences, but had a direct negative effect on pathological symptoms.",From Mobile to Social Life,Mobile Communication

Studies on mediatization of public sector organizations often focus on operationalizations, determinants, and structural characteristics of mediatization processes. We use an actor-centered approach, focusing on the communication manager as the interpreter of the media environment and the resulting actions to shed light on the how mediatization is enacted in the stakeholder relations of these professionals and their organizations. This is especially interesting in the context of Dutch independent administrative bodies since they operate at arm’s length distance from the central government and thus operate relatively autonomous. The study reveals that communication managers increasingly try to cope with sector-specific challenges by implementing integrated communication strategies.

Content analysis results indicated that Chinese and international logistics companies shared similarities in their website CSR communication regarding exposing limited CSR commitment content while highlighting CSR motivations. Besides, both Chinese and international logistics companies often used a self-promotional tone. However, the results also indicated several significant differences between Chinese and international logistics companies. In contrast to former researchers’ findings, relationships with the government were more important for Chinese companies than for international companies. CSR codes or policies and safety issues were presented less on Chinese logistics companies’ websites than on those of international companies, though the proportion of Chinese companies that presented their CSR policies or ethics codes on their sites had increased since earlier studies.

Discussing insights on reciprocity in economic transactions, fundamental human motives and the intuitive background of reasoning, three major concerns are addressed: a) the gap between theory, research and practice of dialogue in public relations, b) the weaknesses of discipline-specific conceptions of the human being, like homo dialogicus, and c) the lack of knowledge on the how and why of dialogue. After all, dialogue is only one, very desirable, but still rather unlikely mode of communication that evolved to facilitate complex cooperation. Motivated by the fear of being deceived and the desire of being accepted, it is quickly colonized by actors for reasons of self-promotion.

This paper focuses on the local sphere, which is conditioned by institutions with less tradition in communication, journalists with poorer labour conditions, and public opinion with the greatest demand for information. We propose an exploratory comparative study between the most populous municipalities of two European regions, Basque Country (Spain) and Bavaria (Germany), using qualitative methods such as ethnography, focus groups and in-depth interviews.

Yet, we know very little about its impacts on issues related to public relations. Using a large international online survey dataset, we analyze the levels of concern that citizens have with issues at the heart of populism – fears related to long-term financial security, job loss, safety, personal rights, and culture – and explore their relative prevalence across the top four countries around the globe in terms of Gross Domestic Product. Further, our analysis examines the role that these concerns play in predicting trust in foreign- and domestic-headquartered businesses. While we uncovered some patterns consistent with the rise of populism, we also found that populist fears do not necessarily translate into distrust trust of foreign-based companies, and that citizens are much more nuanced in their trust evaluations of business.

Facebook and Snapchat users age 16 to 25 (n=266) were surveyed about how often they and their friends post risky health behaviors on each platform, their perceptions of privacy, and their privacy literacy. The findings suggest that privacy literacy was associated with decreased marijuana and sexual activity posting on Facebook, but increased alcohol posting on Snapchat. Privacy perceptions were not associated with posting risky behavior on each platform. Respondents reported their friends post risky behaviors nearly twice as frequently as they do themselves. These findings highlight the concept of privacy literacy and its association with youth’s display of risky behaviors and contributes to our understanding of how youth social media behavior relates to notions of privacy and peer online behavior.","Young People and Risky Expression Online: Where They Talk about Sex, Drugs, and Politics — and Why",Communication and Technology

When such personal information is misused by others, this behavior may result in harmful experiences and negative psychosocial outcomes. Accordingly, we assume online sexual risk behavior and young users’ psychosocial well-being to be connected indirectly via online sexual victimization experiences. Based on a representative sample of 1033 ANONYMIZED online users aged 14 to 20 years, we found that sexting willingness and sexy self-presentation were associated with increased online sexual victimization experiences, which, in turn, were related with more loneliness, less life satisfaction and more negative mental health of the respondents. For all proposed mediation paths, we identified considerably strong and stable indirect effects. The findings not only provide insights into mechanisms of young users’ negative online experiences, but also expand previous research on Internet usage and psychosocial well-being by focusing on sexual risk behavior.","Young People and Risky Expression Online: Where They Talk about Sex, Drugs, and Politics — and Why",Communication and Technology

Accordingly, we explore experiences on the mobile social media app Yik Yak, whose affordances (i.e., anonymity, geo-boundedness, ephemerality) may offer a unique infrastructure for youth political expression. Through a series of in-depth interviews, we find that Yik Yak’s affordances allowed users to assess the opinions of their peers, learn about political issues relevant to them and in some cases, articulate their own political voice. Participants also raised serious concerns over whether political communication on an anonymous social network sites (SNS) could result in substantive dialogue or meaningful change. Our findings suggest that SNS like Yik Yak create civic laboratories, which maximize experimentation with political expression while minimizing the social risks that can be encountered on sites like Facebook.","Young People and Risky Expression Online: Where They Talk about Sex, Drugs, and Politics — and Why",Communication and Technology

Individuals presented with more options viewed more dater profiles and experienced greater cognitive burden with their decision of who to select. Presenting online daters with a pool of options who could potentially disappear had no overall effect, but those who selected from a large pool and were told that their choice might disappear were less satisfied with their selection than those who selected from a small pool and were told that their choice might disappear.

It examines how one’s current affective state (in terms of level of arousal) and one’s traits (gender, need for cognition, sensation seeking, and use-motivations) influence Tinder behavior, measured by the rate of profile views, ratio of profile expansion, and ratio of profile likes. A mood induction manipulated affective states by positive and negative arousal, and positive and negative calm. Results showed that affective state had few effects on Tinder behavior, though subjects who reported higher arousal were less likely to expand profiles to gain more information about other users. Individual traits had more influence on behavior: men were more likely than women to “like” profiles, and certain Tinder motivations predicted both the rate of profile views and profile expansions.","Seeing, Selecting, Swiping, and Sexting (Not Necessarily in That Order): Innovative Scholarship on Mobile, Online, and Speed Dating",Communication and Technology

Furthermore, this study analyzed the role of four interactive uncertainty reduction strategies (URS) in the relationship between eye-contact and romantic attraction. These strategies were (intimate) self-disclosure and (intimate) question asking. A real-life speed-dating experiment was conducted in which singles voluntarily participated with the opportunity for developing a real relationship. The experiment had three conditions: a face-to-face condition, a video-mediated communication (VMC) condition without eye-contact (Skype) and a VMC condition with eye-contact (an Eye-catcher). All dates were recorded and transcribed. The transcriptions were coded for (intimacy of) self-disclosure and question asking. A post-test questionnaire was administered to measure romantic attraction. The findings revealed that there were more (intimate) self-disclosures in the conditions with eye-contact, but fewer (intimate) questions asked. These findings suggest that communication conditions with eye-contact are less uncertain and more intimate, compared to conditions without eye-contact.","Seeing, Selecting, Swiping, and Sexting (Not Necessarily in That Order): Innovative Scholarship on Mobile, Online, and Speed Dating",Communication and Technology

This project, based on ethnographic material collected as part of a long-term study of photojournalistic practice, explores the possibility that an adaptation of performance theory as conceived by Richard Schnechner (1977) offers remedy. With its emphasis on embodiment in presentational activities, performance theory offers a new way of thinking about just what it is that photojournalists do, and what lends authority to their work.","Photojournalisms: History, Performance, Framing, Solutions",Visual Communication Studies

This research examines how the three leading international newswires (Associated Press, Agence France-Presse/Getty Images and Reuters) visually framed the burkini debate, and whether they visually stereotyped women wearing the burkini. Using a mixed-method approach, this study unpacks the role of newswire photography in the visual representation of the burkini. Overall, the analysis identified four visual frames: Mediated Solidarity, Administrative Response, Symbolic Fashion, and Active Liberation.","Photojournalisms: History, Performance, Framing, Solutions",Visual Communication Studies

2018-1772,2018,Paper Session,Befriending Leftover Women’: Construction of Identity in Contemporary China,1,"In the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the number of well-educated, highly paid, and independent unmarried women who have been officially defined as ‘leftover women’. The research starts with an exploration of the interplay among gender, politics, and media and finds that ‘leftover women’ discourse is not based on demographic or social realities, but serves as means of social policing in light of anxieties about changing gender dynamics and power structures. Despite its ‘popularity’ in media and political discourses, the voices of these women are rarely heard. Guided by the communication theory of identity, standpoint theory, and phenomenological inquiry, this study explores the lived experience of Chinese ‘leftover women’ concerning the meaning of singlehood and how they come to befriend the ambivalence in their lives. To explore the way Chinese ‘leftover women’s identity is constructed, semi-structured and in-depth interviews of 23 ‘leftover women’ have been conducted.",HIGH-DENSITY: The Complexities of Women's Identities and Voices,Feminist Scholarship

ICTs provide them a chance to form a virtual community and to make a voice. Through netnography on the largest online community of female Chinese immigrants in the US (www.huaren.us), this article investigates the negotiation of gender identity in the digital diaspora. The research finds that topics about home and work, as well as the “menstruation debate” between working ladies and homemakers, initiate the most heated discussion, implying that women’s traditional role as wives and mother is strengthened for both working ladies and homemakers due to immigration. Regarding “refeminization”, Some women take it as the result of unfair migration laws, while others accept the value of housework and take “refeminization” as a cultural resistance against the gender hegemony of Women’s Emancipation in China.",HIGH-DENSITY: The Complexities of Women's Identities and Voices,Feminist Scholarship

Despite the growing use of mediated communication, little is known about how the practice of patriarchal bargains are enacted and realised within online interactions such as in discussion forums. This paper attempts to address this research gap through an analysis of practices adopted by Chinese unwed mothers to renegotiate the state’s population control and traditional gender arrangement. Findings from in-depth interviews with 30 forum members and 2 moderators revealed that unwed mothers actively utilise the forum for three forms of patriarchal bargaining: 1) leveraging online influence to exert pressure on former spouses for alimony, 2) navigating the legal system for obtaining required certificates and, 3) marriage commodification for political and social recognition. Theoretically, this study extends the patriarchal bargain theory to women’s use of the Internet, and examines the role of bounded communities on current understanding of agency enactment for renegotiating the system’s constraints.",HIGH-DENSITY: The Complexities of Women's Identities and Voices,Feminist Scholarship

It draws on the philosophical traditions of biopolitics and phenomenology, and the sociological tradition of creative action, to inform a theory of “corporeal activism” that underpins communication for social change. On a spectrum of low-risk incremental activism to high-risk radical contestation, are various acts in which the human body communicates for social change, in a process of embodied contention and perception. As such, this paper offers theoretical underpinnings for grasping the human body as a medium for global social and political change, bringing the communication for social change literature into issues of activism and social justice.",The Politics of Racialized Bodies and Emotions,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

However, recent public protests mobilized online can transform into mass protests, with no clear leaders nor speeches. This research charts out the changing cartography of resistance through visual forms in the age of hyperocular culture, paying particular attention to the amplifications that occur in people’s personal networked communication. The case of the Anti 2014 Coup activism protests in Thailand generated the visuals of their unruly bodily acts. I argue that these protesters’ dissident voices played out in adaptive forms when traversing oppression.

It planned to add a retirement village, Plantation Park, and a further nine-hole golf course to its existing development, Amelia Island Plantation. The Plantation, as locals call it, is a gated community taking up much of the south of Amelia Island, a short drive from Jacksonville. The land, called Harrison Tract, was once part of American Beach - an African-American-owned beach bought during the Jim Crow era to offer escape from the humiliations of segregation. The sale put the company into conflict with members of the American Beach community - especially MaVynee Betsch, a descendant of one of the beach’s founders and a prominent environmentalist. Over the years that followed, American Beach’s dispute with the Plantation was the focus of national news, books and documentaries.

2018-1783,2018,Paper Session,"Voices of White ""Resistance"": The Challenge of White Nationalist Voice for Democracy and Democratic Theory",1,"The increasing prominence of white nationalist activists and movements in a number of democratic societies around the world has become a cause of significant public concern in recent years. These groups’ willingness to resort to violence, as well as their exclusionist and even exterminationist aims, underscore the threat white nationalism poses to democratic polities. Motivated by paranoid conspiracy theories portending the forced extinction of the white race, white nationalist voices which espouse resistance, by any means necessary, to their imagined eradication cannot be integrated into pluralist democracies. Accordingly, this paper uses Nick Couldry’s theorization of voice in relation to democratic ideals as an entry point for considering these challenges. Particular attention is paid to the shortcomings of democratic theories, including Couldry’s, as well as decidedly illiberal efforts such as speech prohibition, in dealing practically with white nationalist activism.",The Politics of Racialized Bodies and Emotions,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"

Naming themselves “The Shameless Girls” they published articles in Norway’s largest newspaper, and demanded to be taken seriously as young women opposing cultures of honor and shame, which put restraints on their aspirations. The initiative was broad-based, including hijab-wearing devout Muslims as well as declared non-believers. Legacy media praised them, while in social media, reactions were mixed. The paper studies media coverage of the “Shameless girls” over 13 months, including a quantitative analysis (99 items; registering voices, genre, etc.), as well as identification of three main discourses found in the material.

2018-1788,2018,Paper Session,Toward A Model of Coming Out Message Production,2,"Sexual minority individuals must regularly disclose their sexual orientation to others; yet, the degrees of coming out often vary. This paper proposes a theoretical account, the Coming Out Message Production Model (COMP), for this phenomenon. The COMP identifies disclosure goals (self-oriented, partner-oriented, relational, and task goals), target outness discrepancy, overall outness levels, and relational power as factors influencing degrees of sexual orientation disclosure. The model proposes that as disclosure goals become more salient, people experience higher target outness discrepancy, which in turn increases sexual orientation disclosure. Also, when target outness discrepancy is high, more prior coming out experiences, as reflected in higher outness levels, and greater relational power over disclosure recipients increase degrees of disclosure. The strengths and limitations of this proposed model are discussed, along with suggestions for future research and practical implications.","New Methods, Theories and Measures in Interpersonal Communication",Interpersonal Communication

Here we describe the development and application of the Interpersonal Transcendence Scale (ITS), based on five samples involving more than 1,800 participants. The ITS reflects five theoretically derived dimensions of transcendent experiences: (a) receptivity, (b) comprehension, (c) mutuality, (d) exploration and discovery, and (e) play. Propensity to experience interactions that fall nearer the “transcendent ideal” are shown to vary with relationship type (i.e., roommate, parent-child, same-sex friend, stranger) and also to be associated with relationship characteristics and family communication patterns. The roles of individual-difference factors (i.e., empathy, communication apprehension) are also shown to be in evidence.","New Methods, Theories and Measures in Interpersonal Communication",Interpersonal Communication

Here, a conceptual definition of adult communicative play is presented, and a theory specifying the conditions and processes that give rise to such occasions is developed. Central to this effort is the conception of “quintessential play” as “code-based (verbal and nonverbal) instances of interpersonal engagement, understanding, and coordination, marked by a sense of novelty and enjoyment.” Such experiences are held to be infrequent and fleeting, but also to represent the endpoint of a continuum along which all occasions of play can be seen to fall. The theoretical framework advanced here, then, addresses the role of person factors (e.g., personality traits), relationship factors (e.g., affection, power), dyadic factors (e.g., similarity), contextual factors (e.g., social rules and norms), and properties of interactions themselves, in fostering occasions of quintessential play, and by extension, that sheds light on instances of failed play (e.g., mean-spirited teasing, bullying).","New Methods, Theories and Measures in Interpersonal Communication",Interpersonal Communication
2018-1791,2018,Paper Session,The Construction and Measurement of the Multidimensional Bullying and Teasing Scale: A Semantic Differential Study,2,"Bullying and teasing have long been portrayed as similar communicative behaviors with varying levels of intensity. Targets of the behaviors are often conjointly associated with self-esteem issues, mental health struggles, lowered academic and work performance, and even increases in violent behavior. However, unlike bullying, teasing is often seen as a potentially positive activity that can result in higher quality relationships and increased social skills. Thus, utilizing semantic differential scales, as well as measures of humor, and identification of gender, this study seeks to untangle the underlying differences between perceptions of teasing and bullying. Using 201 students, findings indicate that bullying and teasing share many facets: they are both seen independently as a) negative, b) concrete, and c) frequent. However, it is clear that bullying is overall more negative, though somewhat less concrete and frequent. Males are less likely to perceive both bullying and teasing as negative than females, and they also tend to perceive both as less frequent and common.","New Methods, Theories and Measures in Interpersonal Communication",Interpersonal Communication

Using data collected from a nationally representative National Cancer Institute survey of U.S. adolescents (ages 12-17, N = 1,657), this study tests hypotheses regarding constructs that may be theoretically expected to mediate this association. Mediation analysis and moderated mediation analysis are used, with obesogenic environment as mediator. The results indicate that the effect of advertising is conditional on an adolescent’s susceptibility to influence; that susceptibility likely has an impact on the preference for advertised foods and beverages, particularly if they are readily available in the environment; and that adolescents may be particularly susceptible to advertising that targets perceived peer norms. These findings may inform the development of inoculation-based strategies that can mitigate effects of advertising on the consumption of SSBs and other unhealthy foods.",Content and Effects of Health-Related Media and Advertising,Health Communication

A common technique used in an attempt to dramatize health conditions or sanitize risks in advertising is through animation. In such ads, medical conditions may be personified as monsters, drugs (or their beneficial effects) appear as wings and umbrellas, hand-drawn landscapes serve as serene video wallpaper as alarming side effects are narrated, and body parts talk directly to viewers.

This study examined the effects of DTC advergames with an experiment using a fictitious prescription drug, and compared the effects to those in more conventional DTC advertising media. Advergames are often considered an effective advertising platform for engaging consumers and lowering consumers’ ad skepticism, resulting in more positive attitudinal outcomes. However, this study’s findings reveal that consumers’ ad skepticism was relatively higher in the advergame condition than in the conventional DTC ad media types, while attitudinal outcomes were not better for the advergame than conventional ads. Additionally, interesting moderation effects of the ad media type factor are found, suggesting that advergames might be able to mitigate the negative impact of ad skepticism and enhance the positive impact of ad enjoyment on attitudinal outcomes.",Content and Effects of Health-Related Media and Advertising,Health Communication

Insights From Chinese University Students,2,"Existing studies on “friending” one’s parents on social network sites (SNS) primarily focus on whether young people are likely to accept their parents as online “friends” and why. However, more in-depth research is needed to learn about the impact on the family’s communication after one’s parents have been “friended” on social media. This study used the theoretical framework of family communication patterns (FCPs) and focus groups to explore 146 Chinese undergraduate students’ perspectives. The findings show that social media has not necessarily helped enhance family intimacy or communication in China, and that the level of closeness depends more on their existing offline communication patterns prior to “friending” each other. Furthermore, the study reveals that Chinese parents have a strong desire for their children to have the same perceptions and values as they do. In turn, young adults tend to manipulate their privacy settings to filter the content visible to their parents. This study’s findings suggest that the growing individualistic culture of the single-child generation is a resistance to the traditional collectivistic culture of current Chinese society.",Parents and Parenting in Online Contexts: Opportunities and Challenges,Communication and Technology

It investigates these women educators’ outlooks on the implications of the messenger application for their professional and personal lives. A mixed research method is used: after twenty-five preschool teachers were interviewed in focus groups, an attitudes questionnaire were used to sample some 200 practitioners of the same profession. While acknowledging the logistical advantages of WhatsApp for sharing information, organizing events, and offering broad opportunities for visibility and presentation of preschool activity, the teachers recount the ballooning of trivial events into grand dramas. Add to that are a sense of being flooded, stress, and bitterness in their communication with parents. The teachers’ situation vis-à-vis the WhatsApp groups is described in terms of a series of tensions: between effectiveness and being flooded in a time-consuming manner, between transparency in educational work and infringement of professional autonomy, and between parental involvement in educational inspection and intervention.
The questionnaire explores the relation between behavior patterns and social resources such as seniority and wage. When processed, the findings reveal a connection between the teacher’s ability to set rules and limits on WhatsApp group conduct and the human and social capital that she brings to the arena. Long-time, tenured, and well paid preschool teachers report being more able to apply control and more restrained in their emotional involvement than do younger, non-tenured, and poorly paid colleagues. The findings reinforce the social construction of technology (SCOT) approach, which fits technological novelties into an existing social array—in this case, understanding mobile communication in the context of parents-teachers relations.",Parents and Parenting in Online Contexts: Opportunities and Challenges,Communication and Technology

Our qualitative research project examined 70+ parents’ efforts to construct learning pathways to digital opportunity for their children. We focus on the practices of those parents who see themselves or their children as in the vanguard of the digital age. We find that geekiness provides a plausible identity for some children and parents, and they feel comfortably aligned to discourses of social and digital change. When geekiness is shared, parent and child can co-construct a lifestyle in which each values and learns from the other.

The results showed that pre-restoration scripts reduced state reactance more than post-restoration scripts. In addition, a significant interaction effect between restoration script type and regulatory fit on state reactance was found. Regulatory fit mitigated state reactance in pre-script condition more than in the post-script condition. Based on theoretical explanations, this study proposed and tested the integrated model of psychological reactance and regulatory fit. Multi-group analysis showed that regulatory fit was a significant predictor of reactance only with pre-restoration script condition. Also, the positive relationships between perceived threat to choice and state reactance was significantly lower in pre-restoration script.

Applying the Theory of Regulatory Fit, this study investigates whether messages corresponding to an individual’s regulatory orientation lower intentions to ask for mammography of women under 50.
Method. 360 women (30-45 years) were randomly assigned to prevention fit, promotion fit, or control condition.
Results. Women in the fit conditions, compared to the control group, showed lower intentions to demand opportunistic screening, also controlling for age, health status and healthy behaviors, fear of breast cancer, perceived benefit of mammography screenings, ego-involvement, and past diagnosis of breast cancer among first grade relatives.
Discussion. Findings demonstrate that messages designed and conveyed according to the principles of regulatory fit can positively affect women’s intention to ask for opportunistic screening.",Persuasion Research in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-1804,2018,Paper Session,"Visual Juxtapositions and Persuasion in Health Messages: Direct, Indirect, and Delayed Effects",3,"Using visual persuasion theory and exemplification theory as a theoretical foundation, we carried out a two-wave, longitudinal randomized experiment to test direct, indirect, and delayed effects of persuasion appeals using visual juxtaposition exemplars. Findings suggest that the comparisons used visually within strategic messages influences persuasion both immediately and over time, in this case one-week after initial message exposure. Abstract and novel visual comparisons resulted in greater message sharing expectations following exposure to the message, due in part to a surprised response to message content. One week after exposure, abstract visual comparisons produced a delayed (unintended) effect on attitudes and behavioral expectations. Conversely, less abstract visual comparisons reduced counterarguing with the message and resulted in positive effects immediately and one-week after exposure. Overall, the study offers insight into the complex and delayed effects visual comparisons can have on individuals in strategic message contexts, and suggests future directions for theory and research",Persuasion Research in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-1805,2018,Paper Session,Testing the Theory of Persuasive Hope and Comparing Hope’s Effects to Other Emotions,1,"Hope has the potential to be an important tool for persuasion. The theory of persuasive hope defines the appraisals that evoke hope, describes how to create hope appeals, and identifies the effects of hope appeals and hope on persuasive outcomes. However, little research has tested the theory’s claims. This study tests proposed relationships between appraisals and hope and between hope and persuasive outcomes. The effects of hope also are compared with fear, guilt, and anger. 790 undergraduates completed an online survey about climate protection. Results confirm that the appraisals of importance, goal congruence, future expectation, and possibility evoke hope. The effect of the importance appraisal on hope is fully mediated by the other appraisals. Hope significantly predicts message attention, interest in the message topic, and behavioral intention. Fear and lack of anger also predict interest. This study brings communication closer to the effective use of hope and hope appeals.",Persuasion Research in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-1806,2018,Paper Session,A Climate of Fear: Media Oppression as Structural Violence in Ethiopia,1,"Although Ethiopia has been lauded on the world stage for its economic progress during the last decade, the country’s press freedom has steadily declined. Through in-depth interviews with 37 journalists working for private and state-run media in Ethiopia, this study examined the censorship of news within the theoretical framework of structural violence. Structural violence develops when oppression built into the configuration of society inflicts invisible harm on a group. Journalists interviewed indicated a “climate of fear” hung over the news media. Concerns over repercussions from the government force journalists to censor their work, keeping the media from serving its watchdog function. Furthermore, government policies foster a polarization between both journalists working for private and state-run media and journalists and the public. This polarization keeps the media and public from mobilizing against oppressive policies enacted by the people in power.","Understanding News and Media Systems in Non-Western Contexts: Cases of India, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya and Iran",Political Communication
2018-1807,2018,Paper Session,In Search of a Public Service Broadcasting Model in the Transitional States: The Case of Indonesia,1,"Abstract:

In the transformation phase from autocratic to democratic politics, Broadcasting governance experiences policy changes. The fall of communism in the Eastern European states (1980s) and the authoritarian rules in Asia (1990s) brought about changes in the broadcasting system which included a shift of the past state owned broadcasters to newly public service broadcasting models.

This paper discusses PSB models in these shifting regimes, taking Indonesia as a case study. By applying concepts of PSB governance (e.g. remit, ownership, structure and funding), this paper looks at debates surrounding PSB adoption and pays particular attention to the legacies of state intervention to public broadcasters.

By comparing PSB systems in both the Western democracies and post-authoritarian states, this study shows how the mixture of democratic ideas and the legacies of authoritarians resulted in a `hybrid model` of PSB in Indonesia.","Understanding News and Media Systems in Non-Western Contexts: Cases of India, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya and Iran",Political Communication
2018-1808,2018,Paper Session,Internet Vernacularization and Mobilization in India,1,"Two conspicuous transformations have been noticed in the internet ecosystem in India – 1) massive growth in contents on the web in Indian vernacular languages, 2) and increasing numbers of citizens, in both urban and rural areas, accessing the internet in India’s vernacular languages. These transformations, which I term internet vernacularization, have received little or no attention from scholars, but have been subject of many news stories. This paper analyses the process of internet vernacularization and its potential in mobilization. Rapid growth in internet penetration in India to 432 million in 2016 did not solve the urban/rural divide. Nearly 70 per cent of the internet users remain concentrated in urban areas, so there is still much future growth to be attained in rural areas. Google aims to double the number of internet users by 2017 by launching the Indian Language Internet Alliance (ILIA), which promotes Indian languages on the web. The ever-increasing number of internet users and their potential to influence non-users has prompted business and government, political parties and civil society groups to incorporate the internet and social media as primary vehicles of communication in campaign strategies. This paper analyzes the factors that have propelled internet vernacularization and how this has affected the process of mobilization and journalism.","Understanding News and Media Systems in Non-Western Contexts: Cases of India, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya and Iran",Political Communication

This article attempts to contribute towards growing literature on comparative media systems through study of a ""dissimilar system"" of Iran with unique identity of being a theocratic, democratic and authoritarian state. Iranian media system is analyzed with the help of four dimensions proposed by Hallin and Mancini (2004): structure of media markets, political parallelism, professionalization of journalism and the role of the state. Iran seem closer to the Polarized Pluralist Model but pronouncing it under one model is over simplification of multifaceted media system and complex topic of media systems' categorization. Role of the state specifically strict media censorship is unique characteristic of Iranian media system and shapes other three dimensions as well. Identification of unique characteristics of dissimilar system can help develop exhaustive list of media dimensions leading towards all inclusive categorization of media systems around world.","Understanding News and Media Systems in Non-Western Contexts: Cases of India, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya and Iran",Political Communication

It also investigates the variables that predicted the coverage of the 349 MPs. In the same vein, the predictors of politicians’ mention in news is further analyzed by gender. The study also examines whether senior MPs and those holding leadership positions received more coverage than others. Findings show that the most-covered MPs are male, belong to five dominant ethnic groups, affiliated with four major political parties, first time legislators, and hold no committee or party leadership positions. On predictors of news visibility, negative coverage was found to be the strongest determinant of their coverage. By gender, the strongest predictor for male politicians was negative coverage, while commenting on corruption topic determined female MPs mentions in news. Senior MPs and those holding leadership positions enjoyed more coverage than other colleagues.","Understanding News and Media Systems in Non-Western Contexts: Cases of India, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya and Iran",Political Communication

Political Learning Effects of Using the Same News Media on Different Platforms,2,"People are increasingly accessing news through digital (i.e., computers) and portable (i.e., smartphones or tablets) media formats, while news consumption via more traditional, offline formats is decreasing. Due to critical differences in the presentation and consumption of news across these platforms, this shift might have important consequences for people’s political learning. Using a three-wave, three-year national panel survey from Sweden (N = 2,250), this study examines how the shift in media platform affects how people seek-out and learn about politics and current affairs. Among other things, the results show that although political interest influences news consumption positively across all platforms, people mainly learn about politics and current affairs from offline news, while there are hardly any learning effects from using news media on computers and mobile devices.",Influences on Political Knowledge and Learning,Political Communication

During an election campaign, it may operate as a gateway of individuals’ using diverse media sources afforded by today’s high choice media environment. But the gateway may be open more widely for those with extreme ideological leanings. Analyzing the 2012 American National Election Survey (ANES) panel, this study estimated two parallel sets of mediated moderation models of political knowledge and campaign involvement with each of the two differently measured media source diversity as the focal predictor after stringent controls. Findings show that, media source diversity had unique positive effects on both knowledge and campaign involvement; political discussion functioned as a conduit of the effects of media source diversity. Individuals’ ideological extremity moderated the indirect effects of media source diversity. The results are generally comparable across the two media source diversity measures.",Influences on Political Knowledge and Learning,Political Communication

In this paper, we operationalize reflection as writing down answers to reflection questions and argue that reflection works in a way more than leading to political knowledge. Results from a between-subjects online experiment (N = 168) covering two political issues, namely, fertility and immigration, showed that (a) reflection interacts with information access to influence perceived issue knowledge ; (b) reflection enhances attitude certainty, including perceived attitude clarity and perceived attitude correctness; (c) reflection interacts with information access to influence perceived national and local opinion climate; (d) reflection promotes willingness of opinion expression in private settings.",Influences on Political Knowledge and Learning,Political Communication

Thus, more work is needed on the mechanisms by which social media influences learning. Here, we test the proposition that social media use is positively related to knowledge when there is incidental exposure, but negatively related to it when actual news seeking is weakened as a consequence of the “news finds me” perception (i.e., the feeling of being informed simply by using social media). By means of a two-wave panel survey of a U.S. sample (N = 1,021), we find that, in line with work on the “illusion of knowledge,” any learning effect of incidental news exposure on social platforms is canceled due to the unwarranted perception of being well informed by relying on one’s online networks.

In the research reported here, we use the collaborative remembering paradigm from psychology to examine, for the first time, the effects of collaboration on the retrieval of political information from memory. We find that collaborative groups were more likely to remember accurate political information when compared to individuals remembering alone. Our study advances the literature on political knowledge by highlighting attention to a prevalent resource to which individuals often have access too when they attempt to retrieve political information from memory – other individuals.",Influences on Political Knowledge and Learning,Political Communication

The objective of this study is to determine how sonic logo features (intensity, pitch and pace) orient the response of consumers, and transmit brand values. We expect a greater orienting response in fade up, ascending, fast paced sonic logos, as opposed to descending slow, or constant, sonic logos. This experiment consists of a 3(Intensity: fade up, fade down, constant) X 3(Pitch: ascending, descending, constant) X 2(Pace: fast, slow) within subjects factorial design. Data collection for this experiment has been completed. Data analysis will be completed in February of 2018 and a full paper will be prepared by April 15, 2018.

Based on the concepts of perceived transparency, actual transparency, and trust, this study investigated 1) whether there are gaps between users’ sense of transparency in Google Search and their actual understanding of the system, and 2) how the gaps in transparency affect the extent of user trust in search engine with a moderated mediation analysis using bootstrapping. The main finding was about the role of actual transparency linking user’s perceived transparency to trust. These results challenge the aggressive logic of secrecy in algorithms in the industrial sector by implying the benefits of a greater openness, thereby illuminating the possibility of a reciprocal relationship between industrial actors with the end users.","HIGH-DENSITY: Attitude Formation, Cognition, and Persuasive Message Context, Content, and Form",Information Systems

Path analysis using data from a survey of college students (N=272) in the U.S. supports the proposed dual-path relationships in the model. First, perceived endorser expertise (EE) mediates the effects of product-celebrity congruence (PCC) on attitude towards the ad (Aad) and attitude towards the brand (Ab). Second, perceived endorser trustworthiness (ET) mediates the effects of self-celebrity congruence (SCC) on Aad and Ab. The integrated framework fills a gap within the overall system of relationships in celebrity endorsement literature.

An experimental study among adolescents aged 14-16 years revealed that increasing privacy control salience by means of these user interface elements leads to more critical processing of targeted advertising as these elements raise awareness on privacy-related matters. At the same time, when adolescents perceive a higher privacy control, they evaluate targeted ads as more effective, convincing and reliable ads (i.e. increase in ad persuasiveness). In addition, we also shed light on two important underlying mechanisms by which these effects operate: perceived control and self-efficacy. Based on these findings, we discuss some valuable theoretical contributions and practical implications.","HIGH-DENSITY: Attitude Formation, Cognition, and Persuasive Message Context, Content, and Form",Information Systems

This study extends the model by incorporating privacy self-efficacy as another privacy-related factor and social capital as the expected benefit factor in the context of social media apps. Different strategies in privacy management, including self-disclosure, self-withdrawal, and friending were also considered as the outcomes in the model. Results show that privacy concerns play an important role in limiting self-disclosure. However, privacy self-efficacy and social capital prompt self-disclosure. Particularly, social capital as an expected benefit can counteract the negative effect of privacy concerns (i.e., costs) on self-disclosure and strengthen the positive effect of privacy self-efficacy on self-disclosure. Privacy concerns also promote self-withdrawal and constrain friending behavior. Privacy self-efficacy has a positive effect on both strategies in privacy management, and the effect can be further enhanced by social capital.",Mobile Access and Privacy,Mobile Communication

Framing in the Era of Big Data (Top Faculty Paper),3,"The paper examines the news framing of the 2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive Election with a new approach. Combining computational approach and the traditional methodology, the paper analyses news framing with a strengthened contextual sensitivity and improved large-scale data analysis accuracy. In this study, over 370,000 articles, including news published in over 30 Chinese press media, four prominent Chinese online press media, and posts published on three candidates’ Facebook pages within the election period were studied. The study contributes to the literature by examining the rarely discussed transmedia news framing, especially the relationship between legacy print media, online alternative news media, and audience comments on candidates’ social network sites. The data analysis provides evidence that audiences’ comments on candidates’ Facebook pages influenced legacy news coverage and online alternative news coverage.
The findings provide evidence to support the argument that reporters, regardless of whether they are from traditional news media or online alternative news outlets, monitor political candidates’ Facebook pages regularly and use viewers’ comments in their news reports. Social media can thus empower politicians and individuals and shapes the frames of media. However, this study suggests that legacy news media and messages on Facebook do not necessarily have a reciprocal relationship. The implications of the findings and limitations were discussed.","Framing Contest, Conflict and Crisis",Journalism Studies
2018-1833,2018,Paper Session,Drawing the Line Between Conflict and Disagreement in Political News Coverage,2,"Previous research has yielded contradictory findings regarding the (de-)mobilizing effects of conflict framing in news coverage. This article revisits the classical operationalization of the conflict news frame by Semetko and Valkenburg (2000) and challenges some conceptual dimensions based on theoretical considerations. In line with studies from other disciplines, it argues that the disagreement dimension should not be seen as part of the conflict frame operationalization, since disagreement does not automatically imply conflict and these are distinct concepts, both theoretically and empirically. The context of this study is the Danish European Union Opt-Out referendum and a content analysis (N = 184) of news articles by Danish broadsheet newspapers was conducted. The findings show that disagreement is indeed empirically distinct from conflict framing. Moreover, disagreement – not conflict – dominated the coverage of the Danish referendum campaign. The results suggest that future research should consider both concepts and that more nuance is needed regarding the role of potential influence of conflict and disagreement in news coverage.","Framing Contest, Conflict and Crisis",Journalism Studies

Through both quantitative and qualitative analysis, it provides insight into the multiple and contradictory ways in which Korea in general, and North Korea in particular, is framed in the Americans news media. Specifically, it identifies which actors are attributed responsibility for the ongoing conflict on the Korean peninsula. The study finds that responsibility is overwhelmingly attributed to a small number of actors, and that attribution of responsibility, as well as intensity of coverage, differs among news agencies. In particular, cable news was found to focus on conflict to a greater degree than non-cable outlets, and online-only news sites were found to focus on Kim Jong-un more than legacy media. Finally, attribution of responsibility was found to significantly differ within cable news organizations.","Framing Contest, Conflict and Crisis",Journalism Studies

2018-1837,2018,Paper Session,E-lance Labor Isn’t Free: Freelance Journalists Resist the Law of Digital Rights,1,"Starting in 1994, print journalism companies in the US, the UK, and Canada introduced a new type of contract, asking freelance contributors to waive their moral rights and assign their copyrights to the companies. The companies could then distribute the authors’ printed works on digital platforms and potentially accumulate more capital from these works without having to pay the authors extra. Adopting a radical political economy of communication approach, this paper builds on the concept of alternative communication, examining the labor organizing efforts of freelance journalists and the digital communications tools that they use to resist these contracts. It relies on a labor union standpoint analysis of documentary sources from the companies and the freelancers’ labor organizations. Such research on freelance journalists’ rights could help scholars understand how copyright ownership and control serve as both a key corporate strategy and an opening for labor organizing and resistance in digital journalism.",Does Journalism Pay?,Journalism Studies
2018-1838,2018,Paper Session,Trading Capital: Documenting and Explaining Journalists’ Career Shifts in Rwanda,1,"This paper sheds light on journalists’ behavior by examining the motivations behind voluntary turnover in the journalism field in Rwanda, a case representative of many small, young journalism fields operating within restrictive and powerful political contexts. This examination of career progressions focuses the field theory lends on the individual journalist. This research draws on Bourdieu’s concept of capital to show that journalists who move around their field are trading in different types of capital. To show this, I analyze data collected from field research in Rwanda — a case with characteristics representative of a small and relatively young journalism field operating in the context of a strong and restrictive government. The data shows that journalists seek or trade cultural, social, and economic capital, in alignment with Bourdieu’s categories. This research suggests that journalists also look for workplace autonomy, a form of capital relatively unexplored in the context of field theory.",Does Journalism Pay?,Journalism Studies

The easy part ends there; many have struggled to find ways of earning revenue that will help them sustain their news gathering, production and dissemination efforts. This study examines independent news startups with self-reported revenue earnings in high, middle and low categories and compares them in the areas of news content creation. The findings, based on a content analysis of 704 articles across low-, mid- and high-revenue earning sites reveal that low revenue earners publish fewer stories than middle and high revenue earning sites. For-profit sites publish significantly more in low- and mid-revenue earning categories but non-profits publish significantly more in high-revenue earning sites. There were no significant differences in content produced by editorial staff versus non-editorial staff across the three revenue categories.",Does Journalism Pay?,Journalism Studies

This paper analyses that impact on provincial-level newspaper groups. Evidence drawn from 92 interviews in 6 press groups shows that, faced with the decline of commercial advertising and loss of readers, the groups are developing new strategies. These strategies have strengthened the party-oriented titles inside the groups while weakening the commercially-oriented ones, which have been the site of what limited critical journalism was possible. They depend heavily upon the political influence of the party titles to persuade potential customers, particularly from government departments, to place advertisements. Editorially, there is a shift from providing news towards services, particularly online, which has blurred the differences between journalism and promotional material. The commercial titles have lost what independence they once had. The combination of economic hardship and a harsher political climate means that critical journalism is under great pressure.",Does Journalism Pay?,Journalism Studies

Across 30 programs that claim to teach STEM to young children, 253 unique speaking characters were coded on their demographics, physical attributes, centrality to the plot, and modeling of STEM behaviors and occupations. Following traditional industry trends, female and minority characters were underrepresented in these programs compared to population statistics. However, when it came to the centrality of their role and on-screen STEM engagement, characters were treated relatively equally regardless of their race or gender. This was true, especially, for characters depicted as children, but less so for adult characters, who followed more traditionally stereotypical trends. Findings align closely with prior character-focused content analyses, but also present some areas in which the industry may be improving.",What's in it For Them?

Echoing previous findings on the content of popular children’s songs and television programming, we found that (1) egoistic motivations were represented significantly more than altruistic motivations, (2) altruistic motivations were more prominent in books targeted at younger children, whereas egoistic motivations became more prominent in content for older children, and (3) egoistic intuitions were represented as desirable in some instances and undesirable in others. The fact that these findings replicated across several children’s media denotes the societal importance of these motivations and their representation. We discuss these findings both in terms of their theoretical implications and social import. We note the particular need for the inclusion of egoistic motivations, which have been ignored in most previous content analyses of children’s media.",What's in it For Them?

We found that children's movies are clearly dominated by unhealthy, that is, energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods and beverages. Furthermore, unhealthy foods and beverages are more likely to be presented centrally, to be evaluated positively, to be interacted with, and to be consumed compared to healthy or mixed foods and beverages. Year and country of production as well as movie age rating did not have any effects on the depiction and integration of unhealthy foods and beverages. The predominance of unhealthy foods and beverages in children's movies is thus a global and stable phenomenon that concerns children of all ages. Given the ways with which unhealthy foods and beverages are integrated into children's movies, their persuasive potential is much higher compared to healthy and mixed foods and beverages.",What's in it For Them?

While numerous factors influence children’s health behaviors, this study sought to examine the content of food advertising as a potential contributor to the gender differences in obesity. The results were consistent with prior research stating that children view numerous food advertisements, most of which promote nutritionally poor products. Males appear much more often than do females and are more likely to be overweight. Conversely, females promote foods associated with fruits and vegetables, though the item is often fast food. Females rarely engage in physical activities yet are consistently average or underweight. Thus, child-targeted food advertising appears to be reinforcing the long-standing problems of both obesity and body image disturbances.

Teens’ Differential Preferences for Types and Contexts of Televised Aggression,3,"Effects of teens’ exposure to televised aggression depend on characteristics of the viewer and the portrayed behavior. However, few studies have investigated which teens prefer what forms of televised aggression. This study investigated how teens’ trait aggression and sex guide their preferences for specific types (physical, verbal, indirect) and contexts of televised aggression (reward, punishment, justification, graphicness, realism, and humor). Survey data of 156 teens (balanced for trait aggression and sex, aged 10-14 years) was combined with a content analysis of 4,839 scenes from their favorite television programs. Aggressive teens preferred more physical and verbal televised aggression than less aggressive teens. Trait aggression was not related to preferences for contextual features of aggression. Boys preferred more physical aggression than girls, as well as more realistic, graphic, humorous, rewarded, and punished aggression. This study underscores the importance of distinguishing between different viewers and forms of televised aggression.",What's in it For Them?

2018-1847,2018,Paper Session,The Effects of Socio-Demographic Factors on Social Media Divide: A Meta-Analytical Review,3,"Digital divide has transformed from the early stage unequal access to technologies to a new phase, notably the divergent social media use. Although many determinants of social media divide have been examined, socio-demographics are the most prevalent. Focused on the effects of socio-demographic factors on social media divide, this meta-analysis found that people who were female, younger, well educated, well paid and urban residents were more likely to use social media in general. However, race, marital and employment statuses did not play a role of predicting general social media use. Through the moderator analysis, we further found that the effect of age was very robust without respect to study-level characteristics, studies conducted in collectivistic countries (versus individualistic countries) and random samples (versus convenience samples) had higher effect for the effect size of education level, studies published in older times had higher effect for the effect size of gender, and that other moderators had mixed or insignificant roles in influencing the effect sizes.

In an age of digital communication abundance and closing access divides, overuse is emerging as a new dimension of digital inequality. In this article we conceptually develop and empirically analyze users’ perceived digital overuse (PDO) as a social problem. This phenomenon has not been systematically analyzed nor is its prevalence known. In a first step, we theoretically define PDO and test its measurement. We then provide an assessment of the prevalence of overuse with a representative sample of Italian Internet users (N=2008) and test predictors of digital overuse with structural equation modeling. Results show that the frequency of digital communication and social digital pressure of functioning online increase PDO. Education positively predicts digital communication but simultaneously lowers PDO. We discuss implications of the results for digital inequality theory and future research.","Advancing Scholarship, Methods, and Policy on Digital Inequality and Marginalized Populations",Communication and Technology
2018-1849,2018,Paper Session,"Race, Ethnicity, and Communications Policy: Centering Communities of Color and Rheir Concerns",2,"The present paper examines how and why activist groups representing marginalized communities of color are increasingly engaging in communications and technology policy issues. Utilizing a case study approach examining three separate policy debates, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for civil rights activists attempting to navigate the highly technical communications technology policy arena, particularly in relation to issues of access and representation. The first case study, which explores the NAACP’s original opposition to net neutrality, reveals the primacy of issues surrounding the “digital divide” to populations of color, and the difficulties of engaging in technical conversations surrounding Internet governance when issues of access persist. In contrast, the second case looks into the campaign by Free Press to promote set-top box liberalization as an issue of representation and diversity to both policymakers and citizens. The final case study, which examines the work of the Tribal International Carrier to build an alternative internet service network for Native populations and their neighbors, highlights the precarity which activist groups must strategically navigate, in order to mitigate the influence of both the state and large corporations over Internet policy issues. Based on an analyses of these case studies alongside one another, we make policy recommendations for how extant media and technological policy structures may fail to consider communities of color, and how they may more tangibly foster their inclusion within extant policy discussions, especially in light of their vulnerabilities as a result of such policy making.","Advancing Scholarship, Methods, and Policy on Digital Inequality and Marginalized Populations",Communication and Technology

While considering the ongoing debate regarding the use of student samples in communication research and the value of the underutilized method of field experiment, this paper takes a critical studies lens to examine one field experiment that investigated the role of stable ICT access on health outcomes. Mankekar’s theoretical perspective on fluctuating identity is applied to evaluate the role of researcher and participant within an experimental paradigm. We also provide practical recommendations and solutions within the context of our own challenges and successes. The marrying of the traditional positivistic approach of field experiment with a critical studies lens is a novel approach that can a benefit a growing body of ICT scholarship, from various epistemological traditions, invested in socially conscious research within marginalized communities.","Advancing Scholarship, Methods, and Policy on Digital Inequality and Marginalized Populations",Communication and Technology

An experiment (N= 207) was conducted using a 2 (Virtual self: Seeing vs. Not seeing) x 3 (Media devices: Cell vs. Computer vs. HMD), between-subjects design. Primary findings indicated that not seeing virtual body in the VR ad has favorable effects such as liking the ad and a positive attitude toward the brand. Further, self-presence was found to be a significant mediator that explains why not seeing virtual body leads to favorable brand experiences. The effects of media devices are found to be insignificant.","New Frontiers in Selling: Virtual/Augmented Reality, Product Reviews, and Crowdfunding",Communication and Technology

In doing so, we examined both the main effect of each information cue as well as the interaction effect among them to parse out their relative strength. In sum, positive seller reputation outperformed negative seller reputation, higher star rating outperformed lower star rating, and positive product review outperformed negative product reviews in shaping positive attitudes and increasing purchase intentions for online shopping. However, star ratings and product reviews moderated the strength of seller reputation, particularly when the cues were inconsistent with each other.

This paper argues that crowdfunding is essentially a communication system in exchange of values, and the values are forms of information public goods collectively constructed and owned by online communities. Data analysis and interviews were conducted on two crowdfunding websites Kiva and Zidsha to understand the relationship between credit record, innovative practices and the chance of receiving funding. Multi-level regressions were performed with a recent sample of 2607 loans clustered in 119 partner organizations. The results showed that lenders did care about credit record of partner organizations and borrowers. Although some lenders indicated in the interviews that they valued sustainable and technology development in choosing loans, quantitative analysis showed it was not the main concern. Implication for relevant ICT policy was discussed.","New Frontiers in Selling: Virtual/Augmented Reality, Product Reviews, and Crowdfunding",Communication and Technology

And yet, data suggests CNMs are more common than scholarship might suggest (Weitzman, 2006, YouGov, 2016). Studies and reports about consensual nonmonogamies are disparate and only recently beginning to emerge from relationship studies on LGBTQ persons with an increased focus towards polyamory (Barker & Langdridge, 2010). I conducted 34 interviews with consensual nonmonogamists exploring the strategies for how they navigated the disclosure of their relationship identities to their social networks. Queer reflexivity (McDonald, 2015) informed the construction of the interview instruments. Preliminary findings offer evidence supporting relationship identities as an emerging category of identity; utilized variety of tactic to maintain privacy barriers; maintenance of a permeable ‘open secret’ boundary.","Love, Sex, Friendship: LGBTQ Relationships and Intimacies","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"
2018-1856,2018,Paper Session,Does Gender Matter? Exploring Friendship Patterns of LGBTQ Youth in a Gender-Neutral Environment,2,"Social constructionism suggests the gendered nature of public spaces and social norms contribute to youth tending to develop friendships with peers of the same gender (Shrum, Cheek, & Hunter, 1998). But does this pattern hold for LGBTQ youth – for whom binary conceptualizations of gender may be less relevant – when traditional spaces and practices reinforcing binary gender are removed? No known studies have explored this question. The current study analyzes predictors of friendship patterns in a network of LGBTQ youth (N = 67) congregating in a gender-neutral environment (i.e., a camp program). Results reveal gender identity – operationalized both in a nuanced manner (i.e., transgender male, transgender female, cisgender male, cisgender female, gender nonconforming, and unsure/questioning) and broadly (i.e., cisgender and transgender/gender nonconforming) – to not drive friendship development. Similarly, sexual orientation and race/ethnicity did not predict friendship patterns. Age did predict friendship development, such that youth developed friendships with similarly aged peers.","Love, Sex, Friendship: LGBTQ Relationships and Intimacies","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Studies"

2018-1859,2018,Paper Session,"Brand Imitation Strategy, Package Design and Consumer Response: What Does it Take to Make A Difference?",2,"Drawing upon visual semiotics and creativity theories, this study investigated the effectiveness of brand imitation strategy on the package design of three different products among millennials. The products were male-targeted, female-targeted and gender-neutral. Three 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial experiments were conducted with three independent variables: shape (relevant vs. divergent), color (relevant vs. divergent) and icon (relevant vs. divergent) on three products: an energy drink (a male-targeted product), hair spray (a female-targeted product) and a breakfast cereal (a gender-neutral product). Participants’ attitude toward the leading brands served as a control variable. Dependent variables consisted of participants’ attitude toward the brand (Ab), attitude toward the product (Ap) and purchase intention (PI).
The findings raised three theoretical implications. First, a similar color scheme was more powerful in influencing participants’ Ab, Ap and PI. Second, a more holistically similar design showed more impact on participants’ attitudinal and behavioral changes than a less similar design. Nevertheless, some “divergence” or distinctive design elements did positively influence participants’ brand and product attitudes, as well as their purchase intention, in relationship to the female-targeted product. In addition, a conceptual model is proposed to better define brand imitation. Detailed theoretical and practical implications are also included.","Designing Consumption: Branded, Literate, Gendered",Visual Communication Studies

By analysing modes of address in early Kodak advertisements, the paper shows that many of the attachment suggestions used to sell today’s camera technology have been in use for at least a century. Whilst early Kodak advertisements address in textual form a generalised future ‘you’, who could be anyone, becoming attached to the device as pleased, the visualisations clearly target the advertisements at well-off middle- and upper-class white people who ascribe to the promises of modernisation, urbanisation and consumer capitalism. Attachment suggestions in early Kodak advertisements provide dreams of ubiquitous camera use, dreams that on a second look are socially sorted and ascribing to promises tied to the consumer.","Designing Consumption: Branded, Literate, Gendered",Visual Communication Studies

Visually-Assessing Stereotypes of Women,2,"A striking gap in the visual communication literature is that these two commonly-used methods for quantitatively measuring stereotypes of women have rarely been used together. This gap is significant since each method approaches stereotyping, yet differently. By examining subtle bodily and facial differences of men and women, the two methods of submissivism and faceism reveal ways in which the media consistently portray women as different from–and more negative than–men. Quantitative methods for measuring stereotypes are indeed scarce. Qualitative methods are often preferred because of their ability to account for the context surrounding and subtlety of visual stereotypes. Still, quantitative measures can add triangulation to the contemporary understanding of the way the media may visually stereotype women. This paper tests the complementary nature of two popular quantitative methods for measuring gender stereotypes: submissivism and Goffman. Results show that the two methods are complimentary and add richness to our understanding of visual gender stereotyping.","Designing Consumption: Branded, Literate, Gendered",Visual Communication Studies

A total of 24 un-skilled mainland Chinese dual migrant participants (13 male security guards; 11 female cleaners) were recruited and engaged in in-depth interviews, group discussions and WeChat interviews. Findings show the co-existence of temporality and situatedness in the mobilized experiences of Chinese mainland dual migrants. Home is found to be both an emotional and social investment, tied to a fixed, remembered space, and a mobile, multi-layered, and unstable site, impacted by the experience of daily cross-border mobility. Taking the lens of transnationalism, the Zhuhai-Macao border is constructed as an important entity in participants’ everyday life; the border is also an ambivalent and liminal space, serving the role of both connectivity and detachment.

There was no interaction between framing and visual type, and there was no effect for framing or visual type on future Zika vaccine uptake intent, which is likely indicative of insufficient dosage of the intervention. However, when focusing on intermediate psychosocial constructs that are known to influence behavior and intent, gain-framed messages were more effective in increasing subjective norms as related to a future Zika vaccine, as well as perceived benefits and self-efficacy.",Framing Effects in Health Communication,Health Communication

This study tests fear appeal messages intended to limit males’ consumption of pornography by exploring: (a) the effectiveness of the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) in curbing excessive pornography consumption, and (b) the potential of social identity as an alternative to health threat when using EPPM. Participants were randomly assigned to receive two different messages: (a) a health EPPM message and (b) a religious identity-based EPPM message. The results suggested that social identity correlates with perceived fear in processing EPPM message. Among participants who received traditional EPPM messages, perceived efficacy, but not perceived threat, correlated with behavioral intention, whereas among those who received the religion EPPM message, both perceived fear and efficacy correlated with behavioral intention.",Framing Effects in Health Communication,Health Communication
2018-1872,2018,Paper Session,Talking about Medical Disputes: News Framing of Who is Responsible for Causing and Fixing the Problem in Mainland China,1,"This content analysis examines how Chinese news media have framed the question of who is responsible for causing and solving the medical dispute problem in Mainland China. We identified responsibility-attribution information presented in 229 news articles published in People's Daily, Health News, and Southern Metropolis Daily between January 2013 and December 2015. We find that, when talking about potential causes, physicians were mentioned most often as being responsible. In terms of how to solve the problem, the media were focusing heavily on societal-level efforts, while remedy suggestions were addressed more frequently than prevention actions. Our findings also indicate a lack of media's self-attribution of responsibility in the sample. This study demonstrates that investigating mediated responsibility attribution is essential for understanding the relationship between mass media and the frequent occurrence of medical disputes in Chinese society.",News Media Coverage and Framing of Health Issues: Cross-National Perspectives,Health Communication

Since news media stories and content can influence people’s knowledge of HPV vaccine and their intention to get vaccination, a content analysis was used to examine what information about the vaccine was conveyed to the public in Chinese news media, before the 2017 vaccine implementation. A total of 253 articles published from 2000 to 2016 were collected and coded. The results show that HPV and HPV vaccine received relatively modest news coverage in China. Differences were also found related to type of news media, with party-affiliated press using thematic framing more so than city press. Among six Health Belief Model factors used in the content analysis, benefits information was the most frequently found factor, severity of disease was the least frequently reported factor in news coverage. Implication and future direction are discussed.",News Media Coverage and Framing of Health Issues: Cross-National Perspectives,Health Communication
2018-1874,2018,Paper Session,Framing Genetically Modified Mosquitoes in News and Twitter: Intermedia Frame Setting in an Issue-Attention Cycle,2,"The study examined how online news and Twitter framed genetically modified mosquitoes (GMMs), a scientific innovation to fight against mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika, and the interplay between the two. The study was grounded in the theoretical frameworks of intermedia agenda setting, framing and the issue-attention cycle, and combined methods of manual and computational content analysis, and time series analysis. The findings show that Twitter discussion was more benefit-oriented while the news coverage was more balanced. More importantly, the study reveals that Twitter played a leading role in framing GMMs in the beginning of the debate. When the issue became known to the public, online news gained momentum and persuaded the Twitter publics to discuss the risks of GMMs. Based on the findings, we argue that intermedia frame setting may change its direction over time, and different media outlets may be influential in leading different aspects of the conversation.",News Media Coverage and Framing of Health Issues: Cross-National Perspectives,Health Communication
2018-1875,2018,Paper Session,Silent Voices and Invisible Faces: Autism Coverage in North and South America,3,"Over the past 50 years, the number of individuals diagnosed with autism has skyrocketed, along with growing public awareness and concerns about this developmental disorder. To better understand the information promulgated about this disorder in the popular press, this comparative investigation quantitatively analyzes autism coverage (N = 480) in the two leading newspapers from Venezuela and the United States between 2010 to 2017. The results indicate there were significant differences in topics, sources, images, discourses, and stigmatizing cues between the two countries’ coverage. These differences notwithstanding, science and public relations were the main topics in both countries and individuals with autism were quoted in only 2% of stories and visually represented in less than 10% of the coverage from either country. We argue autism coverage in both countries has important implications for how the public responds to autism in terms of research and services available to support this growing population.",News Media Coverage and Framing of Health Issues: Cross-National Perspectives,Health Communication

Brehm, 1966) and Terror Management Theory (TMT; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986), we examined the interaction between reactance and mortality salience on message perceptions and persuasion. We tested our predictions in a 2 (mortality: salient vs. control) × 2 (threat to freedom: high vs. low) independent group experiment (N = 223), using STD prevention messages as the study topic. As predicted and consistent with TMT proximal defenses, mortality salience mitigated threat to freedom and increased positive attitudes toward STD prevention. However, effects consistent with TMT distal defenses also emerged: Mortality salience significantly lowered behavioral intentions to use a condom, indicating that even when at risk of getting an STD, people may be more likely to endorse behaviors that offer a greater chance for symbolic immortality through spreading genetic material.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narrative Processing and Effects,Information Systems

The experiment utilized a shale gas extraction (fracking) story to investigate whether narratives are persuasive because audiences are unaware of persuasive intent, if the power of narratives has more to do with cognitive effort, or some combination therein. Results showed that the narrative message was more persuasive than the equivalent expository text.

Based on findings on the effects of mixed emotions produced by eudaimonic narratives and the correlation between emotion regulation and cardiac vagal reactivity, we predict that 1) eudaimonic narratives will lead to a larger increase in cardiac vagal reactivity relative to less-eudaimonic narratives, and that 2) cardiac vagal reactivity will mediate the impact of eudaimonic narratives on willingness to delay rewards and acceptance of death related thoughts. If we succeed in demonstrating eudaimonic narrative influence on cardiac vagal reactivity, we would provide strong evidence of influence on emotional regulatory capacity at a fundamental, physiologic level, as well as extending the theoretical understanding of how eudaimonic narratives influence capacity to accept delayed rewards and the inevitability of death.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narrative Processing and Effects,Information Systems

In the study of how belief change occurs, some rules are expressed in mathematical forms (Hunter, Danes, & Cohen, 1984). This article examines four mathematical models regarding the role of psychological discrepancy in belief change based on two theoretical frameworks: the discrepancy model (Fink & Cai, 2012; Kaplowitz & Fink, 1997) and information integration theory (Anderson, 1981, 2008). In this article, the rationale and the empirical support for the original psychological-discrepancy-discounting model (Fink, Kaplowitz, & Bauer, 1983) are discussed first. This article proposes three alternative assumptions regarding the role of psychological discrepancy. Then, the significance of this article is discussed. Also, the results of nonlinear regression analyses comparing the four models based on Fink et al.’s (1983) data are presented. The results indicate the alternative assumptions are indeed plausible.

Implications of News Personalization from the User Perspective,4,"With technological developments, news organizations are interested in personalization technology. So far, studies focused on either the impact of news personalization on editors, or on the effects on users. Our study contributes to this research by providing a comprehensive picture of how users themselves conceptualize news personalization.
Using focus groups, we investigate how users think and feel about algorithmic news personalization, and how they perceive their role in this process. The data was analyzed with the grounded theory methodology, chosen for its strength of developing theoretical propositions grounded in data.
The analysis yielded two main takeaway points: first, users do not discuss personalization distinctively for news and commercial platforms. Second, they desire control to manage this process responsively. Because of how they conceptualize this technological development, users see themselves as actively responsible in the news personalization process, but rely on different platforms to grant them the opportunity to exercise control.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narrative Processing and Effects,Information Systems
2018-1883,2018,Paper Session,"Mismatching the Realism of a Persuasive Agents’ Voice and Face Reduces Its Credibility and Attractiveness, but Not Its Persuasive Success",2,"Embodied agents—i.e., digital systems represented by a virtual or robotic body—are used as persuasive tools in many different contexts. Still, psychological research indicates that for an agent to successfully influence its audience, many design factors have to work together in a way that creates a likable and trustworthy impression. Tapping into previous literature on the importance of facial proportions and voice characteristics, we advance a “consistency” perspective that revolves around matching levels of realism as a main requirement for well-accepted persuasive agents. To test our assumptions, we invite 107 participants to watch the persuasive speech of a virtual agent, while manipulating both its face and voice in a between-subject design. In accordance with recent findings, mismatching the realism of both features significantly reduces the agent’s perceived credibility and attractiveness. However, we examine that neither manipulation actually influences persuasive success in terms of attitude change.",HIGH-DENSITY: Narrative Processing and Effects,Information Systems

News stories from four media outlets, presidential speeches made by Bush and Obama, and public opinion were all included for analysis. Nine discrete emotions were incorporated into content coding to capture the valence and volume of their presence in the political discourse. Negative emotions were invoked before and during war toward Iraq, while positive emotions were used prominently before and during the 2015 Iran deal. Negative emotions appear to be more instrumental to move public support for Iraq war than do positive counterparts for peace deal with Iran.

Investigating the Dynamic Relationship Between Emotional Reactions and Attention Towards Political News,2,"This paper attempts to investigate (a) the relationship between emotional reactions towards political information in the media and attention towards the news and (b) inhowfar this relationship is reinforcing over time in daily news consumption. Building on the reinforcing spirals framework, we use an experience sampling design to assess recipients’ emotional reactions and self-reported attention towards news. Participants reported their news usage, emotional states and attentional focus directly after following a news item for eight days in a row. We analyze these intensive longitudinal data by means of spline models to capture contemporaneous effects, lagged effects and growth of the two variables over time. Results indicate that emotions and attention allocation are indeed correlated (contemporaneous effect), but there are almost no lagged or reinforcing effects, i.e. there is no spiral process over time. Nevertheless, the study shows new and promising ways in assessing and analyzing dynamic processes that could be applied not only to the investigation of emotional and attentional reactions of recipients.",The Role of Emotion in Political Communication,Political Communication

Moreover, extant literature has mostly overlooked the importance of political advertising on social media and the specifics of such communication in the context of the European Union. Using an experimental design, we test whether political parties’ 1) positive or negative EU-related 2) emotional or neutral advertising messages influence citizens’ emotions towards the EU, whether these emotions affect politically relevant outcomes, and whether the effects differ for citizens with varying political ideologies. Among other things, we find that positive emotions in particular affect almost all relevant outcome variables irrespective of experimental condition and individuals’ political orientation.

A longitudinal study was carried out among 2194 adolescents between age of 9 to 14 in Singapore. Results showed the more cyber victimization adolescents experienced, they displayed greater intention to cyberbully, had a more favorable attitude towards cyberbullying and possessed stronger normative beliefs that supported relational aggression. Attitude towards cyberbullying and normative beliefs on relational aggression mediated the relationship between adolescents’ experiences of cyber victimization and their intention to cyberbully. Additionally, it was found that adolescent’s intention to cyberbully predicts their cyberbullying behaviors in a year’s time. Findings of this study confirm the viability of using the theory of reasoned action to investigate the process of the cyber bully-victim and extend our understanding of the interrelationship between cyber victimization experiences and adolescents’ cyberbullying behaviors.",Safeguarding the Digital World,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-1889,2018,Paper Session,Who You Gonna Call? Effectiveness and Determinants of Seeking Support Among Adolescent Victims of Cyberbullying,2,"The purpose of this study was to investigate longitudinal associations between a) seeking support from friends, parents, or teachers and b) cyberbullying victimization and internalizing problems such as low self-esteem and social anxiety. These associations could give an indication of the effectiveness of seeking support, a coping strategy that is often suggested to cyberbullying victims, and of its potential determinants. A two-wave panel study was conducted among a sample of 2,128 adolescents aged 10 to 17. A cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that seeking support is associated with lower cyberbullying victimization six months later. However, this seems only true for seeking support from friends and not from parents or teachers. Furthermore, the model showed that adolescents who fear to be evaluated negatively by peers are less inclined to seek support from friends, whereas adolescents with high self-esteem are less likely to seek support from teachers.

2018-1890,2018,Paper Session,“Nobody Wants the Parents Involved”: Constructing and Contesting Norms of Parental Responses to Cyberbullying,2,"Although parents rate cyberbullying among their top concerns, little is known about how this concern translates to action. In addition, parents are often considered essential to preventing and responding to cyberbullying incidents. With this in mind, this study uses data from focus groups with parents to examine their responses to hypothetical cyberbullying scenarios in which their child is presented as a victim, aggressor, or bystander. We investigate how parents’ responses conform to, deviate from, or complicate recommendations and advice from researchers and advocacy organizations. In addition, we compare adolescents’ responses to cyberbullying scenarios to see how they converge with or contradict parents’ reactions. Results suggest that while parents are concerned about online aggression and are familiar with parenting norms and expectations around cyberbullying, social context and relationships complicate their responses. Children, however, view cyberbullying as normal and believe that parents should not intervene.",Safeguarding the Digital World,Children Adolescents and the Media

To a certain extent, these risks might be minimized by adopting appropriate privacy settings. Applying a health behavior perspective, the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) was used to investigate which factors are associated with adolescents’ motivation to engage in online privacy protective behaviors on Facebook. A survey study was conducted among a sample of 1171 adolescents (M = 16.74 ; SD = .69) in Flanders, Belgium. The results indicate that adolescents’ self-efficacy and response-efficacy are the most important predictors of the intention to engage in privacy protective behaviors on Facebook across gender.

We see relatedness and privacy as two innate needs that adolescents can satisfy with smartphone apps. We argue that adolescents’ choice of features supporting either privacy protection or social relatedness is a consequence of defaults effect, so that adolescents adhere to pre-selected defaults. We test this assumption in an experimental survey design including four app configuration tasks with N = 280 German adolescents aged 11 to 20 years. We find support for default effects for privacy as well as social-relatedness.

This paper explores the term ‘gallows humor’ through its use as a subversive tool for precarious populations, and its adoption within black communities as a tool of resistance. It examines the pervasiveness of gallows humor in black comedy between 2013 and 2015, and its gradual adoption into participatory mechanisms of resistance and survival by activist hacklab Intelligent Mischief, and Black Twitter campaigns like #iftheygunnedmedown. Through this discussion, this paper evaluates the participatory potential of gallows humor about police brutality, and the way black counterpublics can use it to create spaces of discomfort and demystification in discourses about police violence against the black community.","HIGH-DENSITY: Power, Violence, and Voice: Virtual and Vital","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

Knowledge – Deep, Wide, Open, and Violent",1,"Within the theme of culture and technology, I want to bring the conversation around to ""open knowledge."" My aim is partly to show how important culture is in determining what knowledge means and who gets to share it, and partly to compare formal knowledge institutions (universities, publishing, libraries etc.) with informal knowledge systems (social media). What are the implications – for the growth of knowledge – of planetary-scale and population-wide connectivity, and what happens to culture in the process? The paper argues that the current pursuit of “open” knowledge misses a distinction between “deep” (expert) and “wide” (cultural) knowledge, and that the pursuit of the “deep” kind marks knowledge as a function of power, just like violence. Global media connectivity does not ensure openness, but it does give us a new incentive to understand how knowledge is made and moved between groups.","HIGH-DENSITY: Power, Violence, and Voice: Virtual and Vital","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"
2018-1895,2018,Paper Session,Violence in Phatic Culture: Theorizing “Inspired” Terror,1,"Recent history has seen the rise of dispersed forms of violence in which the assailant has no explicit ties to terrorist organizations. Such incidents are often made sense of through the problematic lenses of contagion, radicalization, and inspiration which further reduce the communicative complexity of such phenomena to self-evident dyadic exchanges between the assailant and ISIS. To more fully theorize so-called inspired violence this paper develops a theory of phatic violence centered on relation and mediation rather than information exchange and intentionality. Situated as an ambiguous third party the violent act of the lone wolf produces a mediated “phatic exigency” through which communions and bonds of antipathy might be created or sustained. Placing the war on terror within phatic culture enables new understandings of dispersed violence and the role of phatic communion vis-à-vis antipathies as well as the increasing horror of the war on terror.","HIGH-DENSITY: Power, Violence, and Voice: Virtual and Vital","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The use of VR technology for PTSD is regarded here, following Friedrich Kittler (who follows Hugo Münsterberg) as psychotechnology: the continuous channeling of mind through media and of media through mind. At issue is the changing status of traumatic memory under digitization: specifically, the discretization of the traumatic Real, its re-symbolization into calculative computerized routines, and at the same time, the decoupling of traumatic memory from narrative as its potential carrier. It is suggested that through digital technology, traumatic memory is rendered discrete and modular, and thus made treatable by its division into separately manipuatble elements. This development coincides with the deposing of talk and narrative as a therapeutic medium and as access channel to the traumatic condition.","HIGH-DENSITY: Power, Violence, and Voice: Virtual and Vital","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

In this presentation, I argue that the insistence on the dichotomic framework takes the political out of political struggle. It carries the risk of reducing the political work into raising consciousness about people’s ‘real’ interests and fighting for the policy implementation of the inherent rights. A related risk is that the binary classification of people on the right or wrong side of the history around value-based dichotomies places the left into the category of ‘politically correct’ experts (i.e. part of the elite); something that have been exploited by the populist right successfully.","HIGH-DENSITY: Power, Violence, and Voice: Virtual and Vital","Philosophy, Theory and Critique"

The findings suggest that stakeholder responsibility issues were significantly more often discussed in Canada, Mexico, South Africa and India. Environmental issues were most frequently discussed in China, followed by Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Western countries, except for Canada, expressed greater concern about economic responsibilities, as did Thailand.

Previous studies have asked what importance investors assign to the socially responsible activities of corporations. However, in the context of publicly-traded companies, it becomes important not only to calculate the effects of available information on the company itself but also to estimate the effects of every piece of information on other investors. The results of the study show that while people are supportive of the socially responsible behaviors of corporations, they perceive others to be less supportive of such behaviors; they also see others as less likely to encourage such behaviors through action.

2018-1904,2018,Paper Session,Engaging Home Audiences Across the Border: Message Framing in U.S. and Mexican Embassies Before and After the U.S. Administration Change,2,"This study explores the messages that the embassies of the United States and Mexico in the other country send to their diasporas via websites, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts, analyzing the changes in messaging toward their diasporas following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Findings show that, after this change in the U.S. administration, messaging by the Mexican Embassy became not only centered on building a positive image of its migrants and defending their rights, but it also focused more on responding to the U.S. President’s messages about DACA’s termination, about U.S. bill SB4, and about violence, drugs and migration flows from Mexico, reminding the United States that these problems are a “shared responsibility.”","Media, Framing and Public Diplomacy",Public Diplomacy
2018-1905,2018,Paper Session,China at UN:Comparing Chinese & U.S. Media Responses of President Xi Jinping’s Maiden UN Speech,1,"This study undertakes a comparative investigation of media responses to Chinese President Xi’s maiden U.N. Speech. China has increasingly focused on enhancing its national image and soft power at the principal institutional venue of world politics. The analysis follows three main trajectories: (1) What were the Chinese media’s intended frames ? (2) What were the locally constructed frames in U.S. media ? (3) To what degree is there congruence or lack thereof between Chinese intended frames and locally constructed U.S. media frames? There are several core findings: Chinese media intend to project China as a “responsible world player” to U.S. audience and “middle power” image at the UN, with objective frame and soft power rhetorical. This intended image matches the image portrayed by President Xi on his UN speech. With a high number of commissives speech acts to match its political values, U.S. media differ in their selective reporting of President Xi’s commissives, directives and assertives from China’s media.","Media, Framing and Public Diplomacy",Public Diplomacy
2018-1906,2018,Paper Session,Nation Branding and Journalism: The (Neglected) Role of Foreign Correspondents in the Construction of National Images,1,"Critical studies in nation branding have examined the beliefs, perceptions and actions of diplomats, politicians and branding executives in depth. Whilst the media have been acknowledged as relevant actors in the creation and circulation of national images, they have also been portrayed as devoid of agency, at the mercy of political and economic elites. Indeed, with few exceptions, studies have mostly ignored the voices of individuals working in the media. Focusing on the June 2013 protests in Brazil, this paper examines the role of foreign correspondents and freelance journalists in the construction and projection of the image of a nation. Most particularly, it explores four issues raised by media professionals, which impact the construction and projection of a given nation in the media. They are: news values, editorial decisions, the commodification of news, and the role of technology","Media, Framing and Public Diplomacy",Public Diplomacy
2018-1907,2018,Paper Session,"Britain’s Foreign Policy, Soft Power and Citizens’ Engagement With ‘Brexit’ on Social Media",2,"The aim of this multi-disciplinary study is to explore citizen’s engagement with foreign policy on social media. The central argument and rationale for undertaking this analysis stems from the fact that social media have changed ways in which citizens’ engage with foreign policy, yet neither the scholarship on ‘foreign policy-media-public opinion’ nexus nor soft power and public diplomacy bodies of literature sufficiently explain public engagement with foreign policy on social media. Therefore, this study takes the United Kingdom as proponent of digitalisation of foreign policy statecraft and diplomacy and, using a case study research design, explores how social media impact citizens’ engagement with the issue of Britain’s departure from the European Union. This analysis addresses the challenge that social media brought about to foreign policy analysis, including ways in which foreign policy actors and their practices interlink with the way citizens’ use social media to engage with foreign policy. Subsequently, implications of political engagement with foreign policy issue for the practice of public diplomacy are discussed.","Media, Framing and Public Diplomacy",Public Diplomacy
2018-1908,2018,Paper Session,Explaining the Nation: Participatory Advocacy as Grassroots Diplomacy Between Israel and Iran,1,"This paper is focused on the ways in which members of the Persian community in Israel (Israelis of Iranian descent) take part in Israeli diplomatic efforts through Hasbara (literally translates as “explaining,” seen as Israeli diplomacy as further explained in the paper). The involvement is analyzed through self-proclaimed role community members take upon themselves as Israeli diplomats online. In the case of the Persian community in Israel, members work to construct spaces within which they transcend offline cultural and political limitations. They create online spheres that position the Persian community as a central political player within the Israeli-Iranian conflict through what I define as “Participatory Advocacy.” The materials shared in this essay are a part of a larger, three-year ethnographic project aimed at understanding the transnational, national, and ethnic belonging of the Persian group in the Israeli society. I combine online media studies with public diplomacy studies to look at transnational dialogues and identities in spaces of cultural and political contention.","Media, Framing and Public Diplomacy",Public Diplomacy
2018-1909,2018,Paper Session,Effects of Provider Identity and Locus of Supportive Conversation on Coping With a Stigmatized Trait,2,"This study examines two previously unconsidered features of supportive interactions in the context of stigma: social identity of a support provider and locus of a supportive conversation. Participants (N = 200) engaged in a supportive interaction with a confederate who was trained to manipulate their social identity and offer messages that attended to the affect of the support provider or receiver. Over-time evaluations of support were also collected. Participants reported higher cognitive reappraisal when interacting with in-group and moderate out-group providers compared to out-group providers. Analyses revealed interaction effects. Participants felt less stigmatized when in-group and moderate out-group members were provider-focused compared to receiver-focused, but the pattern of effects was reversed for out-group members. Interactive effects persisted three weeks later.",HIGH-DENSITY: Communicative Disclosures and Support Messages,Interpersonal Communication
2018-1910,2018,Paper Session,"Effects of Reintegration Difficulties, Perceived Message Acceptance and Perceived Autonomy Support on U.S. Military Veterans’ Evaluations of Messages Encouraging Them to Seek Behavioral Health Care",3,"This study examines how Veterans evaluate family members’ messages encouraging them to seek behavioral health care, including how Veterans’ perceptions of acceptance and autonomy support influence relevant outcomes (persuasiveness, emotions, identity management, relationships). Guided by politeness, confirmation, and self-determination theories, we developed messages that varied in acceptance and autonomy support. Veterans (N = 226) who had been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan reported their level of difficulty reintegrating to civilian life, evaluated the extent to which messages were accepting and autonomy supportive, and completed outcome measures. Reintegration difficulties were negatively associated with Veterans’ perceptions of messages as accepting (but not supporting autonomy) and exerted negative, direct effects on identity management, emotions, and relational outcomes (but not persuasiveness). Perceived acceptance was positively associated with three out of four outcomes (not identity management), while perceived autonomy support was positively associated with identity management and emotions. In terms of indirect effects, perceived acceptance mediated the relationship between (a) reintegration difficulties and three outcomes, and (b) manipulated message acceptance and three outcomes. Perceived autonomy support only mediated the relationship between (a) reintegration difficulties and emotions, and (b) manipulated autonomy support and two out of four outcomes (emotions and identity management). Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.",HIGH-DENSITY: Communicative Disclosures and Support Messages,Interpersonal Communication
2018-1911,2018,Paper Session,Examining the Effect of Message Style in Esteem Support Interactions: A Laboratory Investigation,7,"The Cognitive-Emotional Theory of Esteem Support Messages (CETESM) predicts that variations in both message content and message style will affect the outcomes of esteem support interactions. However, little research has focused on message style. The current experiment addresses this lacuna in the research by manipulating message style in a laboratory study examining esteem support interactions. Confederates were trained to provide esteem support to naïve participants in five different styles: low inductive, high inductive, low assertive, high assertive, and control. After the interactions, we assessed participants’ state self-esteem, attributions and appraisals about the esteem-threatening event, and perceptions of conversational relevance to the esteem-threatening situation. Results indicated that the extent to which both inductive styles were used was associated with positive outcomes, including participant reports of state self-esteem, appraisals, and conversational relevance, whereas the extent to which the assertive styles were used was not associated with any dependent variables of interest.",HIGH-DENSITY: Communicative Disclosures and Support Messages,Interpersonal Communication
2018-1912,2018,Paper Session,Friends’ Disclosures About Stressors: How Does Communication Competence Matter?,3,"Stressors are salient in emerging adults’ lives, and, friendships, which are characterized largely by disclosure and social support are the central relationship in emerging adulthood. Thus, it makes sense that emerging adults turn to friends when experiencing stressors. However, little is known about how stressor disclosure occurs, even though stressor disclosure is necessary in the social support process. Communication privacy management theory provided a useful framework for examining how friends disclose stressor and what shapes those disclosures. A dyadic interaction study of 95 emerging adult friends found that perceptions of communication competence is an important factor moderating the effects of disclosers’ and confidants’ disclosures on their friendship satisfaction. Results indicate communication competence functions as a privacy control mechanism within CPM, and when emerging adults want to disclose stressors, their own and their friends’ communication competence should be considered in addition to the valence of the information they want to reveal.",HIGH-DENSITY: Communicative Disclosures and Support Messages,Interpersonal Communication
2018-1913,2018,Paper Session,What to Say When Seeking Support Online: The Effect of Depth of Self-disclosure in Support-seeking Posts on the Quality of the Response Messages,5,"This study examined how exposure to online support-seeking posts with different levels of depth self-disclosure (peripheral, core, baseline) affected the quality of the response messages participants provided. Participants who read the support-seeking posts containing peripheral self-disclosure rated the support-seekers as less anonymous compared to the ones who read support-seeking posts containing core self-disclosure and baseline self-disclosure. In terms of the quality of the response messages, participants who read the support-seeking posts containing peripheral self-disclosure wrote response messages with higher level of person-centeredness compared to the one who read the support-seeking posts containing baseline self-disclosure. Furthermore, participants’ perceived anonymity of the support-seekers were negatively associated with the level of person-centeredness of their response messages. Participants’ perceived anonymity of the support-seekers mediated the effect of the depth of self--disclosure on the politeness of the response messages.",HIGH-DENSITY: Communicative Disclosures and Support Messages,Interpersonal Communication
2018-1914,2018,Paper Session,Workplace Pregnancy Disclosures,2,"Disclosure research to date is dominated by episodic and dyadic examinations of the disclosure process (e.g., patient-provider, child-parent, friend-friend; see Venetis, Meyerson, Griley, Gillespie, Ohmit, & Shields, 2016; Catona, Greene, Magsamen-Conrad, 2015). This study broadens the examination of disclosure to explore how the disclosure of information is negotiated in a social space: examining how 40 expecting mothers disclose their pregnancy in the workplace. Taken from a larger dataset on women’s pregnancy and maternity leave experiences, the transcribed semi-structured interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Results suggest four themes in expecting mothers’ disclosure experiences: (a) disclosure preparation, (b) safe timing, (c) disclosure approach, and (d) being outed. Data analysis revealed that women’s pregnancy disclosure experiences in the workplace entail the use of multiple disclosure strategies, presenting a meta-perspective that positions disclosure as an iterative and digestive process (see Reiss & Shaver, 1988).",HIGH-DENSITY: Communicative Disclosures and Support Messages,Interpersonal Communication

As scholars located theoretically within the long tradition of audience studies, we report in this paper, from a unique exercise within the field - a foresight analysis conducted by a 29 member European research consortium, on the future of audiences in the year 2030, anticipating the ubiquity of connected technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), amidst a critical scrutiny of algorithms, datafication and its myriad consequences. Tracing a set of future scenarios along the dimensions of diverging responses to the IoT on the one hand, and the changing nature of institution-individual relationships on the other, we follow a set of 16 drivers of societal change that we suggest will shape the way we study people as audiences as users moving towards 2030.","Smart Stuff: Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and Urban Broadband Networks",Communication and Technology
2018-1916,2018,Paper Session,Framing Smart Nation: A Moderated Mediation Analysis of Frame-Focus Effects,2,"The rise of smart cities has emerged as a key policy thread that unites various government agencies. However, these smartness initiatives generates tradeoffs between economic growth and privacy concerns, with emphasis placed on data sharing for innovation, and surveillance for cybersecurity purposes. This study examines media framing in Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives. Content analysis indicated news media employ intersected frames to present issues involving the Smart Nation. A between-subject experiment investigated the effect of news frames (gain versus loss) and regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) on respondents’ (N = 157) opinions toward the Smart Nation. Gain frames were more effective when coupled with a promotion focus, and loss frames had a more impact when combined with a prevention focus. A moderated mediation analysis demonstrated that support, attitudes, and perceived vulnerability mediated the interaction effect between gain/loss frames and regulatory focus on the intention to participate in Smart Nation initiatives.","Smart Stuff: Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and Urban Broadband Networks",Communication and Technology
2018-1917,2018,Paper Session,Civic Entrepreneurialism in the Age of Smart Cities,1,"This paper examines what kind of civic voices are cultivated as municipalities partner with tech companies to build smart cities. Rather than a top-down or bottom-up approach, it highlights the role of civic entrepreneurialism -- a new mode of public participation that blends civic duties with entrepreneurial rituals -- in legitimizing the pervasive enthusiasm around the idea that cities can achieve growth and progress through smart technologies. Drawing on a two-year ethnographic project in an aspiring smart city, this paper argues that civic entrepreneurs 1) deliberately defy the distinction between public and private interests, 2) attempt to build solidarity among entrepreneurial residents to mitigate their own precarity in the digital economy, and 3) legitimize a particular “public” voice by catering to the interests of tech companies and social organizations simultaneously, while displacing other potential critiques of the smart city.","Smart Stuff: Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and Urban Broadband Networks",Communication and Technology
2018-1918,2018,Paper Session,Failures of Imagination in Urban Broadband Networks,2,"The design and deployment of urban broadband infrastructures inscribe particular imaginations of internet access onto city streets and offer insights into government, corporate, and community desires for public internet use and ideologies about users. The different materialities and locations of these networks, their uses, and access points often expose material excesses of urban broadband networks and the failures of internet service providers, urban populations, and public officials to imagine the different ways that people incorporate internet connection into their everyday lives. We approach the study of urban broadband networks through the juxtaposition of invisible and inactive networks that are buried under the streets and have always been “turned off” (dark fiber) versus hypervisible and activated networks that are “turned on” and prominently displayed on city streets (LinkNYC). In our analysis, we concentrate on themes of visibility and spectacle as indexes of power and access.","Smart Stuff: Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and Urban Broadband Networks",Communication and Technology
2018-1919,2018,Paper Session,Investigating the Effects of Smelling and Touching a Virtual Donut on Satiation and Eating Behavior,2,"Olfactory research in immersive virtual environments (IVEs) have often examined the addition of scent as part of the environment or atmosphere that act as experimental stimuli. There appears to be a lack of research on the influence of virtual foods in IVEs on human satiation. Studies based on situational cues or self-perception theory provide support for the hypothesis that touching and smelling a virtual food item may lead to increased consumption as a result of modelling expected behavior. On the other hand, studies grounded in embodied cognition suggest that satiation may take place as a result of mental simulation that resembles actual consumption behavior. In this preliminary study, we sought to explore the effects of haptic and olfactory cues through virtual food on human satiation and eating behavior. 101 participants took part in a 2 (touch: present vs absent) X 2 (scent: present vs absent) experiment where they interacted with a donut in an IVE. Findings showed that participants in the touch and scent present conditions ate significantly less donuts than those who were not exposed to these cues, and reported higher satiation as compared to their counterparts. These results provide support for satiation effects as a result of sensory simulation.","Extending Virtual Reality Scholarship: Exploring Opportunities for Feeling Educated, Activated, and Full",Communication and Technology

Over 220 subjects from different learning contexts experienced an immersive underwater world designed to show the process and effects of ocean acidification. In our studies, people either learned about marine science from pre- to post-test knowledge level assessments or demonstrated an interest in learning more about climate change phenomena. Moreover, immersive VR proved to be a pragmatic tool to deliver field trips, which were safe and highly engaging. The findings suggest an opportunity to use immersive VR for education and to drive information-seeking behavior about important social and environmental issues.","Extending Virtual Reality Scholarship: Exploring Opportunities for Feeling Educated, Activated, and Full",Communication and Technology
2018-1921,2018,Paper Session,Virtual Hype Meets Reality: Users’ Perception of Immersive Journalism,2,"Despite a vibrant discourse around the potential of virtual reality technology in journalism, little research attention has been given to its potential users. This study takes an initial step toward understanding how media users respond to immersive journalism and understand its uses, benefits and pitfalls. Within a uses and gratifications framework, focus group participants experienced recent immersive journalistic productions designed to be viewed through VR viewers, and discussed their reactions. Six distinct gratifications were identified, which cluster into gratifications related to experience, affect and action. We found that although users have clear reservations about the technology, they do see great potential for its use for journalism. If used responsibly, users think VR can add great value to almost any journalistic production. Researchers and practitioners alike can benefit from this initial study into understanding users’ impressions of and reactions to VR technology in journalism.","Extending Virtual Reality Scholarship: Exploring Opportunities for Feeling Educated, Activated, and Full",Communication and Technology
2018-1922,2018,Paper Session,"Introducing a Database of Immersive VR clips with Corresponding Ratings of Arousal/Valence, and Exploring Correlations between Head Movements and Affective Ratings",5,"Virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a methodological tool to study the basic science of psychology and other fields. One key advantage of VR is that sharing of virtual content can lead to more robust replication and representative sampling. A database of standardized content will help fulfill this vision. There are two objectives to this study. First, we seek to establish and allow public access to a database of immersive VR clips that can act as a potential resource for studies on emotion induction using virtual reality. Second, given the large sample size of participants needed to get reliable valence and arousal ratings for our video, we were able to explore the possible links between the head movements of the observer and the emotions he feels while viewing immersive VR. To accomplish our goals, we sourced for and tested 73 immersive VR clips which participants rated on valence and arousal dimensions using self-assessment manikins. We also tracked participants’ rotational head movements as they watched the clips, allowing us to correlate head movements and affect. Based on past research, we predicted relationships between the standard deviation of head yaw and valence and arousal ratings. Results showed that the stimuli varied reasonably well along the dimensions of valence and arousal, with a slight underrepresentation of clips that are of negative valence and highly arousing. The standard deviation of yaw positively correlated with valence, while a significant positive relationship was found between head pitch and arousal.","Extending Virtual Reality Scholarship: Exploring Opportunities for Feeling Educated, Activated, and Full",Communication and Technology
2018-1923,2018,Paper Session,And Then the War Came: A Content Analysis of Processes of Resilience in the Narratives of Refugees From Humans of New York,2,"The recent “Refugee Crisis” has received significant media attention but few media representations include actual refugee voices (Berry, Garcia-Blanco, & Moore, 2015). While it is known that refugees exhibit resilience (Hutchinson & Dorsett, 2012), how refugees express and construct resilience is not well understood. The present study examined how refugees represent their resilience in narratives produced by Humans of New York. The authors developed a codebook for assessing resilience representations guided by Buzzanell’s (2010) Communicative Theory of Resilience. The theory describes processes through which individuals communicatively construct resilience. The authors compared refugee narratives with those of veterans, inmates, and pediatric cancer sufferers. Results indicate that refugees uniquely represent their resilience by emphasizing identities that are distinct from being refugees, such as relational and occupational identities. Refugee narratives were less likely to include positive reframings of their hardship or discussion of how they successfully maintain daily routines compared with other narratives.",The Performance of Voice in Marginalised Groups,Theme Sessions

Based on in-depth interviews with HoH and Deaf smartphone users, this paper highlights the social and communicative exclusion of people who are unable to perform voice calls in an era of constant reachability, as well as the way that HoH people who successfully perform mobile voice calls differentiate themselves from Deaf people and the stigma socially associated with Deafness. Two themes are discussed: first, the social, emotional and communicative costs of the inability to perform voice calls are presented; and second, we show how HoH smartphone users' compliance with communicative norms (that require making voice calls) is a function of the intersection of their audiological capacities and other stigmatized positions.",The Performance of Voice in Marginalised Groups,Theme Sessions
2018-1925,2018,Paper Session,Voice and Identity in the Autistic Space of the Blogosphere,1,"The Internet, and blogging in particular, are radically reshaping contemporary thinking about autism, moving toward a socio-cultural view of autism as a manifestation of neurodiversity. Blogs represent a space in which autistic persons can redefine themselves using their own voice, and construct an identity as an individual and member of a community. The current paper aimed to explore the perception of the blog as arena for identity construction and the meaning of autistic identity to the bloggers. A constructivist grounded theory approach guided the data collection and data analysis. In-depth interviews with bloggers and informants were conducted in addition to the textual analysis of the blog posts. Altogether 2,873 blog posts from 16 blogs and 20 interviews were included in the project. The study found the bloggers perceive autism as inseparable from the self and the blog as a controllable space in which they can explore their autistic self.",The Performance of Voice in Marginalised Groups,Theme Sessions
