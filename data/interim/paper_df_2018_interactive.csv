2018-0000,2018,Paper Session,Geographical Diffusion of Protests in China: Evidences From Social Media,2,"Protests often diffuse in time and space. Although the phenomenon has be noticed by social scientists for decades, there is no systematic evidence on how persistent the impact a protest can be, how far it can transmit in geography, and what factors determine the transmission speed. Exploiting a unique dataset of collective actions happened in China between 2014 and 2015, we find that the influence of a protest on future protests can last for around a week in the same location, and for four days in neighboring prefectures. This pattern is also most salient for labor protests. Furthermore, no evidence indicates that the spatial correlation between protests is driven by common shocks, or the transmission can go beyond the first degree neighbors. Prefectures with higher fiscal capacity are more likely to experience protest diffusion.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0001,2018,Paper Session,Media and Corruption in Tanzania: From Pre-Colonial to Re-Democratisation,2,"This paper is based on findings on the media’s role in curbing corruption in the Tanzania. Presenting a historical perspective, the paper argues that, though the liberalization of the media sector has enabled the media in Tanzania to focus more on issues that concern the viewers, listeners and readers, the post-colonial media, particularly Radio Tanzania - Dar es Salaam (RTD) in the 1970s was more successful in the war against corruption than the present media. The study findings established that factors such as media’s limited economic resources, the influence of politicians, the absence of laws to protect both the journalists and sources of information, death threats for refusing to take the money and kill stories related to grand corruption and lack of leaders with moral authority and a political will to hold high-level leaders accountable for their vices undermined the anti-corruption reportage efforts of the current media in the country.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0002,2018,Paper Session,"Spinning Frames of Mediatized Protest: Body, Language, Culture, Space, and Religion",1,"Amid a constant influx of visuals on our digital screens, the space of activism has become a dynamic web of ruptures, connections, and transformations. My analysis of Femen assemblage offers an initial charting of the mediatized activist network. By examining Femen’s protest event of cutting down a crucifix in downtown Kiev, I study the processes of a mediatized activist body linking across media outlets and geographic borders, breaking off of territorial and cultural contexts, and producing new material and digital interpretations swarming around it. The emergence of visually affective activist groups such as Femen disrupts hegemonic power structures and unveils potentials to see and act anew.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0003,2018,Paper Session,"Capitals, Censorship and Risks: The Role of Social Media in Localised Small-Scale Environmental Protests",1,"Social networking media transforms contentious environmental movements in China. Unlike large-scale environmental protests in China, the small-scale protests are featured as isolated, disconnected and contained. However, social media is redefining voice articulation, power balances and capital accumulation in small-scale environmental movements.

By analysing seven cases of localised environmental movements, this paper explores the role of social networking media in helping and hindering localised small-scale environmental protests for local communities in China. It intends to critically assess how the use of social media affected the logics of a loosely self-organised local communities’ field in small-scale environmental protests. In doing so, it examines how social media afforded capital accumulation, employing Bourdieu’s theory of field. The results of this investigation indicate that social media has helped local protesters to acquire certain amounts of various forms of capital, namely cultural, social, symbolic and economic capitals, albeit in a limited way.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0004,2018,Paper Session,Communication Activism in the Basic Course: A Public Speaking for Social Justice Model,1,"While the basic content of the public speaking course has changed little over the decades, the method and manner in which these skills are taught can, and should, reflect the dynamically changing socio-political contexts in which we live and teach. This paper introduces a Public Speaking for Social Justice Model that can be utilized in the introductory public speaking course. The model requires that students thoroughly examine a timely social justice issue, situate themselves and their classmates within the issue while featuring marginalized voices and narratives, seek a critical, well-researched understanding through sustained analysis and interrogation, and offer pragmatic solutions envisioned by those most affected by the issue in order to affect change. The model reflects many of the tenets of Critical Communication Pedagogy (CCP) and Communication Activism Pedagogy (CAP) and the paper discusses appraisals and limitations after utilizing the model for four years in introductory public speaking courses.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0005,2018,Paper Session,Mobile Technologies and the 2012 Occupy Nigeria Protest,1,"This study examines the impact of mobile social networking applications in the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest in order to further understand the use of mobile social networking applications for digital activism. A purposive survey was conducted of students attending two universities in Nigeria: the University of Lagos and the Rivers State University in Port Harcourt. Quantitative data were collected between May-June 2015 using a face-to-face, paper-based survey. Survey results indicate that mobile social networking applications (WhatsApp, 2go, Eskimi, Facebook, Badoo and YouTube) were used most by the protesters to plan, coordinate and mobilize for the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Some respondents used these applications to document their participation in the protest. Of the seven platforms analysed, Facebook was the most used for protest purposes while Eskimi increased the likelihood that a student attended the first day of the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Previous studies on the use of social media to facilitate participation in contentious politics have examined established legacy democracies or authoritarian regimes. Participation via social media in nascent democracies has been less well-documented – e.g. in those countries that democratized between the 1970s and the 1990s including those that recently returned to democracy from military dictatorship such as Nigeria. This study has been conducted to fill such a void.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0006,2018,Paper Session,"So, “How” did the Women’s March Succeed? Women’s March Facebook as an Evidence From Resource Mobilization Theory",1,"The Women’s March starting from a post on Facebook is recorded as the largest single-day protest in the U.S. history. Although existing studies about social media in political participation has investigated the diverse aspects of social media, there is a remaining question of how social media mobilizes resources from the fragmented online public. The present study conducts a qualitative textual analysis of the 274 posts on the Women’s March Facebook page to understand how different types of recourses were attained for the March. With the use of resources mobilization theory (Edwards & Gillham, 2013) as a theoretical framework, three themes were found to be a distinctive feature of the March: transparency, spreadable and participatory media, and legitimacy of the March. Each theme with illustrative examples will be discussed.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0007,2018,Paper Session,Constructed Identity in Memes: Analyzing the German Identitarian Movement’s Strategic Framing and Its Reach on Facebook,3,"The German Identitarian Movement (GIM) claims to be neither left nor right wing but rather identitarian. This movement is active mainly on Facebook and stands for ethno-pluralism (i.e., diversity of cultures, each in a homogeneous society). Without a clear classification to a political wing, social-media users getting in contact with posts created by the GIM might have difficulties assessing what this movement stands for. For this reason, the current study examined strategic frames in memes (n = 184) posted by this movement on Facebook, with memes (usually image macros) being the GIM’s main form of communication. This study identified four strategic frames that represent a plurality of social issues; most of them were framed negatively. Solutions for problems were one-sided and focused on supporting the movement (e.g., financially or through protest). Since strategic frames represent the GIM’s collective identity, this study found indicators that classify the movement as right wing.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0008,2018,Paper Session,A Treat for the Eyes. How Food Cues in Media Content Attract Children’s Visual Attention,4,"Current research on food advertising effects states that the type of food, the level of integration, and individual susceptibility factors influence responsiveness to food cues. In the present study, we determined children’s cue reactivity by measuring their attentional awareness via eye-tracking and considered all three theoretically derived aspects. Participants’ visual attention to unhealthy and healthy food cues (i.e., type of food) presented in different levels of interactivity with a character (i.e., level of integration) was recorded while children were viewing a self-created media content. Afterwards, we asked children about their hunger level (i.e., individual susceptibility). Our results indicated that children dwell on unhealthy food cues longer than on healthier ones, but first fixation duration didn’t differ between healthy and unhealthy food. Furthermore, an increase in the level of integration led to an increase in visual attention. Our findings showed no moderating impact of hunger.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0009,2018,Paper Session,Do Children’s Food Choices “Go With the Crowd”? The Effects of Peer Majority Cues in Placements of Foods High in Nutritional Value,2,"We investigated how peer-majority-cues influence children’s likelihood of choosing fruit over candy. In an experiment, we showed children a cartoon, either presenting no food, presenting one child eating raspberries, or presenting all children eating raspberries. As a mediator, children’s majority awareness, that is, awareness of other peers’ liking of raspberries was measured. As the dependent variable, we assessed children’s choice of raspberries and tested the moderating role of food neophobia measured by parental surveys. We found that children in the majority condition did not increase their awareness of other peers liking raspberries compared to the control condition. The minority condition, however, led children to conclude that most peers do not like raspberries compared to the control. This decreased their own consumption of raspberries. In addition, children with high levels of food neophobia exposed to the minority stimulus were less likely to choose raspberries compared to children in the majority condition.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

2018-0012,2018,Paper Session,"""Put Your Phone Down?"": How Mothers' Smartphone Use Is Associated With Sensitivity",5,"Smartphone use has become an “always-on” activity. Caring for children and being sensitive to their needs seems to be in critical conflict with this immersive and time-consuming activity. Building on John Bowlby’s Attachment Theory, we focused on how mothers' smartphone use is related to maternal sensitivity. Using the Mini-Maternal Behavior Q-Sort method and a post-survey questionnaire, we collected data from 89 mother-child dyads on playgrounds. Results showed that mothers who used their smartphones longer had lower sensitivity ratings, whereas there was no association between low sensitivity ratings and the frequency of use. With regard to particular kinds of smartphone use, we found that mothers who communicated more with friends or family were more sensitive to their children when we controlled for duration and frequency of use. We discuss the boundary conditions of how using a smartphone for certain reasons and time-periods might be compatible with being a sensitive caregiver.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0013,2018,Paper Session,Representing Gender-Based Violence in Teen Series: Young People’s Discourses on the Spanish Series Física o Química,2,"Through the analysis of the fans’ forum of a popular Spanish teen series, Física o Química (2008-2011), this study explores what meanings the audience gives to the representation of gender violence in the series, focussing particularly on how they deal with the representation of male aggression towards women and how audiences reflect on gender stereotypes and unequal romantic and sexual adolescent relationships. From the analysis emerges that adolescents have internalized a series of stereotypes and myths of romantic love that can be very dangerous because they justify violence of men towards women. But it is the same series representation that leads viewers to question the myths, and thus, to talk about gender violence among adolescents, to reflect on it and the dangers of romantic idealization. This happens because the series presents a risky representation and raises the dilemmas openly, without trying to be moralizing with the audiences.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Based on a new conception – ‘transmedia literacy’ – that moves from traditional media literacy (teaching critical media skills at school) to informal learning and practices of participatory cultures, the research behind the present paper aims to understand how new generations are doing things with media outside schools and how they learn to do the things they do. After a short description of the objectives and the methodology, the paper focuses on the outputs of this international research that has involved eight countries. The outputs were organised into three sections: transmedia skills, informal learning strategies and emergent issues regarding teens, new media and collaborative cultures. Finally, the paper deals with the future perspectives of transmedia literacy as a research and action programme.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

2018-0017,2018,Paper Session,Development and Initial Validation of the Self-Transcendent Emotion Dictionary,2,"Recent years have seen a growing amount of research effort directed toward what positive psychologists refer to as self-transcendent or inspirational emotions, such as awe, admiration, elevation, gratitude, and hope. While these emotions are invaluable to promote greater human connectedness, an outward orientation, prosociality, and human flourishing, to date, researchers are not well-equipped to identify them either on mass media or private communication channels. Approaching from an interdisciplinary perspective, we aimed to construct a computational tool that can empower researchers to identify and analyze self-transcendent emotions among textual messages. To that end, we constructed and validated a dictionary tool that can be uploaded into the mainstream, textual analytic software (e.g., LIWC) to identify terms associated with transcendence-related emotional experiences as expressed in spoken and written languages. Potential applications for the newly developed tool and what it could mean for future studies of positive psychology are discussed.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0018,2018,Paper Session,Harnessing Collective Wisdom From Communication Patterns in Human Organizations,3,"The collective intelligence hypothesis purports that groups can be smarter than individuals in a wide range of decision-making problems. Attempts to tap the cognitive surplus of collectives have enhanced innovation, product design, and predictions about the replicability of scientific findings. A similarly important task is to improve organizational decision-making in financial investment firms. Financial companies invest public and private resources and thus their returns fundamentally affect retirement funds and planning, corporate earnings, and economic growth. Despite the far-reaching implications of good organizational decisions, the question about how communication dynamics within companies can result in collective intelligence requires further investigation. Can different patterns of communication or changes in the content of communication over the course of decisions be used to improve decisions? In this study, we show that collective intelligence signals deduced from communication patterns predict the movement of the market. Further, we find that the firm does not take advantage of the produced collective intelligence and that it could make superior decisions using communication-based collective intelligence signals.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0019,2018,Paper Session,Hollywood’s Political Space: Estimating Film Ideology From Revealed Preferences,2,"Traditional forms of film criticism have relied on subjective interpretation of, at most, only a few films at a time. These limitations are a product of the very real limitations on human attention that prevent scholars from watching every movie that has been released. As such, we propose a computational approach for estimating the latent political positions, what we refer to as \textit{film slant}, of over 5 million films. To do so, we adapt a Bayesian item response theory model for large sparse matrices intended for roll call analysis and apply it using an Expectation-maximization algorithm to trace user data in the form of film reviews (N=~20,000,000). We find that this method is valid, both in regards to the ideological positions of films, but also their viewers. We finally turn our attention to some substantive results and demonstrate, through an analysis of the dynamics of the central tendency of our set of films, that the film industry does not have any specific liberal bias, but rather partakes in a form of negative polarization in which the system responds in opposition to the ideological position of the sitting American president.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Therefore, this study presents results from a representative survey in Switzerland investigating which sociodemographic factors predict attitudes and media use with regard to science. We find that the Swiss in general have positive attitudes towards science and that sex, age, education, proximity to science and where someone lives are the best predictors for scientific attitudes. Newspapers and the internet are the most important media sources for scientific issues. In predicting someone’s media use with regard to science, age and proximity to science play important roles.

2018-0022,2018,Paper Session,Reexamine Third Person Effects in the Context of Collective Actions,2,"Abstract
This study employs the third-person effects hypothesis to examine media effects in promoting public engagement in fighting climate change as a collection action.
In line with the collective interest model, which emphasizes that individuals’ decision of participating in collective action depends on their perception of others’ performance and individuals’ worry about free-rider effects would refrain them form taking action, this study reexamined both the perceptual and behavioral components of TPE. A nationally door-to-door survey was conducted in Singapore (N= 705). The results showed that individuals’ perception of others’ media attention leads them to develop third-person perception of media influence. In regards to behavioral component, the more people believe that others are influenced by media messages than themselves; the more likely they would engage in pro-environmental behaviors. This relationship was shaped by attitude, social norms, and collective efficacy.

Although initially reactive, there has been a recent uptick in corporate communication about climate change. While several studies have evaluated business actions and communication about climate change, they have several limitations: idiosyncratic nature of studies that limit cross-country comparisons and benchmarking, understudy of corporations outside the US and Western Europe even if they feature in lists of top companies, and less robust methodologies of frequency counts, among others. This study compares top New Zealand companies—a country advertised as “100% pure” for its clean and green image—with top Australian and Fortune Global 500 companies on corporate communication about climate science, and opportunities and barriers for business engagement with climate change. Based on a indices developed from previous studies, a quantitative analysis of 59 corporations latest (2017) non-financial reports finds that New Zealand companies largely lag behind Australian companies, who appear to perform equally, if not better, compared to the top Global 500 companies on different dimensions of business communication and engagement with climate change. Over half of the companies reported several climate science dimensions, while only a minority of companies reported or agreed with scientific consensus. External and internal stakeholders, regulation, and new opportunities were identified as primary drivers. Few barriers were reported, including company’s growth offsetting emission reductions, uncertainty in policies, with uncertainty about the science and impacts of climate change reported scarcely. Findings indicate that business has reached an inflection point on climate change, with businesses reporting more opportunities than barriers.

A total of 70 participants (47.1% men) took part in a lab experiment that manipulated stereotype threat (i.e., the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one’s group) between playing a video game (Bejeweled 3). Participants performed generally worse after reading a fictitious article on gaming research that women would still play less and perform worse in games than men (ST condition). In contrast to males, however, female participants reported greater frustration from reading this article than their colleagues who read that women and men no longer differ in terms of playing frequency and performance skills (no ST condition). Interestingly, a reverse pattern of results was obtained for male participants, who reported a stronger negative effect of the article in the no ST condition on their ability to show their best gaming performance.

Research has shown that playing certain video games can improve visuospatial skills, which has been linked to predominance in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), where women are vastly underrepresented. With large gender gaps in STEM, video games may be one of the most culturally-pervasive media able to spatially train individuals. Adams and Mayer (2012) proposed that the Matthew Effect could explain females' lack of play: those with higher spatial skills, traditionally men, seek out and play games with higher spatial demands, thus beginning the cycle of enjoyable spatial training. In this study, we assess whether non-gaming females prefer games which match their spatial abilities, or if preferences are predicted by gender themes/level of interactivity. Results indicate little influence of ingoing spatial ability on preference, and an unexpected preference for masculine games. Implications for games, their gendered themes/appeal, and potential use as a spatially education tool are discussed.",Game Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Furthermore, the natural mapped perception was positively linked to the sense of presence, which, in turn, enhanced advertising enjoyment and further improved the immersive virtual reality advertising effects, thereby yielding a three-step serial mediation model.

We hypothesized that gendered self-construals and colorblind responses would lead to different evaluations of image repair crisis responses by gender. We found female participants rated such tweets as more controversial (p < .001, r = .23) and inappropriate (p < .01) than did males. In examining participant evaluation of response strategies, females evaluated the response strategy using colorblind ideology (defiance) as a less appropriate defense than did men (p < .001). Even though a defiance response is relatively effective for men, there are ethical and societal considerations for its use. The potential implications for crisis experts using a defiance response include silencing voices in intergroup relations, as well as pushing societal boundaries for what is acceptable “talk” concerning racial and ethnic differences.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In this comparative analysis study, female and male politicians’ crisis communications are compared, seeking to trace the existence or absence of gender characteristics therein. The study engaged in a qualitative comparative analysis of eight pairs of male and female Israeli politicians in crisis (16 cases) and included 17 interviews with politicians, their spokespeople and other officials and full coverage of the crises in four newspapers (528 newspaper articles). The study indicates that male and female politicians differ in their crisis communication. On the strategic level, female politicians demonstrated greater responsiveness than their male counterparts. On the tactical level, female politicians more frequently applied direct tactics, such as personal interviews or press conferences. With respect to media openness, female politicians exhibited greater openness and collaboration than male politicians, who generally gave more businesslike and laconic responses.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

We aim at investigating this question with a study, based on an experimental research design with a fictitious crisis situation and different response scenarios. We run two online experiment with over 500 participants and measure the perceived appropriateness of crisis responses, buying intentions, and secondary crisis communication as outcome variables. Our preliminary results from the first study reveal that social media comments make no significant difference for these outcome variables, when corporate crisis responses are a clear match (apology) or mismatch (scapegoating/denial). Accordingly, in a second study we will investigate how social comments influence participants’ perceptions, when the corporate crisis response is more ambiguous and less clearly a match or mismatch respectively.

Two theoretical puzzles are identified in the existing crisis communication and network studies literature: whether online crisis communication is a replication of the offline hierarchy of power, authority, media access, and resources, or a revolution in individuals coming together in a public sphere to discuss and influence political decisions; and whether a static aggregated network collected at a particular time point in the crisis period, or dynamic network data comprising data from smaller intervals, offers better predictive power regarding crisis communication. Using the case study of the 2017 Westminster attack, this study uses SNA to depict temporal changes in the communications network during crisis. The prominence of actors or organizations is delineated in the static aggregate network versus the dynamic network, as well as in online patterns and offline hierarchies.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

However, empirical research that evaluates the effect of transparency has been scarce. In particular there is little research examining whether the effects of transparency may depend on contextual factors, such as whether an organization is associated with a controversial industry. Based on legitimacy theory, this 2 (stigmatization of a company: high vs. low) X 2 (level of transparency: high vs. low) experiment examines the effect of CSR messages on supportive communication intent, purchase intent, and skepticism by taking into account the organizational characteristics of stigmatization as well as the message transparency. Results revealed a main effect of transparency on purchase intent and a main effective of stigmatization on skepticism. Most importantly, there was an interaction between transparency and level of stigmatization, such that a higher level of transparency in CSR communication reduced skepticism when a stigmatized company was involved. The results contribute to further contextualizing transparency and CSR research.

In start-ups, these teams are small and a member is brought on because of their specialized skillset. The team is tasked with the goal of innovation, or creating a new method, product, or idea by recombining existing knowledge. Just as the start-up’s strategy may adapt to changes in the innovation during development, the reliance on certain skills among members on the team may also change. The flexible nature of the start-up allows members to explore other areas of expertise and craft their role on the team. Further, members shape what others know of their expertise strategically, claiming and avoiding certain expertise areas. Survival of the start-up, however, depends on how members recognize and utilize expertise, posing a potential conflict between members’ role definitions and the start-up’s management of knowledge. How does a member in a group of experts shape the perception of their expertise? How does the perception of expertise enable the coordination and management of knowledge in the start-up?

However headings show several impairments. Therefore, alternative ways to support text structure processing are needed. Some scholars consider marginalia to be read as comments and to be distinct from headings but also capable of explicating the text’s structure. However, others consider marginalia to be just another kind of heading. The present experimental study investigates differences between headings and marginalia via eyetracking and measurement of learning outcomes. 76 participants learned with a text with identical macropropositional learning aids, presented as either regular headings, marginal headings or marginal comments. Learning outcomes revealed a significant increase in inference performance and recognition of micropropositions for marginal comments compared to both heading conditions.

Survey data were collected from 197 secondary school students in Finland, and analyzed via path modeling. Results supported predictions that children from bilingual households are both more aware of other speakers’ linguistic preferences and needs, and more competent in their language skills, and that both these factors contribute to linguistic accommodation (i.e., language choice). Specifically, our findings suggest language competence appears to function as the “default” determinant of language choice and perspective-taking as an intervention, attenuating this relationship as consideration of others’ wants or needs (that differ from this default) increase.

However, the majority of models depicted in advertisements are strongly physically dissimilar to average individuals in society. The following study attempts to gain insight into the level of model physical attractiveness in advertisements and the influence it has on a female’s perception of their own body. Specifically, the study will examine whether the attractiveness of the model will be impacted by consumer attitudes regarding their own self-esteem, body image, and social comparison tendencies. A quasi-experimental design compared exposure to a non-gendered product advertisement featuring either an attractive model, a realistic-looking model, or no model. Findings revealed that the no model condition was most effective for the likelihood to purchase a non-gendered product.

User-driven sanctions complement the content moderation by platform providers and the legal regulation by state authorities. The paper differentiates social, technical, and legal sanctions against problematic user-generated content. It deduces factors that may determine if users would negatively sanction social media content or expect sanctions from the platform provider or the state. The paper presents evidence from two empirical studies. Among others it shows that assessment of Facebook content as dangerous, a tendency to paternalism, and a general commitment to freedom of expression influence the users’ perceived need for sanctions against the Facebook content.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This study explored the world of haul videos in both their on and offline iterations through an interview with a popular YouTube haul video creator, and an ethnography conducted in the virtual space of haul video comment threads. The findings revealed more about the nuanced nature of the content creator-viewer bond, and gave a brief snapshot of the implications of mediated relationships.

Even though it has been embraced by digital media users, little is known about motivating factors that drive readers to consume this format for delivering news. Hence, this study makes a valuable contribution to the still developing research about the live blog by employing uses and gratifications approach and surveying 339 Internet users, the majority of whom were undergraduate students, to understand what motivates them to read live blogs. The study results suggest that contemporary gratifications - immediacy and convenience - along with information seeking, were the main motivating factors of live-blog consumption. Furthermore, frequency of reading online news and immediacy were identified as the key predictors of the live-blog use, signaling that digital media consumers have an increasing need to acquire live reports about major events.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

By applying Hall’s encoding and decoding and Habermas’ public spheres, three research questions were addressed regarding audience members’ polysemic interpretations of social and cultural constructions in Chinese mainstream media. Via a thematic analysis of audience moments under each post on its official Sina Weibo account of Oriental Pearl Live Newsroom, this study identified three themes from the online public sphere concerning controversial social issues: 1) Government is the core; 2) Request for the rule of law; 3) Media is a paradox. This study supports conceptualizing audience members as citizens. It demonstrates how audience members deconstruct the dominant interpretations of social values and their attempts to elaborate less-favorable voices in transitional Chinese society. Active audience citizenship implies audience members’ desires in creating diverse public spheres and promoting civil society.

This study examines how dimensions of perceived trust in mobile advertisers (ability, benevolence and integrity) mediate the negative effect of privacy concern on intention to use app-based LBA. Analyzing web survey data from 658 Taiwanese smartphone users with LBA experiences, the SEM results show that privacy concern negatively affects intention to use app-based LBA; however, mediated by perceived trust, privacy concern turns to a positive effect on use intention. Among dimensions of perceived trust, integrity is the only mediator influencing privacy concerns and use intention of app-based LBAs. Specifically, privacy concern negatively predicts integrity of mobile advertiser which turns to a positive effect on use intention. Theoretical and practical implications of perceived trust in mobile advertisers and privacy concern on app-based LBA use are discussed.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

We explore this relationship by analyzing the influence of new entrants to the consistency of language used in online discussions on Reddit over a period of nine years. We find that over time, the most popular words used in online discussion communities tend to stabilize from month to month, a finding that is consistent with prior research on the formation of ‘speech communities’ online. We also find evidence that the percentage of new entrants in online discussions negatively predicts popular word stability from month to month, providing empirical evidence that new entrants do not merely cater to existing linguistic norms, but introduce some measure of originality to online discourse.",Theme Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Indeed voice opportunities, aligning with an overarching discourse on patient safety, are widely available mandatory mechanisms for speaking up at routine multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings. Yet, healthcare professionals in the MDT meetings often do not go beyond straightforward reporting of test results and biomedical-functional parameters. Post-meetings interviews with some of the clinicians reveal the discursive contradictions and silences inherent team discussions. These contradictions and silences come in the form of ideological dilemmas inherent in naturally occurring speech, and often go unnoticed. The ideological dilemmas explicate why healthcare practitioners do not exercise voice vigorously.

Based on interview data and analysis of organizational documents, the study found that volunteers at the first organization dichotomized volunteerism and professionalism as incompatible social systems with divergent objectives, practices, and tools. Volunteers at the second organization engaged in constant boundary crossing, oscillating between a volunteer and professional approach to tasks and relationships depending on the context. In both cases, paid staff and members of the public impacted participants’ ability to engage in boundary work.

Such effect is subject to the interaction between incidental and integral emotions. In order to effectively use emotional appeals in public service announcements (PSAs) for non-profit communication, it is particularly informative to study the interaction between the carry-over effect of incidental emotion and the direct effect of integral emotion. Specifically, this study focuses on the application of pride and hope as discrete integral emotions in blood donation PSAs, as well as the interaction between the two integral emotions and incidental emotions, i.e. potential donors’ pre-existing emotions of anger and fear before viewing the PSAs. The results of a 2 x 2 factorial experiment with 313 participants suggested that congruence in appraisal dimensions between incidental and integral emotions could lead to better perceived message effectiveness, stronger issue advocacy, higher intention for blood donation, and increased attitudes for the non-profit organization.

We combined the stigma management communication strategy framework, with the Stereotype Content Model in an innovative way. We conducted a series of online focus groups with Dutch older workers in order to discuss their view on the old-employee stereotype. In addition, we asked the participants to reflect, in a questionnaire, on two real-life media campaigns about older workers’ position at the labor market. We found that older workers hold different positions in the stigma management communication framework and that these positions color the way in which they evaluated the media campaigns.

Yet, research on diverse collaboration suggests these teams face a dilemma: the very features that set these teams up to innovate are associated with elevated communication challenges which can hinder their success. In this paper, we develop a framework in which the tension between divergence and convergence can be used to manage these challenges to facilitate the creative process. We then use this framework to design and implement an intervention to enable a radically diverse cohort of researchers interested in addressing the issue of resilience to climate change. Our intervention sought to transcend the challenges of diversity through a longitudinal oscillation between moments of divergence, which emphasized diverse perspectives, and convergence, which helped to achieve coordination and common-ground.

Examining the Impact of Emotional Culture on Employee-Organization Relationships,2,"Based on a random sample of employees (n = 506) working in various organizations and industries throughout the United States, we examined the influence of emotional culture on the quality of employee–organization relationships (EORs). Results indicated joy, happiness, excitement, and companionate love, affection, and warmth, can meet employees’ psychological need for mutual respect, care, connection, and reliance on one another in the organization. Such culture also contributes to employees’ trust, satisfaction, feeling of mutual control, and commitment toward the organization. Accordingly, when the organization’s emotional culture and atmosphere is downhearted, discouraged, and sad, employees are less likely to develop quality relationships with the organization. When the organization’s emotional culture is fearful, nervous, and scared, employees tend to feel disconnected with the organization and co-workers and their psychological need for relatedness is less likely to be met.

The Labour government went to great lengths to silence or cripple the remaining continental commercial broadcaster – Radio Luxembourg -- that sought to resume its pre-war influence among British radio listeners. The abysmal state of the consumer market in post-war Britain made the job easier. Also, the government, along with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), tried to bolster the commercial-free public service model in most areas under British influence. There were exceptions both in small colonies and big regions. The most glaring example is South Asia, where the British government was the midwife to the most powerful and successful commercial broadcaster in Asia – Radio Ceylon.

Liebling Counter-Convention. During the 1960s, an elite, college-educated group of journalists had been filtering into the newsrooms of the United States, only to find themselves stifled by strict routines governed by a kind of institutional objectivity. In fact, when Vice President Spiro Agnew condemned the American press as “an effete corps of impudent snobs,” he was criticizing a phantom. American news institutions were still fundamentally conservative. But the Liebling convention gave these reporters a collective, national, trans-institutional voice for the first time, gathering them in one place to discuss questions of pressing concern that these journalists could make no headway on as individuals.

Nevertheless, research on the hands-on education is scarce. Drawing on the theory of professionalization, this analysis examines journalists’ attitude toward the traineeship in the early 20th century. Therefore, debates in the publications of the two major journalistic organizations were investigated: Deutsche Presse (DP) of the bourgeois Reichsverband der deutschen Presse and the social democratic Mitteilungen des Vereins Arbeiterpresse (MdVA). All in all, 46 articles were analyzed over the period of 1913 to 1933 by means of a qualitative content analysis. The study reveals that bourgeois journalists discussed the Volontariat mainly with respect to social issues and vocational prestige. More practice-oriented, social democratic journalists reflected the practicability of traineeships for their partisan newspapers. Regarding professionalization, the Volontariat was in-between the view of journalism as a natural gift and academic studies.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Coverage of Straight vs. Gay Spouses in Newspapers,1,"In the paper, the privatization of politics is considered by analyzing the newspaper coverage and imagery of two candidates’ spouses during the second round of the 2012 Finnish presidential campaign. During the campaign, the spouses were reported on more frequently than during previous campaigns; one couple was gay, and one was straight. What the newspapers reported about the spouses, how balanced the coverage of them was, and how intimate issues in the relationships were described in public were analyzed. The method was a qualitative content analysis. The results show the role of the spouse was treated as was traditional in newspapers, but a gay spouse muddled the traditional gendered frames a little. The level of privatization seemed to be high, and the couples used different strategies to protect their privacy. In addition, methodological challenges and the political meaning of the coverage of the spouses are discussed.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Given the issues above, this study utilizes a culture-centered approach to health communication (Dutta, 2007) to interrogate critically the discourses of the residents of Charleston, in the heart of Appalachia, surrounded by coal-mining industries and chemical plants. The study investigates how the residents belonging to low socio-economic status (SES) received information about the chemical spill, and the ways in which they made sense of environmental disaster as they experienced it. This culture-centered approach contributes to the understandings of the ways in which the environmental crisis are discursively produced by the communities of people that are most affected by it by the virtue of living in an environmentally vulnerable region.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Using a simple random sampling and the keyword “isotretinoin,” messages posted on Acne.org (n= 379) and Reddit.com (n= 325) between March and October 2017 were analyzed. The results showed that the largest share of message postings on the selected discussion boards concerned perceived barriers of isotretinoin. This suggested that acne sufferers were able to realize side effects of the medication. However, the discussed side effects (i.e., dryness and initial breakouts) are not the most serious. Physicians should more address adverse effects of the medication (i.e., miscarriage and hepatitis) with patients. Significant differences across the two message boards regarding perceived susceptibility and benefits of isotretinoin, self-efficacy, and cues to action in the posted messages were also found. Type of message boards perhaps relates to discussion topics, and therefore interventionists may consider this relationship for more effective interventions.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Despite the high rate, most Koreans tend to perceive suicide as something unrelated to them or a problem for someone else. Stigma surrounding suicide is associated with increasing suicide rates. Although suicide stigma affects blind recognition of suicide risk across culture, the existence of stigma itself is a complex sociocultural issue. Above all, since stigma is formed and reinforced through social interaction, understanding the sociocultural context can help address the underlying structure of suicide stigma and antecedents of suicide stigma. The purpose of this study was to examine the cultural attributions affecting suicide stigma in Korea. Specifically, this study explored impacts of Korea’s unique cultural factors such as “Chemyon sensitivity,” “conformity tendency” and “Interdependent self.” Results showed that cultural factors played significant roles in predicting suicide stigma levels for Koreans.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

HIV-related stigma is harmful to the well-being of people living with HIV (PLHIV). This study aimed at evaluating the extent to which narrative (vs. non-narrative) health communication can improve attitudes and behavioral intentions towards PLHIV. Participants (n = 124) of an online study read one of two versions (first-person narrative vs. objective non-narrative) of a blog-post which included information about HIV and life experiences of PLHIV. The results show that narrative health communication improved cognitive attitudes towards PLHIV and increased the willingness to donate for PLHIV, while it did not affect the affective and behavioral component of attitudes towards PLHIV.

This qualitative research goes beyond a quantitative measure of health disparities and provides insights into the ways people comprehend and interpret their perceived disparity and aims to advance a qualitative and thus deeper understanding of the participants’ perceptions of health disparities. Both groups seem not to accept disparity in absolute terms but in a more comparative context, by interpreting disparity in an age-related or job-related context.

We tested the effects of virality metrics on a HIV prevention video. We hypothesized that virality metrics will (1) increase intention to share the video online and (2) increase perceived injunctive norm and descriptive norm toward both condom use and HIV testing, which then lead to higher levels of intentions to use condoms and take HIV testing. We conducted an online experiment with a total of 621 participants. Preliminary findings show virality metrics did not influence intention to share the video, but having any virality metrics regardless of the magnitude actually decreased injunctive norms regarding both condom use and HIV testing and decreased intention to use condoms.

Following the model, empowerment from advertising can take three forms: Message empowerment, Self-medication empowerment and Health empowerment. Overall, the mixed appeal ad yielded the highest scores for all four ad-related variables (credibility, comprehensibility, ad and product evaluation) as well as all three empowerment levels, suggesting that instead of solely providing consumers with information regarding a product’s benefits and use, consumers should also be emotionally involved.

In previous mode tailoring studies participants were asked to indicate their preferred information delivery method (i.e., customization/user-initiated tailoring). However, there is an exceeding likelihood that some participants in the non-tailored comparison conditions still received their personal preferences by chance (i.e., personalization/system-initiated tailoring), thus diluting mode tailoring effects. This study examines this difference between (1) customization, (2) personalization, and (3) unmatched mode preference delivery. By reanalyzing data from a large study, we look at how reclassification of the non-tailored conditions into a personalized or unmatched condition affects the influence of mode tailoring on message processing.

The diversity of media outlets and content become an essential aspect of Indonesia’s new democracy. However, previous research has shown that this diversity has been threatened by the issue of media ownership concentration and conglomeration. Moreover, unlike the FCC in the US that initiated an empirical inquiry into the nature of diversity in the electronic media, the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission does not have any parameter to measure content diversity.

Its celebration “baits” customers into record stores, where they can rediscover, by means of practice, the qualities that differentiate music mediums outside of digital and web-based technologies. I use Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of “habitus” to explain why the synesthetic qualities of music proper to analogue technologies are hard to point out and to commensurate with other mediums.

More specifically, the paper argues that the metamodern (Vermeulen & Akker, 2010) expressions in rural Estonia’s art, architecture, and social movements serve as alternative spaces where the post-Soviet, postmodern urban hegemony and nihilism can be resisted. The utopian hope for a progressive country life expressed in these platforms keeps rural Estonians searching for something they may never find, which is why they never stop the search for it, and act as if (the better) rural life does exist.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It traces the origins and evolution of the term, arguing that the notion of financial literacy is reflective of contemporary neoliberal governmentality. In support of this argument, a close reading is conducted of the entire corpus of The New Times’ articles that include the term financial literacy, from the term’s inception to the present, with special attention paid to the ways in which the meaning of the term has changed over time. Drawing on Thomas Lemke, Wendy Larner, and other scholars of Foucauldian governmentality, this paper concludes that contemporary deployments of the term are reflective of the ascension and hegemony of governmentality. It further suggests that contemporary use of the term serves to naturalize neoliberal values of self-improvement and self-entrepreneurship that are themselves imbricated with a discourse of human capital that underpins neoliberal governmentality.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This paper demonstrates how the social construction of technology (SCOT) and semiotic approaches within science and technology studies help open the black box of rating systems. A preliminary assessment of the utility of these approaches is gleaned from a case study of Uber’s rating system. I identify Uber and its drivers as relevant social groups and search for their multiple interpretations of the rating system. I contend that Uber appealed to its “community guidelines” and design decisions to script the rating system as a form of labor management. Yet, Uber drivers articulated various tactics to resist or game the rating system. This case affords opportunities for considering the interpretative flexibility of online rating systems.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Commonly called “a happiness business,” the coworking movement indicates how telecommuting, or its providence of branded coffee and cool workspaces, may represent a utopia of information work. Given that many coworking users are precarious freelancers however, this utopia is necessarily also an attempt to stitch together a fraying sense of middle-class coherence. Using fieldwork interviews and discourse analysis of coworking materials, I argue that coworking allows us to understand first, an affective politics, namely the reframing of precarity from a structural condition to a state of individual loneliness. Second, it indicates a reengineering of the middle-classed good life, where acts of resilience are described to bring people closer to true happiness. Last, coworking infrastructure materializes these affective conditions through human and non-human factors.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This unfolding visual turn is compelling courts to adapt practices and doctrines that can take into account new modes of producing visual evidence, illuminating the transforming legal status of visual imagery. This paper tackles this development through the case of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, showing how the advent of video in courts is blurring the boundaries between the law and the wider visual culture. In the process, the paper argues that institutions and professions, such as the law, need to take visual forms of knowledge production seriously.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0141,2018,Paper Session,When Nationalism Meets Hip-Hop: Aestheticized Politics of Ideotainment in China,1,"To unravel the dynamics of ideotainment in China, this paper examines the patriotic hip-hop songs from a Chinese youth band that attracted global attention. To put this case in perspective, this paper draws on Althusser’s theory of Ideological State Apparatus to analyze how popular nationalism coalesces with state-led hegemony. Supported by textual and semiotic analyses, it reveals that the state-centric ideology is realized through the interpellation of spontaneous popular expressions and the recourse to local and traditional cultural symbols; and that political power is thereby extended into the private and aesthetic realms. It shows how a global music genre and youth subcultural resources could be co-opted locally to strengthen the state’s ideological control. In the end, this paper critically assesses the limitation of this ideotainment project through the lens of Benjamin’s notions of ""aura"" and ""allegory"", pointing to the risk of hollowing out local cultural symbols for politically didactic ends.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We conducted an online experiment with a between-subjects design. Participants (N = 228) read the same news story, but were told that the news was from an either pro-Republican, neutral, or pro-Democrat news outlet. We found that attributing a news story to a news outlet aligned with an opposing party influenced the perception of news bias, irrespective of the leaning of the story. More importantly, partisans perceived the news to be biased only if they had pre-existing skepticism toward the news outlet. Our findings suggest that cross-cutting exposure (i.e. consuming news from outlets aligned with an opposing party) may not produce desirable outcomes because pre-existing skepticism towards an out-group news outlet can undermine the perceived credibility of the news produced by the outlet.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We analyze the relationship between the far-right counterpublic and the mainstream right-wing based on the election coverage of nine online outlets. We show through topic modeling of 21,919 articles how Breitbart established itself as the counterpublic top-tier outlet for the right-wing, how it covered both topics from the mainstream as well as from the far right, and show that Fox News and Breitbart influence each other’s election coverage, specifically on the topic of immigration. We are thus able to show that Breitbart functions as a bridge between the far-right and the more moderate right-wing. Additionally, we show that that although a connection between Breitbart and the right-wing counterpublic exists, the far right is still fragmented.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Using examples from American religious freedom jurisprudence, I argue that Christian liberalism helps us to better understand the unequal distribution of accommodations for religious groups. The concept also elucidates the tension between claims that Christianity is a generic feature of the American public sphere, as well as a set of beliefs requiring specific state protections. This dual dimension of Christian liberalism helps to account for the ways that so-called neutral religious expressions (such as “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance) go uncontested while other specific theological claims become the basis for religiously-based exemptions from federal law (such as the Hobby Lobby decision, upholding corporations’ right to refuse full compliance with the ACA’s contraceptive mandate).",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

To communicate effectively on social media platforms – that is, to influence the behavior of target groups – may collide with basic principles of civil service information such as transparency, correctness and dialogue. Based on an ethnographic case-study methodology, this article provides a rare on the ground study of an evolving strategy to manage migration via social media.

It uses structural equation modeling to investigate the paths of influence among community attachment variables, nonprofit-specific media use, nonprofit-specific discussion, and individuals’ volunteering and giving behaviors. Results highlight the importance of nonprofit-specific discussion in (1) directly promoting both giving and volunteering behaviors, (2) mediating the influence of nonprofit-specific traditional media use, and (3) translating community attachment into greater nonprofit involvement.

However, little research examined whether and how the participant-initiated actions are connected with each other, whether and how they are connected to the movement leaders, and whether the interconnections among the participant-initiated actions relate to existing lines of divisions within a protest. This study examines 138 participant-initiated Facebook pages established during the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. The analysis shows limited connections among the pages, as well as limited connections between these pages and the leading groups. Nonetheless, pages sharing the same thematic concern were more likely to be connected with each other through page liking and content sharing.

Thus, this study investigates the framing effects of online editorials and their accompanying recommended headlines. A 5×2 (5 editorial frames × presence vs. absence of recommended headlines) online experiment was conducted with adult participants. Results suggest that recommended headlines that share the same frame with the editorial made the respondents perceive the editorial as more credible and influential generally. However, regarding issue-related attitudes and emotions, the additional headlines reinforced the effects of the editorial when the frame’s relevance to the readers was high, but undermined the editorial’s impact when the relevance was low.

We ask whether citizens’ engagement with political news on Facebook motivates their participation with political campaign posts, and we examine whether users commenting on campaign pages trend towards ideologically reinforcing media. Overall, we find comparatively low levels of commenting activity on the official referendum campaigns vis-à-vis the media, and the majority of users (70%) commented only once. Looking at the subset of users commenting on both page types (“cross-posters”), we identify a general spillover effect from media to campaign pages, suggesting a positive correlation between political interest and online participation on Facebook.

Research predominantly stems from North America and Europe. More than two-thirds of studies are based on student samples. Publication outlets are mostly political science and psychology journals, while communication journals only play a minor role. A qualitative analysis shows that two central outcome variables are frequently studied (evaluation of politicians/electoral consequences). Overall, studies generally reveal negative evaluative effects for politicians. However, five central moderators (candidate characteristics and behaviors/prior attitudes/context/scandal type) significantly influence scandal effects.

However, most of previous studies compared either relative exemplar effects or exemplars with base-rate information. In this study, we investigate whether ordinary citizens as “opinion-givers” within a news report are more influential in altering judgments compared to a purely journalistic news reports providing the same arguments. We draw from research on persuasive press inference to predict perceptual effects of both report versions. Furthermore, based on research results suggesting that ordinary citizens might be perceived as a more trustworthy source, we examine whether the integration of vox pops enhances the credibility of a news report, and whether this mediates persuasive effects. In a web-based experiment, we can show that both perceptual as well as persuasive effects are dependent on participant’s populist attitudes and thus their resonance to the “voice of the people.”",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This phenomenon was characterized by the concept of “protest paradigm”. However, with the development of the media environment, and the changes in the social movement field. The media’s representation of the protest became more diversified and complex. Scholars begun to treat the protest paradigm as a variable. The former studies also paid attention to the macro effect, that comes from the media environment. Macau is a Special

By extending the established line of inquiry, this study content analyzed the newspapers from Hong Kong and Macau to examine how the combined multiple factors influence media coverages of Macau’s protests. The preliminary result shows that, when compared with the neutral and prodemocracy media, the conservative media adopted more “protest paradigm” framing strategies to marginalize the protesters. The news tended to be more critical if the protests with more radical tactics. When the protest focused on the controversy political issue, the news coverages didn’t show the feature of protest paradigm clearly. The protest coverage became less negative across time.

To this aim, a retrospective study was conducted among 1,010 emerging adults aged 18 to 25. The analyses showed that online and offline bullying are associated in similar ways with negative outcome measures in the long run, such as being less satisfied with life, having a more pessimistic and less optimistic life orientation, and feeling less resilient. Independent of the form of bullying, the frequency of the victimization during adolescence plays an important role.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0173,2018,Paper Session,"Been Booked, Being Viewed: Effects of Cues on Travel Websites and Mediation Through Social Presence",2,"Nowadays, many travel websites use social proof cues about the users’ activities on the platform to facilitate sales. Two common cues are the number of other viewers looking at a product (i.e., hotel) page and the number of recent reservations. The present study investigated how the social cues influence the viewers’ perception of social presence on the webpage, and how the induced social presence further affects their intention to book the hotel. Specifically, three different serial mediation routes that attitudes, social norms, and perceived scarcity play mediating roles between the induced social presence and the behavioral intention were tested. The results demonstrated a significant interaction effect between the two cues on social presence, and the induced social presence further affected behavioral intention through two serial mediation routes via social norms and via perceived scarcity. The findings extend the social presence literature and provide implication for the online travel industry.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Streamers on these platforms derive their success and revenue from strong social ties with their viewers, prompting investigation into which affordances of these platforms promote effective audience interaction. The proposed study isolates one such affordance – the ‘facecam,’ a secondary video feed of the player’s face – and its relationships to parasocial interaction between player and viewer and the overall enjoyment of the viewer. Anecdotal evidence suggests that facecams facilitate personal connections between streamer and viewer, a hypothesis in line with findings in videoconferencing literature.

This raises the concern that recipients receive like-minded information instead of a broad and comprehensive overview of current events. However, there are limited studies available concerning the actual amount of algorithmically personalized media people use and who uses them. We conducted a representative online survey in Germany to measure a) the (absolute and relative) exposure to algorithmic news based on a new typology of sources and b) user characteristics associated with algorithmic news use. The share of algorithmically personalized sources in total news use is on average 25% (SD = 27%), which indicates a relatively high importance of these sources. Results of a multiple regression model show various factors associated with algorithmic news use, such as demographics, personality traits and general tendencies of media use.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The most popular choice of plot development is then shown, resulting in a construction of the film’s narrative that is comparable to ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’ books of the 80s. CTRLMOVIE thus enables collective viewing and decision-making, which has previously been deemed impractical. This paper describes a comparative, mixed-methods study of anonymized audience choice datasets from CTRLMOVIE screenings, analyzing differences across geographic, sociocultural, media-specific and other parameters to ascertain which characteristics and contexts might determine narrative choices. The final paper will also contain a discussion of the ethics, consequences and scientific viability of using datasets such as these and will lay a foundation for further research.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

At the same time these audiences are becoming more diverse than ever, with increasing recognition that sites need to be inclusive. This paper examines how the visual choices communicators make in designing their online messages via websites impact the sense of ambient belonging, or the sense of belonging to a community or a culture, felt by users of such sites. We report results of an experiment, which presented two content-identical webpages for an introductory computer science course to college-aged participants. The sites differed only in aesthetic features such that one was perceived as masculine while the other was gender-neutral. Our results confirm that young women exposed to the masculine page are negatively affected, reporting significantly less ambient belonging, interest in the course and in studying computer science broadly. They also experience significantly more concern about others’ perception of their gender relative to young women exposed to the neutral page, while no similar effect is seen in young men. These results suggest that gender biases can be communicated through web design, highlighting the need for inclusive communication design for the web.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A major question surrounding the use of these social Q&A communities as a knowledge source is the credibility of users who contribute theses answers (i.e., the knowledge contributors). However, less is known about how people judge the credibility of knowledge contributors. The aim of this study is to investigate how systematic and heuristic cues in social Q&A communities influence the perceived credibility of a knowledge contributor, drawing on heuristic and systematic model and warrant-ing theory.

It is also believed that innovative online venues such as e-petitioning would be new political opportunities for these originally disadvantaged groups. However, the empirical studies on online participation are yet insufficient to support this prominent expectation, while concerns that internet may reinforce the offline political disparity rather than promoting democracy still exists. This study is designated to explore the official e-petitioning website launched 6 years ago in the United States to test whether voices for women and ethnic minorities have been promoted through e-petitioning. 287 successful petitions which have gained enormous public support and reached signature thresholds for governmental responses were investigated.

A 12-Country Study of Protest Participation Inequality in the Arab World,2,"This study investigates the role of the Internet in protest participation in the Arab world. More specifically, we aim to address three important questions: (1) Does Internet news use increase the chances of protest participation? (2) Does the Internet news use amplify or reduce participation gaps that exist among individuals at various socio-economic strata? (3) Does press freedom of a country as a contextual factor shape the role of the Internet in participation gaps? The results based on an analysis of nationally representative multi-country survey suggest that Internet news use for political purposes increases the likelihood of protest participation in the Arab world while it also deepens socioeconomic stratification in participation. However, this intervening role of the Internet is largely shaped by national press freedom. Theoretical implications of these findings for political inequality literature and the practical consequences for the Arab world are discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

However, little attention has been paid on the impact of status updates frequency on psychological well-being, explained by the underlying mechanism of social comparison. Due to the amounts and valence of Likes and comments for one’s posts could be signals for popularity, which signify public acceptance within one’s social environment, it is plausible that individuals may compare the amounts and valence of feedback with others to acquire affirmation on popularity. Yet presentations of others’ favorable images due to positive and strategical online self-presentation often make others’ posts with a great number of Likes and comments, which leads an individual to engage in negative social comparison easily. Therefore, the present study hypothesizes that those who update status more frequently may have more opportunities to engage in negative social comparison about posts’ feedback to evoke envy, which, in turn, undermines individuals’ psychological well-being. And self-esteem might moderate the relationship between status updates frequency and negative social comparison frequency.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

However, the rapid rate of technological change means that the media landscape looks very different from even a decade ago when brands began earnest efforts to build online communities.

Drawing on a survey with 1,811 adolescents we analyze the sociodemographic variables, personality traits, and online usage preferences that characterize teenagers who comparably often talk with parents or peers about online activities. Results show that teenagers who are open and who use a lot of audiovisual material online tend to talk with parents and peers at an above average frequency. Girls and teenagers who use the internet for researching information prefer talking with parents about their online experiences. Teenagers with low agreeableness and conscientiousness as well as heavy internet users prefer talking with peers about what they do online.

What is often left out is the user perspective. We suggest that one of the most fundamental shapers of a user’s perspective on regulation is their own experiences of the sharing economy. A key factor in user experience is perceived fairness. In this contribution, we investigate how the perceived fairness of a platform can impact regulatory desirability among users, based on a survey in 12 European countries. We find that procedural fairness has a positive effect on the desire for regulation, while interactional fairness has a negative one.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Although bystanders (i.e., those observing the incident) could prevent the victim from serious harm, they often remain silent. Based on approaches to explain bystander behavior offline as well as Just World Theory, we aim at investigating the perceptual mechanisms that inhib-it bystanders to help a victim of cyberbullying. Drawing on an online-experiment with 240 partici-pants, we show that an incident containing threats (compared to insults alone) is more likely as-sessed as severe, which in turn leads to a higher willingness to help the victim. Yet, an incident that is evaluated as less severe results in a higher tendency to blame the victim, which in turn may in-hibit bystanders’ social support. Results indicate that victims of seemingly less severe incidents are at risk of being victimized a second time.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The aftermath of attacks are thus unique periods where people’s values may temporarily be shaken. Moreover, social media now offer a platform where such immediate reactions can be observed.
We study this phenomenon in the context of the 2015 Paris attacks. We examine the tweets of French opinion leaders on the French ideal of Laïcité, France’s policy and stance toward immigration and religion, in the immediate and medium-term aftermath of the attacks. We then compare these tweets to public statements these leaders made about Laïcité prior to the attack. We focus on the values they express when defining and explaining the meaning of Laïcité. We code their statements using Schwartz’s (2008) system of values. Preliminary results indicate that terrorist attacks shift the articulation of values toward benevolence and away from conformity, with these shifts dissipating over time.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Bearing much resemblance to Twitter in its initial design, Weibo is often regarded as Twitter’s Chinese counterpart. In this paper, we delineate the historical evolution of Weibo as a social media platform (2009-2017). Rather than focusing on individual case event, we showcase how Weibo evolves over the years in the push-and-pull forces of commercialization, capitalization and political control.
Upon examining the political economy of Weibo, platform interface design and functions, we explore both the technological and socioeconomic dimensions of Weibo. Through a historical periodization of Weibo’s development, our study analyzes Weibo in its relationship with Sina Corporation, in its struggles with profitability and economic viability, and in its journey to define the meaning of the platform amidst the country’s increasingly stringent internet control environment. We argue that how Weibo maneuvers user interfaces and articulates its value as a “platform” to stakeholders, users, advertisers and developers is not only important in unpacking the political and economic tensions but also bears significance understanding the contexts within which Weibo platform emerges and its implications for Chinese society.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Since then, journalists have sought to report on an unpredictable president in an increasingly fractured, foggy, and “fake news” infused news landscape filled with frenetic tweets. This paper will examine how Donald Trump’s tweets and journalistic coverage of these tweets facilitated the rise of Trumpism. It will also evaluate how journalists discursively rely on past events to bolster their cultural authority and to establish themselves as interpretive communities in their coverage of Trumpism. Drawing from 150 Lexis-Nexis articles from leading U.S. media between June 2015 and October 2017 I will identify key historical analogies journalists invoke to make sense of Trumpism. Using critical discourse analysis on select newspaper articles I will evaluate the nominalization and passivization associated with Trumpism.

The study is situated within the empirical context of rural-to-urban migrant workers’ issues. Drawing from the conceptual framework of alternative media and communication for social change, I analyze a local NGO’s community newspaper for migrant workers and an online advocacy media targeting at female migrant workers. Based on semi-structured interviews with editors and migrant worker authors, and textual analysis of the published articles and readers’ responses, I examine the two media’s thematic contents and processes of production and distribution. The two cases present sustainable and organized modes of alternative media production that enable deliberation spaces for migrant workers’ collective expression. Migrant workers’ articulations through alternative media constitute a daily mode of activism and resistance, which is in line with the group’s rising consciousness and demands of rights and justice. The study shows that to provide communal and organizational support could mobilize underprivileged groups to participate in alternative and collective media production for social inclusion and equality. I argue that the conceptualizations of alternative media need to be contextualized, and integrating local politics is crucial to explicate the possibilities of alternative forms of media and uses of ICTs for social change.

2018-0206,2018,Paper Session,Representing Africa in China: Comparing the Maoist and Post-Mao Eras,1,"Based on the visual and textual analysis of China Pictorial magazine in two historical periods (1964-1976 and 2000-2016), this study identifies six key genres of China’s representations of Africa and explores how they have been shaped by the changing global geopolitics. This study finds that, different from western way of seeing Africa, China has presented a general positive image of Africa, especially during the Maoist era. The effort to romanticize Africa in the socialist era is conceptualized as a “socialist gaze” which functions as a counter-representation of the “colonial gaze”. By re-historicizing China’s representations of Africa since the Maoist era, this study aims to expand our understanding of south-south media flow and the Cold War media history.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0207,2018,Paper Session,Towards Spreadable Entertainment-Education: How Transmedia Storytelling and Social Influencers Contribute to Effective Health Interventions,3,"Entertainment-Education (EE) is a communication strategy that uses popular entertainment media to communicate with audiences on topics such as condom use, vaccination, or mental health. Recently, changes in the media landscape have enabled audiences to create and share content themselves. This offers opportunities to reach and engage with target audiences in new ways. Health organizations have experimented with new approaches in order to go viral, but reap mixed results. With spreadable EE, this paper provides an alternative approach that strives to meaningfully embed storytelling in the technical, economic, and social contexts in which audiences consume, create, and (re)circulate media. We advocate collaborating with new creative professionals and influential audience members to create multiplatform story worlds that fit the cultures and preferences of the target audiences and allow for a sustainable kind of audience involvement. As such, this article contributes to the design of spreadable EE interventions.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The results of a national survey (N=544) indicate that, in a nation of avid TV users, newspaper use could be the best predictor of social trust and life satisfaction. However, when controls for social background were entered in the models, all media use variables lost their predictive power. Trust in television news did not moderate the relationships between TV use and social trust and life satisfaction, but was a significant predictor of social trust. The results support previous research that pointed to the flaws in Putnam’s original hypothesis of the negative impact of television use on social capital. Due to the lack of explanatory value of media use variables, this study calls for the reexamination of the use of media use variables in models that predict social capital outcomes.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

2018-0210,2018,Paper Session,Critical Analysis of Transmedia Storytelling of Webtoons in Korean Cinema,1,"Korea has developed a new type of transmedia storytelling as webtoons (web comics) have gained popularity. In Korea, the rapid growth of webtoons has created one of the most unique youth cultures, and the local entertainment industries have depended on webtoons as new sources for their own cultural forms. As several movies, such as Secretly, Greatly (2013), Misaeng (2013), 26 Years (2012), and Inside Men (2015), which were transformed from webtoons, became huge successes, many film directors and television producers intend to continuously develop webtoon-based films and television dramas. By employing media convergence supported by transmedia storytelling as a major theoretical framework, this article historicizes the evolution of Korean films according to the surrounding digital media ecology, driving the change and continuity of the manhwa industry, now focusing on webtoons, over the past 15 years. Also partially developing a textual analysis, it investigates not only the recent emergence of webtoons as the source of transmedia storytelling for Korean cinema, but also the reasons why webtoons reflecting contemporary socio-political milieu become popular resources for local films. It then maps out whether films utilizing transmedia storytelling take a major role as the primary local cultural product in the global cultural market in the 2010s.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Interpersonal political disagreements occur in many contexts, and increasingly online. Although this provides new opportunities for voices to be heard, it presents a need to better understand the influence of such discourse on subsequent communication and behavior. This paper presents findings from an experiment in which participants engaged in a one-on-one online chat with an apparent political opponent, and were assigned to perform an imagined interaction task prior to the chat. Preliminary results suggest that increases in chat-partner assertiveness lead to more negative communication and a bolstering of voting intentions, without having a persuasive effect on beliefs or attitudes. In contrast, negative communication within the chat was reduced when participants imagined interacting with an opposing partisan who shared similar personal characteristics.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study not only showcases a plurality of voices from ethical vegans whom are also companion animal guardians (i.e., “pet owners”), but it also seeks to expand our knowledge of the communicative constitution and function of human-animal relationships as related to individual identity/ies. Thirteen participants were interviewed and data were analyzed using iterative qualitative analysis. Data illuminated propositions of the Communication Theory of Identity (CTI). Identity enhancements were discovered for participants’ personal-enacted identity regarding companion animal adoption and personal-enacted-relational identity regarding companion animal agency and shared, specialized space. An identity gap was also discovered pertaining to personal-enacted identity regarding spaying/neutering and companion animal diets that conflicted with ethical vegan values. However, these were communicatively negotiated via personal-relational identity. These findings illuminate the dynamic and fluid nature of identity for ethical vegans whom are also companion animal guardians. Ethical vegan identity was communicatively constructed as independent of, yet interdependent on, identification as a companion animal guardian in this context, thus, consistent with theoretical propositions of CTI. Findings also reveal how identities are communicatively negotiated among CTI’s four intersecting frames. Implications of these findings are discussed as related to extant theory and research as well as ways that identity and human-animal relationships can be further researched and theorized within communication studies.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In a second step, the canon of theories of interpersonal communication in communication studies is identified. This is the basis for expert interviews with communication trainers. Results show that the Four-Ears-Model by Schulz von Thun dominates the examined trainings. The explorative findings suggest that factors of socialization, like further education programs for the trainers, play a major role in influencing the choice of theories used in communication trainings.

The negative attitude further reduces people’s behavioral intention. Although inconsistent arguments in a post-message discussion decreased people’s pro-message elaboration, this outcome did not contribute to attitude and intention.

Furthermore, this study contributes to ongoing conversations about emotional responses, in addition to anxiety, that play roles in information management processes (e.g., interest, attentiveness, determination).

Using a qualitative content analysis, the present study offers first empirical evidence that this news factor played a crucial role during the 2015/16 US election campaign.

The policy’s near uniform support in the editorials was linked to its carving of a niche for the New Zealand journalistic identity in its traditional role as the fourth estate. This is a politically agentive role which simultaneously affords the disavowal of that agency.

The news media’s caste discourse therefore reveals differing parameters for how Brahmins predominantly experience (and therefore, express) their caste privilege as “culture,” while Dalit-Bahujans experience their caste location as oppression. These scripts of the lived experience of caste, I suggest, create a news episteme where coverage of violence against Dalits becomes a convenient substitute for more critical understandings about the operationalization of caste through institutional power structures, and in particular, elite caste oppressor groups.

I argue that hegemony critique is essential to the study of reactionary discourse on social media in order to fully account for the struggle surrounding immigration and racism. The data set consists of a sample of 1103 tweets clustered around three main hash-tags (#stopinvasione, #norazzismo; and #bastaclandestini ). I apply a multi-layered methodology, including content analysis and thematic analysis, which combined allows the researcher to explore a considerable large data corpus while still being able to perform an in-depth reading of the tweets. The result is a more nuanced understanding of the anti-immigration discourse as well as of the discourse that developed in favor of immigration and in support of a counter march, which was also held in Milan on the same day.",Language and Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0239,2018,Paper Session,A Content Analytic Study of Media Indexing in the Context of Transgender Rights (WORK IN PROGRESS),2,"According to the media-indexing hypothesis first articulated by Bennett (1990), news media discourse on contentious political issues tends to follow the contours of debate among political elites, such that official (usually Congressional) debate “sets the parameters of media debate, establishing the boundaries or agenda of public discussion.” As an additional corollary of this core hypothesis, Bennett further suggested that the inclusion of non-elite voices in news media discourse would nonetheless be constrained in their range of opinions expressed to those viewpoints already circulating within elite debate. This study tests the indexing hypothesis in the context of transgender rights in order to illuminate the dynamics of media and governance that drive both public opinion and policymaking on transgender issues. Preliminary results indicate that the indexing hypotheses does not apply to the contemporary transgender rights context and that the press exerts notable levels of independence from elite political agendas.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0240,2018,Paper Session,‘Girls Don’t Play with Boys’: Online Homosexuality Advocacy in India,1,"In India, homosexuality is a criminal offence, therefore clandestine. Extant research on homosexuality in India demonstrates that criminalization of homosexuality tends to further stigmatize Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning, and others (LGBTQ+) community, a sexual minority group, that has led to the denial of basic access to their fundamental rights like basic access to health care, speech, life and liberty etc. Due to the legal status of LGBTQ+ community, mainstream media often ignores advocacy for this sexual minority group while controlling and manipulating their representation in the dominant discourse. However, with the proliferation of internet, social networking sites (SNSs) have emerged as space for alternative discourse, storytelling, interconnectivity, and knowledge construction while building communities of solidarity. This study examines how SNSs offer a public sphere for the gay rights movement in India.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0241,2018,Paper Session,Together on the Construction of LGBTQ Identity Online Using Memes,3,"In this work in progress, three case studies are presented that address the ways in which internet memes are used by LGBTQ communities for the purposes of identity construction and maintenance. As noted by Gal, Shifman, and Zohar (2017, p. 1699), “[w]hile public discourse (and the personal narratives constituting it) is central to the construction of any collective identity, in the LGBTQ case, it is critical, as the group of origin – the family – is not always relevant to its formation”. Further, the identity unique to LGBTQ centers on the realization that individuals are differentiated from their social and family groups as well as from a kind of life-style or “life narrative” which was expected or anticipated. Social media networks in general enable collective identity formation through the interaction of various publics and the employment and deployment of tools, rules, resources, etc. available on the social network.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0242,2018,Paper Session,“Tranny Surprise” vs. “Tranny Chaser”: How TV Trans Characters Remain a Joke,1,"The mistaken identity scenario is a staple of sitcoms. Although potentially liberating for queer scholars when it questions the visibility of “queerness,” its ability to destabilize heterosexual dominance is debatable, particularly since queer sexual desire remains muted or ignored on television even as queer characters increase. This paper asserts that despite a similar growth in visible transgender roles, comedic scenarios continue to promote inherently transphobic assumptions regarding cis/trans sexual relationships, particularly between cisgender men and transwomen. The sexual explicitness of modern television has promoted a shift from one scenario, the “tranny surprise,” when the transfemale character is rejected prior to a sexual encounter, to another scenario, the “tranny chaser,” when cismale partner is denigrated after a sexual encounter. By utilizing a pejorative term, “tranny,” for each, I highlight how queer sexual desire remains a punchline, reinforcing the “perversity” of trans sexuality and denigrating trans women as voiceless, subhuman sexual objects.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Our findings show that interviewees share onFacebook very curated, episodic content reflecting particular milestones, utilize Twitter for less curated but more frequent news dissemination, and rely on WhatsApp for a constant stream of functional and relational information. They post highly stylized images of the quotidian on Instagram, and reserve the more informal visual content for Snapchat.

2018-0244,2018,Paper Session,Impertinent Mobiles – Effects of Politeness and Impoliteness in Human-Smartphone Interaction,4,"This study aims to reveal first insights into human-smartphone interaction by continuing the paradigm “computers as social actors”. Hence, smartphones are conceptualized as social agents suggested to elicit social responses in their human users. In a laboratory experiment (n = 85) participants interacted with a talking phone which replied to them either politely or impolitely. Participants evaluated this specific phone twice, before and after they had received the phone’s feedback. ANOVA revealed polite phones to be evaluated significantly better than impolite phones. Comparing evaluations before and after the feedback showed that polite phones were revaluated regarding friendliness but not regarding competence. In contrast, second evaluation of impolite phones worsened both friendliness and competence. Furthermore, the gender of the phone’s voice impacted the evaluation: impolite “male phones” were evaluated less positively regarding their competence, impolite female phones were not. Results are discussed as empirical contribution of conceptualizing “smartphones as social actors”.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This article focuses on how Chinese rural and suburban users domesticate mobile social media applications such as WeChat in everyday internet activities, and how mobile social media influence users’ information and communication practices. We take the perspective that examining everyday uses of technology is the most useful approach to understanding the changes brought about by smartphones. By combining data from quantitative and qualitative studies, we find that there are differences in the adoption and use of mobile technologies between Chinese rural and suburban areas, and across different demographic and user groups. Qualitative analysis reveals the dynamic relationships between mobile social media and everyday communication and information practices. We hope to contribute to a shift in understanding the mobile internet as a tool not only for communication but also for information practices, with implications for research on media technologies and for development policy.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0246,2018,Paper Session,Use and Perception of Emoji among University Students in China,2,"This research applies uses and gratifications theory (U&G) to examine the use of emoji in WeChat among university students in China. Emoji enjoys increasing popularity in China with the prevalence of micro-messaging apps, such as WeChat, especially among youngsters such as university students. Emoji has become a new medium to communicate and express emotions in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Although not identified, previous studies have followed the U&G approach to understand emoji in various perspectives (psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, etc.), investigating different variables (including age, gender, cultural background and so on) that affect the use of emoji. As for university students in China, the emoji is playing an important role in their daily online communication. This research, as the title indicates, argues the use and perception of emoji in WeChat. In other words, this paper focuses on two parts of the issue: why and how. The question of why university students use emoji in their online communication looks at both the users and the media content, i.e. emoji itself. We attempt to understand why users choose emoji during their online communication in WeChat and what is the perception or affordance of emoji itself, i.e. the content of emoji affords certain functions or meaning to direct their users behavior. We also examine how emoji is used in WeChat. In other words, we test and argue different determinants of emoji use and perception. Previous studies have found contradictory results on variables that determine the use of emoji or emoticon, such as gender. Fullwood, et al. (2013) believe that there is no difference between genders in the range of emoticons used while Tossell, et. al. (2012) hold research results that identify differences between genders in amount and variety of emoji use. This research however, argues, gender is not the major determinant of divergence in emoji use. It is the chat partners that have a more positive correlation with differences in the frequency and choice of emoji on WeChat. Gender does not constitute a key determinant in emoji use but it causes a huge gap in understanding the content and indication of different emoji in WeChat. Data from this research is drawn from empirical study and experiments with university students in China.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0247,2018,Paper Session,Critical Examination of Studies on Visual and Multimodal Media Frames and Requirements for Content Analyses,1,"Images play an important role in the framing process. This role has been investigated for several years in visual communication research using the term ‘visual framing’. Present visual framing research faces two challenges: on the one hand, it runs the risk, like framing research in general, of being fragmented by a multitude of different approaches and, thus, not generating any theoretical progress. On the other hand, it has to deal with the phenomenon of multimodality and the relationship between texts and images in the framing approach. This paper brings together and critically examines the current state of research on textual, visual, and multimodal media frames. On the basis of different systematic literature reviews of empirical studies, requirements for future content analyses have been developed.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0248,2018,Paper Session,Imagining Big Data: Illustrations of Big Data in U.S. News Articles 2010-2016,3,"Imagining big data’ brings up a palette of concerns about their technological intricacies, political significance, commercial value, and cultural impact. Given its broad and controversial reception, this ambiguous notion inspires different cultural visions. Our paper looks at this emerging arena of public sensemaking. It considers the spectrum of press illustrations that are employed to illustrate what big data are and what their consequences could be. Establishing powerful imagery is both a key journalistic task and a tremendous challenge, undertaken to provide palpable form to an abstract phenomenon and to turn big data into an issue. We collected all images from big-data-related articles published in the online editions of two U.S. daily newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, for our analysis. As the first examination of the visual dimension of big data to date, our exploratory study suggests that big data are predominantly discussed with reference to their areas of application and the people involved in data analytics, often in connection with graphical data visualizations.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0249,2018,Paper Session,"Mapping Social Movements and Exploiting Regional Rhetoric: The U.S. Woman Suffrage Map, 1907-1920",1,"This essay examines maps as a tool for social protest and policy advocacy. I analyze the use of the US woman suffrage map to show how social movements can exploit the rhetoric of place through maps and regional rhetoric. I argue that by visualizing US women's voting rights geographically, the suffrage map legitimized woman suffrage, projected the movement's power, and signaled that their success nation-wide was inevitable. Mapping women’s voting rights gave the suffrage movement legitimacy by exaggerating the influence of the movement on national politics and depicting women’s voting rights as spreading across the nation. The black and white coloring of the map envisioned the equal suffrage states in the US West as more civilized and moral than the nonsuffrage states in the East, which challenged traditional meanings of the West. The map invoked regional rhetoric to suggest that suffrage was destined to expand across the continent.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0250,2018,Paper Session,What You See Is What You Know: The Influence of Involvement and Eye Movement on Online Users’ Knowledge Acquisition,3,"News websites have become a major source of information for citizens in western countries. Although a lot of research focuses on how internet use affects knowledge acquisition little is known about how individual websites are used and how this is connected to knowledge gain. This study focuses on how involvement affects attention and how recipients learn from indi-vidual website use. Therefore, theoretical perspectives of Multimedia Learning Theory and the Cognitive Mediation Model are integrated. To test our assumption, an eye-tracking experiment was combined with a log-file analysis and an online-survey. Our results show that websites are mostly used as a text-based medium, while mult-media elements are rarely used. Users’ involvement influences fixations on the central text at a website. Furthermore, knowledge gain can mainly be explained by the fixation duration of the central text.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In this paper, we draw on the work of those who suggest that mediatization is best deployed as a means of understanding particular social domains and the ways in which institutions and actors orientate their activities towards media. Using association football, or soccer, as our focus we offer a bottom-up perspective using data gathered from research workshops with young people in England. These not only demonstrate the extent to which football is followed through a range of media platforms but also how broader understandings of the game are shaped by these engagements. Moreover, we adapt insights from recent phenomenological approaches to media (Moores, 2013) to focus on the practical, embodied forms of knowledge and habit that shape how football is currently played, followed and debated.",Sports Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0254,2018,Paper Session,Monstrosities and Metaphors in Fantasy Football,2,"In this study, the world of fantasy football is examined through the lens of the ethnography of communication and the utilization of metaphor/cluster analysis. Fantasy football has emerged as a highly popular sports-related activity and has become a multi-million dollar industry. By analyzing two popular fantasy football podcasts, we explore the use of metaphors within the social world of fantasy football. Through an examination of these metaphors, 11 defined metaphor categories emerged. We explored the context in which these metaphors were used to determine the premises needed to employ these terms and meanings. Finally, by analyzing these premises, terms, and meanings, 15 rules for communicative conduct emerged from the data and were found to be integral for shared meaning and understanding within the fantasy football speech community. These 15 rules are the focus of this particular paper. The findings of this study have implications for the examination of fantasy football as unique culture, for the examination of language use on podcasts, and for those aspiring to understand and participate within the fantasy football speech community.",Sports Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study employs a four condition experiment in which participants watched a short sports clip displaying different physiological measures in the corner. The participants were then asked about their perceptions of the clip. Broadly, there was not much difference between groups based on the types of information presented, however, presenting blood pressure information proved to be the most entertaining for audiences. This provides early evidence that the presentation of physiological information during a sporting event can impact feelings of enjoyment, meaningfulness, and perceptions of knowledge of the sport.
