2014-0000,2014,Paper Session,When Self is the Source: Implications of Media Customization on Message Processing,2,"Customization of media technologies makes the users de facto gatekeepers of their own information universe; the user in essence becomes the source of communication. But does this sense of “self as source” alter the way the users process information received via customized interfaces? This paper attempts to answer this question by reporting a between-subjects experiment (N = 146) that examined the effect of self-driven customization (high vs. low self-as-source) on persuasive message processing, as mediated by three major psychological consequences of customization—perceived control, perceived identity, and perceived involvement.
The results indicate that perceived identity is a significant mediator between self-as-source in customization and message processing. Theoretical implications for persuasive technologies, dual process models and the agency model of customization are discussed, followed by practical implications for communicators who wish to incorporate new media technologies into their social influence campaigns.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0001,2014,Paper Session,It’s Not What You Say But How You Say It: Information Asymmetry and Compliance Gaining Online,4,"Proliferation of social media has increased the amount of personal information available about users online, and this information is increasingly available to anyone including advertisers and other (unknown) users. Having knowledge about others creates information asymmetries that can be used strategically to manipulate others. Results from an experiment involving sixty-six (31 male and 35 female) same sex dyads show that beneficiaries of information asymmetry were more successful at getting their conversation partners to comply with requests (42% success rate vs. 9% in the control condition). Conversation analysis indicates that conversation topics did not matter. Rather, the linguistic cues were influential: those participants who used fewer second person pronouns—such as you—were more successful at getting their partner to comply. Additionally, we found gender differences affect the style of conversation, such that females communicated more, used more personal pronouns, and more inclusive language than males.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0002,2014,Paper Session,Are You Scared Yet? Evaluating Fear Appeal Messages in Tweets About the Tips Campaign,4,"In March 2012, the CDC launched “Tips from Former Smokers,” a $54 million national campaign featuring individuals experiencing long-term health consequences of smoking. The campaign approach was based on strong evidence that anti-tobacco ads portraying fear, graphic images, and personal testimonials are associated with attitudinal and behavior change. Yet it was also controversial; critics cited the danger that viewers might reject such intensely graphic messages. Tasked with informing this debate, our study analyzes the entirety of the Tips campaign-related tweets from the Twitter Firehose. We provide a novel and rigorous method for media campaign evaluation, and an empirical test of the Extended Parallel Process Model. Among the relevant Tweets, 76% showed evidence of message acceptance, while 18% exhibited message rejection.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0003,2014,Paper Session,Lost and Found in Translation: Persuasive Effects of Native Language and International Comments on YouTube,5,"Research has emphasized the substantial influence of peer comments in participatory online environments. Based on the social identity model of deindividuation effects, this study attempted to explore mechanisms of users’ identification with anonymous commenters and social influence patterns on YouTube. Specifically, we examined whether comments in receivers’ native language lead to stronger persuasive effects than do comments in another language. A 2x2 between-subjects experiment with a German sample (N = 174) showed an anti-marijuana video along with positive or negative comments in either German or English. Video evaluation was directly affected by comment valence, and viewers’ attitude toward marijuana was influenced by the interaction of comment valence and identification with YouTube writers. Native language did not increase identification and persuasive effects. Instead, participants judged English comments more thoroughly: These were more influential when the valence was positive (against marijuana), while pro-marijuana comments tended to be more persuasive in German.",Persuasion in Social Media Contexts,Communication and Technology
2014-0004,2014,Paper Session,Is Citizen News Alternative? Online News Platforms and the BP Oil Spill,1,"For disasters with a culpable human element like the BP oil spill, alternative media are of heightened importance. With emerging content forums and news practices blurring the distinctions between competing journalistic paradigms, this study helps to illuminate those which best promote alternative ideals. Content analysis was conducted for three different hosts for online citizen journalism. Corporate (CNN’s iReport), alternative (Indymedia), and independent blogs’ news stories on the spill (N=1,566) were coded for sources, links, interactivity, tone, and contestation of mainstream information. This helps determine which type of platform is most likely to cultivate news that does not merely extend the mainstream. This study contributes to concepts of alternative media in an expanding communications environment, and parses out the varying functions of those who produce news at different points on the paradigmatic continuum.",Citizens as Collaborators: Extending the Voices of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0005,2014,Paper Session,"Making Investigative News: Social Network, Collaboration, and Journalistic Autonomy",2,"This study aims to examine Chinese investigative reporters’ social network and cross-institutional collaboration, and to relate them to journalistic autonomy and deviance. We found that investigative reporters in China form a close-knit community. On average, reporters claimed to know about more than thirty colleagues from various media institutions. The top three popular forms of collaboration are to share informants, to share background information on a news topic, and to offer materialistic help. Meanwhile, reporters seem to hold pretty positive thoughts toward such favor exchange behavior, believing that collaboration could bring truth to the public and could facilitate reporters’ investigation. Reporters’ social network size and closeness showed strong predictive power in predicting collaboration frequency but not so much in predicting one’s attitude toward collaboration. And finally, we found that journalists with a close and larger social network tend to be more independent in the process of their news production, but only with limited effects.",Citizens as Collaborators: Extending the Voices of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0006,2014,Paper Session,Open Investigative Journalism and the Reciprocal Panopticon: Citizens as Watchdogs,1,"This paper reports on a study of open journalistic practices, namely crowdsourcing and co-creation, in investigative journalism. The paper introduces the concepts of open investigative reporting and the reciprocal panopticon and analyzes the impact of openness on journalistic norms and power structures in society, drawing on empirical data from seven instances in which crowdsourcing and co-creation were used in investigative journalism. In open investigative reporting, citizens and journalists form a powerful alliance in which citizens monitor the power holders and thus gain agency in the public sphere. Open journalism also provides tools with which citizens and power holders can monitor journalism, thus creating reciprocal dynamics in the modern manifestations of power in panopticonism. While crowdsourcing and co-creation can function as accountability technologies, which have the potential to correct malfunctions in society, due to the limited nature of monitoring, traditional power asymmetries remain strong in the society.",Citizens as Collaborators: Extending the Voices of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0007,2014,Paper Session,Rearranging Repertoires: How User Commentary Contributes to Journalistic Diversity in the Coverage of the Financial Crisis,2,"Does news users’ commentary contribute to widening the diversity of viewpoints represented in the news? This paper comparatively analyzes the interpretations of the current financial crisis in the online coverage of five German newspapers and the subsequent commentary of news users. Using an innovative strategy to identify the interpretative repertoires constructed by news and user frames, it assesses how user commentary deviates from those viewpoints represented in the news. Findings show that user accounts mostly remain within the wider interpretative repertoires offered by the media. However, they utilize media frame fragments rather freely to construct their own views, shifting focus and elaborating upon new aspects. While no consistent alternative repertoires were constructed, users thus valuably complemented the diversity of concerns discussed on news websites.",Citizens as Collaborators: Extending the Voices of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0008,2014,Paper Session,Triggering Participation: Hostile Media and Third-Person Effects on Online Participation,3,"Using a 2x2x3 mixed between-within subjects experiment (N=102), we tested the relationship between perceived media bias on subjects’ likelihood of commenting on a digital news story, as well as the effects of existing reader comments on perceptions media bias. We found that (a) bias is a significant predictor of commenting, and (b) presence of comments lowers self-other differences and perceptions of story bias. Additionally, we found that subjects were more likely to comment on stories they found bias against their position (a form of corrective action), and that subjects were more likely to share and like stories they found biased in favor of their position as a form of promotional action.",Citizens as Collaborators: Extending the Voices of Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0009,2014,Paper Session,"Communicating the “Good Life” via Corporate Social Advocacy: The Amplified Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on Consumer Purchase Intention, Corporate Financial Performance",2,"This research explored the impact of organizational stances on social-political issues as an extension of corporate social responsibility (CSR) theory and research. Specifically, using the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical underpinning and a quasi-experimental methodology, the relationship between organizational stances on social-political issues, termed corporate social advocacy, and consumer purchase intention was explored across three experimental social-political conditions (gay marriage, health care reform, and emergency contraception), six organizational conditions (Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Whole Foods Market, Walmart, Nike, and Hobby Lobby) and one control condition (CSR, in general). Strong support was provided for a predictive relationship between CSA and consumer purchase intention, and the inclusion of CSA data amplified the impact of the regression model in comparison to a control group. Implications for the public relations profession are discussed.",Outcomes of CSR-Related Initiatives,Public Relations
2014-0010,2014,Paper Session,“Will You Join Us?”: The Effects of a Partake-in-Our-Cause (PIOC) Message in Corporate Social Responsibility Campaigns on the Evaluations of a Negatively Publicized Company,4,"The way a business organization responds to negative publicity is crucial because such negative news could affect consumer attitudes towards the company and the brand. The current research attempted to examine the effects of a partake-in-our-cause (PIOC) message in CSR communication on reducing the negative publicity effect. A true experimental design was employed in a laboratory setting to test the main effect of PIOC on the attention to the message, cognitive responses, and company evaluations. We found that a PIOC type of CSR message from a negatively publicized company prompted individuals to increase engagement with the message, reduce negative thoughts, and lower negative evaluations of the company than a non-PIOC type of promotional CSR message.",Outcomes of CSR-Related Initiatives,Public Relations
2014-0011,2014,Paper Session,The Effects of Message Framing and Source Credibility in Cause-Related Marketing,2,"This study aims to create an effective message strategy to participating cause-related marketing based on Prospective Theory and Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). To test hypotheses a 2 (message framing: Gain vs. Loss) x 2 (source credibility: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment was conducted and a total of 259 real consumers were recruited. We found that high- (versus low-) source credibility leads to more persuasive power and positive attitude toward the advertisement. However, message framing did not affect participants’ perceptions on whether the message was positive or negative. Also, the results indicated that there is a significant interaction effect of message framing and source credibility in terms of message persuasiveness.",Outcomes of CSR-Related Initiatives,Public Relations
2014-0012,2014,Paper Session,The Cultural Mediated Moderation Effects of CSR Campaigns: Perceived CSR as a Mediator,2,"This study tested whether the effect of concrete versus abstract corporate social responsibility (CSR) campaign messages on attitudes toward the company and purchase intentions varies by cultural difference (i.e., uncertainty avoidance) and whether such an effect is mediated by perceived CSR. Experimental results revealed the relative advantage of the concrete (vs. abstract) message on attitudes toward the company and purchase intentions among Koreans (vs. Americans) with high (vs. low) uncertainty avoidance. Such effect was partially mediated by Koreans’ higher perceived CSR in response to the concrete (vs. abstract) message. The findings contribute to research on CSR research and cross-cultural campaigns.",Outcomes of CSR-Related Initiatives,Public Relations
2014-0013,2014,Paper Session,"@todayin1963: Commemorative Journalism, Digital Collective Remembering, and the March on Washington",2,"This study uses content analysis and social network analysis methods to examine NPR’s novel use of Twitter to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, including the implication of that coverage on collective remembering of the event. Specifically this study explores the extent to which NPR’s coverage followed “conventionalized” patterns of traditional news coverage, including the “protest paradigm,” which obscure the specific civil rights demands at the heart of the march. Twitter’s social network data also make it possible to visualize and examine the audience’s active participation in collective remembering, and whether that participation changes which aspects of the coverage – and the march – are ultimately most salient for collective memory retrieval. However, the “most influential” Twitter accounts in the network that developed around the @todayin1963 coverage that this study focuses on are among those institutions and individuals who have traditionally had more cultural authority over collective memory. Thus, the data end up challenging the extent to which Twitter has altered those power structures that determine whose memories of important historic events dominate, and whose do not.",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0014,2014,Paper Session,For That Forgetful Memory: Ten-Year Anniversary Coverage of SARS in Mainland China and Hong Kong,1,"The 2003 SARS crisis was an epidemic that went far beyond a health issue. This study examines 10-year anniversary coverage of SARS in mainland China and Hong Kong. Specifically, in the context of a past public health crisis, this study seeks to explore how media frames the SARS outbreak in anniversary coverage, what differences exist in coverage patterns in different societies, and how those discrepancies may influence the public's collective memory differently. Analysis of 344 newspaper articles from Hong Kong and two cities in mainland China (Beijing and Guangzhou) reveals both quantitative and qualitative differences between mainland China and Hong Kong's 10-year anniversary coverage of SARS. By presenting how a single past crisis was portrayed differently in two societies, this study provides a framework for future investigations into the mediated past and the journalistic construction of mediated collective memory.",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0015,2014,Paper Session,"Unmasking Title IX on Its Fortieth Birthday: The Operation of Women’s Voices, Women’s Spaces, and Sporting Mythnarratives in the Commemorative Coverage of Title IX",2,"As society’s storytellers, journalists often draw upon a standard set of archetypal forms to convey all of the day’s news to their readers. This study considers the practice of commemorative sports journalism, in particular how (and by whom) the stories surrounding Title IX’s fortieth anniversary were constructed at two of the nation’s leading sports news outlets. Drawing from a combination of narrative and critical discourse analysis grounded in hegemonic theory, we contend that ESPN and Sports Illustrated shifted away from the traditional battle-of-the-sexes narrative; the end result was a celebratory women-centric model, one that offered progressive ways of understanding Title IX but sometimes fell prey to flaws associated with what White (2009) has called the “content of the form.”",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0016,2014,Paper Session,"“Everything Old is New Deal Again”: U.S. Media Remember the Depression and New Deal, 2008-2010",1,"Viewing journalism as a key site for the construction of collective memory, this paper examines how US news media employed historical analogies to the Great Depression and New Deal as the 2008 recession unfolded. News provided space for competing liberal and conservative claims about the lessons of the 1930s for contemporary policy; journalists also remembered the Depression--figured as a time of frugality, common purpose, and a simpler lifestyle--in order to guide behavior during economic hard times. Newfound attention to the New Deal did not, this paper argues, effect consensus around the importance of government involvement in the economy. Liberal calls for a new New Deal met with conservative attacks on the first New Deal, and calls to emulate the values of the Depression resonated with a cultural politics of personal responsibility, implying that the nation’s economic well-being rested on whether or not individual Americans lived within their means.",The Past Brought Into the Present: Collective Memory and Journalism,Journalism Studies
2014-0017,2014,Paper Session,Tradition Meets Immediacy and Interaction: The Influence of Social Media on Journalism Practices,2,"Journalists in Western liberal democracies face similar challenges in
melding existing, hierarchical models of media production with emerging communications technologies where knowledge, expertise and authority are networked and distributed. This paper examines the attitudes and approaches of a select group of digital journalists in Canada to the impact of digital media on journalism and professional constructs of the journalist.
It is based on expert interviews with nine leading senior online news
managers and journalists from Canada’s principal news organizations, with a focus on the growing influence of social media, and the professionals’ subjective, experience-based understandings of the current changes in journalism. The interviewees demonstrated a tacit understanding of a shift away from the traditional role of gatekeeper towards a shared ecosystem of news and information. While journalism was conceived as more of a collaborative enterprise, with interviewees seeking to adapt and benefit from a more participatory media environment, the journalists also expressed the occupational boundaries
of the profession as a way of rearticulating their authority.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies

2014-0019,2014,Paper Session,Chinese Journalists’ Discursive Weibo Practices in a Spin-Off Journalistic Sphere,2,"This study examines Chinese journalists’ Weibo practices through analyzing 2,659 journalist Weibo postings. Past studies indicate that Western journalists generally “normalize” their postings on social media to fit their professional norms and practices, but this issue is much more complicated in China. Findings of this study suggest that Chinese journalists’ Weibo practices are influenced by offline discursive journalistic discourses that include four components: party press, professionalism, market economy, and Confucian intellectual. As Weibo has become a major news channel in China, this study takes journalist Weibo as a “spin-off journalistic sphere” where several boundaries are blurred. Journalist Weibo is both a private sphere and public sphere. Journalists operate on Weibo as both citizens and professionals. And journalists move from the backstage of news production to the front stage of news delivery. The changes offer opportunities for uplifting journalistic autonomy, but findings show that the official control is still tight.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies

More media organizations are using social media to engage with their publics in innovative ways. This study evaluated the perspectives of viewers regarding “Stay Tuned.” Through an online survey and in-depth interviews (N=7), viewers considered the audience of “Stay Tuned,” the topics and format of the show, their involvement and engagement with the show, their learning about show topics, and their overall evaluations of the program. The researchers also sought to validate “trustee networked journalism,” a model that seeks to build on public and civic journalism efforts by supporting journalism that not only addresses community concerns but also empowers community members to act by ensuring that their voices are represented in media content.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies
2014-0021,2014,Paper Session,Social Media Guidelines for Journalists. An Investigation Into the Sense and Nonsense Among Flemish Journalists,2,"This study investigates how Flemish journalists experience the sense and nonsense of social media guidelines, focusing on rules that prescribe their behaviour on Twitter. Analysis of 20 in-depth interviews demonstrates that the majority of Flemish journalists find the introduction of rules concerning the use of Twitter unnecessary. The argument heard most often is that the journalist’s common sense should be enough to deal with the platform in the proper way. A number of journalists even find the rules a curtailment of individual freedom. Particularly guidelines concerning specific formal requirements – such as mentioning the employer in the Twitter bio and/or account name, or the requirement to only use one account – encounter resistance. Based on these findings, the tweeting journalists seem to indicate that they themselves are able to both adapt their use of social media to fit traditional professional norms and adapt those norms to fit the media logic of the Twitter platform.",News and Networks: Journalists' Social Media Use,Journalism Studies
2015-0000,2015,Paper Session,"Anger, Mood Management, and Attraction to Violent Video Games",1,"The motivations for playing violent video games are not well understood. People use media to regulate their moods, and they may be attracted to violent video games in order to manage angry moods. Participants were induced to feel a negatively-valenced or positively-valenced emotion: anger, tenseness/jitteriness, sadness, or happiness. Participants then read descriptions of eight fictitious games (four violent, four non-violent); they then rated how much they wanted to play each game on an 11-point Likert scale, chose one game to play, and indicated the reason for their selection.

A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of mood induction on attraction to violent games, and pairwise comparisons revealed that angry participants were more attracted to violent games. Angered participants were also more likely to select an anger-based mood management explanation for their game choice.

This research supports a mood management based explanation for the attraction of violent video games.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0001,2015,Paper Session,Gendered Self-Concept: What Does It Reveal About People’s Preference for Violent Video Games?,2,"There is a paucity of knowledge on the gender gap in preference for violent video games. Females have consistently been shown to report less of a preference in this regard than males. This study focuses on the gendered self-concept in a sample of gamers for the purpose of investigating their self-reported attraction to games of violence. We tested the assumptions that there is a link between negative attributes of the male gender role and violent game preference and, further, that this link is mediated by physical aggression. The results of an on-line study (N=335) largely confirmed these assumptions and further revealed that the mediating effect of physical aggression was moderated by gender. The present study gives support to the assertion that gaming motivation cannot be analyzed solely on the distinction between genders. Rather, the gendered self-concept has to be taken into account for elucidating the reasons for which people take a preference for violent video games.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0002,2015,Paper Session,"High-Risk Gameplay: Effects on Arousal, Presence, Attraction, and Altruism",1,"Violent video games are frequently cited as holding strong negative effects for their users. In this study, massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) were used to assess arousal in high pressure, violent, group versus group settings. A total of 298 players of two popular MMORPGs were surveyed to determine the impact of their perceived level of arousal, among high-risk and low-risk games, on group attraction, negative affect, and altruism. High-risk games refer to games where participants risk losing their equipment, items, currency, and levels in player versus player scenarios, which are not at risk of loss in low-risk player versus player scenarios. The results indicate that high-risk games hold significant influence over a number of these factors, both positive and negative, and offer evidence contrary to popular claims of violent media which cite that they may inhibit pro-social action and positive outcomes. Further implications and limitations are discussed.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0003,2015,Paper Session,Interactive Experience and Identification as Predictors of Attributing Responsibility in Video Games,2,"This study examines whether the interactive nature of video games affects how players who portray a violent character attribute responsibility for the actions of their character. Through an experiment, we tested the hypothesis that identification with the main character in Grand Theft Auto IV mediates the effect of interactivity on attributions of responsibility for the main character’s anti-social behavior. Using the notion of the fundamental attribution error, we demonstrated that those who actually played the game, as opposed to those who simply watched someone else playing it, identified with the main character. In accordance with the fundamental attribution error, those who played the game interactively and came to identify with the main character attributed the responsibility for his actions to external factors such as “living in a violent society”. In contrast, those who did not interact with the game attributed responsibility for the character’s actions to his personality traits.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0004,2015,Paper Session,Value Threat Can Make Pacifists Oppose Violent Video Games,4,"Public discussions about the harmfulness of violent video games are often held in the aftermath of violent felony. Psychologically, these situations are characterized by a threat to the moral value of nonviolence. In this paper we present two studies showing that value threat can motivate people to support political actions against violent video games. This effect is moderated by individual differences in pacifism, and partially mediated by selective exposure to scientific evidence for the harmfulness of violent video games. The findings of both studies are in line with the value protection model and shed light on how the motivation to protect sacred values can translate into political mandates. Implications of the present findings are discussed with regard to the psychological processes underlying value protection and add to a better understanding of the violent video games debate.",Preferring and Responding to Video Game Violence,Game Studies
2015-0005,2015,Paper Session,Best Practices in Instructional Risk Communication: The IDEA Model for Effective Message Design,4,"Much instructional communication research published to date examines such communication that occurs in conventional classroom contexts. Instructional communication also may occur in other contexts. This analysis contributes to that growing body of literature by examining instructional communication in the context of risk and crisis messages. More specifically, this study employed the IDEA learning cycle model to design and test a television news report about a contaminated food product. The researchers compared affective, cognitive, and behavioral learning outcome results reported by viewers of the IDEA model message (treatment) with those of viewers that watched the status quo (control) message. IDEA model message viewers reported significantly higher perceptions of message effectiveness (affective and cognitive learning), as well as behavioral intention (cognitive and behavioral learning) than control message viewers. The study confirms the utility of the IDEA model for designing effective instructional risk messages and for extending instructional communication research into such contexts.",Putting Theories to the Test,Instructional & Developmental Communication

College students completed a survey in two different studies and results indicated teacher confirmation significantly influences attitudes toward communicating with an instructor, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control predicted 58% of the variance in students’ behavioral intention to communicate with instructors in study 1 and 72% of the variance in study 2. This study concludes with both theoretical and practical implications that explain the powerful possibilities of using the theory of planned behavior in the instructional communication context and how instructors can effectively influence students’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control through confirming communicative behaviors.",Putting Theories to the Test,Instructional & Developmental Communication

A survey of 881 university students found that mothers, followed by educators and fathers, were the most encouraging VAS source. The most frequently cited message type was students’ fit (abilities/skills). The second most frequent encouraging messages provided career details. Mothers often guided children to follow their passion. Teachers/ professors mostly gave career detail messages. Friends frequently provide discouraging messages. FGCS identified teachers/professors as the most influential VAS source. Males were more confident of their career goals.

2015-0009,2015,Paper Session,Digital Inequality and Second-Order Disasters,1,"This article investigates whether new communication technologies can mitigate the consequences of disasters and disaster recovery for affected populations. We pay particular attention to questions of social inequality and how it intersects with digital inequality. Drawing on a long-term ethnography with affected communities recovering from Typhoon Haiyan that hit the Philippines in 2014 triggering a massive humanitarian response, we observe that digital inequality can amplify social inequalities leading to a ‘second order disaster’. This refers to humanly perpetuated disasters that can even surpass the effects of the natural disaster. The fact that some participants are recovering at a rapid pace while others are languishing behind represents a deepening of social inequalities. Those already relatively better off have access to a richer media landscape which they are able to navigate often reaping significant benefits. By contrast, the more disadvantaged participants have access to a diminished media landscape and are less likely to take advantage of any opportunities. Rather than democratising opportunities digital media exacerbate social inequalities by heightening the life chances for the better off, whilst leaving the poorer participants further behind.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0010,2015,Paper Session,Mapping Political Discourse of the Iranian Green Movement,2,"Recognizing the creative political communication strategies initiated by the Iranian Green Movement in June 2009 following disputed Presidential election results is imperative in broadening current narrow conceptualizations of “Arab spring” protests. Our analyses map the character of this discourse as creative, in its strategies, and as transnational, in terms of language, distribution, and gendered expectations. Despite emphases in western media on the prominence of digital media in mobilizing activism, the Green Movement worked through a variety of communications approaches, as versatile as traditional sweet desserts concocted in commemoration of the Tragedy of Karbala inscribed with political statements in cinnamon powder, to graffiti on bus sides, street curbs and walls posting marg bar khamnei (death to Khamnei), and resistance slogans written on national currency. With this latter illustration of money stamped with anti-regime messages such as green victory signs, we consider how the material bill serves as a site for resistance against state-controlled artifacts, re-appropriated as symbolic currency in political protests.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0011,2015,Paper Session,Placemaking as Praxis: Connectivity and a South Lebanese Village,1,"This study reflects a recent interdisciplinary concern with social production(s) of spatiality, including within communication and media studies (Gieryn 2000; Warf and Arias, 2008; Falkheimer and Jansson 2006; Jansson 2009). It situates place-making as communicative praxis, a thought-action nexus focused on communicating for social and/or political change. Drawing upon historical and ethnographic research of a village in south Lebanon, I trace goals of place-making-as-communicative-praxis that I encountered within face-to-face and mediated discourses among translocal Lebanese about the means and ends of communication. Delineating an emergent mode of communicative praxis oriented toward “being connected,” or associating via a technological device, I note changes over time in translocally shared goals of communicative/connective praxis, as well as changes in the broader communicative values these goals reflect (for instance, communicative values of visibility, representation, or participation). I describe relationships between these shifts in goals and values of praxis and observed processes of place-framing, identity, and memory practices related to the village.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change
2015-0012,2015,Paper Session,The Content Analysis of Song Sequences in Bollywood Cinema,2,"Bollywood research on the impact of song sequences has slowly emerged over the past decade. In this paper, we utilized extensive content analysis for the first time to compare song sequences with non-song sequences in popular Hindi films in order to map out the impact of liberalization on these sequences within the context of globalization. Given scholars oft-repeated arguments that song sequences represent the essence of Bollywood cinema and provide soft-power appeal, we analyzed those found in 61 years of top-grossing films – one film per year – to identify any structural changes that might impact this appeal. Overall, the data indicated that song sequences have been utilized primarily as vehicles for romantic and sexual content during the 61 year period, and have featured significantly less violent, criminal, political, and geographical content than non-song portions of these films. We conclude that Bollywood song sequences will most likely continue to function as semi-autonomous vehicles for the presentation of Indian romantic content, particularly as part of various soft-power campaigns.","Discourse, Disasters, and Place",Global Communication and Social Change

Discussing Ethical Challenges of Visual Everyday Communication",2,"Transformations of media technology bring about new communicative practices that challenge existing ethical and moral norms and demand for continuous renegotiations and reconfirmations of what is considered responsible and appropriate. So far, the scientific discourse on visual ethics has mostly focused on visual research ethics and the ethical norms within professional fields of mass-media production, neglecting ethical and moral dimensions of mundane visual practices. The paper illustrates the necessity of a critical engagement with “ethical practices” in the field of visual everyday communication, using various areas of conflict regarding the production, distribution, and use of images (e.g. non-consensual photo sharing, reproduction of visual stereotypes in selfies) as starting points for the discussion. Overall, rather than providing obligatory normative guidelines for ethical visual behavior, the paper identifies multiple dimensions of ethical considerations and draws implication for future research.",Advances in Visual Communication Studies: New Challenges and New Frameworks,Visual Communication Studies

This study also suggests that replacement visuals contain three variations, with possible different levels of structural complexity. The modified typology aims to exhaust all structurally different pictorial metaphors and to create a shared set of terminologies in future studies of visual metaphor. An experimental study on consumer elaboration is proposed to test the validity of the modified typology. set of terminologies in future studies of visual metaphor.

2015-0015,2015,Paper Session,A Rubric for Transcultural Visual Media Production,1,"The purpose of this project was to create a rubric from which researchers and filmmakers can begin producing media different from the existing English language, jargon-laden, instructional videos currently in use in the American healthcare industry. From this rubric, one video detailing a clinic visit was produced, screened for a diverse audience and evaluated for its efficacy. This video utilized only images to convey information in an attempt to circumvent the confusion that may result while viewing media in a foreign language. The details of the video’s screening and feedback sessions are included in a separate paper. This paper focuses on the video production rubric and the visual communication theories that provided its framework. The overarching strategy behind this production guide was to create media that was more comprehensible to a culturally diverse viewership by excluding the use of some representations (such as verbal or written language, symbols, graphs or diagrams) because their meanings are arbitrary and culturally assigned. Instead, this rubric recommends presenting procedures in as direct and uncomplicated a manner as possible. To reduce the tedium of such a straightforward approach, the resultant video was structured as a narrative involving characters that model appropriate and inappropriate behavior, allowing for the occasional opportunity for physical comedy. This paper lists each of the formal filmmaking strategies considered in this rubric (shot composition, editing, mise-en-scène, representation, and casting) and details the workability of these tactics during a film shoot.",Advances in Visual Communication Studies: New Challenges and New Frameworks,Visual Communication Studies

Impartiality is the cornerstone of principles of public service broadcasting at the BBC and other broadcasters modeled on it. However, the paper suggests that in the case of the BBC, it is principally put into practice through juxtaposing the positions of the two main political parties – Conservative and Labour. This is the case despite the news organization’s commitment to representing a broader range of opinion.

Evidence of mediatization was stronger on the most commercially driven bulletins – far higher than typically found in first order elections – with an overwhelming emphasis on the game frame and a more interpretive approach in live and edited formats than the most public service orientated broadcaster (e.g. BBC). However, in more qualitative analysis we found the BBC – notably in its use of vox pops – pursued a more mediaitzed approach than at first glance. Developing a close-textual analysis of how broadcasters reported party campaign launches – representing what we call key “mediatized moments” – we argue a more qualitative approach to assessing the tug of war between media and political logics can complement comparative quantitative studies about mediatized politics.",Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies

This study aims to document these trends and consider their effects on news content and American politics. Using decades of archived television transcripts and print and online articles, two types of content analyses are performed identifying (1) aggregate polling references using computer-aided methods, and (2) the kinds of polls mentioned and their sponsors using a hand-coded subset of New York Times articles over three election years (1984, 1996, and 2012). In contrast to claims that news has become increasingly poll-driven, results indicate surprising consistency over time and a decline in pure horse-race polling relative to surveys about policy issues and approval ratings.

We examine this question for Dutch parliamentary election campaigns between 1998 and 2012 on the basis of content analysis and survey data. Convergence on dominant issues in the media increases a party's electoral support indeed, especially in combination with diverging issue positions. In line with issue ownership theory, a party wins at the elections if it succeeds in getting more media attention for its issue positions than its competitors on issues that receive more media attention than in the previous campaign. However, holding on to issue positions on owned issues may pay off less than when strategically altering issue positions to attract voters.",Covering Politics: Perspectives on Political News Around the World,Journalism Studies

This includes withstanding attempts of social engineering aimed at manipulating people into divulging confidential information. However, many users are lacking awareness of the risks involved with, for example, password security. In a field survey that tested reciprocal behavior in social interactions, 1,208 participants were asked to reveal their personal password. More than one third of the participants shared their password with an unknown interviewer. In line with the social norm of reciprocity, people were more willing to do so when they received a small incentive (i.e., a piece of chocolate) before they were asked to reveal personal information. Elicitation was even more successful when the incentive was given right before asking for the password. The results, including moderating factors (e.g., age, gender), are discussed in the light of security awareness of ICT users and the mechanisms of psychological persuasion.",Framing and Logics Surveillance and Privacy,Communication and Technology

The logic of connective surveillance is constituted by a collection of strategies by which distributed social movements may be proactively and efficiently monitored by exploiting the latent surveillance capacities of centralized digital communications networks. These strategies dramatically reduce the costs of surveillance, enable monitoring of entire populations, and facilitate retroactive surveillance of networks and individuals.

2016-0004,2016,Paper Session,How the Language Style of Small Claims Court Judges Does Ideological Work,2,"Small claims courts were created to help ordinary people settle small disputes quickly and cheaply. To make non-lawyer folks feel comfortable, small claims trials were designed to relax legal rules and be relatively informal. A consequence of the justice system’s commitment to informality is that small claims trials exhibit significant variation. A small claims trial in Court A with Judge X can be quite different from a trial in Court B with Judge Y. After overviewing the different ways language/discourse styles and ideology have been conceptualized, we provide background on small claims court and describe the data. The centerpiece of this paper is an analysis of three cases taken from judges in different small claims courts. We show that judges vary in how they: (1) open a trial and frame what they will be doing, (2) announce and justify their decision, and (3) question litigants and solicit their stories. In concluding, we suggest how the style manifested by a judge accomplishes ideological work, instantiating different understanding of justice and what a reasonable relationship between ordinary disputants and the state should be.","Language Use in Small Claims Court, Public Meetings, Consultations for Over-the-Counter Medicines, and Health Information Consumers' Online Comments",Language & Social Interaction

Taking a discursive approach to energy system transformation highlights the importance of understanding how communication and discourse contribute to shifts in policy, culture, and norms. Using Cultural Discourse Analysis (CuDA) (Carbaugh, 2007), we identify cultural discourses of community identity and analyze how they are leveraged within public participation at city council meetings regarding municipalization, examining how Boulder’s “progressive” “commitments” to be an “innovative” “leader” are manifested in citizens’ testimonies in support and opposition of forming a municipal utility. Following the contours of these cultural discourses can provide insight into energy system transformation, interactional dynamics of public meetings, and design of culturally-appropriate public meetings.","Language Use in Small Claims Court, Public Meetings, Consultations for Over-the-Counter Medicines, and Health Information Consumers' Online Comments",Language & Social Interaction

Yet, posts and conversations shared by health information consumers online, in unstandardized format, are not readily actionable for interpretation and decision-making. This study extends prior research on the use of natural language as a predictor of consumer attitudes and provides a link to the decision-making by evaluating the predictive role of uncertainty indicators expressed in natural language. Analyzed data included free-text comments and structured scale responses related to information about skin cancer prevention options. The study identified natural-language indicators of uncertainty and showed that it can serve as a predictor of decisional conflict. The natural indicators of uncertainty reported here can be used to facilitate the monitoring of health consumer perceptions about cancer prevention recommendations and can inform communication campaign planning and evaluation.","Language Use in Small Claims Court, Public Meetings, Consultations for Over-the-Counter Medicines, and Health Information Consumers' Online Comments",Language & Social Interaction

As most research about CSR has been performed in a consumer setting, the goal of this study was to gain an insight in the way in which business-to-business organizations communicate about their CSR initiatives. Qualitative interviews were conducted with CSR experts who work in or for business-to-business organizations. Participants (N = 16) were asked to elaborate on whether or not the same characteristics of CSR communication as described in business-to-consumer literature are relevant in their specific business-to-business context. According to the CSR experts, CSR is not about supporting social causes anymore. Therefore, supporting social causes that fit the organization, is not considered to be CSR anymore either. Rather, participants of this study suggest an integrated approach to CSR, which has come to be known as strategic CSR. Strategic CSR is designed for creating business value and positive social change, and it is embedded in everyday business culture and processes, so CSR initiatives should be designed and implemented at the strategic level. As a logical result, CSR communication is not seen by the participants as a disconnected communications topic.

Employing theoretical frameworks in CSR communication and paradox management, this study aimed to examine how luxury brands employed linguistic and rhetorical devices to communicatively navigate the CSR-luxury paradox online. Qualitative content analysis using a linguistic approach conducted across 43 luxury brand websites revealed that the luxury sector employed active, long-term paradox management strategies to discursively navigate the CSR-luxury paradox online, showcasing sophisticated understanding of paradox management. Nevertheless, some brands lapsed into reactive short-term strategies such as repression and reaction-formation.

Findings show that participants considered unscripted video with higher views as most credible. YouTube use was a moderating factor in this relationship. Implications are discussed.",Perceived Credibility Online,Communication and Technology
2017-0000,2017,Paper Session,Cognitive Dissonance’s Effects on Biased Processing of Counterattitudinal Messages as Predicted by Value-Relevant Involvement,1,"This study tested the proposition that the Cho and Boster (2005) value-relevant involvement (VRI) measure can be used to indicate which attitudes are related to the self-concept. Cognitive dissonance theory was used to derive predictions about how VRI would moderate the relationship between the extent to which a message is counter-attitudinal and various indicators of biased processing. 285 students were exposed to one of two messages about a potentially involving topic and the hypothesized outcomes were recorded with an online survey. The data were largely consistent with VRI as an indicator of an attitude being related to the self-concept as well as VRI moderating biased processing outcomes including perceiving bias in the source, disliking the source, and the belief that the source’s supporters have been misled.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

Study 1 (N = 455) confirmed the process model and further found a visual attenuation effect that positive visual images reduced loss framing perception. Study 2 (N = 424) replicated the general findings in Study 1 as well as found motivation matching effect where emotions were better discerned as their motivational direction, rather than valence.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems
2017-0002,2017,Paper Session,Effectiveness of Message Targeting Strategies for Media-based Antistigma Interventions,3,"Stigmatization is common for people with a disability and health problems, and has tremendous negative effects. Mass media play a huge role in shaping our attitudes towards these individuals. The current study tests the assumption that ‘targeted’ media messages (i.e., portrayals of exemplars that match relevant audience characteristics) are more effective in reducing stigmatizing attitudes than unmatched messages. A 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 full-factorial experiment was conducted, in which 498 respondents were presented a print magazine cover that was manipulated with regard to sex congruency (exemplar’s sex congruent vs. non-congruent with recipients’ sex), occupational context (matched vs. unmatched), hierarchy (same vs. superior status), and type of disability (depression vs. paraplegia). Findings indicate only partial support fort our hypotheses. Destigmatizing effects emerged particularly as interactions of recipient-exemplar sex congruency and same hierarchical status. Further results and implications for non-stigmatizing journalism and strategic anti-stigma communication will be discussed.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems
2017-0003,2017,Paper Session,Affective Persuasion of Comparative Advertisements: Interplay Between Context-Induced and Ad-Induced Affect,2,"Both the advertising context and the advertisement itself are able to eliciting emotional feelings. This study conducted a 2 2 2 between-subjects experiment to investigate the interplay between context-induced and ad-induced affect on the effects of a comparative versus a non-comparative advertisement. The results showed that there were significant three-way interaction effects on participants’ ad and brand attitudes. In the condition of positive context-induced affect, participants preferred the comparative ad to the non-comparative ad when ad-induced affect was positive, but expressed similar responses to both types of ads when ad-induced affect was negative. In the condition of negative context-induced affect, participants expressed more favorable responses to the ad that elicited positive affect. This study is believed to provide both theoretical and practical implications to research of advertising and affective information processing. Directions for future studies are also discussed.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems
2017-0004,2017,Paper Session,The Effects of Social Norms and Value-Relevant Involvement on Information Processing and Behavior,5,"Empirical evidence demonstrates the impact of social norms on behavior and the factors that strengthen or attenuate the relationship. This study expands existing literature by examining how people respond to social normative information when recipients are presented with either a value-relevant or a non-value-relevant message. Results from an experiment indicated perceived injunctive norms mediated the relationship between descriptive norms and behavioral intent among people exposed to the value-relevant message, and moderated the relationship among people exposed to the non-value relevant message. The results did not show an effect of value-relevant messages on information processing nor did value-relevant messages moderate the relationship between descriptive normative information and behavioral intent. The findings help explain the conditions under which social norms influence action. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems
2017-0005,2017,Paper Session,Accessibility of Personal Norms Predicts Intent to Practice Proenvironmental and Prosocial Behaviors,4,"Existing theories, such as value-belief norm theory and extensions of the theory of planned behavior, propose that behaviors with a moral or ethical dimension are consistently predicted by personal norms -- our feelings of moral obligation to engage in a behavior or make sacrifices in order to protect cherished objects or states of being. Data from this study supported the hypothesis that (1) personal norms that are more, rather than less, accessible (available in memory) are associated with greater intent to practice pro-environmental and prosocial behaviors among those generally pre­disposed to enact them, and (2) accessibility of personal norms perceptions predicts intentions beyond the influence of the perceptions alone. Preliminary findings indicate reasonable construct validity for the personal norm accessibility measure and suggest that those who seek to increase these behaviors might reasonably pursue methods of enhancing the accessibility of related personal norms among individuals who possess them.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

We compare Black and White adolescents because prior research has suggested that Black and White adolescents often show different magnitudes of media effects. As social media use about television increased, so did the relationship between television exposure and attitude toward alcohol and aggression for both Black and White adolescents. This moderation was also present for the relationship between exposure and perceived injunctive norm for White adolescents but not for Blacks. Future research should further examine social media in the context of traditional media effects.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

The results showed that both descriptive and injunctive normative messages have mediated main effects on behavioral intentions in both samples. A three-way interaction among perceived injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and group orientation on behavioral intentions was found in both national samples with collective group orientation enhancing normative effects. Findings suggest the need for culturally-grounded and audience-driven approaches to communication of social norms as well as building cultural concepts into theories of social norms.",Top Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication

Despite this, people are often prejudiced against it. In order to better understand the nature of this antagonism, the present study investigated the role of Social Dominance Orientation as one potential source of resistance. Across three studies, the direct and mediated impact of SDO on both self-reported and behaviorally-indicated dialogic engagement was assessed. Results provide evidence that SDO supports a series of contextually-relevant beliefs and social evaluations that, in turn, help prejudice participants against dialogue with an African-American woman describing her experiences living through Hurricane Katrina.

2017-0010,2017,Paper Session,Intergroup Anxiety and Willingness to Accommodate: Exploring the Effects of Accent Stereotyping and Social Attraction,2,"Guided by communication accommodation theory (Giles, 2008), the current experimental study examined the direct and indirect effects of accent stereotyping on U.S. American native English speakers’ (N = 243) perceptions of and willingness to communicate with the nonnative Spanish speaker and willingness to accommodate to the Hispanic/Latino Americans in general. Using Hayes’ (2013) PROCESS, results revealed participants rated the speaker as less socially attractive in the negative accent stereotyping condition than in the control condition, indicating the negative effect of accent stereotyping on perceptions of social attractiveness of the speaker with a moderate level of accent. In addition, results indicated significant indirect effects of negative accent stereotyping on willingness to communicate with the speaker and willingness to accommodate to Hispanic/Latino outgroup members through perceived social attractiveness and communication anxiety. Implications of these findings are discussed in light of communication accommodation theory, interpersonal and intergroup communication, and institutional support and acculturation.",Top Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication
2017-0011,2017,Paper Session,A Second Look at Family Obligation and Request Compliance Cross-Culturally: Reciprocity Versus Relationship,2,"A previous study by the authors combined relationship and reciprocation in the same message to induce a sense of family obligation, which led to subsequent compliance actions. The goal of the current 2 x 5 (country by message) between-subjects experiment based on 525 participants from China and the U.S. was to disentangle the strength of family relationship from reciprocation to examine whether the two components function differently in shaping perceptions toward obligation and the subsequent compliance behaviors. The results showed that in general, obligation was perceived as more benevolent than aversive. One-sided favor message induced less aversive and more benevolent obligation perceptions and more subsequent compliance compared to the equivalent reciprocation message. Chinese participants were more susceptible to the relationship messages compared to their American counterparts. These results replicated the findings from the first study and offered additional insights into cultural mechanisms underlying the perception and enactment of family obligation.",Top Papers in Intercultural Communication,Intercultural Communication
2017-0012,2017,Paper Session,Women Warriors: The Role of Military Service in Evaluation of Female Senate Candidates,3,"The demographic breakdown for the 114th Congress reveals a record number of women veterans in United States politics. Military service is acknowledged as one of many elements voters use to evaluate candidates, but is understudied in current political communication research. As such, this project looks to the role of military service as a heuristic for voter evaluation of female candidates. A survey was administered to determine the extent that veteran status impacted voter evaluation of female candidates, specifically regarding gender roles and military issues. We found no differences in the patterns with which gender and military status affected evaluations on terrorism and foreign policy given by Democratic male and female, and Republican male participants. However, we found Republican women responded outside of this pattern, instead giving no penalty to candidates for civilian status, but rather a reward to specifically female candidates with military experience.

2017-0014,2017,Paper Session,“A Plague on Both Your Sides”: Benevolent Sexism in the Debate on Gender-Neutral Toilets,3,"When “bathroom bills” restricting transgender persons’ access to public toilets entered U.S. politics in 2015, the debate quickly spiraled along partisan lines. More insidious, was the presence of benevolent sexism, or the belief that women must be protected. This study delineates the benevolently sexist themes in the debate through a framing analysis of 8,841 online comments on the most circulated articles about transgender persons’ public toilet access between September 2015 and September 2016. While opponents of gender-neutral bathrooms viewed men as unable to contain their sexual desires, supporters argued that women are more likely to be sexually objectified or assaulted outside of public toilets. Both sides re-emphasized a centuries-old script of sexual assault as women’s problem. Our findings suggest a pervasive shifting of the debate from the human rights of transgender persons to the protection of women, without recognizing the patriarchal substructures oppressing women and transgender individuals.",Gendered Discourse in American Politics,Political Communication
2017-0015,2017,Paper Session,Troubling Republicanism: Carly Fiorina and Conservative Republican Gendered Discourses,1,"Within the Republican Party, party elites, political donors and voters perceive Republican women as moderate. In an increasingly polarized political landscape, this results in a dearth of Republican women vying for higher office. Despite this trend, early in the 2016 presidential primaries, Republican Carly Fiorina briefly rose to prominence. In this manuscript, I examine how Fiorina articulated and re-articulated gendered discourses of a conservative woman in an effort to move beyond perceptions of moderation. A qualitative semiotic phenomenological content analysis of her campaign’s official Facebook posts reveals three gendered discourses that emphasize her gender while highlighting her identity as Republican politician. These discourses are: From Secretary to CEO, Every B Word in the Book, and Lady Liberty. This research begins to fill a gap in the communication literature related to women in politics and the construction of gender conscious conservative identities. Additionally, it provides a communications strategy for overcoming stereotypes.",Gendered Discourse in American Politics,Political Communication
2017-0016,2017,Paper Session,The Emergence of the Newspaper Comic in 1890’s New York City,1,"Fin-de-siècle New York City of the 1890’s witnessed a historically unprecedented birth of new media forms. Cinema historians often hail film as a product of this moment, and some journalism scholars recognize the press’ modernization in the period’s “yellow journalism”. Fewer scholars, however, have recognized this period as the birthplace of a foundational 20th-century art form: the newspaper comic. This paper situates the newspaper comic, in particular, as a new visual medium taking shape within the elaborately graphical urban newspapers of its time, while also gaining its segmented structure from the cinema filmstrip. The newspaper comic’s formal plasticity, which relies on the reader’s act of perception, in a sense anticipated the later development of modern media like the animated film and the interactive video game. This paper unites a media-theoretical approach with a practice-based visual analysis, seeking a third path of media scholarship amidst literatures dominated by either-or traditions.",New Temporal and Spatial Visual Environments,Visual Communication Studies

This study demonstrates that, in harmony with the discourse of Japaneseness celebrating the hybridity of Japanese culture in the context of postwar economic recovery, the mixed race star was imagined and represented as the embodiment of Japanese cultural hybridity in popular culture. It offers insight into the ways in which the representations of the mixed race star served to mask the historical disjuncture in U.S.-Japan relations between the prewar and the postwar periods, dissociating the image of mixed race people from the stigma of being occupation babies and submerging the memories of World War II and the U.S. Occupation.",New Temporal and Spatial Visual Environments,Visual Communication Studies

This article explores the enduring challenges and the theoretical implications of image classification by tracing two genealogies of image organization as they developed from the early 20th century into the contemporary moment. This narrative is anchored by two mid-century figures: Bernard Karpel, Librarian at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and Romana Javitz, Head of the Picture Collection at the New York Public Library.

For Indian women, engagements with Indian produced mass mediated texts have underscored the complexities of the postcolonial feminine subject who is caught between poles of ‘modernity’ and ‘tradition’. In the globalized context of global cultural exchanges, routine engagements with Western popular television affirm intensified contradictions in the way cultural desire operates in the lives of elite Indian women. Based on fieldwork and in-depth interviews conducted with young women in Hyderabad, this study braids together global popular culture, nationalist postcolinality and ideations of modern femininity that women exercise while consuming popular shows. In doing so, contours of modernity and femininity emerge as young professional women utilize popular fictional narratives of to navigate conservative social expectations and individual aspirations while re-branding the Indian-state within the global imagination.",New Temporal and Spatial Visual Environments,Visual Communication Studies

This study of the college living spaces of Third Culture Kids seeks to increase understanding of the construction and performance of identity by those with globally mobile childhoods. Coupling ethnoarchaeology with participant observation and interviews reveals the ways that spaces and artifacts function in the presentation of self.

Evidence From a Counterfactual Analysis,2,"In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a project carried out by a non-profit organization in China to encourage migrant-worker parents to have more communication with their children “left behind” in the rural area. One group of the participants received a 10-month training program on parenting and communication skills. The other group, besides participating in the same training sessions, also participated in an online community created on Wechat where they could share their parents-children communication experience, ask related questions and access a variety of materials on communication and parenting skills. After controlling for the effect of education and emotional attachment to children, our analysis shows that participating in the online community led to a 10.6-minute increase in the average duration of each phone from the parents to their children, suggesting that participation in an online community could be an effective way to encourage parents to have more interaction with their children.",Parents and Parenting in Online Contexts: Opportunities and Challenges,Communication and Technology
2018-0001,2018,Paper Session,Do We Really Want to Chat With Our Parents Online After “Friending” Them on Social Media? Insights From Chinese University Students,2,"Existing studies on “friending” one’s parents on social network sites (SNS) primarily focus on whether young people are likely to accept their parents as online “friends” and why. However, more in-depth research is needed to learn about the impact on the family’s communication after one’s parents have been “friended” on social media. This study used the theoretical framework of family communication patterns (FCPs) and focus groups to explore 146 Chinese undergraduate students’ perspectives. The findings show that social media has not necessarily helped enhance family intimacy or communication in China, and that the level of closeness depends more on their existing offline communication patterns prior to “friending” each other. Furthermore, the study reveals that Chinese parents have a strong desire for their children to have the same perceptions and values as they do. In turn, young adults tend to manipulate their privacy settings to filter the content visible to their parents. This study’s findings suggest that the growing individualistic culture of the single-child generation is a resistance to the traditional collectivistic culture of current Chinese society.",Parents and Parenting in Online Contexts: Opportunities and Challenges,Communication and Technology
2018-0002,2018,Paper Session,To Ride the Tiger Preschool Teachers Tackle a Mobile Phone WhatsApp Group in Israel,2,"This article asks how preschool teachers cope with mobile communication on the WhatsApp groups of their pupils’ parents. It investigates these women educators’ outlooks on the implications of the messenger application for their professional and personal lives. A mixed research method is used: after twenty-five preschool teachers were interviewed in focus groups, an attitudes questionnaire were used to sample some 200 practitioners of the same profession. While acknowledging the logistical advantages of WhatsApp for sharing information, organizing events, and offering broad opportunities for visibility and presentation of preschool activity, the teachers recount the ballooning of trivial events into grand dramas. Add to that are a sense of being flooded, stress, and bitterness in their communication with parents. The teachers’ situation vis-à-vis the WhatsApp groups is described in terms of a series of tensions: between effectiveness and being flooded in a time-consuming manner, between transparency in educational work and infringement of professional autonomy, and between parental involvement in educational inspection and intervention.
The questionnaire explores the relation between behavior patterns and social resources such as seniority and wage. When processed, the findings reveal a connection between the teacher’s ability to set rules and limits on WhatsApp group conduct and the human and social capital that she brings to the arena. Long-time, tenured, and well paid preschool teachers report being more able to apply control and more restrained in their emotional involvement than do younger, non-tenured, and poorly paid colleagues. The findings reinforce the social construction of technology (SCOT) approach, which fits technological novelties into an existing social array—in this case, understanding mobile communication in the context of parents-teachers relations.",Parents and Parenting in Online Contexts: Opportunities and Challenges,Communication and Technology
2018-0003,2018,Paper Session,"Geeky Parents, Geeky Children: New Practices of Parenting in the Digital Age",2,"It seems that ‘geeks’ and ‘nerds’ are newly in vogue, celebrated by both official and alternative discourses of technological innovation. Does this enable a viable and valuable identity and future for today’s youth? Our qualitative research project examined 70+ parents’ efforts to construct learning pathways to digital opportunity for their children. We focus on the practices of those parents who see themselves or their children as in the vanguard of the digital age. We find that geekiness provides a plausible identity for some children and parents, and they feel comfortably aligned to discourses of social and digital change. When geekiness is shared, parent and child can co-construct a lifestyle in which each values and learns from the other. These families avoid some of the conflict around tech that bedevils families where digital interests are not shared, but they face the risk that their ‘digital investment’ may not pay off.",Parents and Parenting in Online Contexts: Opportunities and Challenges,Communication and Technology
2018-0004,2018,Paper Session,Toward a Typology of Mediated Anger: Routine Coverage of Protest and Political Emotion,1,"This paper establishes the importance of studying mediated anger. It first develops a typology of mediated anger, suggesting it is performative, discursively constructed, collective and political. It applies this typology to routine coverage of anger in UK protest coverage during a two-month time period in 2015. The analysis demonstrates that anger serves as a cause of engagement and a barometer of public feeling. It sets out a spectrum of discursive constructions of mediated anger. At one end sits rational and legitimate anger, which forms the basis for social change. Along the spectrum sits aggressive and/or disruptive anger motivated by rational and legitimate concerns. At the other end of the spectrum lies illegitimate and irrational anger. The analysis shows that protesters can be simultaneously angry and rational, peaceful and legitimate. As such, the paper contributes a more nuanced understanding of anger as a political emotion.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies

Analysis of actual circumstances in which speech, counterspeech, silencing and outrage are expressed can help illuminate the impacts and limits of fierce adherence to freedom of expression. The principle of freedom of expression seems to have an expansive generosity that values all voices and opinions.

2018-0006,2018,Paper Session,"“I am Burning, I am Burning”: Affect, Acid Attacks and British Tabloid Newspapers",1,"This article draws on studies that explore forms of contemporary journalism which focus on the role played by the expression of emotions and feelings. We present results from a qualitative study which examined how British tabloid newspapers covered acid attacks on women between 2010-2016. Drawing on the notion of affect, we explore the extent to which journalists try and turn painful embodied states into rational discourse. The data analysed suggest that such experiences cannot be completely captured by language. The journalists make use of particular narrative strategies focussing on the incident of the attack by highlighting how pain was experienced by the individual. This often results in the women being singled out and isolated. While there is some discussion of the contexts in which the violence occurred, the wider socio-cultural background is absent from the articles. We conclude that the focus on intense pain in the articles may enable a particular affective relationality to emerge that is felt by victims, journalists and audiences alike.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies
2018-0007,2018,Paper Session,Affective Solidarity in Audience Encounters With Mediated Distant Suffering: In Defence of Mere Feltness,1,"In recent media theory affective solidarity has been treated as a contradiction in terms. Any relation to the other consisting in sympathy cannot form the basis of full subjective recognition, and in practice is often actively dehumanising. Further, there remains the notion that solidarity is contingent upon a rupture of habitual being-in-the-world, and in journalistic contexts this leads to practices that aim at intensive encounters that transcend the affective livedness of everyday routines. This paper, however, argues that solidarity is not clinched in spite of the merely felt experience of the other in everyday life, but instead is predicated precisely on that mere feltness. Interviews with heavy media-use journalists in Egypt and Lebanon are used to posit that it is the discontinuous and dispersed nature of multiple media immersion that affords the kinds of affective experience – busyness, pleasure, distraction, resistance and above all ambivalence – around which subjective recognition can crystallise.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies

To trace and analyze the evolution of emotional storytelling, this paper presents a historical case study, examining the emergence of narrative journalism in U.S. newspapers between the 1970s and the 1990s. Drawing from archival research, oral history interviews and textual analysis of trade publications, this paper analyzes the discursive construction of narrative journalism with respect to new journalistic roles that consequently legitimized certain norms, ideas, and practices. It documents a more interpretive approach to news reporting and writing, a paradigmatic shift with implications that still reverberate today.",Emotionality in Journalism,Journalism Studies
2018-0009,2018,Paper Session,Turning the Page on Children’s Book Use: Parent Perceptions of eBooks and Print Books,3,"Despite the pervasiveness of mobile screens in the home, many parents remain skeptical about the value of children’s eBooks (Rideout, 2014). Reading books aloud to preschool-aged children is associated with a host of academic benefits (Bus, van IJzendoorn & Pellegrini, 1995), and social development (High et al., 2014). Whether or not parents are willing to use eBooks the same way they have used print books for decades has yet to be established. The current study used survey data from Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform, to investigate parent reports (N=2,260) of print and eBook uses, preferences, and purposes . Implications suggest different book formats play unique roles in families. Therefore future research may benefit from treating eBooks and print books as separate tools to best reflect their separate uses.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0010,2018,Paper Session,How Parents Support Early Math and Science Learning: The Role of Media and Parent Comfort,4,"Children’s early learning of science and math is critical to their later achievement in these fields (Watts et al., 2014), however little is known about how parents engage their preschool children in informal science and math learning. Here we examine parental attitudes around their children’s science and math learning and parental beliefs about the role media plays in exposing children to these concepts. Using interviews, we found that parents of preschool-aged children can identify science and math learning activities they do with their children, but feel more equipped to support math learning and identify math media in comparison to science. Parents described using media to support rather than introduce science and math concepts, but used YouTube to answer science questions. These findings broaden our understanding of how parents use media to supplement children’s informal learning. We offer recommendations for designing media to help caregivers further support their children’s learning.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0011,2018,Paper Session,Do Caregivers Care About Cultivation? A Study of Parents' Opinions About Violent Media Effects,2,"Using the extended parallel process model (EPPM; Witte, 1992), we argue that parents will care about media violence when they perceive the outcomes as being severe, and they perceive their families as being susceptible. To test these hypotheses, a survey was distributed among primary caregivers of children in K-5th grade. In it, we provided parents with layperson descriptions of five common media effect outcomes: fear, cultivation outcomes, desensitization, aggression, and hostility. For each violent media effect, caregivers provided their opinions on perceived severity and susceptibility for their oldest child in the K-5th range. Results suggest parents view their children as most susceptible to fear and cultivation outcomes, but not aggression and hostility. On the other hand, they perceived aggression and hostility to be the most severe. Consistent with the EPPM, ratings of susceptibility and severity predicted overall anxiety about media violence effects. Implications for media violence intervention strategies are discussed.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media

Key-findings are that only a minority of the parents (five to 34%) agree to use media as a pacifier. Moreover, parents use media to fulfil their own needs (e.g., instrument for better eating or sleeping, or to take time off) but mostly primarily because of their child’s needs (keep them occupied, reward or punish them). Parents low in parenting self-efficacy and who lack support of their partner and are confronted with child developmental problems are most apt to turn to media devices and fulfil the parent’s need for relief.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0013,2018,Paper Session,Parents’ Responses to Cyberbullying Effects: How Third-Person Perception Influences Support for Legislation and Parental Mediation Strategies,4,"The third-person effect has often focused on the perceived media effects on others versus the self. This study attempts to extend the existing understanding of the third-person effect by examining how parents’ perceived effects of cyberbullying is associated with two behavioral outcomes: support for anti-cyberbullying legislation and parental mediation of social media use. We surveyed 1,187 of parents of children aged between 8 and 17 in Singapore. Our results supported both the perceptual and behavioral hypotheses. Parents perceived other children as more susceptible to cyberbullying than their own children. Parents’ third-person perceptual gap was negatively associated with support for anti-cyberbullying legislation, and positively associated with parental mediation strategies, suggesting that different behavioral outcomes are associated with different processes. The associations between the third-person perceptual gap and both related outcomes were stronger among parents of younger children as compared to adolescents. Implications for research on the third-person effect were discussed.",The Parent's Voice in the CAM Space,Children Adolescents and the Media
2018-0014,2018,Paper Session,"Calculating the Consequences of Australian Copyright Exceptions: Measurable, Hidden and Incalculable Costs to Creators",4,The kind and extent of exceptions and limitations to copyright monopolies are major focus of copyright reform discussion worldwide. The debate is often portrayed as pitting the interests of creators against users. Australian copyright law features narrow and limited exceptions. Australian creators benefit from copyright monopolies; but do they suffer any costs for lack of flexible exceptions? A national survey of creators showed that they experience significant costs in time and money in making work; avoid or abandon projects because of copyright problems; and avoid developing ideas for projects that involve use of third-party copyrighted materials. These costs have previously been uncalculated and not included in national policy debate. The results provide information not only for the Australian context but for copyright policy discussion internationally.,The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy
2018-0015,2018,Paper Session,"Copyright Givers and Takers: Mutuality, Altruism and Instrumentalism in Open Licensing",3,"The discussion about the role of open licensing in creative industries and communities tends to be polarized into two vantage points. Either: 1) it is a new, altruistic paradigm enabling creative communities to rework copyright to fit their vision for the cultural commons, or: 2) it is a radical theft of creative labor, encouraged by digital industrial powerhouses such as Google, to cheat creative laborers out of their share of profits. Both of these rhetorical vantage points presume a monolithic and largely either selfless or unaware base of creative laborers. In this article, we analyze data from a series of surveys across a range of creative industries and communities to show that, in fact, cultural laborers employ open licensing agentically for a variety of reasons, including instrumental purposes oriented toward skirting the many impediments created by institutions and law, rather than merely because they are unaware or selfless.",The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy
2018-0016,2018,Paper Session,Information Subsidies: Visions at Stake in Portuguese Copyright Law Reform,2,"This paper first sets out to analyse how the main online Portuguese newspaper, Público, covered the amendment of the private copying law during 2012 and 2015. Using Gandy’s information subsidies theory, it investigates how the issues of power among the three key actors concerned played out in the news until the reform was approved in May 2015. Second, we examine the representation of the two main competing visions at stake in media coverage: the ‘private property vision’ and the ‘public policy vision’. After discussing the findings of the thematic analysis conducted, we point out issues for future research.",The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy
2018-0017,2018,Paper Session,Policy Diffusion and Internet Governance: Reflections on Copyright and Privacy,3,"Internet governance reflects tensions around a struggle for control over infrastructures, content but also users. As the conditions of internet governance become increasingly global, policy attention turns away from the regulation of major actors and to the individual: this paper explores two cases of policy, informed consent and graduated response as cases aiming at the role of the individual user. Through the lens of policy diffusion the paper explores in detail the trajectory of these two elements in internet policy and discuss the ways in which principles and concrete measures are found in different regulatory spaces.",The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy
2018-0018,2018,Paper Session,Digital Intellectual Property Protection in China: Trends and Damages in Litigation Involving the Big Five Websites (2003–13),1,"After decades of breakneck economic growth and rapid change in its media environment, China has abandoned its notoriously cavalier approach and has become the most litigious country in the world when it comes to IPR protection in the digital domain. This empirical study investigates 351 cases involving the country’s five biggest websites from 2003 to 2013. In that decade, the win rate was 24 per cent for websites being sued—but the rate jumped to 90 per cent for websites suing others. Plaintiffs were awarded a median 5,502 yuan in damages—representing a median 10 per cent of their claims. The data further revealed the significant impacts of the situation of the litigants, the type of content in dispute and the jurisdiction on the outcome of cases. This research adds an empirical footnote on the growing discussion on the general direction of digital intellectual property rights protection in China.",The Struggle Over Copyright and Intellectual Property,Communication Law & Policy
2018-0019,2018,Paper Session,"eHealth Literacy, Social Capital and Health Information Behavior: A Case of Grassroot Community in China",2,"Nowadays, the Internet is widely adopted to access health information and make health decisions in people’s daily life. eHealth literacy and social capital are critical antecedents to understanding individuals’ health information behavior. Studies in this area are abundant in developed countries, limited studies exist in relation to grassroots communities in China. This study aimed to examine how eHealth literacy and social capital affect Internet users’ health information behavior in county communities in China. In-person interviews were conducted with 886 valid Internet users in Rongcheng, a county in North China, in 2017. This study found that: (1) eHealth literacy was positively associated with both rural and urban respondents’ scope of health information sources, urban respondents’ scope of online health information seeking behavior, and correlated with health information providing; (2) the diversity of social capital was positively associated with urban respondents’ health information behavior, whereas social capital was not associated with rural respondents’ health information behavior; (3) social capital’s upper reachability and range have moderate effects on the relations of eHealth literacy and scope of health information resources for rural respondents, the relations of eHealth literacy and health information providing for urban respondents were moderated by them as well.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication
2018-0020,2018,Paper Session,“I Was Right About Vaccinations”: How Health Literacy and Existing Beliefs Result in Confirmation Bias,4,"Western countries face decreasing vaccination rates. Research suggests that current vaccination criticists are well-educated parents having higher health literacy (HL) who could be influenced by anti-vaccination on the Internet. It is unclear whether confirmation bias plays a role here. This study investigates the relationship between HL and the selection and evaluation of vaccination-related OHI and to what extent this depends on people’s existing vaccination beliefs. 480 parents of young children (0-4) were exposed to vaccination-related information. They were asked to select messages that interested them, and to evaluate positive and negative vaccine-related information for credibility, usefulness, and convincingness. Results showed that HL is associated with a biased selection and the perception that belief-consistent information is more convincing, but only if people hold strong beliefs either in favor or against vaccination. HL also influences the perceived credibility and usefulness of positive vaccine-related information, but only when people have strong positive beliefs.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication
2018-0021,2018,Paper Session,Comparing the Impact of a School-Based Health Literacy Intervention for Rural Children in Low and High Income Schools,4,"Second grade students from a rural low income school had lower baseline health literacy scores in the first year of testing than students from a high-income school in the same district. Low health literacy indicates that a person may struggle with numeracy, reasoning, reading, and comprehension regarding health information. Though children's health literacy has rarely been studied, low health literacy in adulthood is associated with poor health outcomes. Students from the low-income school showed low health literacy at pretest, but after a health literacy intervention delivered by their teachers, students’ posttest health literacy scores increased so that there was no longer a gap in health literacy between students from the low and high income schools. As these second graders transitioned into third grade the pattern was repeated such that after receiving a health literacy intervention, student health literacy in the priority school increased significantly and there was no discrepancy between schools. These findings suggest that a health literacy intervention integrated into elementary school curricula has the potential to reduce health literacy disparities among children. It is our hope that equity in health literacy will continue into adulthood for these children and will help close the gap in health disparities.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication
2018-0022,2018,Paper Session,Understanding eHealth Literacy from a Privacy Perspective: eHealth Literacy and Digital Privacy Skills in American Disadvantaged Communities,1,"Despite the importance of eHealth literacy in the eHealth domain, studies on the antecedents of eHealth literacy, especially through a privacy lens, are still limited. Using a door-to-door paper-and-pencil household census of public housing communities in a major American city, this study examines how eHealth literacy varies by digital privacy skills beyond the frequency of Internet activities among members of such disadvantaged communities. Results show that proficiency in digital privacy skills plays a positive and direct role in influencing levels of eHealth literacy. In addition, it mediates the positive relationship between the frequency of Internet activities and levels of eHealth literacy. This study offers a refined understanding of eHealth literacy from a privacy perspective.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication
2018-0023,2018,Paper Session,Health Literacy and Diabetes-Related Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis,3,"Background: Health literacy is a prominent topic in health communication as studies have shown that low health literacy levels are associated with poorer health outcomes, especially in chronically ill patients such as diabetes patients. Narrative and systematic reviews have described the relationship between health literacy and diabetes outcomes, leading to heterogeneous results. Meta-analytic summaries of original research in this area are lacking.
Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis by searching five databases (MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and CENTRAL) for original empirical studies on adult diabetes patients that included at least one validated measure of health literacy or numeracy and one measure of diabetes-related outcomes. We extracted different demographics and methodological information from all retained studies and used Fisher's r-to-z transformation as a measure of effect size.
Results: The meta-analysis, including 41 studies, showed mixed results. Health literacy was significantly negatively related to glycaemic control only in studies with type II diabetes patients and in studies where the proportion of low educated patients was higher. Health literacy was positively related to specific diabetes self-care (blood monitoring), in particular, when the studies were carried out in American countries, used type II diabetes patients only, and used diabetes specific health literacy measures. A consistent positive relationship was found for health literacy and numeracy and diabetes knowledge. Egger’s tests did not point towards any publication bias.
Conclusion: Based on these results, we can draw different conceptual, methodological, and practical conclusions.",Health Literacy and Health Information,Health Communication
