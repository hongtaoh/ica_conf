2014-0000,2014,Poster,Communication Can Reduce Stereotyping Behavioral Decisions,3,"Stereotypes are oversimplifications of a complex social environment, and they can contribute to a host of social problems. Based on decision science literature, we conceptualize stereotype decisions as a hybrid of both rule-based and experience-based decision process, and explore how feedback of decisions and the way we communicating categorization information during the decision process can help reduce stereotyping behavior. We designed a novel decision game experiment to study how people make interpersonal interaction decisions based on the stereotypes provided in the cover story at the beginning of the game and trial-by-trial feedback over time throughout the game. In addition, the decision trials required different communication effort for the categorization information during the decision process. Through a multilevel time series logit model, we found that communication of categorization information and feedback information can significantly reduce stereotyping behavioral decision.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0001,2014,Poster,How Do Men and Women Self-Present in Online Business Networks: A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis,2,"While Facebook predominantly caters for the needs of private self-expression, the self presentational features of business networking sites (BNS) like LinkedIn and XING serve more professional impression management purposes (van Dijck, 2013). Besides contact lists and (discussion) groups, these networks feature detailed information on working history, as well as categories regarding personal but job-related information but have so far largely been ignored. In the context of discussions about a wider inclusion of women in the workforce, it is worthwhile to investigate similarities and differences in the use of self-presentational resources that might have consequences with regard to visibility and hiring probability. One can expect differences between men and women resulting from gender roles and stereotypes that suggest corresponding behavioral preferences. The study analyzes similarities and differences in the profiles of men and women with regard to the outer form, quantitative aspects, and qualitative presentation, finding that there are indeed several differences.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0002,2014,Poster,Online Interruptions: Relevancy of Media Richness Theory,3,"Media Richness Theory is one of the controversial theories in CMC research.The theory assumes that media differ in their ability to carry varied types of information and ‘Social Richness’.This study examines the role of richness of interruption messages effect on cognitive performance quality. An experimental research design utilized a computerized simulation game to measure participants' cognitive performance. 114 participants were assigned randomly to four groups and one control group. Manipulation achieved by exposing participants to messages (using ‘Push’ technology) in Mobile phones (SMS/MMS) and online application (text/banner). A significant difference between experimental groups was found regarding the time of the task. Analysis also reveals a significant effect of the richness of the message and a main effect of the media type.This research seeks to broaden our understanding of the incorporation of information technology, such as mobile phones and the Internet, as an integral part of the workplace.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0003,2014,Poster,Online and Retrospective Negation of Media Stereotypes,2,"The present study investigated the negation (e.g., “No! This is not true!”) of media stereotypes and its consequences on media-induced changes of prejudice. This study is the first to measure negation during exposure by utilizing a process-oriented continuous measurement approach with eye tracking methodology. The data show that individuals negated the repeated depictions of the “criminal foreigner” stereotype during reception (online) as well as in a subsequent situation (retrospective). However, they rarely negated the stereotypic information directly at the moment of encoding. This is unfortunate, because scholarship has indicated that negation directly at the moment of encoding may have important beneficial consequences. In addition, this study investigated negation’s consequences on media-induced attitude change: Whereas some scholars have argued that media effects on attitudes typically occur during exposure, others highlighted the situation when the attitude judgment is constructed. Our data emphasize the importance of the judgment construction situation.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0004,2014,Poster,Parsing Gender Gaps on News Memory Making and Decay,4,"This experiment investigated gender differences in audiovisual news acquisition by manipulating emotional personalization in stories and measuring memory and comprehension at two time points, one week apart. Data (N=80) offer evidence that gender gaps are intricate and resisted uniformity across three memory and five comprehension measures. Over time, memory decay showed up strong but without substantial gender variance. Free recall tests point to women as having an edge over men. Recognition and comprehension did not vary across gender but men were more efficient (used fewer words) than women in articulating what they learned from news. Education of participants (a control factor) revealed that highly educated women gave lengthy responses to open-ended items without improving accuracy in articulating the main point of stories. Taken together, these findings reveal the value of employing multiple memory measures to map an overview of where future gender gap studies might be productively focused.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0005,2014,Poster,"How Gender, Conflict Linkage, Victimization, and Cardiovascular Reactivity Predict Taking Conflict Personally",2,"Taking conflict personally can lead to negative relational outcomes. In this study we examined how viewers of an escalating conflict within a couple advised and predicted what would happen next. We examined the effects of gender, imagined interaction conflict linkage in terms of persons predicting and advising if the partners should replay an escalating conflict in their mind while preparing for what should happen next, as well as past victimization and, change in cardiovascular variables including blood pressure as they correspond with viewer’s taking conflict personally. People who take conflict personally may have increased blood pressure as conflict escalates. Results indicate being female, conflict linkage, past victimization, advising escalation, and change in blood pressure are positive predictors of taking conflict personally.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0006,2014,Poster,No Woman No Cry?: How Televised Women’s Football Affects Moods and Judgments,3,"The objective of this article is to improve the understanding of mood and judgment effects evoked by major televised sport events like national football matches. According to disposition theory of sport spectatorship, viewers’ affective experiences, specifically their moods, are assumed to be effected by the outcomes of the matches they watch. This study tests whether these mood effects depend on viewers’ team identification as well as viewers’ sex. Moreover, past research has indicated that mood changes as effects of sport viewing could influence viewers’ subsequent judgments in line with feeling-as-information theory. Based on this line of arguments, a quasi-experimental pre-post-test study with 180 participants was conducted to assess the moods and judgments (self-confidence, evaluation of the economic situation, government satisfaction) of viewers before and after a win and a defeat of the German national football team during the 2011 women’s FIFA World Cup. The results support disposition theory of sport spectatorship as well as feeling-as-information theory and give new insights into the moderating role of team identification and sex.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0007,2014,Poster,Violating Viewers' Expectations During Narrative Processing,3,"This study investigates how violations of the expectancies viewers form during narrative processing are processed and influence the viewing experience. In a 2 (solved: yes vs. no) × 2 (message) × 4 (order) mixed repeated measures experiment 59 participants watched four stimulus clips while psychophysiological measures were being recorded, and indicated their levels of engagement and enjoyment after each clip. Results confirm that expectation violations can elicit orienting responses in viewers regardless of their level of narrative engagement and lead to more enjoyment when they are explained during the following plot. Implications for future research about narrative processing are discussed.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0008,2014,Poster,Dimensions and Information Introduced (ii): How Information Provided Weighs Differently When Number of Visual Dimensions change,4,"Based on the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing, or LC4MP (Lang, 2006), Park, Lee, Lee, & Nam (2013) explored how change in dimension (2D vs. 3D) affects the cognitive load on individuals. Park et al. (2013) reported that the additional dimension in the visual field increased cognitive load for individuals to process information, which resulted more cognitive effort paid and poorer performance in information processing.
This study attempts to extend the findings from Park, Lee, Lee, & Kim (2013) by adding another concept to the picture: information introduced. Ongoing study is collecting data (target N=60) and this extended abstract will provide some of the preliminary results from data gathered to date.
Results from data collected to date shows general support for LC4MP, which suggests 3D technology leads to early cognitive overload for viewers. Implications from this finding is that structural features that consume cognitive resources needs to be used even more carefully in 3D environment in order to successfully deliver information to viewers.
an experiment has been designed using video clips varying in its density of structural features and levels of arousing content. The results provides general support for LC4MP, suggesting that additional dimension in the visual field provided by 3D technology do increase the cognitive load in processing mediated messages. To date, this project has collected data from 21 subjects, and will complete with additional forty or more (total N > 60) by ICA 2013.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0009,2014,Poster,Explicating the Emotion Spillover Effect Using Motivated Information Processing Approach: Promising Evidence and Remaining Issues,1,"This manuscript reports on research conducted under the framework of motivated information processing theories with a goal of understanding the underlying mechanisms of the emotion spillover effect. The central hypothesis within this approach suggests that the emotional tone of the message preceding the to-be-remembered content influences the encoding strategy for that content by signaling to a cognitive system which motivationally relevant content should be prioritized during encoding. The framework suggests that positive emotional tone vs. negative emotional tone support different information processing strategies and as a result, they can produce different outcomes for information processing. The main propositions of the framework are described and initial empirical evidence from three experiments is reported. The results are discussed in light of theory advancement.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0010,2014,Poster,How Camera Changes Affect the Recognition of Public Service Announcements: A Test Outside the Lab,2,"This study aimed at estimating the impact of camera changes on the recognition of PSAs amidst of an array of other factors affecting the attention to these ads. Recognition percentages of 193 PSAs derived from campaign evaluation studies were related to content analysis data of the ads measuring the number of camera changes per second and the information introduced per camera change. The study reveals increasing the number of camera changes may slightly increase PSA recognition if the amount of information introduced by these camera changes is small, but increasing the number of camera changes tends to decrease PSA recognition substantially as the amount of information introduced by these camera changes increases. Combined, the number of camera changes per second and the information introduced per camera change account for 5% of the variance in PSA recognition. These findings corroborate theoretical propositions from the LC4MP outside the laboratory setting.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0011,2014,Poster,How Perceived Information Quality of Online News Sources Determines Political Knowledge Through Self-Efficacy,1,"The Internet is a challenging news source. Young users have to choose between so-called ‘quality media’ and diverse semi-professional or non-professional sources. We suggest that the perceived information quality of online news sources plays a crucial role in the acquisition of political knowledge. Based on self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977, 1986) we propose that in the course of an individual’s media socialization, perceived information quality, media self-efficacy, internal political efficacy, and political knowledge should be understood as consecutively linked.
Based on a student sample (N = 560), aged 12 to 22 (M = 16.04, SD = 1.37), our assumptions were supported for general online news exposure. Further, we examined whether the model holds true for professional, semi-professional and non-professional information sources. Here a more complex picture revealed. The results underline the importance of focusing on media literacy education as well as the development of media and internal political efficacy to trigger knowledge acquisition processes.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems

The study uses a 2 (topic: person v. object) x 2 (gender: male v. female) x 4 (repetition) mixed design. The dependent variables include heart rate (as a measure of attention), skin conductance (as a measure of arousal), and encoding, storage and retrieval (measured via recognition, cued recall, and free recall).

2014-0013,2014,Poster,The Impact of Image Intensity and Text Color on Responses to Health Warnings,8,"Health messages from organizations are often designed to communicate the risks of unhealthy behavior in explicit warning messages. Despite these efforts, graphic and fear-inducing health warnings have been considered to potentially trigger extreme fear and defensive reactions, such as message rejection or avoidance (i.e. Ruiter, 2005). To confirm this with real-time reactions, this study will investigate how the emotional intensity of visual images and color of text used in health warning messages impacts cognitive and emotional processing of the message in a 3 (Visual Image Intensity) X 2 (Text Color) X 3 (Message) X 3 (Order) within subjects repeated measures design. Participants will view health messages that vary along three levels of visual image intensity (low, moderate, and high) and two text colors (blue and red) while psychophysiological measures of cognitive resources allocated to encoding and emotional response are recorded. The research will also assess message attitudes and perceived effectiveness.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0014,2014,Poster,Variables Influencing the Likelihood of Being Reminded to a Failed Message by a Similar Communication Situation,1,"This study investigated factors that influence whether a speaker will be reminded by a current communication situation to an earlier situation where a message addressing a similar primary goal had a negative outcome. Being reminded as such may play a role in the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated adaptive ability. The study asked whether the likelihood of being reminded to an “old” situation by an analogous “new” situation is influenced by: (a) four types of similarity between the two scenarios; (b) amount of elaboration on the old scenario; (c) number of times the old scenario was thought about; and (d) extent to which the earlier episode was interesting or emotional. Results showed that participants were reminded to more old situations when they elaborated on the old situations than when not, and when the old situations were processed twice, rather than once. The situation components most predictive of reminding varied across situations.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems

In general, pictures and words did show different motivational activation responses across the time course. Pictures showed greater motivational activation, while words showed lesser activation initially but showed a second firing response that generally increased motivational activation. This supported these theoretical predictions. Movement as it relates to the imminence of threats and opportunities in our environments was also investigated, but results did not follow predicted lines.

2014-0016,2014,Poster,Against Policy Failure: Designing a Media System That Enables “The Good Life”,1,"Any conception of the “good life” would likely include a media system founded on normative values like openness, diversity, and information rich. Enabling freedom of speech and other essential liberties, this system would need to be accessible and affordable to all members of society. However, commercialized media systems often run counter to these ideals. American digital communication systems have become dominated by oligopolies driven by a corporate libertarian logic—one that conflated individual freedoms with corporate privilege—that does not accommodate public interest principles in line with “good life” ideals.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

A core principle of A2K is that the expansion of IP law is often anti-democratic, restrictive and an outright threat to cultural participation and creative practice. Restricting sharing, openness and access to information can prove a direct threat to “the good life” as imagined in an information society. In this position paper, I provide an overview of the problem of emerging IP enforcement regimes and explain how A2K approaches to information policy can cultivate social well-being.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

2014-0019,2014,Poster,The Goods Life: Local Journalism From Public Good to Merit Good,1,"This position paper contributes to the discussion of how to ensure the sustainability of journalism by arguing for a rhetorical and semantic shift away from labeling journalism as a “public good” to thinking about it as a “merit good” (Musgrave, 1959). While public goods suggest regulatory intervention only to the point that “respect[s] the wishes of consumers,” merit goods suggest regulatory intervention regardless of consumption habits (Eecke, 1998, p.5). That is to say that merit goods are deemed so socially valuable that they should be provided regardless of consumer behavior. Positioning journalism as a merit good, rather than a public good lends political economic leverage for increased regulatory and legislative support for journalism, and may revive efforts to ensure the sustainability of journalism, particularly at the local level.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0020,2014,Poster,The Right to Communicate as a Foundation for the Good Life,1,"This position paper argues that communication is a basic human right, and therefore a fundamental aspect of the good life. Accordingly, the right to communicate should be formally codified in international human rights law. Human rights are international norms that protect each human being from an array of abuses and seek to identify basic needs necessary to lead a minimally good life. Human rights are a “realistic utopia” in that they institutionalize the utopian ideal of a just society in the laws of modern constitutional democracies (Habermas, 2010). These rights exist as ideal statements that may be embodied in laws and regulations at local, national, or international levels. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations, 1948) and other treaties serve as standards which identify norms to be embodied. In this regard, communication laws and policies can help to structure the good life within communities.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

2014-0025,2014,Poster,Contexts of Digital Surveillance and Trust: Ethical Action and the Good Life,1,"Ethical and legal charges about digital invasions of privacy usually surface in response to some apparent surveillance. Nissenbaum (2010) claims that privacy can be understood within a structure of “contextual integrity” in which streams of personal data, originating in different social contexts, are handled by entrenched socio-legal conventions. These conventions may be violated by the monitoring practices associated with information technologies; thus contextual integrity is broken. Privacy violations, then, are judged in accordance with the goals and values of a specific context. This research proposes a contextual reading of surveillance as it pertains to Nissenbaum’s contexts of privacy and the notion of contextual integrity and ethics. Specifically, it examines principles of “the good life” in terms of ethical responsibilities in legal remedies for privacy violations. In what contexts do we expect surveillance? How do “caring” forms of surveillance modify our perceptions of privacy rights? What technological routines support surveillance? What are the implications for human dignity and respect? How have current legal regimes surrounding privacy neglected basic notions of humanity that contribute to “the good life”? Using a critical theoretical perspective, this paper seeks to understand what surveillance contexts mean for individuals in terms of values, the law, and morality.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0026,2014,Poster,Landscapes of Care: Feminist Approaches to Global Public Relations,1,"This paper explores and synthesizes feminist standpoint theory (FST) and a feminist ethic of care in the context of global public relations. While FST and ethic of care have been incorporated in public relations literature, they have not been explored in light of the turn from global to glocal public relations and its greater cultural emphasis. Guided by those feminist theories, I analyzed public relations conducted by coalitions of public and private organizations constituting the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (PPPHW). I found that PPPHW’s localized handwashing campaigns mirrored FST’s activist commitment to social change, lived experience, and indigenous knowledge. Additionally, an ethic of care contributed to their effectiveness in decreasing infant disease, as well as (perceived) ethicalness. Finally, FST values and ethic of care aligned with glocal public relations’ goal of local responsiveness while retaining a global message (in this case, handwashing with soap).",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Social media have evolved into the fastest and most direct means to communicate with student populations. In this study, we experimentally tested the use of Twitter and Facebook as crisis communication media at a university and further observed the effects of the communication source (university or dean) and the crisis information (instructing or adapting) on secondary communication by the students (e.g. sharing the message and leaving a reaction). The role of the dean as an information source seemed to incite students more to act by secondary communication.

The results showed that most media depicted Protestant churches in South Korea in a negative way. Especially, when news stories were about mega churches, the tone of the stories became more negative. In regards to framing, the results showed that most media seemed to be more interested in what churches and minister are doing and in what is wrong with churches rather than their doctrines or beliefs.

A survey was conducted in a U.S. medium-size university to test community identification’s mediating effect between social media engagement and e-WOM. 335 completed responses were collected. Results showed that active Facebook engagement accounted for more variance than passive engagement in predicting community identification and predicting active e-WOM behaviors. On the other hand, passive engagement explained more variance than active engagement in predicting passive e-WOM. Hierarchical regressions along with an Aroian test indicated that community identification significantly mediated the relationship between active Facebook engagement and active e-WOM. However, gender did not significantly moderate the relationship between Facebook engagement and e-WOM.

Focusing on digital natives and their social media use, this paper defines “engagement” from several perspectives, distinguishing between positive and negative engagement. Reported results from a recent study differentiate nine types of engagement and show that digital natives often choose not to engage with brands or organizations.

The current research replicates and extends recent work about health care reform information seeking which demonstrated predicted outcome value is the best predictor of information seeking. Unlike the previous work, this data collection took place after health care reform implementation, uses a different sample, and includes new variables of interest (e.g., deviance, knowledge, involvement). Results suggest uncertainty levels have, interestingly, increased post-implementation, and students want to receive health care reform information from friends and family or online, from non-partisan sources, and in varied formats. The data also demonstrate that predicted outcome value of health care reform information, uncertainty tolerance, and involvement significantly predict intentions to seek information about health care reform.

In the first study, participants viewed a mistargeted print D-PSA or a direct D-PSA. In Study 2, participants viewed a mistargeted video D-PSA, a direct D-PSA, or a control ad. In both studies the mistargeted D-PSAs significantly weakened the association between depression and negative help seeking inclinations. Further, among people with heightened levels of depression the mistargeted D-PSA resulted in significantly greater help seeking intentions from close friends and a romantic partner than a direct D-PSA (study 1). In study 2, among people with heightened levels of depression, the mistargeted D-PSA resulted in more favorable attitudes and intentions toward help seeking than both a direct D-PSA and a control ad.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0036,2014,Poster,Mortality Salience and Identification Processes in Predicting Organ Donation Outcomes,2,"Despite attitudes toward organ donation in US culture being positive, the rates of donation behavior remain dismally low. Therefore, there is a need for more research on variables which can increase positivity, willingness, and behavioral intentions in potential donors. The present study applies terror management theory and social identity to the organ donation context. Results indicate that reminders of death through narrative may improve organ donation outcomes as a form of worldview defense, through identification and death thought accessibility as mediators.

2014-0037,2014,Poster,On a Scale of Health Uncertainty,2,"Uncertainty has been recognized as a fundamental construct in health communication. The conceptualization regarding its definition, attribute and scope, however, is not yet clear. In this article, health uncertainty was explicated as the psychological state in which one is incapable of appraising one’s health status and/or making health-related decisions. It was proposed that health uncertainty comprises four dimensions: information uncertainty, condition uncertainty, efficacy uncertainty, and emotion uncertainty. A 17-item scale was developed as a measurement instrument. Four external variables (i.e. health literacy, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and information management) were used to test the construct validity of the sale. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses of data from college students (N=238) showed that the scale was unidimensional on the second order. The results indicated that the scale exhibited good internal and external consistency, construct validity, as well as good reliability. Implications for future research were discussed.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0038,2014,Poster,Perceptions Regarding Healthy and Unhealthy Families: Formative Research to Inform Health Communication Interventions in Malawi,5,"Background
This qualitative study was conducted to gain insight into Malawian men’s and women’s perceptions of “healthy families” and the “good life” in anticipation of designing effective health communication programs.
Methodology
32 focus group discussions and 49 key informant interviews were conducted in Chitipa, Nsanje, Phalombe and Salima Districts.
Results
Healthy families were identified as those with well-nourished, educated parents, two children, living in a clean environment. The main barriers to the good life were structural -- poverty, food insecurity, and lack of access to hygienic conditions, education, and health services. Several individual-level behaviors were also seen as problematic.

Conclusions
Participants tended to be positive and focus on actions that could be taken at the community, family and individual levels even as they identified many structural factors that impede health and access to the good life. These findings informed the design of communication interventions, as described in this manuscript.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0039,2014,Poster,Realism Matters: The Role of Perceived Realism in the Biggest Loser,2,"This study explores the role of perceived realism on audience members’ cognitive and behavioral responses to health-related messages in the context of the NBC’s popular reality TV show, The Biggest Loser. The study suggests that exposure to the program is positively associated with perceived realism of the program, which in turn is positively associated with developing internal weight locus of control. Meanwhile, internal weight locus of control positively predicts audience members’ exercise behaviors, meaning the higher level of internal weight locus of control the audience members develop, the more likely they are to engage in physical exercise. The study offers evidence that reality TV might be a useful tool to influence audience members’ cognitions on health issues, which could potentially lead to healthier outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0040,2014,Poster,Shame Predicts Sexual Risk-Taking Among MSM,5,"Recently, Christensen et al. (2013) found that shame predicted unprotected anal intercourse

(UAI) with non-primary (casual) partners for young men who have sex with men (MSM). Unknown

is whether some men (i.e., those more insecurely attached) are more susceptible and what mediates this link (e.g. alcohol, drugs) and whether this applies to both insertive, and, more risky, receptive UAI. To examine these links, data from 1196 high-risk young MSM were gathered. Using hierarchical negative binomial regression models and mediation analyses we found that shame (as measured with the PANAS-X) positively and significantly predicted both receptive and insertive UAI. The effect of shame on sexual behavior was mediated by alcohol. Furthermore, avoidant attachment predicted shame, alcohol use, and insertive and receptive UAI -- but only consistently for MSM whose attachment responses indicated that they were paying attention (i.e., those who responded to items and reversed items in a conceptually similar way). Further analyses indicated that avoidant attachment, but not anxious attachment, significantly mediated the shame to alcohol link.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

In particular, the current study examines how individual difference in Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) and temporal message framing (i.e., present-oriented message and future-oriented message) interact to influence attitudinal and intentional outcomes. Results of a controlled experiment (N =416) showed a significant interaction effect of CFC and temporal framing on attitudes and intentions as a whole indicating high CFC individuals, compared to low CFC individuals, were more persuaded by present-oriented messages and less persuaded by future-oriented messages.

2014-0043,2014,Poster,The Health Belief Model as an Explanatory Framework in Communication Research,6,"The health belief model (HBM) posits that messages will achieve optimal behavior change if they successfully target perceived barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, and threat. While the model seems to be an ideal explanatory framework for communication research, theoretical limitations have limited its use in the field. Notably, variable ordering is currently undefined in the HBM. Thus, it is unclear whether constructs mediate relationships comparably (parallel mediation), in sequence (serial mediation), or in tandem with a moderator (moderated mediation). To investigate variable ordering, adults (N = 1,377) completed a survey in the aftermath of an 8 month flu vaccine campaign grounded in the HBM. Exposure to the campaign was positively related to vaccination behavior. Statistical evaluation supported a model where the indirect effect of exposure on behavior through perceived barriers and threat was moderated by self-efficacy (moderated mediation). Perceived barriers and benefits also formed a serial mediation chain. The results indicate that variable ordering in the health belief model may be complex, help to explain conflicting results of the past, and a good focus for future research.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0044,2014,Poster,The Role of Communication Networks on HIV/AIDS-Related Behaviors in Malawi,1,"HIV prevalence in Malawi’s southern region is 15%. As Malawians may be influenced by norms transmitted through interpersonal communication within their personal networks to make decisions about their sexual behavior, this study examined the relationship between interpersonal communication, norms and condom use among sexually active Malawians living in the southern region. An egocentric network study (n=1,316) asked participants to name 3 ties they spoke with about health issues. Network descriptive norms (AOR: 2.11; p<0.001), general injunctive norms (AOR: 1.29; p<0.05) and network injunctive norms (AOR: 1.42; p<0.05) were associated with condom use generally. Network descriptive norms were associated with condom use with a primary partner (AOR: 1.58; p<0.01) and non-primary partner (AOR: 2.98; p<0.001). Norms within a personal network may play a role in protective sexual behaviors among Malawians, suggesting that social norm interventions utilizing interpersonal communication may be an innovative approach to increase uptake of protective sexual behaviors.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Effects of Crowdsourcing on Perceived Credibility of Online Health Information,2,"Conceptualizing crowdsourcing as the system that allows users to collectively serve as the source of the content, this study examined the effects of crowdsourcing and an additional professional source layer on credibility judgments and behavioral intentions toward health messages. A 2 [crowdsourcing] × 2 [professional source] × 2 [Message topic] between-subjects online experiment (N = 189) found two indirect paths for the crowdsourcing effects. The crowd-as-source path suggests that crowdsourcing negatively affects content credibility and behavioral intentions through decreased perceived source trustworthiness and information completeness. In contrast, the self-as-source path indicates that crowdsourcing may have positive effects on perceived source trustworthiness via heightened perceived interactivity and sense of control. Finally, although the additional professional source on crowdsourcing sites raises perceived gatekeeping on the site, it does not have substantial influence on credibility judgments.

2015-0002,2015,Poster,Social TV for the Elderly: When Passive Coviewing Leads to a Better TV Watching Experience,3,"Challenges that the ageing global population faces include psychological distress, social isolation, and depression among the elderly. Due to the expensive cost and lack of resources for the treatment, active ageing (e.g., social interaction) via combined entertainment and social activities on social TV has been discussed as a new cost-effective prevention method. In this study, we report on an experiment that examined the effects of social TV (active vs. passive vs. traditional TV) on TV watching experiences among the elderly, including positive affect, enjoyment, perceived quality of social interaction, sense of belonging to the senior center, intention to participate in a community activity, and intention to use social TV in the future. The results (n = 144) showed significant main effects of passive social TV on positive affect, TV enjoyment, sense of belonging, and intention to participate in a community activity. In addition, the results of mediation analyses showed that positive affect mediated the effect of social TV on all the measured variables. Implications regarding the potential of social TV in enhancing the general well-being of the elderly and promoting active ageing are discussed.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology

The iNakba demonstrates the unique capabilities of new media in promoting the right to memory of a marginalized community. The presentation explicates the theoretical foundations of “the right to memory,” a recent addition to the growing literature on collective memory. A demonstration of the app on a poster and an accompanying screen will address three goals: an explication of a recently introduced and scarcely discussed term: the right to memory; a contextualization of the use of contemporary interactive and collaborative applications (commonly referred to as “social media”) as empowering tools for silenced memories of marginalized communities; and an application of the authors’ theory of “new” and “social” media based on a distinct characterization of these media and the ways they differ from their predecessors.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology

Interactivity is often touted as an important characteristic, but we do not know if it contributes to greater usage of online health campaigns. To address this issue, we content-analyzed 94 anti-drug websites in the US, in order to assess the extent to which they feature three dominant types of interactivity. This data was compared with website traffic data from Alexa.com. We discovered that the number of interactive gadgets and the total frequency of the three types of interactivity significantly predicted global ranking of the website as well as the number of daily page-views per visitor. The frequency of modality interactivity and the presence of source interactivity on the homepage were particularly useful in predicting website ranking.

2015-0005,2015,Poster,Persuasion Effects of Web Interactivity: A Meta-Analysis,2,"Web interactivity in recent years has attracted increasing academic attention. Unlike traditional media, online media can utilize lots of new functions including web interactivity to engage and interact with users. To examine the extent to which web interactivity can affect persuasion in prior research, we conducted a meta-analysis of 30 studies (N=5335) that met our selection criteria. The results reveal that high web interactivity is consistently more effective in eliciting users’ positive attitudes and intentions compared to low level of interactivity; with this said, users don’t necessarily form positive attitudes when there is too much interactivity. Despite the promise on persuading attitudes and intentions, no significant persuasion effect of web interactivity has been found on cognitive responses and memory. In addition, perceived interactivity shows a significantly larger persuasion effect as opposed to objective interactivity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this paper.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology
2015-0006,2015,Poster,Big Data or Small Stories? Exemplification and Interactivity Effects on Shaping Perceptions and Attitude of Social Issues,2,"With the rising popularity of “big data”, journalists are trying to integrate data-rich information into news content and to make them accessible to everyday news readers by accompanying them with exemplifying cases. But, these exemplars do not always fully capture the complexity of the data patterns, yet they end up playing an important role in shaping user perceptions of the issue. This study examines the effectiveness of interactivity in counteracting the strong exemplification effect through enhancing perceived vividness of, and user engagement with, data-rich information. A 2 (baserate-exemplar consistency) × 3 (presentational format) × 2 (issue topic) mixed-design experiment revealed that, compared to textual description and static visualization, interactive visualization is effective in motivating systematic processing of the baserate information, which positively influences accuracy of issue perception as well as personal attitude. The study generates both theoretical and practical implications on journalistic practices and interface designs for communicating big-data information.",CAT Interactive Papers #2,Communication and Technology
2015-0007,2015,Poster,Climate Change and Technology: Examining Opinion Formation and Risk Perceptions of Geoengineering,1,"In recent years, ‘climate change’ has matured from a technical term employed by scientists and policy-makers to a social, political, and moral locus that has garnered widespread media coverage, public interest, and debate around the world. As evidence demonstrating the anthropogenic influence on the Earth’s climate has steadily grown stronger, climate change has come to be seen as a pre-eminent challenge of the 21st century. Until recently, most discourse regarding potential responses to anthropogenic climate change have focused on two categories of response options 1) emission mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and 2) human adaptation to a changing world (Mercer, Keith and Sharp, 2011). Geoengineering, a set of proposed large-scale technological fixes to reduce or neutralize greenhouse gas emissions, is a third emerging category of response to global climate change. This study seeks to understand which factors contribute, or alternatively, subtract from public acceptance of geoengineering through predictive hierarchical OLS regression modelling of public perceptions of a variety of factors including socio-demographics, value predispositions, and media use. Such predictive modelling can enable risk communicators and policy-makers with vital information to improve future public engagement and communication about geoengineering.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It was predicted that framing an environmental risk as a human health risk would improve persuasive outcomes of a message. Further, it was expected that similarity between the audience and the people and places depicted in the message would also improve message outcomes. Two types of similarity (demographic similarity and scene similarity) were manipulated in a 2 (risk frame: health, environmental) × 2 (demographic similarity: high, low) × 2 (scene similarity: high, low) between-subjects experiment (N = 568), in which participants were exposed to a message about drought framed as either a health or an environmental risk. Scene similarity interacted with message frame (health vs. environmental) for narrative persuasion and behavior-related variables. Specifically, high (versus low) scene similarity resulted in better persuasive outcomes for the health frame than for the environmental frame, whereas low (versus high) scene similarity resulted in better persuasive outcomes for the environmental frame than for the health frame. Additionally, the study found that framing an environmental risk as a health risk increased behavioral intention and behavioral expectation. Furthermore, high (versus low) personal relevance improved risk perception, narrative persuasion, behavioral intention and expectation, and response efficacy. The study has implications for health and environmental risk communication, particularly for impersonal risks that people perceive to be of low personal relevance, and opens up new avenues for research and practice in areas such as climate change communication and entertainment-education.

The resulting public controversy, dubbed 'climategate', cast doubt on the credibility of the scientists, the CRU, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and on the science supporting anthropogenic climate change. This paper uses the Image Repair Theory (Benoit, 1997) to examine the communication strategies of the parties involved. Nine investigations, press releases, newspaper articles, and blogs were analyzed to identify image repair strategies of the scientists, the CRU and IPCC. Analysis suggests that denial, attacking the skeptics, and bolstering were prominently used by the three parties, in different measures with relative success.

Experiment 1 compared a sadness appeal, a hope appeal and a control condition (no message), and found that, in general, both the sadness appeal and the hope appeal were more persuasive than the control condition in heightening a number of behavioral intentions, such as support for policies, information seeking, and pro-marine environment behaviors. Experiment 2 not only compared the sadness appeal and the hope appeal with a neutral message condition, but also investigated the interaction effects of the two emotional appeals with gain versus loss frame. This experiment provides initial evidence that a sadness appeal will be more effective when it is accompanied by a gain frame and that a hope appeal tends to have greater impacts when it is juxtaposed with a loss frame.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Homophobia is found to cause anti-gay violence. Research has endeavored to examine correlates and causation of homophobia to better understand and to effectively intervene.
This study used online surveys to examine whether or not social identity theory (SIT) predicted male and - previously underexplored - female homophobia, whether or not there was a gender difference in homophobia and gender role beliefs, and whether or not homophobia and gender role beliefs were correlated. The results showed that social identity theory predicted only female homophobia (RQ1) but not male homophobia (H1), there was a gender difference in homophobic attitude (RQ2a) but not in gender role beliefs (RQ2b), and homophobia and gender role beliefs were positively and significantly correlated with homophobia in both males and females (RQ3).","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Paper Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Variation in symbolic threat, as well individual differences in Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), were all investigated for their impact on respondent openness. Among 39 student volunteers it was found that a woman's testimony featuring a high degree of symbolic threat engendered less openness to the other across cognitive and affective measures than less threatening testimony offered by a man. Additionally, participant levels of RWA and SDO explained a significant amount of variance in their openness to the other.

The results show that the unintended consequences that characterise not just the conventional market but also the systems of moral production and consumption cause conflicts between different ethical concerns, making it impossible to make choices that are perfectly moral. Regarding the moral market the analysis shows that because consumers and producers are not able to predict, assess and anticipate the outcomes of their choices and because they can't know what information they can trust, ideologies are constantly re-evaluated. New insights lead to adjusting of ideologies. In this context of constant and endless reflexivity, ideologies become intrinsically unobtainable and reflexivity becomes a non-formative of ideology.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

These evangelicals espouse a free-culture ethic that mirrors that of the FOSS and Creative Commons movements, but is sharply contrasted with previous norms in evangelical media use. I interrogate the question: How does the emerging Christian understanding of free culture online intersect and diverge with the secular understanding, and what do these intersections and divisions reveal about the social imaginaries (Taylor, 2002; 2004) that inform these movements? Furthermore, what do they reveal about the social imaginary of the internet in American culture, broadly conceived?","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0026,2015,Poster,Ontology of Opposition Online: Representing Antagonistic Structures in the World Wide Web,2,"Research on harmonious or cooperative social structures on the Internet is available, and likewise, we find many analyses of particular types of individual and collective conflict behavior online (such as flaming or cyberbullying by individuals, or collective protest behavior). However, we lack a typology of antagonistic structures that exist online, and particularly of the ways they are represented on websites. Social structures can be represented formally (manifestly) or informally (in open verbal or visual forms), or remain latent—a distinction that, in our view, has not received much scholarly attention in the analysis of computer-mediated communication. Based on an interpretative analysis of relational structures and types of acts, we distinguish structural elements that lead us to empirical typologies of antagonistic structures represented online. We finally develop theses why some structures are formally represented more often than others and theorize the consequences of this selective formal representation.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0027,2015,Poster,Practically Theorizing the I and F of Discussion-Based Teaching I,1,"Informed by the conference theme and addressing the topic of the life communication skills students practice in the classroom, this paper examines the discussion-based variant of the traditional direct instruction based triadic I-R-E/F classroom participation structure. Implementing grounded practical theory, idealized reconstructions are made of the instructional communication practice, instructor-facilitated collegiate classroom discussion (IFCCD), on three levels: interactional dilemma, situated ideals, and talk/discourse techniques. In the reformulated participation structure, the instructor retains the first and third-turns, but the conversational work done in these turns is qualitatively different. The first-turn accomplishes invitation rather than initiation and the third-turn is primarily dialogic follow-up accompanied by evaluation and feedback rather than being primarily the latter two. These instructor turns are examined in depth in two classrooms where the instructors consistently facilitated engaged and participatory discussions. These case studies show the theoretical, practical, and life skills relevance of this scholarly approach and discussion-based teaching.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0028,2015,Poster,Three Studies in the Philosophy of Logic,1,"Three studies on the philosophy of logic, three conundrums: What do we mean exactly by the notion of “form” in formal logic? What must be left unsaid, when a given form is incomplete? And what do formless arguments, those without a form, are in want of? In these respective essays, I make the case that many other knowledge fields have contaminated the system of logic; that arguments are living desires; and that the soul apprehends not a form, but the surface of a figure. An overarching critique runs across all essays: I believe that the concept of identity is inadequate to cover the full range of linguistic expression in the practice of argumentation. I propose another interpretation to the cognitive stance toward logic: that intuition is the basis of judgment and moral belief, of intelligence and motivation.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

However, distribution has typically received less attention from communication scholars than other areas like media production, analysis of media texts, or studies of audience effects. This paper examines the areas where media distribution practices and research intersect with important issues in communication scholarship. It makes the case that, precisely because distribution touches on so many areas of social importance and scholarship, it can and should be advanced as a subject of study in its own right.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

I propose that a performance-based analytic paradigm (Alexander, 2006), in which a theoretical conception of “sacred” forms (Lynch, 2012) as well as an acknowledgement of the role of affect in “shaping” lived experience (Ahmed, 2004) have been embedded, should underpin such a framework. I propose applying such a theoretical framework to a series of seven instances wherein the performance of popular music scripts in which sacred forms have been embedded stands to reveal much about popular music’s role in enriching and/or problematizing collective experience.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

A quantitative content analysis of a broad newspaper sample for each country over the course of one year (June 2012–May 2013) was conducted. The results reveal that conservative newspapers do not amplify skeptical voices in general; the difference between conservative and more liberal outlets is only found in the case of impact skepticism.

Yet media analyses of this region, and others experiencing acute climate change impacts, remain scant. As such, this analysis examines climate change frames in the Las Vegas Review-Journal among 1,111 articles between 1997 and 2014. Findings reveal positive, significant relationships between magnitudes of attribution of responsibility and economic consequences frames; human interest and morality frames; and conflict and economic consequences frames. Discussions of geospatial context among articles remains primarily regional and national; authorship patterns are constrained to a small group of individuals over time; and placement patterns in the physical publication are mostly situated behind the front page and section.

Data were collected through a survey conducted in Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Myanmar. The findings of this study showed that individuals’ routinized advanced use of mobile technology, along with participation in voluntary associations and communication with the core network, significantly predicted information seeking about impending disasters. Supporting the mobilization hypothesis, rural residents’ use of basic functions of mobile technology helped increase their involvement in information seeking about impending disasters. Individuals’ risk perception and information seeking were significantly directly and indirectly related to preparedness behavior through information sharing. Moreover, the relationships between various predictors -- information seeking, communication with the core network, voluntary participation, and receipt of general social support-- and preparedness behavior were mediated by the receipt of disaster-related tangible social support.

This debate is often covered by the media. Especially NGOs aim to gain attention and focus on visuals of pain-suffering animals, whereas scientists often keep silent. Against this background we investigate how media audiences respond to media coverage on scientific animal experimentation. Specifically, we are interested in the impact of different textual and visual peripheral cues on lay audiences’ attitudes. We refer to dual-process models of persuasion to predict the reliance of news readers on peripheral cues and effects on attitude outcomes. Two experiments were conducted to observe the influence of expert statements, the visualization of animals and the depicted animal species on acceptance, attitudes and emotional response to animal research. Our findings indicate that expert statements are an important determinant to create attitudes, whereas animal visualization had no immediate effect on audience responses.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Previous scientific studies are mostly focused on factors that motivate (or hinder) knowledge sharing behaviour within such online communities, but little is knows about the consequences of participation. The current study examined employees of a health care organization participating in a VCoP. We applied self-determination theory to investigate motivations to share knowledge within the VCoP by assessing perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness within the online community, and consequences of online participation by measuring perceived autonomy, competence, relatedness at work, and job satisfaction. Results showed that feelings of competence within the VCoP were positively related to online knowledge sharing behavior. Furthermore, employees felt more competent and autonomous in performing their job, more related to colleagues, and more satisfied in their work due to online VCoP participation.",Online Communities and Media Technologies,Information Systems

Preliminary data collected from subjects to date (n=45) shows that as information embedded (value of ii) increases, subjects’ attention level also increases, but recognition memory performance drops, which suggests cognitive overload took place. However, increase in information also leads to enjoyment, which is consistent with findings from another study presented at ICA 2015 and submitted to ICA 2016 for possible presentation. Furthermore, increase in information also led to individual’s viewing intent for the whole series, suggesting that causing cognitive overload may be a useful technic to increase/sustain viewership of television shows.

Afterwards, participants’ eye movements were measured while viewing images of 36 females with varying degrees of body shape (i.e., ideal size model, plus size model) and degree of dress (i.e., fully dressed, scantly dressed, partially clad). Our findings suggest that sexually objectifying music videos increase the sexual gaze among women, but not among men. Thus, women who were primed with sexually objectifying imagery absorbed the presented gaze pattern and looked more on female bodies than on female faces. This effect was independent from the body shape and the degree of dress. This suggests that all kinds of women may be targeted by visual sexual objectification.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

2016-0027,2016,Poster,It's No Game: Testing if Generative Music Systems in Video Games Increase Flow in Players,1,"Flow is “the optimal experience"" and originally proposed by Csíkszentmihályi. It is a pleasant state of deep concentration where the outer world melts away and a person focuses intently on the task at hand. When a person is in flow they are only able to focus intently on the task at hand when the difficulty of the task is closely paired with their ability. This means a person is always challenged, but also able to succeed. Although Csíkszentmihályi initially used flow to describe the pleasurable deep concentration observed in painters and sculptors, subsequent research reports people experiencing flow while doing a wide range of hobbies, from chess to rock climbing. People have also reported experiencing flow while using video games or listening to music. The study combines these two media sources to see if the musical soundtrack in games influences the sense of flow players experience while playing them.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

A Test of the Synchronization Theory of Flow,3,"Flow is a positively valenced psychological state characterized by focused attention and reward that is thought to result from a balance between task challenge and individual skill. The central prediction of the synchronization theory of flow understands flow as an emergent property of a network synchronization process that manifests itself in functional connectivity between attentional and reward structures during flow-inducing media use. However, there is no well-established procedure for experimentally manipulating the construct. In three behavioral experiments, we validated a protocol for manipulating flow. This included the development of an open-source video game stimulus that allowed for a high degree of experimental control while providing a log of in-game events. Three conditions were manipulated: (1) boredom – low challenge/high skill, (2) frustration – high challenge/low skill, and (3) flow – balanced challenge/skill. This procedure was then replicated in a brain-imaging (fMRI) context where the results were largely consistent with theoretical predictions.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

As a result, individuals high in trait procrastination showed a higher risk of experiencing negative consequence of Internet use in other life domains. These negative repercussions of insufficiently self-regulated Internet use partially accounted for the detrimental effects of trait procrastination on stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings clearly underline the role of Internet use as an instrument for dysfunctional task delay. The implications of the results are discussed with regard to research on media use and self-control in general and procrastinatory media use in specific.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems
2016-0030,2016,Poster,Stressed by Smartphone Use? The Interplay of Motivation and Mindfulness During Instant Messaging,2,"The number of smartphone users worldwide is rapidly rising. However, there are only few and contradictory scientific findings about the users’ well-being in the context of smartphone use. The most popular applications are instant messengers (IM). Our study aims to understand under which conditions IM is related to stress. Based on Self-Determination Theory, we assumed that an autonomous motivation to use IM is associated with less stress. Furthermore, inferred from research on the relationship of mindfulness with well-being, we suspected a negative relationship between mindfulness during IM and stress. Finally, we hypothesized that a day-specific mindfulness might indirectly reduce stress by empowering people to use their devices more autonomously. We conducted a diary study with 211 participants who answered 868 short questionnaires on five consecutive days. The results of regression analyses supported our assumptions. We discuss implications of our findings and further methods of analyses.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Using structural equation modeling, we tested a two-step model that investigates (1) the extent to which adolescents’ need to belong and need for popularity were associated with an increased Facebook use, through fear of missing out and (2) the extent to which adolescents’ fear of missing out was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use, through an increased Facebook use. Adolescents (N = 402) completed paper-and-pencil surveys. Results indicated that adolescents’ need to belong and need for popularity were associated with an increased Facebook use through an increased fear of missing out. Fear of missing out, in turn, was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use through Facebook use. These results emphasize the role that fear of missing out plays in adolescents’ lives.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

However, little is known about whether app users are aware of and concerned about the data collection and usage practices of apps, whether they perceive themselves able to protect their privacy, and whether they actually engage in privacy protection. This study assesses app users’ current status of privacy knowledge, concerns, self-efficacy, and protection behavior, by surveying 1.593 app users about the 12 most popular mobile apps in a Western European country. The results demonstrated that app users know little about the data collection and usage practices of apps and that they are not very concerned about their privacy. Moreover, app users did not feel able to protect their privacy in apps and they did not engage much in privacy protection. Comparisons between apps and between differently concerned users showed that levels of privacy knowledge, concern, self-efficacy, and protection behavior may vary per app and per privacy-concerned segment.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

As predicted, high self-monitors were more likely to write about all four types of information typically posted on Facebook (location, action, social, and personal information) than low self-monitors. As the same time, high self-monitors were more concerned about authoritative figures and marketers finding their information on Facebook than low self-monitors. In addition to self-monitoring, different types of privacy concerns were associated with users’ likelihood of posting various types of information on Facebook: Concern for marketers had a negative influence on posting location information and concern for authoritative figures had a positive effect on posting what they are doing and whom they are with.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

In particular, this study investigates how the positive (i.e., site seals) and negative interface cues (suspicious download advertisements) drive users’ attitudinal changes and decision-making regarding information disclosure, and whether the position of cues on Websites matter. It employed a 3 (first order: no cue vs. positive cue vs. negative cue) x 3 (second order: no cue vs. positive cue vs. negative cue) fully-crossed factorial between-participants online experiment (N = 146). The results show the primacy effect of a negative cue, indicating that when people evaluate a Web site, they are more likely to be influenced by first impressions formed by the presence of a negative cue.

Yet, it is still unclear how they assess the security of online systems and reveal their private information online. Some scholars presume that users carefully evaluate the benefits and risks of information disclosure, following a “privacy calculus.” However, other scholars question this proposition and claim that users are driven by cues in the interaction context, which trigger cognitive heuristics about the safety and security of specific online transactions. This study examines 18 potential heuristics via a scenario-based survey of a representative sample of US nationals (N=786) in order to identify those that most strongly predict online information disclosure. First-cut analyses of data reveal that heuristics relating to sense of community and self-presentation promote disclosure whereas those pertaining to mobility inhibit disclosure.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Building on exemplification theory, social comparison theory, and the intersectionality hypothesis, the current study investigates if exemplar characteristics alter recipients’ general stigma-related attitudes towards individuals with a disability, and examines the role of recipient characteristics as moderators of the proposed relationships. Respondents read an article about an individual with a disability before completing a questionnaire that assessed five facets of stigmatization. Articles were manipulated regarding the gender, type of disability, immigration background, and sexual orientation of the depicted exemplar. Results support the assumption that exemplar characteristics affect readers’ general attitudes towards social groups, and that recipient variables play an important role in this process.

This project seeks to analyze how residential tenure and residents’ use of media and/or interpersonal communication impact their knowledge and use of health-enhancing resources (i.e., grocery stores, farmer’s markets and community gardens, and places to exercise) during a time of rapid neighborhood change. It uses data from surveys and focus groups in a gentrifying neighborhood in Los Angeles. Preliminary analyses of data suggest that communication network composition seems to play a greater, significant role in knowledge and use of health-enhancing resources among residents who are newer to a neighborhood, with media and interpersonal communication facilitating knowledge or use of different resources.

Liberal and conservative politicians differ in the complexity of their language and the noun usage. Yet, the present study takes the multi-dimensional nature of European political system into account and theorizes that language use correlates with pro- vs. anti-European ideology. Using a computerized content analysis, we measured the complexity and noun use of politicians from seven German parties between 2006 and 2015. The results show that a higher use of nouns is correlated with anti-European ideology, while linguistic complexity is not. Contrary to the expectations, conservative politicians use more complex language. The use of nouns and complexity does not differ over time, challenging the hypothesis that language use changes during situations that cause insecurity.

Constituting the single most commented issue in the FFC’s history, the organization found itself unable to analyze the “big data” comprising the “Open Internet Docket,” the public file pertaining to net neutrality. As such, the FCC turned to data scientists at large on the internet, publicly soliciting help on their website blog and publishing the Open Internet Docket data corpus. In response to the FCC’s call, this work uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to create topic modeling of the entire corpus of comments in the Open Internet Docket (N ≈ 3.7 million). With LDA, 1000 topics were generated and manually coded by two researchers, revealing 47 salient topics containing the most unique and telling words pertaining to net neutrality. The Open Internet Docket comments contain geographic data by state, city, and zip code, so the 47 significant topics were used to run multiple linear regressions with US Census data from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results reveal that the majority of comments were concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois; linear regressions show a distinctive use of word choice in comments according to household income; and political affiliation and household income are the strongest predictors for rates of comments submitted to the FCC among the 100 most active zip codes.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

While methodological literature has addressed questions of collection and analyzing large-scale datasets of media data, the step in between – the systematic storage – has been largely neglected, as has been the question where to situate preprocessing within the workflow. In this paper, we situate such considerations within the social-scientific research process and offer guidelines for deciding on a suitable data architecture. We show decisions on how to store the data influence later analysis.

2017-0007,2017,Poster,Tracing Patches: Introducing a Semiautomated Approach to Analyze Journalists’ Processing of Source Material,1,"The extent to which messages from a particular source are reproduced by others is a key question in communication research. In journalism studies for instance, there is considerable concern about journalists’ extensive reliance on subsidized content from sources and news agencies (‘churnalism’). Since journalists typically reformulate and rearrange source information rather than literally replicating it, computational approaches that focus on the literal copy-pasting of entire texts overlook an important dimension of source reliance. This study presents a semi-automated approach to trace this journalistic 'patch writing' by comparing source texts to news texts on a sentence level. In addition to offering a more refined view on churnalism, the approach can be used to study a variety of related research problems, including questions on news diversity (to what extent do news media re-purpose each other’s material?), sourcing bias (is the material of official sources systematically preferred over alternative sources?), and transparency (is the source attributed?).",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0008,2017,Poster,Hot Politics: Physiological Responses to Political Communication,3,"The “hot cognition” hypothesis suggests that every political construct is emotionally charged in the brain. The initial positive and negative emotions towards politics affect the ability to make rational decisions. Negative emotions occur when a person is exposed to counter-attitudinal political communication, while positive emotions should occur when a person is exposed to pro-attitudinal political communication. The current state-of-the-art employs self-reported survey items to measure the experienced emotions which mix the emotion with a cognitive rationalization of these emotions. Accordingly, we do not know politics is hot as we would expect based upon the “hot cognition” hypothesis. In a lab-study we assessed physiological responses – arousal (Electrodermal activity; Electrocardiography) and valence (Electromyography) -- to pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal political communication. In a sample of 146 adults, we find that exposure to counter-attitudinal political communication increases the heart-rate with 1-2 beats per minute. Accordingly, we provide evidence that politics is indeed ‘hot’.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

We propose that propagation between information sharers and receivers is driven by neural synchrony in brain systems associated with subjective valuation, self-reflection, and social cognition. To test this hypothesis, we measured neural activity as well as content-related preferences in information sharers while they were exposed to news articles and in receivers exposed to sharer-composed messages about the same content. We show that neurocognitive synchrony between sharers and receivers exists selectively within the hypothesized regions of interest, and only for communication partners, not randomly paired individuals who processed the same content without interacting. Further, the extent of neurocognitive synchrony covaried with the successful propagation of content-related preferences. Our results suggest that information propagation is supported by the transmission of sharer's content evaluations through sharer-receiver synchrony in a neural propagation system consisting of regions associated with valuation, self-reflection and social cognition.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0010,2017,Poster,Neural Correlates of Social Influence Across Socioeconomic Status,5,"People routinely change their preferences and behaviors in response to social influence. Early development, however, may change the way that the brain responds to social cues, and as such people from different cultural upbringings may be influenced through different neurocognitive pathways. Consistent with this logic, one potential moderator of brain-social influence relationships is socioeconomic status (SES). In our sample of young adults, those from high and low SES backgrounds conformed equally often; however, higher SES was associated with greater activity in one set of mentalizing (DMPFC) and positive valuation (VMPFC) regions, whereas lower SES was associated with activity in a different set of mentalizing (TPJ) and inhibitory control (inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus) regions when conforming to peer feedback. Thus, those from high and low SES backgrounds recruit different neural processes when conforming to peer feedback, despite the fact that their ultimate behaviors appear similar on the surface.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

We built predictive models that used brain responses to news articles to predict sharing of these articles in the broader population. We found 1) there were large individual differences in the predictive capacity of brain valuation responses and 2) these differences tracked with frequency of engagement with similar articles in daily life, such that frequent readers showed high ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) responses in general, whereas infrequent readers showed high vmPFC only to heavily shared articles. Follow-up analyses revealed that vmPFC predictivity tended to track with predictivity across a global brain network encompassing regions associated with valuation, social cognition, and controlled attention. These results provide a model of variability in brain predictive capacity for population sharing behavior, and identify individual differences in domain familiarity as a psychological source of this variability.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0012,2017,Poster,Reproductive Effort Interacts With Socioeconomic Status to Influence Support of Censoring Government Criticisms,2,"Drawing on life-history theory, we tested an evolutionary explanation of why individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more supportive than higher SES individuals of censoring government criticisms. According to this explanation, suppressing dissent helps enforce a secure environment, which will support one’s high reproductive effort (e.g., to reproduce early and in large quantities) better than an insecure environment. Lower SES individuals have stronger desires for collective security because they generally reproduce earlier and in large quantities. Indeed, our analyses of survey data (N = 34,986) showed that household fertility partially mediated the negative correlation between SES and support of censoring government criticisms. Household fertility also interacted with SES such that its effect was stronger for higher- than for lower SES respondents. This suggests that increases in reproductive effort render higher SES individuals more risk averse. These findings qualified a system-justification hypothesis and offered a novel explanation of “working-class authoritarianism.”",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

I examine the relationship between children’s game engagement and addiction tendencies and the moderation effect of parental mediation strategies-namely active and restrictive parental mediation, on this relationship. Results showed that game engagement was significantly associated with game addiction. For adolescents (12-16 years old), neither active nor restrictive parental mediation was significantly related to game addiction tendency or moderating the relationship between game engagement and game addiction tendencies. For pre-adolescents (8-11 years old), active parental mediation was positively related to game addiction regardless of children’s engagement level. However, only restrictive parental mediation moderated the relationship between game engagement and game addiction tendencies, depending on game engagement levels. For highly engaged gamers, game addiction tendency is similar regardless the frequency of restrictive parental mediation perceived. For lowly engaged gamers, higher restrictive parental mediation associates with higher addiction tendency.

Using intercultural competency as an analysis tool uncovers the underlying Westernized assumptions within the training used by IVHQ about how culture and communication are defined and interact. The training’s emphasizes center Westernized perceptions of culture and communication.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0007,2018,Poster,Beyond Soft Power: The Rise and Fall of Turkey’s Twitter Public Diplomacy,2,"This study follows up on the Uysal, Schroeder, and Taylor (2012)’s work on Turkey’s use of social media via Twitter as a means of public diplomacy. Turkey’s foreign policy has drastically changed since 2012 due to international changes that have occurred, such as the Syrian Refugee Crisis, the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. At the same time, domestic challenges such as the Gezi Park protests in 2013 and a failed military coup in July 2016, have led Turkey to drift away from the West. Five years later, this study follows up on Turkey’s current public diplomacy strategies and tactics through a qualitative content analysis of Twitter messages published by seven Turkish officials’ accounts between August 23 – November 1, 2017 N = 1,220). Applying Zaharna and Uysal’s (2015) four-quadrant model of framework to Twitter public diplomacy, this study contributes to the theorizing efforts in the new public diplomacy domain.",Public Diplomacy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0008,2018,Poster,Drawing Boundaries Between Actors of Public Diplomacy: A Structuralist-Functionalist Approach to Theoretical Models,1,"his paper depicts the theoretical framework of a structuralist-functionalist conceptualization of public diplomacy (in comparison to a functionalist one). Firstly, it introduces public diplomacy to the reader in terms of its definition in four different schools of thought. Secondly, it summarizes previous research and illustrates the problems of previous essentialist and functionalist approach to public diplomacy. Thirdly, in a structuralist functionalist approach, it re-conceptualizes the three of the actors in public diplomacy: the state, the mediator and the people. Last but not the least, it explains the relationships between the different types of actors with a one-sided ecology model, and the competitive nature of public diplomacy a two-sided negotiation model.",Public Diplomacy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0009,2018,Poster,"Essence of the Work and Diplomacy: Time’s United Nations Coverage, 1945-2015",2,"This study expands our understanding of Time’s coverage of the United Nations (UN)
from 1945 to 2015 to explain the organization’s mainstream media visibility, looking at how the news magazine’s news selection routine particularly with the UN stories changed over the years. This study shades light on the United Nations in light of its recent negative spotlight by its major Member State funder, the United States, which withdraw from UNESCO in 2017 and U.S. President Trump questioning the role of some UN agencies. In terms of media publicity of the UN’s missions, what international events/issues accounted for periods of Time’s high UN coverage; and how did the page quantity change, including topics and countries that dominated coverage? Results on those news selection routine variables show that Time’s news selection routine for the coverage of the UN decreased over the years. Briefly discussed is the UN’s public diplomacy image and implications.",Public Diplomacy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0010,2018,Poster,Performing Interstate Relations Through Amicable Actions,1,"The communicative problem guiding this study is how to foster amicable relations between states. Resorting to linguistic-pragmatics and international relations theories, it firstly aims at conceptualizing amicable actions and their potential to thwart escalatory processes or initiate, maintain, and restore solidarity-based and deference-based relations in interstate communication. On the basis of 2,180 amicable actions performed by a variety of international actors in a range of communicative contexts and corroborated by eight senior foreign affair policymakers, a classification that points to variations, goals, and prevalence of amicable actions is suggested. In the conclusions, I argue for the empirical importance and practical applicability of amicable actions and point to six challenges (situational, intentional, interpretative, power, cultural, and media-related) that need to be confronted in the future in order to answer the overarching question: Under what conditions do amicable actions achieve their ends?",Public Diplomacy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0011,2018,Poster,Computational Methods for the Critical Simulation of Image-based Social Media Platforms,3,"Social media platforms like Instagram are organised around creating, sharing and consuming images. Increasingly, platforms are engineering computer vision algorithms to classify, organise and act on their immense user-generated image databases. These algorithms are central to the advertising model and cultural impact of social media platforms, yet are not open to public scrutiny. Our interactive poster develops a computational framework that allows communication scholars ready access to a computational toolkit to simulate and interrogate the inner workings of these computer vision approaches. By building the image machines of social media platforms in the public domain, the project aims to enable critical understandings and analyses of how digital media shapes culture.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0012,2018,Poster,Development and Initial Validation of the Self-Transcendent Emotion Dictionary,2,"Recent years have seen a growing amount of research effort directed toward what positive psychologists refer to as self-transcendent or inspirational emotions, such as awe, admiration, elevation, gratitude, and hope. While these emotions are invaluable to promote greater human connectedness, an outward orientation, prosociality, and human flourishing, to date, researchers are not well-equipped to identify them either on mass media or private communication channels. Approaching from an interdisciplinary perspective, we aimed to construct a computational tool that can empower researchers to identify and analyze self-transcendent emotions among textual messages. To that end, we constructed and validated a dictionary tool that can be uploaded into the mainstream, textual analytic software (e.g., LIWC) to identify terms associated with transcendence-related emotional experiences as expressed in spoken and written languages. Potential applications for the newly developed tool and what it could mean for future studies of positive psychology are discussed.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0013,2018,Poster,Harnessing Collective Wisdom From Communication Patterns in Human Organizations,3,"The collective intelligence hypothesis purports that groups can be smarter than individuals in a wide range of decision-making problems. Attempts to tap the cognitive surplus of collectives have enhanced innovation, product design, and predictions about the replicability of scientific findings. A similarly important task is to improve organizational decision-making in financial investment firms. Financial companies invest public and private resources and thus their returns fundamentally affect retirement funds and planning, corporate earnings, and economic growth. Despite the far-reaching implications of good organizational decisions, the question about how communication dynamics within companies can result in collective intelligence requires further investigation. Can different patterns of communication or changes in the content of communication over the course of decisions be used to improve decisions? In this study, we show that collective intelligence signals deduced from communication patterns predict the movement of the market. Further, we find that the firm does not take advantage of the produced collective intelligence and that it could make superior decisions using communication-based collective intelligence signals.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0014,2018,Poster,Hollywood’s Political Space: Estimating Film Ideology From Revealed Preferences,2,"Traditional forms of film criticism have relied on subjective interpretation of, at most, only a few films at a time. These limitations are a product of the very real limitations on human attention that prevent scholars from watching every movie that has been released. As such, we propose a computational approach for estimating the latent political positions, what we refer to as \textit{film slant}, of over 5 million films. To do so, we adapt a Bayesian item response theory model for large sparse matrices intended for roll call analysis and apply it using an Expectation-maximization algorithm to trace user data in the form of film reviews (N=~20,000,000). We find that this method is valid, both in regards to the ideological positions of films, but also their viewers. We finally turn our attention to some substantive results and demonstrate, through an analysis of the dynamics of the central tendency of our set of films, that the film industry does not have any specific liberal bias, but rather partakes in a form of negative polarization in which the system responds in opposition to the ideological position of the sitting American president.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0015,2018,Poster,Theory-Driven Automated Content Analysis of Suicidal Tweets : Using Typicality-Based Classification for LDA Dataset,3,"This study provides a methodological framework for the computer to classify tweets according to variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We present a sequential process of automated text analysis which combined supervised approach and unsupervised approach in order to make the computer to detect one of TPB variables in each tweet. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), Nearest Neighbor, and then assessed “typicality” of newly labeled tweets in order to predict classification boundary. Furthermore, this study reports findings from a content analysis of suicide-related tweets which identify traits of information environment in Twitter. Consistent with extant literature about suicide coverage, the findings demonstrate that tweets often contain information which prompt perceived behavior control of committing suicide, while rarely provided deterring information on suicide. We conclude by highlighting implications for methodological advances and empirical theory studies.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0016,2018,Poster,Patriarchal Pits: The Gendered Experiences of Female Concert Photographers,1,"While the presence of women in photojournalism is increasing, the way they are treated by their male counterparts remains unbalanced. Through the lens of feminist theory and embodiment, this study examines how the gendered experience plays out for women in a particular niche of photojournalism, concert photography. Considered a branch of lifestyle journalism, concert photography provides a glimpse into our society and culture. In-depth interviews with male and female concert photographers show women still face a form of patriarchal oppression in the field. This is seen through gendered language, such as “one of the guys” versus a “mom in the pit,” embodied actions such as direct sexual harassment or indirect subtleties, and in how women are questioned when they identify themselves as a photographer.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0017,2018,Poster,Stereotypes of Appalachian Women: Communication of Stereotypes Through Literature,1,"The stereotype of Appalachian women can hinder their communication abilities through fear of confirming behaviors, traits, or attitudes associated with that stereotype. These stereotypes are continually communicated to various audiences through different media channels, including works written by women of the area. The continued representation becomes problematic as the women of the region internalize the stereotype, which leads to the appearance in their works even if they do not agree with that representation. The worst of these stereotypes allow women of the area to be dehumanized and essentially become a caricature to be referenced as hillbilly or mountain women. Using a literary analysis of three short stories produced by recognizable female authors of the region, the stereotype is identified within their works and leads to the discussion of the potential consequences for communication, as well as what the appearance of this stereotype means for the women themselves.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2018-0019,2018,Poster,Privatization in a Finnish Presidential Election. Coverage of Straight vs. Gay Spouses in Newspapers,1,"In the paper, the privatization of politics is considered by analyzing the newspaper coverage and imagery of two candidates’ spouses during the second round of the 2012 Finnish presidential campaign. During the campaign, the spouses were reported on more frequently than during previous campaigns; one couple was gay, and one was straight. What the newspapers reported about the spouses, how balanced the coverage of them was, and how intimate issues in the relationships were described in public were analyzed. The method was a qualitative content analysis. The results show the role of the spouse was treated as was traditional in newspapers, but a gay spouse muddled the traditional gendered frames a little. The level of privatization seemed to be high, and the couples used different strategies to protect their privacy. In addition, methodological challenges and the political meaning of the coverage of the spouses are discussed.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
