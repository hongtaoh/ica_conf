2014-0000,2014,Poster,Against Policy Failure: Designing a Media System That Enables “The Good Life”,1,"Any conception of the “good life” would likely include a media system founded on normative values like openness, diversity, and information rich. Enabling freedom of speech and other essential liberties, this system would need to be accessible and affordable to all members of society. However, commercialized media systems often run counter to these ideals. American digital communication systems have become dominated by oligopolies driven by a corporate libertarian logic—one that conflated individual freedoms with corporate privilege—that does not accommodate public interest principles in line with “good life” ideals.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0001,2014,Poster,Access to Knowledge and Cultivating the Good Life,1,"The Access to Knowledge [A2K] movement encompasses a broad theoretical, political and activist landscape that is concerned with the use of information and creative works outside the realm of intellectual property [IP]. A core principle of A2K is that the expansion of IP law is often anti-democratic, restrictive and an outright threat to cultural participation and creative practice. Restricting sharing, openness and access to information can prove a direct threat to “the good life” as imagined in an information society. In this position paper, I provide an overview of the problem of emerging IP enforcement regimes and explain how A2K approaches to information policy can cultivate social well-being.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0002,2014,Poster,Digital Human Capital: A Policy Framework for Transitioning From Digital Exclusion to a “Good Life”,3,"***This proposal is for the Communication Policy & Law extended session on ""The Good Life"" conference theme***

This position paper argues for policymakers to implement a Digital Human Capital framework for designing ICT programs. This approach would help move marginalized community members into mainstream society through computer literacy initiatives that also address social exclusion. It has the potential to shift digitally excluded residents from a life on the periphery to, ideally, a “good life” with professional and educational opportunities.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0003,2014,Poster,The Goods Life: Local Journalism From Public Good to Merit Good,1,"This position paper contributes to the discussion of how to ensure the sustainability of journalism by arguing for a rhetorical and semantic shift away from labeling journalism as a “public good” to thinking about it as a “merit good” (Musgrave, 1959). While public goods suggest regulatory intervention only to the point that “respect[s] the wishes of consumers,” merit goods suggest regulatory intervention regardless of consumption habits (Eecke, 1998, p.5). That is to say that merit goods are deemed so socially valuable that they should be provided regardless of consumer behavior. Positioning journalism as a merit good, rather than a public good lends political economic leverage for increased regulatory and legislative support for journalism, and may revive efforts to ensure the sustainability of journalism, particularly at the local level.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0004,2014,Poster,The Right to Communicate as a Foundation for the Good Life,1,"This position paper argues that communication is a basic human right, and therefore a fundamental aspect of the good life. Accordingly, the right to communicate should be formally codified in international human rights law. Human rights are international norms that protect each human being from an array of abuses and seek to identify basic needs necessary to lead a minimally good life. Human rights are a “realistic utopia” in that they institutionalize the utopian ideal of a just society in the laws of modern constitutional democracies (Habermas, 2010). These rights exist as ideal statements that may be embodied in laws and regulations at local, national, or international levels. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations, 1948) and other treaties serve as standards which identify norms to be embodied. In this regard, communication laws and policies can help to structure the good life within communities.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

Position Paper – Communication Law & Policy and “the good life”
Revenge Porn: Criminalizing the Posting of Provocative Pictures When Breakups Go Bad

It has been dubbed “involuntary porn.” A couple breaks up and one of the parties posts once-intimate nude photos of the other all over the internet – sometimes including identifying information such as the subject’s name and address.
Hurtful and humiliating, yes. But should such cruel conduct be criminalized? That’s the law on the books now in California and New Jersey, while other jurisdictions consider outlawing “revenge porn” in the digital age.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy

2014-0009,2014,Poster,Contexts of Digital Surveillance and Trust: Ethical Action and the Good Life,1,"Ethical and legal charges about digital invasions of privacy usually surface in response to some apparent surveillance. Nissenbaum (2010) claims that privacy can be understood within a structure of “contextual integrity” in which streams of personal data, originating in different social contexts, are handled by entrenched socio-legal conventions. These conventions may be violated by the monitoring practices associated with information technologies; thus contextual integrity is broken. Privacy violations, then, are judged in accordance with the goals and values of a specific context. This research proposes a contextual reading of surveillance as it pertains to Nissenbaum’s contexts of privacy and the notion of contextual integrity and ethics. Specifically, it examines principles of “the good life” in terms of ethical responsibilities in legal remedies for privacy violations. In what contexts do we expect surveillance? How do “caring” forms of surveillance modify our perceptions of privacy rights? What technological routines support surveillance? What are the implications for human dignity and respect? How have current legal regimes surrounding privacy neglected basic notions of humanity that contribute to “the good life”? Using a critical theoretical perspective, this paper seeks to understand what surveillance contexts mean for individuals in terms of values, the law, and morality.","Extended Session: Communication Law, Policy, and the ""Good Life""",Communication Law & Policy
2014-0010,2014,Poster,Available Resources as an Indicator of Brand Placement Processing,6,"The present study applies the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) to persuasive communication. Specifically, it aims to investigate whether and how (1) a brand logo placement in a video clip affects cognitive processing resources, and (2) the measurement of available resources with STRT reflects message elaboration. In a between-subjects experiment, 69 students were shown a video clip including brand placements with varying prominence. STRTs were measured immediately after the placement during the clip, and cognitive and affective processing measures were assessed after the clip. Analyses showed faster STRTs for prominent placements compared to nonprominent placements, and faster STRTs for nonprominent compared to no placement. This pattern indicated that with increasing logo prominence, message recipients had more resources available. The measured resources mirrored the cognitive and affective measures of message elaboration, indicating that brand logo prominence affects message elaboration, and that elaboration can be validly assessed through STRTs.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0011,2014,Poster,Beyond Time and Frequency: Attending to Attention in Media Multitasking,5,"The purpose of this study is to extend assessment of media multitasking to situations that involve more than two activities and to introduce attention as an additional outcome variable to time and frequency measures of media multitasking. Both frequency and attention measures supported the hypothesis drawn from limited capacity. Two-group multitasking activities were pursued more frequently than three-group multitasking activities and activities with TV/Video in the mix were pursued more frequently than activities without TV/Video in the mix. Further, attention allotted to the primary task decreased with increasing number of activities in the multitasking mix. The sharpest decline in attention to the primary task occurred when the number of activities increased from two to three. Overall, these findings suggest that time, frequency and attention are a triumvirate of variables that should be considered in concert when measuring multitasking.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0012,2014,Poster,Can Exemplars Trigger a Spiral of Silence?,3,"Research on exemplification has shown that exemplars can affect people’s perceptions of public opinion. More specifically, the distribution of exemplars, that is the proportion of individuals expressing a certain opinion, influences the way people perceive current opinion distributions in society. Climate of opinion perception is also an integral part of Noelle-Neumann’s spiral of silence theory which posits that people will fear to become socially isolated when they express opinions on morally loaded issues which contradict public opinion. They will therefore refrain from expressing such opinions in public. The current experimental study links research on exemplars and the spiral of silence by testing the effects of exemplar distributions on individual public opinion perception, fear of isolation, and the tendency to speak out. As a stimulus an online discussion group on Facebook was presented where we manipulated user comments regarding the issue of evicting violent immigrants.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0013,2014,Poster,Effects of Testimonial and Informational Comments on News Perception,2,"Online reader comments (ORCs) are located in close spatial proximity to the online news stories eliciting them. Previous studies have found that such ORCs can affect perception of news stories or issues discussed in them. The purpose of the current study is to build on this growing pool of literature on ORCs by examining how two types of ORCs found on health news websites, testimonial and informational, affect readers’ perceptions of credibility, newsworthiness, quality and liking of the professional health news content. The study will also investigate the possible moderating role of issue involvement.

2014-0014,2014,Poster,Engaging Readers: What Makes Readers Actively Seek More Information During Controversial Message Processing,5,"This study tests (1) the direct effects of personal traits, like need for cognition, open-mindedness, and issue interests, on information seeking behavior, and (2)whether the effects of these personal traits are contingent on characteristics of the issue context in which information seeking takes place. We use the emerging science of nanotechnology as a case study because, despite low levels of awareness (Smith et al., 2011), previous research has found that strongly held values and other types of heuristic cues are used by individuals to form opinions about the issue even in the absence of issue-related knowledge (Brossard et al., 2009). This work finds significant direct effects and interaction effects of personal traits and issue-interest factors on information seeking processes. Implications for the theoretical understanding of information processing of controversial science issues are discussed.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0015,2014,Poster,Exploring Effects of Controlled and Automatic Processes for Cognitive Information Processing on Perceived Interactivity,3,"The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) could offer an explanation for the automatic process of how an audience reacts to online interactive elements. The other explanation will be the audience’s intention for future use of the website.
RQ1: How does intention affect users’ perceived level of interactivity of the website?
H1: When exposed to self-relevant interactive features that are in-line with their intention, appetitive activation will be enacted, and memory span will be higher than when the users are exposed to other neutral stimuli.
RQ2: How are controlled and automatic processes for cognitive information processing taking place in the presence of different interactive elements?
The participants will be randomly assigned to a 3 (intention: exploratory vs. information-seeking for self vs. information-seeking to help others) x 3 (motivational state: appetitive vs. aversive vs. control) between-subjects design.

The stages from the Precaution Adoption Process Model were included in the analysis as a moderator. The PRISM fit the data well. Moreover, the results showed overall model differences among people who have not decided to take action about hydraulic fracturing, people who have decided to take action, and people who have decided not to take action.

2014-0017,2014,Poster,"Resources Available to Processing Antismoking PSAs as a Function of Smoking Cues, Argument Strength, and Structural Complexity",1,"The current study examines how cognitive resources are allocated and required to processing audio and video information of antismoking PSAs, as function of three message characteristics: the argument strength (AS) of messages, the presence of smoking cues, and the structural complexity. By conceptualizing the three variables in terms of resources required and resources allocated, this study predicts resources available to processing antismoking PSAs by employing Secondary Reaction Time Measures accompanied by audio and video recognition. This abstract reported preliminary result supporting that strong argument elicit more resource allocated and smoking cues have impact on both resource allocation and the amount of resources required to process. Further, the result also suggests that structural complexity should be considered to explore available resources influenced by various message’s features.",Cognitive Resource Allocation,Information Systems
2014-0018,2014,Poster,"GIFTS: Communication, Gender, and Theory: Exploring the “Good Life” of One’s Childhood",1,"Through this activity, students recognize and relate communication and gender theories to real life scenarios. By applying their own childhood experiences, students engage directly with gender and communication theories. Moreover, when students apply these course concepts to their own childhood memories, their individual voices and perspectives enter the conversation. This activity encourages students to be active learners and critical thinkers in the classroom. After discussing which theories students perceive impacted their childhood memories, the teacher should poll the students to see which theories resonated with them the most. Even though gender is a culturally based construct, students often do not perceive it as having an impression on their gender construction. Rather than the teacher imposing this message directly, the results of this activity provide students with the opportunity to assess to what extent gender is a perceived cultural concept in their interpretations about gender and their own identity construction.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2014-0021,2014,Poster,GIFTS: Intercultural Transmedia Storytelling,1,"“Intercultural Transmedia Storytelling” is a bold, engaging concept, which helps multilingual, multicultural students, coming from different educational systems, assessment and learning styles, find fresh, fun methods to develop their awareness of story, exposition, and the respective power of sound and image and their ability to communicate their ideas. Based on intercultural and media components, the content is adaptable and the structure is flexible enough that it can be easily adapted (in its entirety or by using individual components) to different circumstances, for workshops or courses and different age groups. The key components include harnessing the power of sound and the visual in conveying story, combining the components in various media and individual and group basic storyboarding and transmedia storyboarding exercises. “Presentation assessments” throughout allow the “storyteller” to understand the audience perspective as well in adapting content, format and style.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2014-0022,2014,Poster,GIFTS: Internet-Based Audience Awareness Activity,1,"This critical thinking activity was created for an online upper-division course taken by communication and writing majors. However, the activity could be used in any online or face-to-face course dealing with persuasion and reader/audience awareness. This activity helps students learn to tailor communication to a specific audience. After the activity, students are able to:

* Dissect an organization’s self-published documents to extract paradigms, priorities, and preferences.

* Predict whether a particular organization would likely accept a planned proposal.

* Defend their predictions with linguistic evidence found in the organization’s documents.

This activity allows online teachers to comment on student opinions conversationally and in front of the whole group, as is so often done in a face-to-face classroom. This activity encourages students to use the Internet to search for specific information, make a decision about that information, and find supporting evidence to justify that decision to others.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2014-0023,2014,Poster,GIFTS: Nonverbal Speech Delivery and Humor: Discovering the “Good Side of Your Face”,1,"This activity addresses the need for students to develop nonverbal delivery skills and improve their proficiency in critical thinking. First, it introduces students to the seven nonverbal behavioral categories of speech delivery. Class discussion is facilitated through the application of these ideas to popular television sitcoms. Because the students watch the video first without any sound, they are given the opportunity to critique the speaker’s performance of nonverbal cues. Once they listen to the speaker’s message with his/her nonverbal behavior, students determine to what extent the speaker’s nonverbal behavior is effective. By opting to focus solely on the nonverbal cues first, this activity connects a speaker’s core message to the nonverbal behavior he/she demonstrates. Students evaluate and critique the speaker’s nonverbal cues. Ultimately, the activity motivates students to learn more about enhancing their own speech delivery by constructively evaluating speech deliveries on sitcoms.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2014-0027,2014,Poster,GIFTS: Using the Sandtray to teach Mindfulness of the Good Life,1,"College students are at a time in their lives of developing identity and autonomy. However, they often get torn in our incredibly networked society between the goals their parents want for them, what society says is the best career, and what is currently reinforced in media. Ellen Langer writes about the importance of mindfulness in interpersonal communication. This activity uses a sandtray to increase intrapersonal awareness through art. Based on work done by Rachel Naomi Remen, a physician who has used the sandtray across multiple groups, this activity uses the sandtray as a tool to explore the Good Life. Using miniature toys, students create a picture of their life journey and examine the event schema and personal narratives they have developed.

2014-0029,2014,Poster,Complex Dynamic Systems in Communication Research,1,"Almost all communication research can be described as seeking to understand different types of dynamic systems--systems that change over time. This paper introduces mathematical properties of dynamic systems to communication research and discusses their implications for understanding communication phenomena. Using what can be described mathematically about such systems, scholars should be able to better understand and explain the predictive boundaries of their theories. Specifically, this paper argues first, that the majority of systems described in communication research are complex in nature, as they are made up of large groups of simultaneously interacting components. Then the paper describes major properties of such systems and their implications on predictability of behavior.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0030,2014,Poster,"A Dynamic, Human-Centered Conceptualization of Flow, Presence, and Transportation States",3,"This paper builds on previous conceptualizations of flow, presence and transportation from a motivated cognition perspective (Lang, 2006; Lang, 2009) and argues that they are the result of the motivated cognitive system, which is a self-organizing dynamic system composed of the human information processing and motivational subsystems, settling into different attractor states. Literature on each of the states was examined and predictions about their formation and concomitant cognitive and motivational responses were made based on theoretical statements of scholars in the field. In Study 1, predictions were made and generally supported regarding the types of motivationally relevant information that would create each distinct state. In Study 2, certain types of psychophysiological and behavioral responses were expected to be present during consumption of mediated messages previously identified as producing each distinct state. Limitations and conclusions are discussed, and future research is proposed.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0031,2014,Poster,A Simulation of a Dynamic Theory of Reasoned Action With Shock: Implications for the Fit of the Cross-Sectional Theory of Reasoned Action,5,"Recently, a longitudinal version of Fishbein and Ajzen’s (1975) TRA, the dynamic theory of reasoned action (DTRA), was developed (Boster, Shaw, & Liang, 2011). Simulations of the DTRA show that it predicts that the strength of endogenous autoregression parameters influences model equilibrium, on the fit of the cross-sectional model of the TRA, and on changes in the distributional properties of endogenous variables. This manuscript extends that program of research by simulating the effects of a shock, such as a persuasive message, to a system of attitudes (A), subjective norms (N), behavioral intentions (I), and behavior (B) that begins in disequilibrium (Simulation 1) and to a system that begins in equilibrium (Simulation 2) in the DTRA. Effects of a shock on the fit of the cross-sectional TRA model and on the number of trials required for A, I, B, and the four-variable system to reach equilibrium are assessed and discussed.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems

2014-0033,2014,Poster,Blending Behavioral and Cognitive Science to Produce a More Rigorous Theory of Human Communication,1,"This paper advances a paradigm of communication systems theory blending behavioral and cognitive sciences. The paradigm marries traditional communication science observation (behavioral science approach) to a model of neural processing from cognitive science. The mechanism tying the two together is neural synchronization. We explicate the distinction between behavioral science and cognitive science, propose a general theory of communication informed by cognitive and behavioral science, and provide a number of examples of how this theory/paradigm may expand our understanding of complex communication phenomena.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0034,2014,Poster,Can Identity Serve Simultaneously as a Moderator and Mediator of Communication Effects? Evidence for the Prism Model,2,"A recently proposed model of communication effects (the prism model; CITE WITHHELD) argues for the potential of identity to serve both as a moderator and mediator of communication effects on behavior-relevant outcomes. Although these intervening roles have been studied in previous work, typically only one of the roles is examined at a time. This may be surprising because highly influential views of identity including the social identity perspective suggest the potential for these roles to be co-occurring. The prism model brings these roles together in a simultaneous model with implications for hypothesizing about communication effects. This paper builds on conceptual development of the model by presenting empirical evidence based on re-analysis of experimental data. Results provide support for the prism model's propositions.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0035,2014,Poster,Comprehension Models of Audiovisual Discourse Processing,4,"The landscape model of comprehension maintains that comprehending involves integrating past knowledge and new information into a coherent situation model to make sense of interconnected concepts and ideas. Previous research testing the landscape model of text comprehension has primarily relied on factual stories. This study applied the landscape model to three clips from entertainment programming. Across all clips, the landscape model explained 85% or more of the variance in participants’ memory for the clips. In addition, the results support the more recent dual-code version of the landscape model, which assumes separate verbal and visual representations of the story in memory. Finally, this study begins to explore the potential merger of the landscape model and the event-indexing model. The event-indexing model hypothesizes five dimensions of information that are critical to narrative comprehension: time, space, motivation, causation, and entities. This study provides preliminary data supporting the value of merging these two models.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems

In the present paper we examine the concept of evaluation in the context of entertainment research with focus on movies. Our aim is to delineate the role of evaluation before, during, and after watching a movie and highlight its similarities and differences to common related concepts (e.g., enjoyment and appreciation). After selectively reviewing previous research that dealt with such concepts, we describe the associative–propositional evaluation model as a useful tool to unravel underlying psychological processes of movie evaluations and discuss its advantages for application in entertainment research.",Theories and Models of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0037,2014,Poster,3D Screening and Entertainment: A Model of Entertainment for Cinema,1,"3D screenings increased in popularity and it seems that 3D might be ready to stand the test of time. To examine the effect of 3D on the experience of entertainment we refer to the model of entertainment by Vorderer, Klimmt, & Ritterfeld (2004), in which technological as well as personal prerequisites can induce entertainment. The model was further adapted for the cinema context by including the appeal of special effects, fanship, age and gender. To figure out the impact of the suggested prerequisites we conducted a field study comparing the entertainment experiences of 2D and 3D audiences’ of the same fantasy movies in a between subject design (N= 289). Results showed that the technological features cannot predict entertainment. However, the feelings of presence, the appeal of the special effects and fanship are predictors for entertainment.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0038,2014,Poster,Egocentric Projection Into Story Characters,2,"Understanding how audiences perceive narrative characters is important to understanding how audiences engage in a story and how persuasive and/or entertaining narrative messages work. The current studies examine to what extent and when do audience members understand a character’s mental processing by egocentric projection—projection of the audience member’s own mental processes into the mind of the character. The results of two experiments indicate that this depends on a number of factors including familiarity with the character, whether audiences anchor on the self, availability of mental resources and existence of competing stereotypes. Overall the results support theories indicating that egocentric projection is most likely for unfamiliar characters. This study helps clarify some common misunderstandings of egocentric projection and shed light on the mechanism of narrative processing.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems

We conducted an experimental study during the 2013th European soccer Champions League Finals in London, focusing on supporters of the final teams Borussia Dortmund and FC Bayern München. Fans were compared on media entertainment experience as well as the fan-specific involvement in terms of the affective impact of the game. Furthermore, it was examined whether different fan groups show different cognitive processing patterns of the game. Results show stable but strongly diverging fan cultures that influence the cognitive processing of the game.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0040,2014,Poster,Media Entertainment and Well-Being: Linking Hedonic and Eudaimonic Entertainment to Media-Induced Recovery and Vitality,4,"This paper addresses the notion of two-factor models of entertainment and their impact on well-being via a hedonic and a eudaimonic route. It is suggested that media-induced recovery and the satisfaction of respective needs can provide an important link in bridging these two entertainment experiences (hedonic and eudaimonic) with well-being after media consumption. Using structural equation modelling, relationships between hedonic/eudaimonic entertainment experiences, involvement, enjoyment, recovery experience and vitality as recovery outcome were tested experimentally (N=120). Results suggest that satisfying recovery needs is achieved via hedonic as well as via eudaimonic experiences by enhancing either relaxation or mastery. Both pathways to recovery are positively related to an increase in vitality and thereby able to foster well-being.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0041,2014,Poster,Same Same But Different: Antecedents and Consequences of Eudaimonic Entertainment in a Political Format,1,"Two studies were conducted to look into the influence of entertainment experiences as need satisfaction on information processing. Self determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and the affect infusion model (Forgas, 1995) serve as theoretical basis. First, an online survey (N = 82) aimed to establish existing measures in the new context of political talk shows and test the hypotheses without the influence of a laboratory setting. In the second study a 2 x 2 x2 (autonomy on/off, competence on/off, positive/negative video) mixed design laboratory experiment with 94 subjects was conducted to account for the causal relationship between needs and entertainment experience. Results from both studies support an influence of need satisfaction on eudaimonic entertainment. Furthermore, an influence of eudaimonic entertainment on substantive processing is established.

However, observing other’s goal achievement may explicitly encourage people to model the observed behaviors. In an experiment, participants read a story in which a story character succeeded in losing weight (goal-achieved) or failed it (goal-failed), and she continues or discontinues pursuing that goal. When the story character continued to pursue the goal, readers implicitly pursued the observed goal more than when the character discontinued it while the story character’s goal achievement did not have an effect. On the other hand, when the character’s goal was achieved, as readers perceived more similarity with the story character, explicit behavioral intention toward diet-related behaviors increased. The results indicate vicarious goal satiation occurs because story characters stopped pursuing the goal—not because they succeeded or failed.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0043,2014,Poster,"The Influence of Media Portrayals of Care, Loyalty, and Purity on Elevation and Connectedness With Humanity",5,"The purpose of this research was to examine how media portrayals of morality focused on care, purity, or loyalty interact with the moral domains of viewers to elicit the emotional response of elevation and resultant feelings of connectedness with humanity. An experiment was conducted, with results showing that the portrayal of care elicited the strongest feelings of elevation, followed by loyalty. Both of these portrayals were associated with feelings of greater connectedness, mediated by elevation responses. The effect of care portrayals was most pronounced among viewers with progressive moral attitudes emphasizing care and fairness over loyalty, purity, and authority. The portrayal of purity not only failed to elicit moral evaluation, but appeared to dampen this response among individuals higher on progressive moral attitudes.",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0044,2014,Poster,Viewing Meaningful Entertainment and Altruistic Behavior: Investigating Potential Mediators,2,"Recent research has shown that exposure to meaningful entertainment media content, or that which shows examples of moral beauty, may influence not only affective responses, but also altruistic behavior. This process has been said to be an effect of a set of feelings referred to as “elevation,” although the processes by which the effects take place have not been explored. This experiment (N=107) showed that participants watching a meaningful clip of a television show were more likely to engage in helping behavior than those who watched a non-meaningful clip. The effect of the clip was mediated by the degree to which the clip produced mixed affective response in participants. Although clip meaningfulness led to increased empathy with the character and increased feelings of elevation, neither of these predicted helping behavior after controlling for clip meaningfulness. Helping behavior also increased when the help recipient was less similar to the participants (age, race, and university affiliation).",Psychological Processes Underlying Mediated Entertainment,Information Systems
2014-0045,2014,Poster,Communication Can Reduce Stereotyping Behavioral Decisions,3,"Stereotypes are oversimplifications of a complex social environment, and they can contribute to a host of social problems. Based on decision science literature, we conceptualize stereotype decisions as a hybrid of both rule-based and experience-based decision process, and explore how feedback of decisions and the way we communicating categorization information during the decision process can help reduce stereotyping behavior. We designed a novel decision game experiment to study how people make interpersonal interaction decisions based on the stereotypes provided in the cover story at the beginning of the game and trial-by-trial feedback over time throughout the game. In addition, the decision trials required different communication effort for the categorization information during the decision process. Through a multilevel time series logit model, we found that communication of categorization information and feedback information can significantly reduce stereotyping behavioral decision.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0046,2014,Poster,How Do Men and Women Self-Present in Online Business Networks: A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis,2,"While Facebook predominantly caters for the needs of private self-expression, the self presentational features of business networking sites (BNS) like LinkedIn and XING serve more professional impression management purposes (van Dijck, 2013). Besides contact lists and (discussion) groups, these networks feature detailed information on working history, as well as categories regarding personal but job-related information but have so far largely been ignored. In the context of discussions about a wider inclusion of women in the workforce, it is worthwhile to investigate similarities and differences in the use of self-presentational resources that might have consequences with regard to visibility and hiring probability. One can expect differences between men and women resulting from gender roles and stereotypes that suggest corresponding behavioral preferences. The study analyzes similarities and differences in the profiles of men and women with regard to the outer form, quantitative aspects, and qualitative presentation, finding that there are indeed several differences.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0047,2014,Poster,Online Interruptions: Relevancy of Media Richness Theory,3,"Media Richness Theory is one of the controversial theories in CMC research.The theory assumes that media differ in their ability to carry varied types of information and ‘Social Richness’.This study examines the role of richness of interruption messages effect on cognitive performance quality. An experimental research design utilized a computerized simulation game to measure participants' cognitive performance. 114 participants were assigned randomly to four groups and one control group. Manipulation achieved by exposing participants to messages (using ‘Push’ technology) in Mobile phones (SMS/MMS) and online application (text/banner). A significant difference between experimental groups was found regarding the time of the task. Analysis also reveals a significant effect of the richness of the message and a main effect of the media type.This research seeks to broaden our understanding of the incorporation of information technology, such as mobile phones and the Internet, as an integral part of the workplace.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0048,2014,Poster,Online and Retrospective Negation of Media Stereotypes,2,"The present study investigated the negation (e.g., “No! This is not true!”) of media stereotypes and its consequences on media-induced changes of prejudice. This study is the first to measure negation during exposure by utilizing a process-oriented continuous measurement approach with eye tracking methodology. The data show that individuals negated the repeated depictions of the “criminal foreigner” stereotype during reception (online) as well as in a subsequent situation (retrospective). However, they rarely negated the stereotypic information directly at the moment of encoding. This is unfortunate, because scholarship has indicated that negation directly at the moment of encoding may have important beneficial consequences. In addition, this study investigated negation’s consequences on media-induced attitude change: Whereas some scholars have argued that media effects on attitudes typically occur during exposure, others highlighted the situation when the attitude judgment is constructed. Our data emphasize the importance of the judgment construction situation.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems
2014-0049,2014,Poster,Parsing Gender Gaps on News Memory Making and Decay,4,"This experiment investigated gender differences in audiovisual news acquisition by manipulating emotional personalization in stories and measuring memory and comprehension at two time points, one week apart. Data (N=80) offer evidence that gender gaps are intricate and resisted uniformity across three memory and five comprehension measures. Over time, memory decay showed up strong but without substantial gender variance. Free recall tests point to women as having an edge over men. Recognition and comprehension did not vary across gender but men were more efficient (used fewer words) than women in articulating what they learned from news. Education of participants (a control factor) revealed that highly educated women gave lengthy responses to open-ended items without improving accuracy in articulating the main point of stories. Taken together, these findings reveal the value of employing multiple memory measures to map an overview of where future gender gap studies might be productively focused.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems

2014-0051,2014,Poster,No Woman No Cry?: How Televised Women’s Football Affects Moods and Judgments,3,"The objective of this article is to improve the understanding of mood and judgment effects evoked by major televised sport events like national football matches. According to disposition theory of sport spectatorship, viewers’ affective experiences, specifically their moods, are assumed to be effected by the outcomes of the matches they watch. This study tests whether these mood effects depend on viewers’ team identification as well as viewers’ sex. Moreover, past research has indicated that mood changes as effects of sport viewing could influence viewers’ subsequent judgments in line with feeling-as-information theory. Based on this line of arguments, a quasi-experimental pre-post-test study with 180 participants was conducted to assess the moods and judgments (self-confidence, evaluation of the economic situation, government satisfaction) of viewers before and after a win and a defeat of the German national football team during the 2011 women’s FIFA World Cup. The results support disposition theory of sport spectatorship as well as feeling-as-information theory and give new insights into the moderating role of team identification and sex.","Analyses of Stereotypes, Gender Roles, and Expectancy Violations in Media",Information Systems

The main aim of this study is to investigate which adolescents receive negative feedback on social network sites, based on three types of individual susceptibility: (a) developmentally-based susceptibility, (b) dispositionally-based susceptibility, and (c) socially-based susceptibility. In addition, this study investigates why these adolescents receive negative feedback by examining two possible underlying mechanisms: the frequency of adolescents’ social network site use and their online self-disclosure.

2014-0054,2014,Poster,Audience Targeting Strategies for Seeking Information on Facebook,2,"Because Facebook acts simultaneously as a social and informational resource, using the site to seek information has become common practice. Social networks provide better information for more nuanced needs and may offer additional social benefits. However, little is known about how to access knowledge that various topic experts in these networks hold. By targeting specific friends using the various communication features offered by Facebook, individuals may obtain more relevant information with less network disruption. The present study uses a within-subjects experiment in which participants ask a question of their Facebook networks using four audience targeting strategies ranging from public to private: 1) status update to the full network, 2) status update to a custom audience, 3) post on a friend’s wall, and 4) private message. The results of this study will reveal which strategies of seeking information on Facebook are most successful, in terms of both social and informational outcomes.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0055,2014,Poster,Credibility of Anonymity in Third-Party Content Online,2,"A growing controversy over communication and pseudonymity online has led many news organizations to ban the use of pseudonyms in online commenting (e.g., The Buffalo News and the Voice of San Diego). This trend has developed without sufficient empirical evidence to show that pseudonymous comments are less civil or less credible (Reader, 2012; Sullivan, 2010). This study will attempt to move us closer to a more thorough understanding of reader perception of the credibility of online comments. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion, this study will examine whether levels of anonymity (providing pseudonyms vs. real names) really make a difference from the perspective of a reader. More specifically, we investigate whether individual difference variables, specifically people’s tendency to think deeply about issues, and the comment’s argument strength can affect how credible readers perceive the source of the comments to be in the presence or absence of source’s real identification.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0056,2014,Poster,Discussing News on Facebook? The Interplay of Sharing of and Commenting on Online News Articles,3,"Similar to interpersonal communication, social media enable both manifestations of diffusion and discussion of online news content in one platform. On Facebook, content can be “shared”, i.e., posted in one’s own profile and thus allowing for further dissemination within the private social network and comments on the post, which falls within the realm of follow-up communication. In order to shed further light on this double-role of Facebook in news diffusion, we analyzed the interplay of Facebook sharing and commenting behavior of online news content. In order to do so, we developed a large-scale driven methodical framework which matches standardized information on online news articles with the available indicators of interest on Facebook (i.e., comments, shares). Altogether, 39,386 articles from major online news outlets in Germany and the U.S. were analyzed, summing up to a total of 10,972,128 observations of sharing and commenting behavior of these articles.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0057,2014,Poster,Friends Without Benefits? The Effects of Message Valence on the Willingness to Respond to SNS Status Updates,2,"The present study aims at exploring the communicative norms and expectations in Social Network Sites (SNSs). We argue that a “positivity bias” in SNS communication can restrict the availability of public social support via public responses to status updates. Our data derived in an online experiment (N=870) show that users are significantly less willing to respond to a negative status update with a public comment than to a positive status update. In contrast, users show a higher willingness to react to a negative status update with a private message than to a positive status update. These effects were moderated by the strength of the relationship between the sender and receiver of the status update and mediated by perceived message appropriateness and perceived need for social support. The results suggest that SNS users tend to canalize supportive reactions to negative experience of their SNS friends through private modes of communication.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems
2014-0058,2014,Poster,"Social Media, Social Support, and Solitude Among College Students",4,"Mental health problems, such as stress, depression, and fear of loneliness, are an increasingly serious problem among college students. A recent study by American College Health Association (ACHA, 2012) shows, more than 25% of college students have been diagnosed or treated by a professional for a mental health condition within the past year. College students tend to suffer from mental health problems for a variety of reasons. Being away from families and friend circles, facing new and unfamiliar environment, and peer pressures and fear for uncertainty all contribute to the problem (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2012). Naturally, social support gained through social network has been proposed to be a plausible buffer protecting college students from mental illness (Feyza et al., 2008). The proposed study aims to examine the relationship between social media use and social support among college students, and propose constructive ways that social media can be used to help build social support among college students.",Online Media I: Analyses of Communication Processes,Information Systems

Due to the increasing importance of social networking sites as sources of information, news media organizations have set up Facebook channels in which they publish news stories or links to articles. This research investigated how journalistic texts are perceived in this new context and how reactions of other users change the influence of the main articles. In an online experiment (N = 197), a Facebook posting of a reputable news site and the corresponding article were shown. The type of user comments and the number of likes were systematically varied. Negative comments diminished persuasive effects of the article, particularly when they included arguments instead of subjective opinions. However, huge number of likes did not lead to conformity effects.

2014-0061,2014,Poster,A Case Study in Computational Content Analysis: Comparisons of Sentiment Analysis Methods on News Media,1,"The advent of the Internet has been a boon for the field of communication. The digital mediums of online communication platforms hold promise for a new era of quantitative, data-driven analyses of communicative behaviors. Content analysis specifically stands to benefit greatly from advances in computer science, particularly text as data approaches. However, not all computational methods are equally suited to the content analysis domains typically studied in communication. In this paper, I survey existing text as data methods as they pertain to sentiment analysis, including the assumptions that are foundational to each method (and which are often ignored in the pursuit of automated content analysis). I review the practicalities of each of these approaches as they pertain specifically to the types of content analysis performed in social science as opposed to computer science. Finally, I present an analysis of the relationship between average daily news sentiment for 24 news outlets on presidential favorability ratings that allows for the comparison of each of these methods against each other. I find that the daily average sentiment computed by these models produce point estimates that are substantively and significantly different from each other. Additionally, I find evidence that the use of one model over another can lead to substantively different inferences regarding the relationship of news sentiment to public opinion.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems
2014-0062,2014,Poster,A New Content Analysis Methodology: A Comparison of ExxonMobil’s CEO Corporate Citizen Report Letters for 2002 and 2012,2,"This study proposes a text network analysis (TNA) method of content analysis that is different in four important ways from traditional approaches. First, this computational approach employs TNA connectedness measures of betweenness centrality and degree common in network analysis eliminating the need for subjective validity and reliability coding. Second, TNA measures are not based on the most frequently counted words, but emphasize relationships or connections among words or communities of words. Third, our TNA is informed by the Landscape Model of Reading Comprehension, which is a reader oriented theory, therefore focusing on the message that is likely received from reading the content. Last, TNA provides a graphical visualization of the analysis that provides an easily understood overview of the entire text. The graphical depiction clearly identifies key words and major themes. We illustrate the benefits of this method by analyzing the 2002 and 2012 ExxonMobil CEO CSR introductory letters.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems
2014-0063,2014,Poster,Development of a Short Measure of Media Multitasking for Adolescents,3,"Despite increasing research interest in media multitasking, there is a lack in measures of media multitasking that can be used with younger people. The aim of the present study was to develop a new measurement of media multitasking that is 1) short but still able to fully capture the concept of media multitasking, 2) normally distributed among adolescents, and 3) internally and externally valid. Data for this study were collected at six urban and suburban high schools. In total, 523 adolescents aged 11 to 15 (48.2% girls) participated in this study. The short measure seems to be a reliable and valid measure of media multitasking that is normally distributed among adolescent samples. Due to its brevity it can be easily applied in survey studies among children and adolescents. Because of its high utility it may be an adequate alternative for existing extensive measures of media multitasking.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

In testing, researchers often face a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency specifically with regard to the number of raters per message. In this light, the current study examines how the number of raters affects the accuracy of overall ratings relative to the population. Five data sets evaluating anti-smoking messages were utilized. Bootstrapped samples and populations are compared using various techniques. Results suggest that after 23 to 25 raters per message, increasing the number of raters does not enhance evaluation accuracy appreciably. Nonetheless, variation across messages and tolerance level for misclassification may require more or fewer raters per message.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

Without such systematic research, it is difficult to know the true effect of media violence exposure on aggressive behavior. To enable critical evaluations of past studies, as well as optimal measurement in future research, this study assesses the reliability and validity of two commonly used self-report measures of exposure to violence in TV shows and games (direct estimates and favorites). We use data from a longitudinal survey with a sample of Dutch adolescents aged 10 to 14. The results will be interpreted alongside the strengths and weaknesses of each of the measures, showing that apart from reliability and validity, utility is a third important characteristic of media exposure measurement. This study will provide important information to researchers as they make decisions about which media exposure measurement to use within their own research.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems
2014-0067,2014,Poster,Using a Response Deadline Procedure to Understand How People Process Alcohol PSAs,5,"Positive portrayals of alcohol in drunk-driving PSAs (e.g., presentation of alcohol in a positive social setting) may increase the accessibility of pro-alcohol attitudes which suggests that anti-alcohol advertisements may be interpreted as pro-alcohol at a very early stage in the processing of the PSAs. To test whether people are initially interpreting certain anti-alcohol advertisements as pro-alcohol, a response deadline procedure was used. Participants made judgments of whether an advertisement was pro- or anti-alcohol at one of three response deadlines: 800, 1600, or 2400 milliseconds. Response deadline procedures are more sensitive to the effects of relatively fast, automatic interpretations of public service announcements because the procedure controls for the effects of relatively slow developing strategic or controlled processes. The results suggest that drunk=driving PSAs that include visuals with alcohol prominently displayed in a positive way are incorrectly interpreted as pro-alcohol advertisements even after 2400 milliseconds of exposure to the advertisement.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

This process, however, is not perfect due to systematic and idiosyncratic biases of journals, editors, and reviewers. In an attempt to increase the transparency of the review process, we launched an independent website that archives and aggregates feedback by users about their experiences with academic journals' review processes. We present in-progress analyses of N = 110 reports on descriptive statistics, as well as relationships between journal characteristics (e.g., impact factors) and their evaluations. This in-progress study’s contribution is threefold: 1) to evidence the utility of a public repository of authors’ review experiences as a check of journals’peer-review processes, 2) to identify trends and patterns in peer-review processes, and 3) to identify predictors of author perceptions of review quality.",Advances in Measurement and Methodology,Information Systems

Park et al. (2013) reported that the additional dimension in the visual field increased cognitive load for individuals to process information, which resulted more cognitive effort paid and poorer performance in information processing.
This study attempts to extend the findings from Park, Lee, Lee, & Kim (2013) by adding another concept to the picture: information introduced. Ongoing study is collecting data (target N=60) and this extended abstract will provide some of the preliminary results from data gathered to date.
Results from data collected to date shows general support for LC4MP, which suggests 3D technology leads to early cognitive overload for viewers. Implications from this finding is that structural features that consume cognitive resources needs to be used even more carefully in 3D environment in order to successfully deliver information to viewers.
an experiment has been designed using video clips varying in its density of structural features and levels of arousing content. The results provides general support for LC4MP, suggesting that additional dimension in the visual field provided by 3D technology do increase the cognitive load in processing mediated messages.

The central hypothesis within this approach suggests that the emotional tone of the message preceding the to-be-remembered content influences the encoding strategy for that content by signaling to a cognitive system which motivationally relevant content should be prioritized during encoding. The framework suggests that positive emotional tone vs. negative emotional tone support different information processing strategies and as a result, they can produce different outcomes for information processing. The main propositions of the framework are described and initial empirical evidence from three experiments is reported. The results are discussed in light of theory advancement.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems

Recognition percentages of 193 PSAs derived from campaign evaluation studies were related to content analysis data of the ads measuring the number of camera changes per second and the information introduced per camera change. The study reveals increasing the number of camera changes may slightly increase PSA recognition if the amount of information introduced by these camera changes is small, but increasing the number of camera changes tends to decrease PSA recognition substantially as the amount of information introduced by these camera changes increases. Combined, the number of camera changes per second and the information introduced per camera change account for 5% of the variance in PSA recognition. These findings corroborate theoretical propositions from the LC4MP outside the laboratory setting.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0072,2014,Poster,How Perceived Information Quality of Online News Sources Determines Political Knowledge Through Self-Efficacy,1,"The Internet is a challenging news source. Young users have to choose between so-called ‘quality media’ and diverse semi-professional or non-professional sources. We suggest that the perceived information quality of online news sources plays a crucial role in the acquisition of political knowledge. Based on self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977, 1986) we propose that in the course of an individual’s media socialization, perceived information quality, media self-efficacy, internal political efficacy, and political knowledge should be understood as consecutively linked.
Based on a student sample (N = 560), aged 12 to 22 (M = 16.04, SD = 1.37), our assumptions were supported for general online news exposure. Further, we examined whether the model holds true for professional, semi-professional and non-professional information sources. Here a more complex picture revealed.

Despite these efforts, graphic and fear-inducing health warnings have been considered to potentially trigger extreme fear and defensive reactions, such as message rejection or avoidance (i.e. Ruiter, 2005). To confirm this with real-time reactions, this study will investigate how the emotional intensity of visual images and color of text used in health warning messages impacts cognitive and emotional processing of the message in a 3 (Visual Image Intensity) X 2 (Text Color) X 3 (Message) X 3 (Order) within subjects repeated measures design.

Being reminded as such may play a role in the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated adaptive ability. The study asked whether the likelihood of being reminded to an “old” situation by an analogous “new” situation is influenced by: (a) four types of similarity between the two scenarios; (b) amount of elaboration on the old scenario; (c) number of times the old scenario was thought about; and (d) extent to which the earlier episode was interesting or emotional. Results showed that participants were reminded to more old situations when they elaborated on the old situations than when not, and when the old situations were processed twice, rather than once.

In general, pictures and words did show different motivational activation responses across the time course. Pictures showed greater motivational activation, while words showed lesser activation initially but showed a second firing response that generally increased motivational activation. This supported these theoretical predictions. Movement as it relates to the imminence of threats and opportunities in our environments was also investigated, but results did not follow predicted lines. Implications and future research are discussed.",Analyses of Content and Structural Features of Messages,Information Systems
2014-0077,2014,Poster,Emotional Cues and Thought Confidence in Persuasion: Attitudinal and Behavioral Outcomes,2,"Substantial work has examined persuasion using the Elaboration Likelihood Model which examines the dual routes. Recent revisions of the model suggest that thought confidence can serve as a mediator for persuasion by affecting attitude change. The present study sought to replicate and expand the previous work done on thought confidence by looking at thought confidence’s effect on behavioral intention. Participants were exposed to brief strong or weak ads advocating donations to animal shelters accompanied by happy or sad music and photos. Replicating prior research, thought confidence mediated attitude change. In addition, thought confidence was also found to mediate the relationship between posttest attitudes and behavioral intention. Furthermore, the emotional frame manipulation replicated past work finding that the happy condition led to increased thought confidence. Finally, analysis of message bias showed an effect of emotional frame such that sad-framed messages were seen as more biased which led to decreased posttest attitudes.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

2014-0079,2014,Poster,Is Personalization Too Fragile to Work? How Priming and Need for Uniqueness Influence the Effectiveness of Personalized Communication,2,"Personalized communication is becoming an industry trend due to rapid development of Internet technologies. A personalized message is believed to be more efficacious than a non-personalized message because it creates a match between the message and the message receipt. The current study challenges this widely-accepted notion by arguing that personalization may not always outperform non-personalization since the effectiveness of a personalized message can be affected by both external factors (e.g., the context where the message is placed) and internal factors (e.g., the message recipient’s personality). Through a 2 (message type: personalized vs. non-personalized) × 2 (prime type: positive vs. negative) × 2 (need for uniqueness: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment with 223 adults, it is illustrated that a personalized message is more effective than a non-personalized one only when the immediate message context suggests so (when the prime is positive), and such a phenomenon is especially characteristic of individuals with a lower need for uniqueness. Theoretical and practical implications based on these findings are discussed.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems
2014-0080,2014,Poster,Killer Ads: A Terror Management Account of Fear in Advertisements,4,"Building on terror management theory, three experiments tested whether advertisements with a mortality reminder increase purchase intentions for products that provide an (un)important source of self-esteem. Study 1 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) design for art library and newspaper subscriptions. Study 2 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) x 2 (brand familiarity: low vs. high) design for newspaper subscriptions. Study 3 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) x 2 (product type: healthy vs. unhealthy) design for a beverage with importance of the product for consumers’ self-esteem as a continuous moderator. Across studies advertisements with a death reminder increased unconscious thoughts about death, which, in turn, increased purchase intentions. These effects occurred independent of mood, brand familiarity, product type, product relevance to self-esteem, and ad liking. Findings suggest that ’killer ads’ trigger unconscious consumer fears that may be alleviated by the urge to buy.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

Using the mere thought protocol, the study found that message conformity effects explain 350% more variance in attitudes than the traditional account of consistency-induced persuasion. The message conformity effects were predicted by the discrepancy propositions of information processing theory. Participants at a large eastern university (N = 232) were randomly assigned to receive the mere thought induction or a distraction task in a pretest-posttest control group design. Topic familiarity was also manipulated in the design. Regression analyses indicated that receivers’ perceptions of their referent group’s attitude toward the target concept, combined with their premessage attitude toward the target concept predicted attitude change. Causal modeling was used to track the effect of target attitudes on the rest of the attitude hierarchy.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

This study collected data in France (N = 372) and the US (N = 240) to test a 3 (direct request, polite request, or BYAF) X 2 (requester benefits or 3rd party group benefits) design. The study was designed to offer a critical test of the reactance and the reciprocal politeness explanations of the technique. The French sample replicated the effectiveness of the technique and was consistent with the reactance explanation. The American sample did not replicate the technique but found an increase in compliance for the polite request, but only when the requester was the beneficiary. Possible explanations for the discrepant findings are discussed.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

In the worst case, the attempt to rectify misinformation can lead to solidification, resulting in even more people remembering the misinformation as true. So far, this so called backfire effect has been found in the context of health statement. In the present study, we transfer this phenomenon to the media environment and can show that misremembering myths as facts also occurs when misinformation is presented within an interview. Furthermore, we identify two moderators that amplify the backfire effect: The repetition of the myths before its rectification and the judgment formation strategy. Furthermore, results show that this flaw in memory also has consequences for people’s attitudes.","Persuasion, Compliance, and Attitude Change",Information Systems

However, the field of journalism remains divided along gender lines. Female journalists are underrepresented in older age groups and in media sectors, news areas and positions that are associated with high levels of prestige. The goal of our research was to study whether and how female journalists experience gender-related obstacles in their professional life. We examined this by means of in-depth interviews with 19 female journalists in Flanders (Belgium). The analysis confirms the existence of all ‘traditional’ barriers that women experience in journalism. The added value of this study is that we registered several additional difficulties, and that we gained insight into the strategies that our respondents use to deal with these gender-related barriers, and prevent them from having a negative impact on their job satisfaction (support of a partner, part-time or freelance work, use of digital technology, …).",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: International Communication Association Annual Awards and Presidential Address

My paper argues that it is in the negotiation of this contact via the cell phone that students creatively negotiate their sexual identity. Based on my own research (interviews, focus groups, and surveys) at an American liberal arts college, I discuss how students, in extensively texting for sex, experience a disconnect between their subversive behavior in hookups and their hegemonic explanations of campus sexual culture. Drawing on two divergent models of mediated self – Turkle’s “collaborative self” (2011) and Bauman’s egocentric consumer self (2003) – I explore how and why the mobile phone allows men and women to play with gender boundaries. Applying a feminist critique to texting for sex, I evaluate the impact of these revolutionary sexual subjectivities within a highly dominant fraternity culture.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: International Communication Association Annual Awards and Presidential Address

Previous work utilizing this and other scales has had low explained variance and null results. The current study utilized a grounded research approach to generate items for a homophily scale that were based on how participants made judgments of homophily in natural settings. Results suggested that some items utilized in previous homophily studies (e.g., demographics and physical appearance) were, indeed, unimportant when individuals were making similarity judgments.

Informed by the Common Ingroup Identity Model (CIIM; Gaertner et al., 1994), we hypothesized that adoptees’ abilities to reconcile their personal identities with their shared family identities with birth and adoptive families would contribute to their well-being in adulthood. SEM analyses demonstrated that adoptive identity work and shared family identity mediated the relationship between parental communication and adoptee self-esteem. Specifically, adoption structural openness predicted adoptees‘ reflective identity exploration, which in turn predicted adoptive shared family identity and adoptee self-esteem. The current project serves as an important first step in understanding the role of family communication in fostering integration of the complex layers of identity within diverse families.

It also investigates the factors that play a role in the influence process, including children’s persuasive strategies (argumentative vs. non-argumentative) and parents’ attitudes toward technology (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness). Using a parent-child survey conducted in three schools and dyadic analyses, the results suggest that youths influence their parents’ acquisition of all technologies examined in this study, particularly the Internet. They also suggest that youths’ argumentative strategies have a greater influence than non-argumentative strategies on the influence youths exert on their parents’ technology adoption. Finally, parents’ attitudes toward technology play a minor role in the influence process.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

In addition, we explore how these adolescents use mediated communications in their romantic relationships. Data are from 5 focus groups and 1 depth interview with 44 Latino adolescents (14-18 years old) in the Midwest U.S. Findings indicate the adolescents believe media portray ideals of romantic relationships to be modeled. They are familiar with the terms major motion pictures use to describe romantic experiences, yet did not reach consensus on their use or meaning. Lastly, the youth perceived one-to-one mediated communication as beneficial to their relationships, but evaluated one-to-many mediated communication (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) as largely negative. Our findings identify three sources of evidence in the latter context that creates relational uncertainty: (1) photographs, (2) partner communication, and (3) third-party communication.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0096,2014,Poster,Parasocial and School Relationships of Preschool Children,2,"This research answers calls for more examination into the role parasocial relationships play in children’s lives. Specifically, this research explores the impact parasocial relationships have on preschool students’ interpersonal relationships – to see if these media bonds change whom children choose to have relationships with in school. Results of this study found that girls are more likely than boys to select opposite-sex media characters as their favorite and that this selection impacts their friend choices in school. Specifically, girls with male parasocial partners are more likely to play with boys and have male best friends in school. Previously, Maccoby (1998) argued that same-sex relationships create disparate cultures between the sexes and that this divide continues to influence adult life. From this, it is now clear that the media’s increasing importance in the lives of toddlers and young children can have long lasting repercussions on future relationships, in particular, future opposite-sex interactions.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0097,2014,Poster,Parental Mediation of Children’s Television and Video Game Use: Active and Embedded in Family Processes,2,"In the present study, parents and their nine to 12 year-old children reported on their usage of television and video games. The results shed light on the complex interaction between family processes and cognitive media beliefs. Above all, we found that mediation strategies differ from acknowledged media usage conceptions in that parents play a more active role than previously assumed. Restrictive mediation comprises rules and restrictions, but also parents’ educative explanations that media do not reflect reality. Patronizing mediation includes shared media consumption, but also parents commenting on media contents. Pointing out and emphasizing socio-emotional features in the media content (e.g., acts of empathy) characterizes an active-emotional co-use (AEC). Parental fear of negative media effects predicted both AEC and restrictive mediation. Children and parents’ congruent perceptions of family interactions predicted AEC and patronizing video game mediation. Overall, positive ratings of family interactions were associated with children using media less frequently.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Results also showed that the effect of mediation’s timing consistently depended on children’s age. Older children responded better than younger children to the mediation when it was delivered prior to their exposure to a violent TV program. On the other hand, only older children exhibited reactance when they received the mediation message after watching a violent TV program. The timing of active mediation may be, therefore, an important factor in interpreting research and in the design and implementation of mediation interventions.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Drawing from Yu (2005), I argue that the dispute is part of a long-standing process between the U.S. and China, wherein the U.S. pressures China to stop IP infringement and China responds by taking temporary, ineffective measures to end piracy within its borders. I also compare and contrast the history and regulation of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and China. The comparison focuses on the U.S.’s maximalist approach to IPR, which views IPR primarily as a commodity, and China’s IPR development in the context of Confucian and Communist philosophy, which views IP primarily as a resource.

2014-0106,2014,Poster,Media Reform in Argentina: A Case Study of International Influences on National Media Law,1,"Amid the backdrop of a new wave of populism and a complicated legacy of political leadership, Argentina is the site of an ongoing attempt to regulate and diversify the media industry. Its 2009 Audiovisual Communications Services Law (Audiovisual Law), promoted by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, explicitly seeks to “democratize,” and promote competition within, Argentina’s media industry. A federal appeals court in Argentina brought about by the media conglomerate Grupo Clarin SA (Clarin Group) ruled, in April 2013, that the law would unconstitutionally restrict broadcast licenses. Several analysts speculate that the Audiovisual Law was designed to target the political influence of the Clarin Group, the media conglomerate whose coverage of the Kirchner administration had become increasingly adversarial.

2014-0108,2014,Poster,The Effects of Regional Concentration and Vertical Integration on the Flow of Cable Programming Networks,1,"Using a 2009 cross-sectional database of digital cable systems in the U.S., this study examines the combined effects of vertical integration and regional concentration (cable TV clusters) on the carriage and tier positioning decisions of cable networks. Focusing on four basic cable network segments—the Outdoor, Cartoon, Movie, and Comcast affiliated networks—this study finds that the effects of vertical integration (the vertical favoritism of affiliated networks and vertical exclusion of their rival networks) still exist, confirming the results of previous studies. This study shows that in general, integrated cable systems (a) have a tendency to increase their subscriber base by carrying their affiliated networks more frequently, positioning them on an analog tier with more subscriber access, or both; and (b) tend to limit rivals’ subscribers by either carrying unaffiliated rival networks less frequently or positioning them on digital tiers. This study also examines the effects of cable clustering (the regional concentration of cable systems), a subject that has not been investigated in previous studies. In general, the increase in the regional concentration of cable systems positively affects the carriage rate of overall basic cable networks regardless of vertical ownership, while it negatively affects the placement of basic cable networks on the analog tier. The increase in regional concentration is also associated with the decrease in the effects of vertical integration, suggesting that system efficiency through regional concentration may mitigate the vertical integration effect.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

A bottom-up approach is adopted to generate queries used to capture public attention on environment and energy issues, which guarantee the face validity of Google Trends. Google Trends is found to have convergent and predictive validity in measuring public attention on environment issue, but fails in measuring public attention on energy issue. This finding suggests that web queries data, as a measurement of public attention, should be used with caution by taking issues peculiarity into account.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0111,2014,Poster,Coping With Unemployment Through Online Social Support,3,"This paper posits that online social support plays an important role helping to cope with unemployment, and facilitate the search for new employment. Based on a structural equation model, we develop and test the influence of online-mediated, enabling and caring social support on job search self-efficacy that may positively encourage the job search behavior of unemployed persons. In addition, we control the model for the factors gender, age, user experience and attitude towards the Internet. Based on 2,400 telephone interviews with unemployed individuals in Germany, we identify and confirm online social support as influential driver of job search behavior. Our results show that social support derived from new information and communication technologies does counteract to a certain degree the adverse effect of being unemployed. Furthermore, our model confirms that these relationships differ in gender, age, user experience and attitude towards the Internet.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This study explores how two types of feedback in exercise video games (exergames) can impact a user’s game experience and sense of self-efficacy about performing an exergame-based physical activity. An experiment (N = 47) using a between-subjects design manipulated feedback messages: non-supportive vs. supportive. The investigation finds that supportive feedback favorably influences a user’s exergame experience (e.g., enjoyment), and social presence mediates the relationship between the type of feedback and exergame play outcomes. The paper concludes with the implications of these findings for research about presence, exergames, and perceived exercise efficacy.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0114,2014,Poster,A Novel Explanation of Differentiated Contributions to Wikipedia: The Role of Internet Skills,2,"Despite the egalitarian rhetoric surrounding online cultural production, profound inequalities remain in who contributes to one of the most visited Web sites worldwide: Wikipedia. Women represent an estimated 16% of global Wikipedia editors and 23% of adult Wikipedia editors in the United States. In searching for sources and solutions to this persistent disparity, previous research has focused on analyzing aspects of current contributors and the existing Wikipedia community. We draw on unique panel survey data collected in 2009 and 2012 on a diverse group of American young adults with detailed information about not just contributors, but also non-contributors. We examine the role of individuals’ background attributes and Internet skills in participation on the site. We find that the gender gap in editing, widely documented in the literature, is exacerbated by a similarly significant Internet skills gap. Our results show that by far the most likely contributors are high-skilled males.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

We expected that effects depend on patients’ level of emotional approach coping. 133 Dutch breast cancer patients filled out a T0 and (six month later) a T1 questionnaire, assessing online activity within the support group, emotional approach coping and psychological wellbeing. Results showed three-way interactions of time, online activity and emotional approach coping on wellbeing. For patients who were active online, a low score on emotional approach coping caused an increase in wellbeing, while patients actively approaching emotions did not show this beneficial effect, but reported highest wellbeing overall.

2014-0116,2014,Poster,Foot-in-the-Door or Moral Balancing: The Moderating Effect of Issue Similarity in Activism Compliance Post Slacktivism,2,"The “foot-in-the-door” effect is a well-studied phenomenon where an individual is more likely to comply with a subsequent, larger, request, if the person has previously agreed to an initial request. However, recent research on the Moral Balancing Theory suggests that an individual may be less likely to comply with a subsequent act after agreeing to an initial request. These two effects seem to predict conflicting outcomes under the same scenario. This paper presents two experiments in the online activism domain that suggests issue similarity between the actions can help reconcile these two “competing” theories. When the causes between the two actions are similar, a desire for consistency is displayed and the “Foot-in-the-door” effect is observed. When the causes are not similar, individuals are more likely to behave in-line with the moral balancing effect.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0118,2014,Poster,The Accuracy of Self-Reported Internet Use: A Validation Study Using Client Log Data,1,"The vast majority of empirical research on online communication, or media use in general, relies on self-report measures instead of behavioral data. Previous research has shown that the accuracy of these self-report measures can be quite low, and both over- and underreporting of media use is commonplace. This study compares self-reports of internet use with client log files from a large household sample. Results show that the accuracy of self-reported frequency and duration of internet use is quite low, and that survey data are only moderately correlated with log file data. Moreover, there are systematic patterns of misreporting - frequent (according to their log files) internet users tend to underreport while infrequent users report more time spent online than their log files indicate. Self-reports for specific content such as social network sites or video platforms seem to be more accurate and less consistently biased than self-reports of generic frequency or duration of internet use.

In this study, we examine how external communicative elements, namely privacy assurances and website reputation operate in conjunction with sensitivity of information to influence trust between consumers and the online entity. An online experiment was used to understand the interaction effects amongst these antecedents. We find that when highly sensitive information is sought, privacy assurances can make a positive difference in creating trust to both lesser and more reputable websites. In comparison, when a reputable website asks for less sensitive information, the presence of privacy assurances engenders no differences in consumers’ trust. Privacy assurances are thus vital for websites with weak reputation regardless of sensitivity information requested.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This study also attempts to explore how cultural contexts are related to those intentions among college students in the US and Korea. Consistent with previous studies using the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the current study using survey data shows that the theory can predict people’s behavioral intentions in the context of illegal downloading. However, across three different types of variables for predicting intention to download digital content through unauthorized P2P sites (i.e. social psychological variables, TPB variables, and expanded TPB variables), several significant differences were revealed between American and Korean students.

Opportunities for capital enhancement afforded those online are also divided. Social networking sites are, arguably, the most important online space, and can be tools for capital enhancement. Of the 31% of Armenian adults on social networking sites (70% of Internet users), there are demographic divides between two sites: Facebook and Odnoklassniki. Our regression results show that Facebook users are more urban, better educated, and have superior foreign language skills than Odnoklassniki users. Facebook users are more likely to get information, while Odnoklassniki users are more likely to game. The implications of this are that more elite users exist in a different information environment than non-elites and are thus replicating the divide between the haves and have-nots in a society that already faces inequality.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This conceptually oriented paper seeks to bring strategic content more fully into the picture and develops a process-oriented model that outlines not only how strategic messages might be effective communication tools but how these messages are interpreted and processed depending on individual predispositions and orientations. Drawing on cultivation theory, social cognitive theory and framing theory, this manuscript proposes a model of persuasive environmental communication that is informed by the O-S-O-R perspective of social psychology and political communication to outline the potential salutary role of strategic messages in climate change communication and the ways in which it represents opportunities to educate and engage lay audiences.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0127,2014,Poster,Family Communication and Climate-Friendly Behavior: Intergenerational Influence at Home and on the Road,5,"Environmentally significant behavior is typically studied at the individual level, but occurs within households and requires the cooperation of multiple individuals. To assess the impact of intergenerational influence, we investigate family communication as a mediator between individual beliefs about climate change and climate-friendly behaviors, hypothesizing that open, mutually receptive communication on climate and energy will build family behavioral norms that support climate-friendly behavior. Data are 523 U.S.-representative parent-teen dyads who participated in an online survey. Results show that climate change beliefs are strongly related to the perceived importance of climate-friendly behavior for both parents and teens. In households that perceive climate-friendly behavior as important, and that communicate frequently about it, a stronger conservation norm is found; this norm influences home energy consumption and transportation choices above and beyond what is explained by the parent's or teen's own beliefs. Implications for communication strategies to increase climate-friendly behavior are discussed.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0128,2014,Poster,“Wild Flavors” or Wild Animals? The Discursive Warfare Surrounding China’s Endangered Wildlife Trade in the (Looming) Age of Green Consumerism,1,"The Chinese are notorious for their consumption of wild animals. From rabbits and monkeys to shark fins and tiger bones, this omnivorous culture enjoys exotic meats as both delicacies and tonic. As the Western notion of green consumerism enters China, however, the ancient tradition is slowly falling out of favor. International environmental NGOs (e.g. Wild Aid, TRAFFIC of WWF China, etc.) launched advertising campaigns to dissuade the public from eating endangered wildlife. Curiously, their opponents—advocates for exotic meat consumption—also jumped onto the “green wagon” and marketed wild meats as an “ecological diet.” The opposing rhetoric demonstrates the plasticity of “green consumerism”: If you love animals, should you eat them, or protect them? The ambivalence in the human-animal relationship gives birth to two types of desire, which are manifested in advertisements. This paper compares the pro-wildlife-eating ads by restaurants and tonic manufacturers and the environmental NGO-sponsored ads that support the opposite, and analyze the different cultural, ideological, and psychic functions they perform. Questioning the popular fetishization of the “local” or the “indigenous” over the “global” or the “Western” in the (looming) age of green consumerism, I argue that non-Western and indigenous values could also contribute to environmental degradation when coupled with the greed of consumerism.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This meta-analysis aims at identifying important determi-nants of hydrogen acceptance via aggregation of correlation data reported in 19 acceptance studies. Whereas attitude formation seems to be rather based on cognitive aspects, the be-havior is strongly influenced by affective determinants. The perceived risk showed to be less important than perceived benefits or subjective norm indicating that safety criteria are not the most relevant aspects people consider when evaluating hydrogen technologies. Fur-thermore, the results relativize the NIMBY-phenomenon: The closer a person lives to a hy-drogen refueling station, the higher the hydrogen acceptance.

I consider a set of focus groups with black interns from a wide range of agencies and suggest that advertising's race problem presents a unique set of challenges for blacks. Drawing on theories of intersectionality and identity, I argue that supposed race-based affiliations conceal deeper anxieties of cultural belonging marked by fissures of class and language. I conclude that the added psychological burden of stereotype threat makes black interns wary of seeking out help from other more established black employees—for fear of being seen as preferring their own race—thus placing them at a structural career development disadvantage vis-à-vis whites, who have no qualms about affiliating with and mentoring members of their own race.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Sixty-five years have passed since the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Right. However, political and economic systems still deny billions of people their political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights promulgated in the Declaration and its covenants. I probe music's potential to affect this challenge through a methods process of multiple triangulation. Specifically, I research the livid experience within Jamaica's music community through critical ethnography; develop a ""Taxonomy on the Neuroscience of Music and Morality""; and analyze the global music sector through the political economy of human rights lens. Integrating the findings, I conclude that music is not only a tool for realizing human rights, but also that music capability itself is a human right to the extent that it develops cognitive and emotive capacities, serves agency and voice, and supports sociability, participation, and community. Further, I conclude that the music community is uniquely poised and with capacity to play a leadership and facilitate role in the moral, scientific and political discourse that clarifies not only collectively established human rights goals, and but as well the structures of the music sector and the overarching political economy necessary to reach the goals.

This paper critiques this queering’s dimensions of freedom and domination through the lens of critical rhetoric. In terms of freedom, Mulan’s queering represents a progressive step forward for Disney, as the company previously had no LGBT characters. The choice of Mulan is also examined in its dimensions of domination. Disney’s choice of the most masculine princess as a bisexual reinforces harmful stereotypes about LGBT women, while its choice to only permit a LGBT character on a program aimed at adults neglects its role as a moral educator of children. A suggestion of the creation of an original animated lesbian or bisexual princess is offered as a means of overcoming the oppressive nature of Mulan’s queering.","Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies Interactive Paper Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

The connection between the local and transnational media activisms is shown in the local activists’ appropriation of the ideas and practices from the global exemplars, and in their attempt to mobilize transnational resources by forging tangible co-operations with the counterparts elsewhere. Their contributions to transnational media activism in particular and transnational activism in general will be discussed.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

The advent of digital native non-profit organizations, however, is influencing the sector. Kiva.org is a website that allows users to fund microloans to small business owners in developing nations. This study uses semi-structured qualitative interviews of Kiva users to explore this form of philanthropy as a potential example of crowdsourcing, a concept recently introduced to scholarship and still in flux. The study finds that Kiva may be a form of crowdsourcing, and discusses the implications for crowdsourcing theory as well as the non-profit sector generally.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0145,2014,Poster,Examining the Role of Facebook in Political Participation Among Young Voters in Georgia,1,"The exploratory study of young Georgian voters (N=432) demonstrated that young Georgians were interested in public affairs, had a strong sense of collective efficacy, supported democracy and had overwhelmingly voted in the 2012 Parliamentary Elections. However, they were detached from many forms of political participation, both online and offline. Facebook, in which young Georgians spent considerable amount of time, emerged as a platform for engagement in a public affairs discourse, such as reading and viewing and occasional commentary/ posting. Those who were active in the public affairs discourse were also highly likely to participate in Facebook’s political activities and in real life activities, although less frequently. Online and offline political participation were strongly and positively interrelated, countering beliefs of some scholars that Facebook-based participation displaces traditional forms of political participation. Young voters’ strong sense of collective efficacy predicted participation in real settings but not in Facebook-based political activities.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

This study conducts a panel data analysis on 182 countries observed from 2010 to 2012, to investigate a cross-country difference in the adoption of Facebook. The findings show that, concerning the diffusion of recent ICTs, authoritarian rules have a limited ability to maneuver in obstructing the way to the global social network. Rather, the governments’ suppression promotes the increased use of Facebook in response to the spread of cell phones and the growth of the urban population. Finally, a wider Facebook reach occurs when people perceive higher levels of political efficacy under such authoritarian controls, whereas it corresponds to greater public unrest in democracies.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

First, different theoretical traditions have formulated their own understandings on global media. Second, it’s long been controversial on how to comprehend the concept of globalization. Third, the difficulty in perceiving digital divide has complicated the global media production and consumption. Fourth, it’s hard to fully grasp the process of identity construction on various sites. This paper argues that the primary characteristic of global media is multi-sitedness, which is implicated and developed by each challenge mentioned above.

The present study examined how Chinese newspapers cover female smoking by analyzing the published news articles (N = 105) from 2005 to June 2013. Results showed only a small number of news articles, 105 in 8 years, addressed female smoking. These articles were given low prominence in newspapers and tobacco-control services specific to women were rarely mentioned. Only one half of the articles included tobacco-control content from a women’s perspective and these reports tended to adopt a loss frame over a gain frame. In order to slow down the increasing rate of smoking among women, Chinese media should offer more tobacco control information that is relevant to women, such as highlighting unique health risks among women and addressing the misconception that smoking is associated with attractiveness, which is widely promoted by “women’s cigarettes”.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0149,2014,Poster,“Bitch is So Bitch”: Making Sense of Audience Responses to Global Counterflow of Chinese TV Series,1,"The subject globalization and its influence on the audience is by no means a new research topic, particularly those that examines the influence of the West or the U.S. on the rest of the world. Not many studies have considered the audiences from the exportation side, and their view on the process of globalization. Thus, this paper asks the fundamental question, “How do audiences feel when their cultural products are exported into another country?” By using the case of memes that circulated in response to the news that a Chinese TV series The Legend of Zhenhuan is going to enter the U.S. market, this paper examines the cultural expectations that Chinese audiences place on their cultural exports. The analysis reveals a complicated case of cultural works that simultaneously arouse anxiety about China’s complicated culture and its impossibility to translate well in the global market, and reliefs them through self-mockery and satire. This paper argues that the process of globalization not only impacts the importing countries but the exporters as well. Through the examination of the audience’s expectations for global cultural expansion, this paper shows that there are many more nuanced cultural undercurrents that motivate or dissuade a country to enter the global market other than the spread of power or ideology.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Unlike the previous work, this data collection took place after health care reform implementation, uses a different sample, and includes new variables of interest (e.g., deviance, knowledge, involvement). Results suggest uncertainty levels have, interestingly, increased post-implementation, and students want to receive health care reform information from friends and family or online, from non-partisan sources, and in varied formats. The data also demonstrate that predicted outcome value of health care reform information, uncertainty tolerance, and involvement significantly predict intentions to seek information about health care reform.

In the first study, participants viewed a mistargeted print D-PSA or a direct D-PSA. In Study 2, participants viewed a mistargeted video D-PSA, a direct D-PSA, or a control ad. In both studies the mistargeted D-PSAs significantly weakened the association between depression and negative help seeking inclinations. Further, among people with heightened levels of depression the mistargeted D-PSA resulted in significantly greater help seeking intentions from close friends and a romantic partner than a direct D-PSA (study 1).

Therefore, there is a need for more research on variables which can increase positivity, willingness, and behavioral intentions in potential donors. The present study applies terror management theory and social identity to the organ donation context. Results indicate that reminders of death through narrative may improve organ donation outcomes as a form of worldview defense, through identification and death thought accessibility as mediators. However, this is only the case when the characters in the narrative are not members of a disliked outgroup. When the character is a member of a disliked outgroup (in this case, Arab ethnicity), organ donation outcomes become more negative.

2014-0154,2014,Poster,On a Scale of Health Uncertainty,2,"Uncertainty has been recognized as a fundamental construct in health communication. The conceptualization regarding its definition, attribute and scope, however, is not yet clear. In this article, health uncertainty was explicated as the psychological state in which one is incapable of appraising one’s health status and/or making health-related decisions. It was proposed that health uncertainty comprises four dimensions: information uncertainty, condition uncertainty, efficacy uncertainty, and emotion uncertainty. A 17-item scale was developed as a measurement instrument. Four external variables (i.e. health literacy, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and information management) were used to test the construct validity of the sale. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses of data from college students (N=238) showed that the scale was unidimensional on the second order. The results indicated that the scale exhibited good internal and external consistency, construct validity, as well as good reliability.

2014-0155,2014,Poster,Perceptions Regarding Healthy and Unhealthy Families: Formative Research to Inform Health Communication Interventions in Malawi,5,"Background
This qualitative study was conducted to gain insight into Malawian men’s and women’s perceptions of “healthy families” and the “good life” in anticipation of designing effective health communication programs.
Methodology
32 focus group discussions and 49 key informant interviews were conducted in Chitipa, Nsanje, Phalombe and Salima Districts.
Results
Healthy families were identified as those with well-nourished, educated parents, two children, living in a clean environment. The main barriers to the good life were structural -- poverty, food insecurity, and lack of access to hygienic conditions, education, and health services. Several individual-level behaviors were also seen as problematic.

Conclusions
Participants tended to be positive and focus on actions that could be taken at the community, family and individual levels even as they identified many structural factors that impede health and access to the good life. These findings informed the design of communication interventions, as described in this manuscript.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0156,2014,Poster,Realism Matters: The Role of Perceived Realism in the Biggest Loser,2,"This study explores the role of perceived realism on audience members’ cognitive and behavioral responses to health-related messages in the context of the NBC’s popular reality TV show, The Biggest Loser. The study suggests that exposure to the program is positively associated with perceived realism of the program, which in turn is positively associated with developing internal weight locus of control. Meanwhile, internal weight locus of control positively predicts audience members’ exercise behaviors, meaning the higher level of internal weight locus of control the audience members develop, the more likely they are to engage in physical exercise. The study offers evidence that reality TV might be a useful tool to influence audience members’ cognitions on health issues, which could potentially lead to healthier outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0157,2014,Poster,Shame Predicts Sexual Risk-Taking Among MSM,5,"Recently, Christensen et al. (2013) found that shame predicted unprotected anal intercourse

(UAI) with non-primary (casual) partners for young men who have sex with men (MSM). Unknown

is whether some men (i.e., those more insecurely attached) are more susceptible and what mediates this link (e.g. alcohol, drugs) and whether this applies to both insertive, and, more risky, receptive UAI. To examine these links, data from 1196 high-risk young MSM were gathered. Using hierarchical negative binomial regression models and mediation analyses we found that shame (as measured with the PANAS-X) positively and significantly predicted both receptive and insertive UAI. The effect of shame on sexual behavior was mediated by alcohol. Furthermore, avoidant attachment predicted shame, alcohol use, and insertive and receptive UAI -- but only consistently for MSM whose attachment responses indicated that they were paying attention (i.e., those who responded to items and reversed items in a conceptually similar way). Further analyses indicated that avoidant attachment, but not anxious attachment, significantly mediated the shame to alcohol link.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0160,2014,Poster,The Health Belief Model as an Explanatory Framework in Communication Research,6,"The health belief model (HBM) posits that messages will achieve optimal behavior change if they successfully target perceived barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, and threat. While the model seems to be an ideal explanatory framework for communication research, theoretical limitations have limited its use in the field. Notably, variable ordering is currently undefined in the HBM. Thus, it is unclear whether constructs mediate relationships comparably (parallel mediation), in sequence (serial mediation), or in tandem with a moderator (moderated mediation). To investigate variable ordering, adults (N = 1,377) completed a survey in the aftermath of an 8 month flu vaccine campaign grounded in the HBM. Exposure to the campaign was positively related to vaccination behavior. Statistical evaluation supported a model where the indirect effect of exposure on behavior through perceived barriers and threat was moderated by self-efficacy (moderated mediation). Perceived barriers and benefits also formed a serial mediation chain. The results indicate that variable ordering in the health belief model may be complex, help to explain conflicting results of the past, and a good focus for future research.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

As Malawians may be influenced by norms transmitted through interpersonal communication within their personal networks to make decisions about their sexual behavior, this study examined the relationship between interpersonal communication, norms and condom use among sexually active Malawians living in the southern region. An egocentric network study (n=1,316) asked participants to name 3 ties they spoke with about health issues. Network descriptive norms (AOR: 2.11; p<0.001), general injunctive norms (AOR: 1.29; p<0.05) and network injunctive norms (AOR: 1.42; p<0.05) were associated with condom use generally. Network descriptive norms were associated with condom use with a primary partner (AOR: 1.58; p<0.01) and non-primary partner (AOR: 2.98; p<0.001). Norms within a personal network may play a role in protective sexual behaviors among Malawians, suggesting that social norm interventions utilizing interpersonal communication may be an innovative approach to increase uptake of protective sexual behaviors.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Undoubtedly, the speech of the Mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella, was the most discussed due to her insecurities in the domain of English language. In this sense, Botella’s speech illustrates the importance of prosody in public speaking since it can affect the speaker’s credibility. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the influence of prosody in listeners’ perceptions of politicians’ credibility. In developing this understanding, we conducted an acoustic analysis to measure the audience’s perception of credibility.

The present study seeks to provide evidence to support the importance of incorporating immediacy into business communication training by exploring the influence of supervisor immediacy on subordinates’ organization citizenship behaviors (loyalty, participation, and obedience). A model was tested in which perceived immediacy was predicted to mediate the relationships between supervisors’ immediate behaviors and subordinates’ organizational citizenship outputs. Although the full model was not supported, the data were consistent with a simple causal string from supervisor immediate behaviors  perceived immediacy  subordinate loyalty.

A social-psychological model is employed in order to predict various kinds of political action (e.g. strike, protest, petition, syndicalism) or even violent acts (e.g., vandalisms). This model focuses on three main factors: perception of injustice; perception of collective efficacy; and social identity (politicized and national). The relationship between this set of predictive variables and the intention to act is examined within the context of media framing. Based on a content analysis of the Greek press three main frames of what Greece should do in order to deal with the economic crisis (implement the memorandum, defy the memorandum and leave the Eurozone, or negotiate the memorandum within the Eurozone) were developed. The effect of media frames on perceived threat to freedom and the consequent psychological reactance is also examined as a predictive variable. Results suggest that media framing affects a) people’s reaction to their situation (e.g. reactance) and b) the relationship between the predictive variables and their intention to act.",Intergroup Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Discriminant Validity of the News Credibility Scale,5,"The construct of news credibility has been of interest to communication scholars for decades, yet researchers have struggled to develop a measure of news credibility that demonstrates a reliable factor structure and construct validity. This study uses confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and discriminant analysis to evaluate Abdulla and colleagues’ (2004) measure of news credibility. Results indicate that although the factor structure of the measure is replicable, the measure exhibits significant concerns related to discriminant validity. Discriminant analysis on another measure of news credibility (Kohring & Matthes, 2007) revealed similar concerns, suggesting that all existing measures of news credibility may possess this flaw.

Similar studies also suggest that journalists covering specialty areas such as health are more likely to experiment with and adopt new forms of practice that break with the traditional tenets of journalism. Through interviews with such journalists, this study explores the perceptions, practices and drivers of personal branding among journalists. Findings indicate journalists are squarely focused on branding at the individual level (rather than branding the organizations they work for). Journalists cite technological and cultural changes in the profession as giving rise to personal branding. They also describe the tension they feel between their obligation to uphold the traditional tenets of journalism and their perceived need to incorporate more branding into their practice, especially on social media platforms. The findings also indicate that journalists may be changing the fundamental elements of branding in at least one way, exchanging the differentiation between themselves and their content for the mutual sharing and co-creation of content with their colleagues and audience.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

An analysis of NBC primetime telecasts and sports coverage in The New York Times found that the coverage of foreign nations and their athletes was not significantly affected by any given nation’s performance in the Olympics. Instead, U.S. media emphasized only a few elite countries –such as China, Russia, Britain, and Japan – just as they do in selecting other foreign news. In addition to a few elite countries’ dominance, the military expenditures of a given country, its linguistic proximity to the U.S., and the number of sports celebrities and gold medals won were important predictors of that country’s media visibility.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

However, it remains unclear how specific sports news frames affect a recipient’s quality perception of a journalistic product and if news frames further affect an individual’s post-exposure behavior in social interaction with a person with a disability (PWD). To shed some light on these potential news framing effects, two experimental studies (between-subjects designs) were conducted.
Study_1, revealed systematic news framing effects on recipients’ attitudes toward a depicted AWD and showed effects on a recipient’s perceived quality of a news story.
Study_2, further revealed that specific news frames may (automatically) affect a recipient’s behavior (e.g., verbal communication performance, visual attention/eye contacts) in a subsequent face-to-face social interaction with a PWD.

2014-0188,2014,Poster,The Limits of the Debate: How the Oslo Terror Shook the Norwegian Immigration Debate,2,"It is widely documented that dramatic events and crises have the potential to change how an issue is debated in the media. The lone wolf terrorist of the 2011 Oslo attacks claimed an extremist, contra-jihadist ideology, stating that he carried out the terror attacks to “wake up” and “warn” the political establishment and public of a failed immigration policy. The present paper analyzes how immigration was debated before and after the Oslo terror, and conceptualizes the developments in the polarized, heated immigration debate by employing Hallin’s (1986) influential three-sphere model. The attacks challenged the journalistic balance between newsworthiness and sensitivity covering a polarized issue. Based on analyses of a comprehensive, quantitative data set of Norwegian mainstream media coverage of immigration in 2011, we find that the debate on immigration changed by a decrease in the amount of coverage, a shift in the prioritization of formats, topics and sources, and by including certain viewpoints into the debate that earlier belonged to an online sphere of deviance.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

After a brief historical overview of the notion of public controversy and its use in empirical research, I propose to adopt a more processual view of public controversy. I theorize the production of controversy as an everyday life rhetorical invention (rather than a phenomenon made visible through documentation of mediated traces of public statements). To support this view of public controversy with empirical data, I conducted a four-month ethnography in a community-based organization that defends the rights of LGBT people. In the analysis, I explain how activists become passionate about an issue and engage in political action; then I details problems of alignment that result from talk about political issues, such as the legal and social recognition of transsexuals and transgender people.","Language and Social Interaction Interactive Paper Session: Constructing Controversy, Help, and Play",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

A large body of research on transportation focuses on written stories; little is known about modality’s effect on transportation. This study examined the effects of modality (text vs. video) in a non-profit narrative on transportation, empathy, attitudes toward organization, and behavioral intentions. Findings show a significant interaction between trait transportability and modality in predicting narrative transportation. Individuals low in transportability are more transported into a video narrative than a text narrative, while individuals high in transportability are equally likely to be transported regardless of modality.

On the other hand, they keep electing politicians that do not address income disparities. To understand this paradox, this study examines how media shape citizens’ perceptions of inequality. Consequently, it shows how these perceptions influence income distribution preferences and participation behaviors. Based on a representative sample of the Colombian adult population (N=1,031), this study illustrates how news exposure reduces perceptions of income inequality, while exposure to entertainment content enhances citizens’ understanding of income gaps. Moreover, this study suggests that more realistic perceptions of inequality lead to more equalitarian preferences for income distribution.

To develop our central arguments about the temporality of communication design, we first describe how the consideration of varying time scales offers great utility in the communication design enterprise, and elaborate on the designable features of temporality for human interaction. Next, we draw on Ballard’s (2007) typology of work-based activity cycles to offer some temporally based design principles for the design of work. We then apply these insights to various work activities that unfold at various time scales, and illustrate how concern with temporality (rather than only time) may lead to a redesign of communication.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

To address these issues, this paper presents a model, membership transitions for volunteers (MTV), that builds upon communicative flows of organizational communication (McPhee & Zaug, 2000) and the typology for nonstandard membership (Ballard & Gossett, 2007). Elaborated through a volunteer case study, the model of MTV demonstrates utility in understanding how a volunteer at a nonprofit organization enters as a contingent member who communicatively negotiated a transition into standard membership through the flows of membership negotiation, activity coordination and temporal self-structuring.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0214,2014,Poster,Working Toward a Positive End (of the Good Life): Third Party Resolution of Family Conflict,2,"Processual models of conflict management have been utilized to study all stages of conflict, from the initial cause of conflict all the way through to the final resolution of the conflict. One of the ways that processual models can be applicable is studying how organizational actors employ these methods with individuals who are still important to the function of the organization, but are not familiar with it, such as visitors to a hospital. The focus of this paper is the role of the organizational actors who deal with end-of-life issues on a daily basis, specifically on how they manage conflict between family members of patients. Using qualitative interviews with nurses, patient advocates, social workers, and chaplains (n = 78), many individuals deal with conflict between family members every day. The ways that these organizational actors manage conflict is by reframing, refocusing, referring, and reconciling.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0215,2014,Poster,“The Birthing Process is Messy”: Positioning Sustainability “In the Cloud” as an Emerging Profession,2,"We examine how practitioners communicatively position the emerging profession of sustainability, which employs around 3 million people in the United States alone. Despite extant research on emerging fields, this literature mainly focuses on institutional developments and entrepreneurial actions, neglecting the wider subjectivities that develop among “ordinary” practitioners of such nascent fields. In contrast, we adopt a “practice-based” approach, using discursive positioning theory. Drawing on interviews with 45 sustainability practitioners and 35 contributed curriculum vitae, we find that 20 discursive resources are used to construct four broad subject positions for the emerging field—discovery, enlightenment, legitimacy, and consumption. Our data suggests a “cloud” approach to field positioning, whereby positions overlap and practitioners utilize different (re)combinations of the discursive resources, in response to particular tasks, contexts, and stakeholders. Our findings contribute to discursive positioning theory, practice-based perspectives to emerging professions, and the political embeddedness of work.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0216,2014,Poster,Transcoding: The Mirroring of the Database Form and Postmodern Culture,1,"This essay explores the rise of database logic that pervades our current culture, specifically how media forms are recontextulaized through the database and human communication is shifting to fit database logic. Building on Lyotard’s narrative disintegration, this account explains altered definitions of truth, creativity, individuality, experience, and art. Drawing broadly, this paper incorporates McLuhan’s insights on electric media, new media theorist Lev Manovich’s metarealism, and technologist Kevin Kelly’s thoughts on the future of the web. These themes are recapitulated by tracing the extension of these cultural logics from older media to cybernetic systems, through Enzensberger, Benjamin and Nichols’ discussions of art, technology, and human subjectivity. Aside from this synthesis, the notion of credibility is contributed to describe fully-functioning database elements.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0217,2014,Poster,Intrapersonal Communication: Technologies of the Self in Educational Material & Practice,1,"Following the late work of Michel Foucault, this paper traces the genealogy of the technology of the self represented by intrapersonal communication or “inner dialog” and its relationship to both textual and digital educational media. Today, this type of communication is enacted and studied in educational contexts under rubrics such as “self-talk,” “self-regulation” and “self-explanation.” As Foucault suggests, two important precursors for this specific “technology of the self” go back to the Middle Ages and antiquity, particularly with the emergence of writing and the Christian confessional as means of self-reflection and -examination. However, many variations intervene between ancient and modern practices. The paper plots the oscillation of this intra-personal communication between a ritualized, externalized performance and fully internalized self-examination, from the catechism of Luther to self-regulatory communication studied in today’s cognitive science –concluding with a brief discussion of new, related possibilities offered by many-to-many Internet communication.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0218,2014,Poster,"“No Media, Less Life?”: Online Disconnection and Media Participation",2,"In times when media are mundane fellows that are disappearing from our consciousness, when media usage is partly habitualised and therefore invisible, looking at disconnections rather than exclusively connection enables us to develop a deeper understanding of what it means to live in mediatised worlds. Media disconnection beyond digital divide and knowledge gap is, however, rarely addressed in current studies of mediatisation. The following presentation is an attempt to investigate specific forms of disconnection in conjunction with connection enabled by media.
By using disruption of the daily stream of online engagement as a method, the presentation discusses how online disconnection can contribute to understanding of media participation and its role in the everyday lives of young adults.In the analysis, we show how conscious disruptions of habitualised media practices can contribute to an understanding of the role the internet-based media participation plays in the everyday life of young adults. Hence, the presentation provides a theoretical and empirical investigation of forms of connection and disconnection that are persistent in mediatised worlds.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Further the paper examines to what extent political economy integrates with other approaches to the study of media or communication such as cultural studies and development communication. The paper argues that centrality of political economy to media and communication prompts a close assessment of the relationship between state and media. Finally, the paper argues for the need of supplementation of hybridization with political economy to understand the contemporary developments such as globalization and the resistance to it.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Responsiveness and Scope Expansion in Television News Reports of Protest Demonstrations,1,"Most of the interaction between movements and elites nowadays takes place in the media arena. This study deals with reactions of political targets (responsiveness) and third parties (scope expansion) in news reports on protest events. It asks whether targets and third parties respond to protest, how they respond, and when they are more likely to respond. Data spanning eight years of protest coverage of both the Belgian public and commercial broadcaster (N=564) is used to test hypotheses drawn from journalism and protest impact literature. Results show that protestor voices dominate protest coverage, that political targets are more prominent than third parties, and that accounts of targets more frequently contain negative elements compared to accounts of third parties. Demonstrations that are large, reactive, not staged by unions and which have a domestic and specific target are more likely to trigger responsiveness. Disruptive demonstrations have no consistent impact on responsiveness whatsoever, yet trigger negative third party reactions.Results are discussed in light of protest impact and political communication literature.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

In this study we offer a conservative test of the political power of fictional television dramas by evaluating whether minor differences in character portrayals and plot details affect viewers’ attitudes and policy preferences. We rely on a variation on the switching replications design in which a representative sample watched one of four versions of an episode of Special Victims’ Unit: Law and Order edited to manipulate the alleged rape victim’s sexual history and the jury verdict regarding the alleged perpetrator. We find that subtle variations in the exemplars and storyline influence viewers’ attitudes towards four issues: standards of evidence in rape cases, confidence in the justice system, and immigration policy and health care system. Our findings suggest that fictional programs need not be explicitly didactic in order to influence viewers’ political views; in fact, exemplars may be more influential when they are only incidental to the plotline.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

With the increasingly important role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) incorporated in different civil and civic behaviors, the interdependent relationships between voluntary associations and communities may change. Building on this inquiry, this study employs social capital theory, the perspective of media multiplexity, and communication public goods theory to examine the relationship between voluntary associations and community involvement through a telephone survey of a randomly selected sample of 400 residents in the Greater Cleveland area (USA). The results showed that being embedded in affiliation networks is significantly correlated with community involvement. Moreover, participation in voluntary associations through multiple means of communication significantly predicted community involvement after controlling for other factors such as local ties, diversity of social ties, and affiliation ties. In other words, for people who are not associated with multiple affiliations, their active involvement in a single voluntary association through multiple technologies facilitates their participation in community activities. Findings of this study present theoretical and practical implications for contemporary forms of voluntary associations in relation to communities.

Specifically, we examine state legislators’ responses to variations in narrative focus (individual vs. community) and a statistical map (presence vs. absence) depicting the prevalence of food deserts across the U.S. Using a web-based randomized experiment (N = 496), we show that narrative focus and the statistical map interact to produce different patterns of cognitive response and support for policies to reduce the prevalence of food deserts. Individual narratives were more effective when paired with a statistical map than in the absence of such an image; the image did not have an impact when combined with a story describing a community at large.

We test this assumption by systematically manipulating the modality (audio vs. audiovisual) of the 2013 German televised debate in a live-experiment. 110 participants either watched or listened to the debate prior to the 2013 national elections. As predicted, viewers of the debate rely on candidates’ personality characteristics while listeners of the debate focus on issue agreement when evaluating the candidates’ debate performance. However, this effect is conditional upon existing levels of political interest, with highly interested subjects being less open to modality effects and basing their evaluation on issue-agreement independent of the experimental condition.

Extant approaches view news media as epiphenomenal to foreign policymaking. Theories such as indexing, hegemony, and cascading activation argue that the political elite make foreign policy choices independently; the media either fail to question these choices on their own or are used to manufacture favorable public opinion. In contrast, this paper argues that the news media are a site where nations construct their identities—shared beliefs about their history, norms, values, and status in the architecture of global relations. These beliefs go on to shape foreign policy by making particular choices appear necessary or natural. The paper also parses out four analytical categories to study this relationship. This theoretical framework connects critical and cultural media theories with the constructivist paradigm in international relations.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

2014-0227,2014,Poster,The Political Communication of Independent Regulatory Agencies,5,"Following liberalization, regulatory agencies were created all over Europe in order to regulate the newly established competition. Therefore, a significant share of policy-making has been carried out by organizations that are neither democratically elected nor directly accountable to elected politicians. In this respect communication could prove to be highly important by contributing to the accountability of regulatory agencies and thereby helping them to mitigate their inherent deficit in democratic legitimacy. Moreover, regulators might also use communication as a soft tool of governance. However, agencies have so far been neglected by political communication research. To fill this gap, this paper examines the public communication of IRAs in four countries and three sectors based on interviews and content analyses. Results indicate that the organization of the communication function follows a national pattern approach while a policy sector approach is helpful for understanding the use of communication as a soft tool of regulation.

Yet few studies have examined the politically demobilizing role of conflict avoidance in contexts outside of the continental United States. As such, in the present study, data are analyzed from a probability-based mail survey of registered voters (N = 319) in the remote Western Pacific Island of Guam. Findings revealed that conflict avoidance is inversely associated with voters’ political participation, political efficacy, civic engagement, and attention to the Internet and interpersonal sources regarding a political issue. However, conflict avoidance was not associated with neighborliness, arguably, a less confrontational form of engagement.

Yet, political leaders around the world—from Rwanda to Egypt to Venezuela to Hungary—have restricted media freedom, arguing that irresponsible news coverage will incite political violence. Is media freedom a force for democracy or a source of domestic conflict? We hypothesize that the effect of media freedom on domestic conflict is conditioned in part by a country’s level of social tolerance. Specifically, we predict when social tolerance is high, media freedom will discourage domestic conflict because the tone of news coverage will tend to mirror the level of tolerance in society and ameliorate any inflammatory coverage. In contrast, we predict that low levels of social tolerance will fuel and be fueled by inflammatory news coverage if the media are free, and that this combination will promote domestic conflict.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

To analyze the functions VAAs have for their users, we identify user types based on cognitive characteristics and motivations, drawing on unique user data from a popular Dutch VAA. A latent class analysis resulted in three types, varying in efficacy, certainty, and interest. As turns out, these different types use the VAA for different reasons at different points in time.

It was found that each of these films is congruent with Foucault’s ideas about disciplining the body. As people are continually defining themselves by invisible surveillance of social institutions, the tendency for self-medication or self-modification rises. Representations of normalcy are used to prescribe the structure of society. In each film, the protagonists are able to self-regulate their own mental illness with structures that are outside of institutional control. In essence, the mental health of each character resides in an internal panoptical struggle between Obsessive-compulsive disorder and normalcy. Each character “cures” himself without help from any medical or psychological help. Thus, each act as a prisoner with behaviors that are controlled by the unseen definitions of accepted behaviors.

Guided by those feminist theories, I analyzed public relations conducted by coalitions of public and private organizations constituting the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (PPPHW). I found that PPPHW’s localized handwashing campaigns mirrored FST’s activist commitment to social change, lived experience, and indigenous knowledge. Additionally, an ethic of care contributed to their effectiveness in decreasing infant disease, as well as (perceived) ethicalness. Finally, FST values and ethic of care aligned with glocal public relations’ goal of local responsiveness while retaining a global message (in this case, handwashing with soap).",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

What Digital Natives Think About Engaging With Brands and Organizations,3,"Stakeholder engagement is seen as a central aim for public relations, although few studies ask whether engagement is actually expected by stakeholders. Focusing on digital natives and their social media use, this paper defines “engagement” from several perspectives, distinguishing between positive and negative engagement. Reported results from a recent study differentiate nine types of engagement and show that digital natives often choose not to engage with brands or organizations. This might challenge the ideal of engagement and highlight the importance of careful target-group analysis. In addition, it is necessary to differentiate engagers based on their tone and degree of engagement.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception
2014-0249,2014,Poster,Setting the Consumer Agenda: How Oregon Wineries Use Social Media to Promote Their Brand and Engage Consumers,2,"The research reported in this extended abstract is focused on how Oregon wineries promote and enhance (i.e., manage) their reputations and the regional reputation of Oregon wine while engaging customers through the use of social media (Facebook and Twitter). Our interest is in what kinds of messages are posted by the wineries and how Facebook fans and Twitter followers respond to each kind of message. We propose a framework of four message-objective categories: managing reputation, announcing news, engaging customers and prospects, and promoting sales. Using this framework, we are currently analyzing data collected from 20 Oregon wineries over a 6-month span in 2013. A total of 998 separate winery posts and 1248 consumer responses to those posts were collected. We will follow in January of 2014 with collection and analysis of similar data for Twitter.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session and Reception

Data from the Seattle Neighborhoods and Crime Survey were used to create neighborhood-level measures of structural factors, local social ties, organizational, participation, communication ties, collective efficacy, disorder, and victimization. Results indicate that socioeconomic status and residential stability have positive effects on communication ties among neighbors. The measure of communication ties is positively related to collective efficacy, which in turn has decreased effects on disorder and victimization.

2014-0254,2014,Poster,Bridging Disciplines: An Agenda for Health Risk Communication Research and Practice,1,"This review takes a psychological approach to explain why people underestimate health risks despite health communication efforts to inform them about risks to improve their decisions and behaviors. It posits that people are predisposed to automatically underestimate self-relevant risks. Rationale for this proposition is derived from research documenting health risk information is (a) self-relevant, (b) inconsistent with the positivity bias and self-threatening and that (c) self-schema activation is automatic.

Literature on risk perceptions and automatic processing of self-relevant information is reviewed. A theoretical model that describes how people arrive at biased risk perceptions is presented. The model shows routes by which automatic activation of self-schema influences the processing of personal health information and biases risk perceptions. Implications for health risk communication research and practice and limitations of current framework are discussed.",Processes Underlying The Communication of Science and Health Information,Information Systems
2014-0255,2014,Poster,Bystanding or Standing by? How the Number of Bystanders Affects the Intention to Intervene in Cyberbullying,3,"The more bystanders are present in a critical situation the less individuals perceive responsibility to react what in turn prevents them from intervening. This “bystander effect” is highly robust in the face-to-face context. In cyberbullying bystanders play an essential role as their behavior can affect the process of such incidents. Although several studies inquire factors influencing bystander behavior in cyberbullying, the bystander effect has not been tested in this context. Thus, this study aims to do so: In a first experiment we find that the presence of bystanders lowers the intention to intervene. This bystander effect is completely mediated by the feeling of responsibility. Moreover, the bullying’s severity has a positive effect on the intention to intervene. Using a different number of bystanders, we cannot replicate the bystander effect in a second experiment. However, bystanders’ reactions reinforce as well as prevent participant’s intention to intervene.",Processes Underlying The Communication of Science and Health Information,Information Systems

Public deliberations are being explored to due claims of positive effects for the citizens who participate. However, there is a need to determine what aspects of the deliberative process actually lead to these beneficial effects. In this study we sought to determine what aspects of participating in a deliberative event are associated with increases in knowledge – specifically, knowledge about nanotechnology. Through implementing experimental design and measures at multiple time points, we sought to understand what aspects of the deliberative process lead to increases in knowledge of the topic and why they do so. Using three longitudinal studies, we determine that participants learn throughout the deliberative event, but the extent of learning differs based on how the information is presented, and the level of cognitive engagement while participating in the event.",Processes Underlying The Communication of Science and Health Information,Information Systems

The 53 participants were instructed to watch each PSA presented in a random order while psychophysiological measures were recorded to index real-time cognitive and emotional processes engaged while viewing the messages along with various self-report items. Results show that viewers allocate the most cognitive resources to gain-framed high empathy messages followed by loss-framed high empathy messages. Loss-framed high empathy messages are the most arousing, while gain-framed high empathy messages are the least arousing suggesting a difference in how these types of messages are processed.

In order to explore how visual representation of hurricane uncertainty affect risk perception, fear, anxiety, and behavioral intentions, a 2 (areas: affected vs. unaffected) × 2 (modality: animation vs. static images) × 2 (uncertainty graphic: cone vs. windfield) between-subjects online experiment (N = 207) was conducted. Results show that the animated windfield graphic raised perceived risk and other outcome variables compared to the static windfield graphic, whereas the pattern was reversed for the cone graphic. Perceived vividness, spatial presence, and cognitive involvement were found to be mediators of this two-way interaction effect.

Second, the study compared memory outcomes for news stories and tweets. The study focuses on three memory measures as pointed out above as memory outcomes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. With regard to encoding, and in addition to measuring recognition for news stories and tweets, the study includes two signal detection theory measures of sensitivity and criterion bias (Shapiro, 1994; MacMillan & Creelman, 1991) Based on this, we ask:
How do tweeter’s race, weight status, and the interaction between them affect encoding, storage, and retrieval for news stories and tweets?
How do tweeter’s race, weight status, and the interaction between them affect encoding, storage, and retrieval for tweets?

2014-0264,2014,Poster,Do We Blame it on the Machine? Task Outcome and Agency Attribution in Human-Technology Collaboration,3,"When humans routinely work and communicate with technology to complete tasks and solve problems, they constantly assess, consciously or non-consciously, the roles that they themselves and the technology play in the interaction. Given the well- known tendencies for fundamental attribution error in teamwork and the application of social rules to technology (Nass, Steuer, & Tauber, 1994), the existing literature in communication and social psychology would suggest a self-serving bias among human users when they collaborate with technologies on tasks: When things go well, the user will take credit for self; but when things go badly, they will blame the technology while distancing themselves from the failure. In this study, we empirically examine whether the fundamental attribution error is applicable in a human-technology collaborations, and whether that would influence users’ attribution of agency, as well as other psychological outcomes such as user experience and perception, in different task outcome scenarios.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems

This study focuses on cardiac activities during emotional video clips by analyzing heart rate variability, in order to examine how individuals’ approach motivational activation interacts with their experiences with violent games on both parasympathetic and sympathetic aspects of information processing. So far the results show some predicted outcomes, such as higher cardiac vagal index (CVI) , an indicator of parasympathetic activity, for participants high in approach system activation (ASA) while watching a violent video clip. On the other hand, Cardiac Sympathetic Index (CSI) which is an indicator of sympathetic activity is turned out to vary as a function of ASA, violent game exposure and video contents.

2014-0266,2014,Poster,Recall and Recognition of In-Game Advertising: The Impact of Game Control,2,"The study aims to contribute to research on the effectiveness of in-game advertising (IGA) by investigating how player involvement affects the way people process advertising embedded in the game environment. More specifically, the study focuses on kinesthetic involvement or the player’s sense of involvement related to the control and movement mechanisms in a game. A within-subjects experiment was conducted in which the player’s control over a racing game was varied by manipulating game controller type (symbolic controller versus mimetic controller). Results show that this variation in game controller significantly affected the recall and recognition of the brand placements embedded into the game. This impact was primarily due to differences in controller difficulty and internalization: when game controls are easier to use, they require less conscious attention, freeing attentional resources that can be subsequently spent on other elements of the game such as in-game advertising.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems
2014-0267,2014,Poster,"The Thrill is Gone, But You’d Never Know: Habituation and Generalization of Arousal Responses to Video Games",2,"Past research suggests that repeated exposure to video games “desensitizes” players to the arousing effects of game content. Notably, much of this research suffers from a lack of conceptual clarity and fails to systematically incorporate the psychological mechanisms of habituation and generalization. The current paper reports the results of a longitudinal study examining habituation and generalization using physiological data (blood pressure and heart rate) as well as self-report data. Findings of the current study suggest that habituation is experienced similarly with regard to both physiological and self-reported data. However, generalization (i.e., the extension of habituation processes to other similar stimuli) is only evident with regard to the physiological data. Results are discussed in terms of: Implications for game developers and players, implications for game researchers, current conceptual ambiguity between cross-sectional models and the results of longitudinal analyses, and the appropriateness of utilizing self-report measures in longitudinal studies examining arousal.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems

Effects of Perceived Enjoyment and Perceived Output Quality,3,"Human Computation Games (HCGs) are games that harness human intelligence to tackle computational problems. Put differently, HCGs allow individuals to perform computational tasks in an enjoyable manner, and generate useful outputs as byproducts. Hence, enjoyment and usefulness of outputs are recognized as two prominent features of HCGs. These games have proliferated in various problem spaces recently, and have demonstrated their usefulness in tackling computational problems. However, studies on individuals’ attitudes and behaviors related to HCGs have been lacking. This study aims to investigate the effects of perceived enjoyment and perceived output quality on intention to use HCGs within the context of SPLASH, our developed mobile HCG for sharing location-based content. A survey was designed and administered to 205 undergraduate and graduate students from a local university. Our findings suggest that perceived affective and cognitive enjoyment, as well as perceived output relevancy were significant in predicting individuals’ intention to use HCGs.","Analyses of Gaming, Mobile Devices, and Technology",Information Systems

While traditional social network analysis approaches capture explicitly declared relationships, they often ignore the implicit relations within sequential interactions such as commits. We propose a method using temporal adjacencies within event log data to produce structural representations of sequence data to identify the trajectories of both users and artifacts as they progress through the system over time. These sociotechnical trajectories reduce large quantities of digital trace data into more parsimonious network graphs. These trajectories reveal the structure of sequences such as regularities in action or anomalies in the behavior of users and artifacts that can motivate follow-on qualitative investigations of social roles, communities of practice, and institutional routines. We evaluate the potential of this approach with case studies of user and project activity on two large and complex sociotechnical systems, GitHub and Wikipedia.",Online Media II: Analyses of Communication Networks,Information Systems

The model suggests that self-disclosure and withdrawal contribute to and are affected by two distinct components of privacy and that these effects are explained by boundary permeability and psychological crowding. Ultimately, the model provides a cohesive framework that advances information privacy theory and allows for novel research opportunities by introducing a new factor that predicts and be predicted by privacy.",Online Media II: Analyses of Communication Networks,Information Systems

An Exploratory Perspective on Facebook Users,1,"Social Network Sites (SNS) have developed into a major communication tool for both private (interpersonal) and public communication purposes. From an economic standpoint SNS rely on advertising based business models offering their services free of charge for users in exchange for attention and personal data in order to provide targeted, personalized advertising. This is in conflict with user’s privacy concerns about their personal data and information disclosed. Given facebook’s recent attempts to install user-sided payment options and to implement modified privacy regulations this paper analyzes how users evaluate and react to (a) a decrease of the platform’s privacy regulations and (b) the installation of different modes of user-sided payment. Empirically, this study is based on a quantitative online survey among facebook users (N=188).

The present study aimed to investigate these emerging processes of opinion dissemination based on the classic concept of opinion leadership. In an online survey (N = 527), we assessed activities of posting public or private messages on political and societal topics as well as users’ motivations and personality traits. Personality strength and political interest predicted Facebook opinion leadership, while extraversion was not related to online behavior. With regard to motivational aspects, users primarily aim to distribute relevant information and raise awareness of specific topics.

Two experiments employed the original musical stimuli, one used contemporary music; two experiments employed a naïve experimenter team, whereas one – like the original – used hypothesis-aware experimenters. As the original study was criticized for relying on demand artifacts, we incorporated post-experimental inquiries exploring these. Across experiments, great care was taken to reproduce original materials and procedures. Results of the experiments using the original music provided no evidence for musical conditioning, but the experiment using contemporary music fully reproduced original effects.

Narratives that have a point, are plausible and diagnostic of the prevalence of the phenomena depicted in the story are more likely to provoke implications than are narratives scoring lower on these three dimensions. Stories that provoke implications are more likely to prompt effects than stories provoking few implications. These SAT-derived propositions were tested using implications indicators derived from structured measures. Mediation analysis of computer theft, identity theft and the flu stories revealed that story versions judged to be pointed, plausible and probative provoked more implications than stories scoring low on the dimensions. Implications, in turn, were significantly related to a measure of estimated behavior change, as predicted by SAT.

Television narratives are a compressed form of storytelling. Certain parts are edited out, which greatly reduces the number of discrete chunks in an event, and even the chunks that remain often are not told in chronological order (Lang, 1989). Our ability to chunk, or segment, information into discrete elements, and then reconnect them, plays a primary role in our ability to control attention, allocate processing resources, and provide a means for both storing and retrieving long-term memories. Past research has provided some insight into how viewers process semantically related and unrelated scenes, but often in isolation from the narrative as a whole.

This can be accomplished when the audience enjoys the program – especially the music. The constitution of enjoyment can be explained by the flow concept. Only when the challenge of the content and the skill of the content user are balanced, flow experience and enjoyment arise. In order to create radio music programs compatible with large groups of people, the degree of complexity of radio music must remain rather low because most of the target audience has no skills or/and no motivation to listen to a challenging program with complex or/and unknown songs. To test these assumptions, a 4x1 between-subject experiment was conducted. The 217 participants listened to one of four different radio programs with a music program of twelve songs that varied in terms of complexity (complex vs. not complex) and publicity (unknown vs. well-known) of the songs.",Psychological Processes Underlying Consumption of Narrative and Music,Information Systems

Both of these theories have been studied in many contexts however, each study compares a particular treatment against itself in order to determine if a person has been actively engaged in a story (Narrative Engagement) or transported (Transportation theory) into a story. This research study looks at how varying lengths of narratives can lead to varying degrees of transportability. Sixteen stimulus clips taken from cable television shows were used in an experiment. The 16-clips were edited for time in such a way as to keep the narrative virtually identical and modify the amount of time presented including 40 seconds, 50 seconds, and 60 seconds.",Psychological Processes Underlying Consumption of Narrative and Music,Information Systems

Exploring Psychophysiological Responses in a Media Systems Dependency Framework Using Multilevel Modeling,1,"In previous research about the emotional underpinnings of individual-level dependency relations, the dominance factor of emotion has become important. A dysfunctional relationship between perceived control and media use emerged. As increased media use for informational goal achievement has increased, perceptions of control have decreased. The proposed study explores whether individuals’ reported feelings of control match their automatic, psychophysiological responses, and to explore whether those responses might resemble psychophysiological responses related to behavioral addiction.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems

To better understand effectiveness of health intervention in cigarette smoking, it is important to examine the influence of both message content and individual difference. Built upon the framework of dynamic motivational activation, this ongoing experimental study attempts to test the model in the context of anti-smoking public service announcements (PSAs) viewing, and extend the framework by exploring the potential moderating effect of ethnicity on the process. The model brings together the basic motivational processing research and motivated media processing research, and specifies the dynamic causal relationships between exogenous message content variables and endogenous self-causing cognitive processing system. The experiment employs both physiological and self-report measurement, and incorporates ethnicity of both PSA characters and participants as a potential moderator.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems
2014-0289,2014,Poster,Processing Food Advertisements: Initial Biological Responses Matter,2,"Food is a primary biological motivator and as such elicits automatic approach and consumption responses. How directly food is portrayed may alter these responses and as such alter how the ad, brand and product are evaluated. This study uses continuous response measurement (CRM) regarding how much an individual would like to eat food products across the course of their television advertisements as well as standard ad and brand attitude scales to investigate these evaluations. The ads in this study differed in how they were produced. Some ads initially portrayed food as very appetizing and ready-to-eat while others initially portrayed foods in their packaging and not ready-to-eat. In general, results support that unpackaged food is more directly appetitive showing better appetitive ratings overall.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems

Participants were asked to categorize images of food that varied in their directness before and after being exposed to a set of advertisements that also varied in the directness of their available food cues. In general, food products that appeared direct and ready-to-eat sped motivational processes but slowed cognitive processes, and food products that had the least direct food cues did the opposite. Exposure to advertisements, overall, did not hasten the motivational processing of branded information. Implications and future research are discussed.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems

Guided by social comparison theorizing, hypotheses were tested in an experimental design with social comparison motives (self-improvement vs. self-evaluation vs. control) induced through magazine cover headlines and recipient gender as between-subjects factors, and with body satisfaction as within-subjects factor (pre- vs. post-exposure measures; N=150 young adults). Results showed that self-improvement headlines accompanying media models with idealized bodies increased body satisfaction, compared to control headlines and baseline measures. In contrast the self-evaluation headlines did not impact body satisfaction. Results imply that inconsistencies in the extant literature regarding effects from exposure to idealized body imagery are explained by the context in which media images are portrayed, which evoke differential social comparison motives.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems

More specifically, this research proposes and tests an O-S-R-O-R model to provide a more comprehensive picture of the underlying mechanism of HMC effects on healthcare behaviors. To test the theoretical model, we analyze data from the 2013 Consumer Health MARS (Multimedia Audience Research Systems) survey on a syndicated multimedia and product usage related to health and healthcare. The total sample size is approximately 20,000 with 42.8% response rate, obtained as a representative sample of adults residing in the US. We predict that all hypothesized paths in our model will achieve statistically significance with effects in the expected direction, providing support for our view that HMC translates into healthcare consumption through a reasoning processes reflected in interpersonal communications and additional information seeking behaviors.",Psychological Processes Underlying Health Communication,Information Systems

The propositions of the current study rest on the assumption that individuals use media for pleasure while performing more difficult and less enjoyable tasks. Based on the reviewed literature, we predicted that pairing pleasant media activities, such as listening to music (parallel) and checking social networking sites (SNS; serial) with the primary task of reading health-related information online, would lead to more favorable attitudes toward tasks and multitasking situations, enhance memory for health-related contents, and lead to greater argument understanding, argument agreement, and intentions to engage in health problem prevention activities.

Previous research has found that violent content results in memory impairment for products shown during commercial breaks. We extend this work on violent content into the arena of violent video games. In particular, this study examines how violent game content and advertisement congruency affects memory and brand evaluations for fictional brands. Congruent advertisements depict brands related to the actions completed by the player in the game world. Participants were exposed to interactive advertisements placed on the bumper of the car used during gameplay. We found that violent content and congruent advertisements yield decreased memory for the brands depicted in the game. We discuss the significance of these findings in light of the changes predicted for the field of in-game advertising.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems

In the present paper we introduce the concept of consumer endorsement, which we define as people’s intentional public and positive affiliations with brands. Little is known yet about why people are willing to endorse brands. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to examine factors that affect people’s decisions to endorse brands. Suggesting that people strive to express their identities by publicly endorsing brands, we investigated to what extent brand symbolism and the public (vs. private) nature of an endorsement affected people’s intentions to endorse, and explored whether these effects differed between for-profit and nonprofit brands. Results indicate that people prefer to publicly affiliate with nonprofit brands, but prefer private affiliation with for-profit brands. Higher levels of brand symbolism enhanced people’s intention to endorse for-profit brands but not nonprofit brands.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2014-0298,2014,Poster,How Advertising Cues in Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns Influence Consumer Responses,1,"The aim of the present experiment was to investigate how communication elements of a cause-related marketing (CRM) campaign influence consumer responses to the advertised product. Specifically, the roles of visual focus (on the company or on the social cause) and textual message (informational or emotional) were studied. The CRM literature provides some suggestions about these communication strategies, but these suggestions are sometimes contradictory, or not based on direct comparisons of the different elements. Moreover, little is known about the effects of different combinations of these visual and textual advertising elements. In sum, the results of this study show that the combination of visual and textual elements is of importance. Congruent advertisements (visual of company with informational message or visual of cause with emotional message) resulted in more positive consumer responses than incongruent advertisements. Furthermore, first indications for a mediating role of CRM skepticism are obtained in this study.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems

Although goal specificity and self-referencing are both known to affect elaboration, it is unclear how these two sources of elaboration interact. The results showed that lacking a goal resulted in more attention toward the ad and participants had higher intention to click on it than those with a goal. While exposure to high and low self-referencing ad did not have a varying effect on persuasion, there was an interesting interaction effect of motivation and self-referencing ad on attitude toward the website that call for further research.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems

The findings showed that people in a positive mood were more likely to utilize relational processing, whereas people in a negative mood were more likely to utilize item-specific processing. The results also showed that people in a positive mood evaluated ad and product more positively when they were exposed to ad with a utilitarian appeal, whereas people in a negative mood evaluated ad and product more positively when they were exposed to an ad with an experiential appeal. Also, people in a positive mood were more likely to buy the product regardless of types of ad, whereas people in a negative mood were more likely to buy the product when they were exposed to an ad with an experiential appeal.

2014-0302,2014,Poster,When Discounting Fails: Initial Beliefs Can Bias Processing of Corrective Advertising Disclosures,1,"This study aimed to examine the impact of disclaimer saliency and content type in correcting false inferences in mutual fund advertisements. Overall, disclaimer saliency and content type had an additive effect. That is, making the mandated (more general) disclaimer salient as well as a stronger worded disclaimer reduced investors’ return expectations and attitudes toward the advertised fund, indicating that systematic processing of disclaimer content attenuated subjects’ beliefs in a “hot hand” effect (i.e., past success predicts future success). More interestingly, disclaimer content interacted with subjects’ prior knowledge. A strong worded disclaimer which explicitly stated not to rely on prior fund performance (which is normatively irrelevant and uninformative) was effective only among low knowledgeable subjects, whereas high knowledgeable subjects failed to discount prior fund performance in their return expectations and attitudes toward the advertised fund. Overall, the results suggest that investors apparently hold strong beliefs in a “hot hand” effect and that these beliefs tend to persevere among high knowledge investors, even when provided with a strong worded disclaimer.",Analyses of Advertising Cues,Information Systems
2015-0000,2015,Poster,A Prophet Not in His (or Her) Own Land: The Effect of Distance Traversed on Social Influence,3,"Although research has found that the greater the distance between individuals, the less they are attracted to each other, persuaded by the distant other, or form friendships, the current research proposes the prophet not in his (or her) own land hypothesis. It looks at a potential positive side of distance: That being from afar may result in a person being perceived as having more honor, which translates to greater credibility as compared to a person who is local. Therefore, we test whether someone who is from far away is more persuasive than someone who is local. A structural equation model (N = 269) was used to test this general hypothesis, which found that distance has indirect effects that support our hypothesis. Distance affected perceptions of honor (praise to the agent and the expected attractiveness of the agent), which, in turn, caused belief change. Limitations and possible future research are discussed.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0001,2015,Poster,A Laboratory Investigation on Predictors and Consequences of Experiencing Social Closeness During the Usage of Social Networking Sites,2,"In the last decade, scholarship provided a series of insights on how and why using social networking sites (SNS) can be socially and psychologically beneficial for individuals. The present research extends this evidence by focusing on the concept of social closeness as a feeling people experience in the situation they use SNS. In a laboratory setting (N = 60), participants logged in on Facebook, spent ten minutes on the platform and reported their experiences during this session. Analyses of participants’ usage behavior and the experiences revealed that the more time users spent on interacting with other users (e.g., by commenting on updates), the closer they felt to other people. Interacting with others also predicted user’s well-being after Facebook usage, this effect was mediated by the perception of social closeness. This study is one of the first employing momentary measures, offering a further theoretical link between active SNS use and well-being.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0002,2015,Poster,Blending In or Standing Out? Investigating the Impact of Selfies and Social Comparison and Individuals’ Self-Concept,5,"The selfie concept, which refers to ‘digital self-portraits,’ has become particularly popular among teenagers and celebrities across the world (Block, 2014, Wortham, 2013). The increasing use of selfies, however, has raised various concerns such as whether social media has exacerbated narcissistic tendencies among young adults (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2014). The preponderance of these posts begs the question of how such activities and shared information is connected to one’s tendency to socially compare and ultimately influence one’s conception of the self. In this study, using a popular photo sharing platform, Instagram, we investigate the ‘selfie’ concept within the context of social comparison, narcissism, and physical attractiveness. We incorporate a mediator-moderator approach to measure the predictive power of different types of selfies on an individual’s satisfaction with his/her own personal image. Results of this research will provide insights into mediator - moderator relationships on social psychological research addressing digital media usage.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0003,2015,Poster,Parasocial Relationships as Meaningful Relationships: An Exploratory Study of PSRs’ Relationship With Companionship and Emotional Support,1,"Countless studies have examined the purely hedonic, pleasurable experiences and benefits entertainment viewing can elicit. However, more recent theorizing in entertainment effects has shifted to explore a “two-factor” model of entertainment (Vorderer, 2011) in which mixed affect and more complex experiences such as feeling elevated, inspired, touched, and feelings of poignancy that focus more on intellectual and moral virtues and connecting to the human experience are integral parts of an entertainment experience. Rieger, Reineck, Frischlich & Bente (2014) recently found that such entertainment fare can influence one’s overall well-being, creating a form of media-induced recovery from life stresses (see also Reinceck, 2009; Rieger, Reinecke, Kneer, Frischlich, & Bente, 2013). The present study explores the beneficial effects parasocial relationships may have on one’s well-being. More specifically, this suggests one’s motivation to seek out entertainment is related to strength of parasocial interactions which may lead to either companionship or emotional support.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0004,2015,Poster,Romantic Jealousy 2.0: Facebook Jealousy as a Three-Component Conceptualization,2,"Facebook jealousy is traditionally conceptualized and measured as a unidimensional construct. This study examined the multidimensional nature of Facebook jealousy by testing a three-component conceptualization of Facebook jealousy and analyzing how Facebook use (i.e., time and intensity) are associated with these three constructs. Results from a survey of 351 emerging adults from Belgium supported the presence of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral Facebook jealousy as distinct constructs. Further analysis tested mediation models of Facebook intensity and time with the Facebook jealousy dimensions. Facebook intensity was positively associated with behavioral Facebook jealousy both directly and indirectly through emotional Facebook jealousy. Cognitive Facebook jealousy was not a significant mediator of Facebook intensity and behavioral Facebook jealousy. No significant mediation or direct paths emerged for Facebook time and behavioral Facebook jealousy. Overall, these findings highlight the complex nature of Facebook jealousy and the roles of Facebook intensity and time spent on Facebook.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems

Drawing on the heuristic systematic model (HSM), the differential impact hypothesis, and narrative persuasion theory, we examined responses to online news stories conveyed on social media and news sites. Social media formats tended to increase perceptions of identification with message sources contributing to greater personal level risk perceptions and perceived effects on self—thus minimizing third person effects. The narrative format also increased the persuasive impact of the messages. The effects of the risk stories, however, was significantly mediated by the perceived credibility of the source--online news and Facebook sites.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems

Independent of the enduring and lasting changes in the media landscape, TV shows create a desire for recipients to be part of the group experiences (Lochrie & Coulton, 2012c). While in the beginnings of TV consumption, the joint reception was restricted to the people present in one room, the development of social media enables communication and interaction via SNS or microblogging platforms between physically separated persons while watching TV. This leads to a new form of mass participation (Lochrie & Couton, 2012b). This study will seek to close a research gap to a certain extent by examining the climate of opinion in tweets while watching TV. Furthermore, it was of interest for analyzing data if an algorithm enables an automatical and faster classification of valence.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems
2015-0007,2015,Poster,Zero Likes: Virtual Thumbs Down for Belongingness and Self-Esteem,3,"On Facebook, status-updates including pictures, videos, or links can be liked by friends and acquaintances. The presented research investigates the influence of those likes for a status-update on feelings of belongingness and self-esteem and assumes that the absence of likes to status-update poses a need threat to the user. The predictions were tested in a 3 (number of likes zero/two/thirty) x 2 (relationship friends/acquaintance) between-subjects online-experiment (N = 805). Receiving no likes on a status-update had meaningful impact on the participant’s self-esteem and feeling of belongingness. The presented study concentrates on the meaning of not receiving likes on Facebook as temporal need-threat. The experimental manipulation showed that likes are a currency for self-esteem and belonging. It offers distinct data on phenomena like partial ostracism, showing that few likes boost self-esteem and belongingness lesser than many likes.","Social Cognition, Comparison, and Influence",Information Systems

Chilton, born into privilege, was as an unquestioning member of the white power structure. However, over time he became extremely vocal on Civil Rights issues, often using The Gazette’s editorial pages and reporting resources to do so. In examining Chilton’s publishing career, this study reveals how a single newspaper publisher became the most vocal and possibly the most effective voice for change in West Virginia during the civil rights movement, illustrating the dynamic role of even a single press outlet in providing access to information for debate in the public sphere.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Respectively, MP communication campaign in general, and MP films in particular frequently have been hailed to ‘sell Europeans on’ democracy, shared economic goals and the hope of a new, peaceful Europe built on the ashes of the ruined old one. However, it is impossible to talk any of these two aspects, when it comes to the Turkish case.
Although not involved in WW2, Turkey was one of the countries, which not only benefited from Marshall Aid, but also became the audience/theme of some Marshall Films, such as Yusuf and his Plough (1951), The Village Tractor (1951) and Turkish Harvest (1952). Predominantly illustrating the transformation of the “backward” conditions under which Turkish urban-people live, to a “productive and normalized” social environment thanks to Marshall Aid, these movies, as well provide with valuable insights about the regimes of representation that place Turkey into a certain discourse, namely development. Since then, development discourse has historically been such a dominating one in the country, in economical, political, social and cultural spheres.
In this paper, the images of Turkey as they reflect on the representations Marshall Plan planners and experts utilized as they design and carry out their program is analyzed in detail to show the connection between the creation of visibility in discourse, and the exercise of power. The study of employed communication techniques, namely The Marshall Movies about Turkey, problematizes the birth and development of “development discourse” in Turkey, the mechanisms and institutions that were agents in making of development discourse, and, the kind of subjectivity it fostered on Turkish people.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

As part of the Latin music industry’s global launch of this artist, Internet fan outreach and viral marketing strategies were devised to divert attention from the “Nigga” moniker by rebranding and repackaging him as “Flex.” Yet, the use of a racially charged moniker and dual marketing strategies worked against his global branding appeal and produced a crossover fail. Through Internet discourse analysis, I examine four social networking fan pages maintained (2007-2008) under each moniker. This case study is particularly compelling, as it analyzes how representations of Blackness and Latinidad are produced in a hegemonic system that depends on uneven access to power.

Variation in symbolic threat, as well individual differences in Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), were all investigated for their impact on respondent openness. Among 39 student volunteers it was found that a woman's testimony featuring a high degree of symbolic threat engendered less openness to the other across cognitive and affective measures than less threatening testimony offered by a man. Additionally, participant levels of RWA and SDO explained a significant amount of variance in their openness to the other. This study quantitatively confirms that testimonies of race-based suffering- utterances that have great potential to interrupt master narratives and invite deep learning- are likely to be met with a complex pattern of resistance that must be more fully understood.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Thus, the article shows that an epistemic community can move beyond its mainly “informational” role to enter into the shaping of more egalitarian media policy, regulations and administrative practices. The article examines the work of the Institute for Public Representation (IPR), at Georgetown Law Center, and Howard Media Group (HMG), at Howard University, since 2003 to show how two university-based public interest groups have expanded the notion of epistemic roles for women and people of color.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

By focusing on just the academic conspiracy theories of GamerGaters we are able to see how this movement embodies trends that are of particular concern to all scholars. Many of the GamerGate critiques of academia tap into broader anti-intellectual trends in U.S. culture. We also show that GamerGate discourse draws on a long history of connecting feminism to communism in the United States (Storrs, 2007). As feminist scholarship practice increasingly attempts to make academic work more widely accessible, it allows feminist work to be available for critique and harassment in a way other scholarship rarely is. At the same time, this also means that feminist scholarship is uniquely positioned to speak for itself when it is mischaracterized and to change minds even as it is attacked.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0021,2015,Poster,Beyond Sex Differences: Using Testosterone to Investigate Communication During the Post Sex Time Interval,3,"The goal of the present study is to complicate research on sex differences in communication and offer physiology as a possible alternative for understanding differences in communication during the post sex time interval (PSTI). In line with feminist critiques of research involving sex differences, this study does not assume that all females and males are similar, but instead focuses on sources of intrasexual variation. More specifically, this study hypothesized that testosterone would be a better predictor than biological sex when investigating individuals’ positive relational disclosures after sexual activity. The findings of this study provide preliminary support for the role of physiological markers as better predictors of communication behavior during the PSTI than biological sex, as testosterone levels predicted individuals’ positive relational disclosures after sexual activity while biological sex did not. The findings of this study suggest that the binary categories of “female” and “male” may not be sufficient (and may, in fact, be problematic) for understanding post sex behavior and that intrasexual variation needs to be considered when investigating communication after sexual activity.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

It is revealed that no fixed categories can be attributed to the body, and the transition among different types is a tactical response to the compulsory external and internal power that cultivates the body.

We contribute to feminist inquiry by showing how this popular cultural text portrays mothering as a contested site in which women can explore how intensive mothering processes can be destructive-transformative, affirming-disconfirming, and self-focused-community-oriented when not carried to extremes and when situated amidst other possibilities. Our reading of Mad Men delineates transgressive mothering as those gendered processes that disrupt intensive mothering “ideals” by modeling alternative lifestyles, advocating for others’ children, and engaging in anti-mothering practices. In our critique, we consider the broader historical context dominated by significant changes in consumerism, medicine, technology, and politics.

Interpreting this metajournalistic news discourse about what it means for war journalists to report from conflict zones, journalists can be understood sometimes as cultural imperialists, sometimes as hybrid actors in the production of knowledge, but both critical positions insufficiently explain why news discourse persistently positions journalists as a special class deserving of special treatment by governments engaged in conflict. This article argues that journalists should be understood to be part of a corporatist professional-managerial stratum, through which they claim exception to conditions that should be understood as Agambenian states of exception.

However, the concept of multimedia is too ambiguous to adequately analyse contemporary journalism platforms. The concept of multimedia is used both as the combination of media as well as a mix of modalities. This paper questions the current definitions of multimedia and argues that multimodality, a concept stemming from linguistics and semiotics, more adequately grasps the integrated use of different forms of presentation. Grounded in theory, a distinction is made between both concepts, and the argument is put forward that multimedia may be referred to when describing the combined action of multiple online media platforms. It is argued that future research in the domain of journalism studies may benefit from taking this difference between multimedia and multimodality into account.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, the amount of business coverage presented in US news media increased dramatically, and understanding the causes of this trend--including claims of anti-business bias by business leaders, news organizations’ desire to reach affluent audiences, and a growing conviction that economics and finance were of vital importance to all Americans, not just business professionals--provides important context for recent work on the contemporary business press.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Homophobia is found to cause anti-gay violence. Research has endeavored to examine correlates and causation of homophobia to better understand and to effectively intervene.
This study used online surveys to examine whether or not social identity theory (SIT) predicted male and - previously underexplored - female homophobia, whether or not there was a gender difference in homophobia and gender role beliefs, and whether or not homophobia and gender role beliefs were correlated. The results showed that social identity theory predicted only female homophobia (RQ1) but not male homophobia (H1), there was a gender difference in homophobic attitude (RQ2a) but not in gender role beliefs (RQ2b), and homophobia and gender role beliefs were positively and significantly correlated with homophobia in both males and females (RQ3).","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Paper Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The results show that the unintended consequences that characterise not just the conventional market but also the systems of moral production and consumption cause conflicts between different ethical concerns, making it impossible to make choices that are perfectly moral. Regarding the moral market the analysis shows that because consumers and producers are not able to predict, assess and anticipate the outcomes of their choices and because they can't know what information they can trust, ideologies are constantly re-evaluated. New insights lead to adjusting of ideologies. In this context of constant and endless reflexivity, ideologies become intrinsically unobtainable and reflexivity becomes a non-formative of ideology.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

However, we lack a typology of antagonistic structures that exist online, and particularly of the ways they are represented on websites. Social structures can be represented formally (manifestly) or informally (in open verbal or visual forms), or remain latent—a distinction that, in our view, has not received much scholarly attention in the analysis of computer-mediated communication. Based on an interpretative analysis of relational structures and types of acts, we distinguish structural elements that lead us to empirical typologies of antagonistic structures represented online. We finally develop theses why some structures are formally represented more often than others and theorize the consequences of this selective formal representation.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Implementing grounded practical theory, idealized reconstructions are made of the instructional communication practice, instructor-facilitated collegiate classroom discussion (IFCCD), on three levels: interactional dilemma, situated ideals, and talk/discourse techniques. In the reformulated participation structure, the instructor retains the first and third-turns, but the conversational work done in these turns is qualitatively different. The first-turn accomplishes invitation rather than initiation and the third-turn is primarily dialogic follow-up accompanied by evaluation and feedback rather than being primarily the latter two. These instructor turns are examined in depth in two classrooms where the instructors consistently facilitated engaged and participatory discussions. These case studies show the theoretical, practical, and life skills relevance of this scholarly approach and discussion-based teaching.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

A comparative content analysis was conducted across communication from elites who have been internationally recognized as having played some kind of leadership role for in-groups that have committed acts of violence against out-group(s). Data stretching across two decades from four different cases - the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka and Myanmar - were examined. A thematic coding scheme was developed using themes identified in the previous literature, Susan Benesch’s proposal on dangerous speech (2012) and perspectives from Social Identity Theory (1981). Coding and analysis revealed that across countries and temporal spans, elites use a combination of themes but greatly bolster in-group and out-group distinctions and identity through their language choices, but typically avoid outright dehumanization as commonly assumed. Moreover, they excessively create non-falsifiable statements about current, past, or future events; and employ allegations against the intentions, plans and activities of the out-group. These non-falsifiable statements make a bulk of their speech or broadcasts. Several additional themes were identified as well.

2015-0055,2015,Poster,Journalists in Cognitive Dissonance: When Liberal Journalists Work for Conservative Media (or Vice Versa),1,"Seeking a position with a media organization that subscribes to political views different from one’s own is commonly seen in the journalism profession. The ideological gap between individual journalists and editorial policies creates dissonance and tension. This study applies the cognitive dissonance theory to the study of journalistic professions and provides empirical evidences by analyzing survey data from a comprehensive national survey of American journalists. It identifies the major characteristics of journalists working in dissonant newsrooms: they tend to be young and non-religious, and more likely to work in daily newspapers. This study further provides evidences that they perceive less autonomy in newsrooms and enjoy less job satisfaction. Several dissonance reduction modes were found. Based on these findings, this study also discusses the implications for future research in the polarized media environment.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2015-0056,2015,Poster,Living Proof: Using Autobiographical Argument to Make Political Points in Blogs About Inequality,1,"People often cite life experiences as evidence in arguments, though personal experience is far from generalizable. Why? In this paper, I consider the rhetorical dynamics at work in “autobiographical argument” by examining We are the 99 Percent and We are the 53 Percent, two blogs that use autobiographical stories to make discursive points. I argue that autobiographical appeals efficiently use all three of Aristotle’s persuasive “proofs” – logos (logic), ethos (credibility), and pathos (emotion). Then I show that many of the blogs’ stories focus on “redemption,” a theme personality psychologists have found emphasized in the narrative identities, or “stories of self,” of Americans. I argue that autobiographical arguments draw on the cultural and psychological power of life stories.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The network media logic perspective is useful to explain how social media platforms change political communication without resorting to technological determinism or normalization. Comparing network media logic to mass media logics and political logics, we are able to outline their distinct differences and similarities, in terms of how political communication is produced, distributed, and used. This paper specifically focuses on how news mass media’s and social media platforms’ ideals, commercial imperatives, and technological affordances differ in terms of media production, media distribution, and media use.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This is important, as news coverage about political scandals damages politicians’ image, but more decisively, it can also affect democracy as a whole. Using an online experiment, a four factorial between-subjects design, we found that different types of scandals have a direct impact on politicians’ character credibility. Additionally, we found tentative support for the theoretical argument that sex scandals have the lowest impact, financial scandals have a medium impact, and power scandal have the largest impact on character credibility. Interestingly, results show that less politically sophisticated citizens become more cynical when they encounter a sex or power scandal. This emphasizes that the role of political sophistication is important when examining the impact of scandals.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

As a means of resistance for ordinary people in the communist movement, openbare vergadering was the space where the subaltern class gathered together to discuss and debate their oppression and exploitation, their demands and strategies for resistance. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, I provide a brief history of openbare vergaderingen and outline their communicative characteristics. In the second section, I discuss how the concept of openbare vergaderingen, which arose from the practice of public meetings in the period, challenges the Habermasian concept of public sphere and offers a new idea of what “public” means when seen from the perspective of class analysis.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

We investigated whether question polarity affects the answer to VAA statements and the voting advice.
In a natural field experiment during the Dutch municipal elections of March 2014 we varied the polarity of 18 out of 30 VAA statements (N 38,758).
Analyses show a significant effect of question wording for 11 out of 18 questions. Although the direction of these effects varies, it is plausible that variation in question wording does lead to a difference in voting advice. The results of question polarity occur for a broad range of types of VAA users, which stresses the need for VAA builders to be sensitive to wording choices when designing VAAs.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

However, this area of research is plagued by some common shortcomings of implicit theoretical premises and consequently of their empirical realization. The aim of the paper is twofold. First, we tackle these shortcomings with a hierarchical model of generalized functions of public sphere. On a theoretical level, we interweave different strands of thought on the public sphere, and the resulting model is more inclusive and less rigid than those strands on their own. Second, we empirically explore the plausibility of our model in a global comparative analysis. Based on this approach, future research can be contextualized: Case-study based research can plausibly articulate expectations regarding the impact of social media on the public sphere.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

We therefore analyze the use of Twitter in political communication in Switzerland because, in comparison to other democracies, Switzerland with its strong federalism fragmented party system, small country size, and semi-professional politicians can be seen as the most different system thus creating unique conditions for the use of social media. The study investigates the individual characteristics of Swiss Members of Parliament that could influence social media usage and the relationship to journalists as a group on Twitter with high adoption rate. Thus the study contributes to the debate about equalization and normalization with respect to Twitter as a relevant channel for political communication and to the significance of country-specific conditions for the adoption of innovations in political online communication.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In contrast, those with mature faces are perceived as dominant, competent and strong. Based on that research, in the current study we assumed that people with babyish faces would be perceived as having left-wing attitudes while mature-faced people would be perceived as having right-wing attitudes. Moreover, based on research documenting people’s preference for those who do not violate expectations, we predicted that people whose faces are congruent with their political attitudes would be perceived as more socially and physically attractive. However, based on research documenting dominance as an important trait for political leaders, especially during times of war, we posited that political candidates who express dovish attitudes would benefit from mature faces. Two experiments we conducted confirmed these hypotheses and documented the role of the participants’ attitudes as antecedents and consequences of these effects.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In this study, we depart from one specific sort of journalists’ opinions, their issue ownership perceptions, and scrutinize how these relate to both access and favorability of political actors in the news. To this end, a content analysis of 3846 news items from two Flemish television broadcasters, containing 8548 political actors, was performed. Results of the analyses are most clear for access and confirm that parties are more selected as news sources in items about an owned issue than in news items about a non-owned issue. For favorability, results are more mixed but nevertheless lead us to believe that political actors from the issue-owning party receive a more favorable coverage as compared to political actors from other parties.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Through conditional tolerance of criticisms, the Chinese government attempts to present the image of a “free” Internet to its citizens.

Using Kraidy’s conception of a “deterritorialized industry” and Curtin’s theory of “trajectories of creative migration”, I demonstrate a key dimension of the new Moroccan cinema is its situation within a new Moroccan mediascape that has shifted in scale from national cinema to something more regional in terms of distribution and global in terms of financing. In doing so I contend that cinema has become a transnational space for cultural activism by public intellectuals seeking more autonomy to challenge Morocco’s traditionally centralized media discourses, as well as well as an attempt to integrate political norms and participation with those of global civil society in a way that is inclusive of, yet not specific to, Morocco.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In academia, however, using a critical lens to fat is relatively new. Size is not seen as an identity vector imperative to explore when using an intersectional lens, yet we look to race, gender, and nationality (to name a few). By leaving body size out of this conversation we then assume that all sizes are privileged equally.

I suggest the study of photography has to go beyond the meaning of textual level. Thus I propose “Sze-ying” is more than the production of female images. It is a kind of liminoid cultural performance, which allows participants to mimic a social status that they can hardly achieve in the reality, and within this event dramaturgical capital is realized. Dramaturgical capital is used to distinguish the status of the participants in a less-than-ideal liminoid experience.

Participants read an interview about a fictitious medical study that was supposedly set out to test a new malaria medication. On top of the stimulus page, the interviewee was either described as an emotional (n = 62) or a rational (n = 53) expert. Results clearly show the expected communicator matching effect.

Their most important predictor is the perceived undesirability of media messages (Perloff, 1999). Later, Eveland and McLeod (1999) were first to link the social desirability of pro- and antisocial media messages and perceptions of being persuaded within TPP. Nevertheless, persuasion research clearly links persuasion knowledge with reactance (Brehm, 1966), but there is almost no research on the role of persuasion knowledge and reactance within the theoretical framework of TPP.
To shed light on this important antecedent of TPP we conducted a series of two independent experiments on two different topics.
Results of the experiments confirm the assumptions of Eveland and McLeod (1999): social desirability influences TPP via persuasion knowledge. Moreover, the present study adds another mediator, reactance, to this indirect effect.",Persuasion I: Strategies,Information Systems

We test this “backfire effect” in the context of journalistic coverage and examine how to counteract it. In an online experiment, we find evidence for a systematic backfire effect, leading participants to misremember corrected misinformation as true more often than facts as false. The effect occurs after a few minutes and strengthens after five days. However, we show that forming judgments during reception (online judgments) can reduce backfire errors and prevent the erroneous memory affecting the participants’ attitudes. In contrast, people forming memory-based judgments are more prone to backfire errors and thus base their attitudes on misinformation.",Persuasion I: Strategies,Information Systems

We conducted three experiments to investigate how a positive or negative emphasis of only one of these dimensions (i.e., of only warmth or only competence) affects the perception of the other (complementary) dimension, and how voting intentions are influenced by these emphases. The results show that when a politician is described positively in only one of the two dimensions, people assess the complementary dimension more negatively. In addition, the negative emphasis of only one of the two dimensions also leads to a more negative assessment of the complementary dimension. Furthermore, we explore how these one-dimensional person descriptions affect the assessment of the speakers uttering them. Politicians who describe their opponents in negative terms are also evaluated negatively. On the contrary, politicians who judge others in positive terms are not necessarily evaluated positively.",Persuasion I: Strategies,Information Systems

In this article, we propose this reasoning only holds for people high in their Need to Evaluate (NTE). Low NTE individuals do not update their opinions online and have to construct their attitudes memory-based, limiting the likelihood of finding second-order relations. Indeed, results from a cross-sectional survey among 226 adolescents indicate that crime drama viewing and scary world beliefs are only correlated among high NTE individuals. The NTE does not moderate cultivation through non-fiction.

According to Hastorf and Cantril, the memory of gameplay differed, depending on fan involvement, due to the fan groups’ divergent perception of actions as socially relevant ""events"" (p. 132). In a preliminary study (2013), we were able to show cognitive processing of a live soccer-broadcast did not differ between fan-groups of different soccer teams. However, this research revealed interesting findings in regard of fans’ information processing, especially, in regard of perception and memorization accuracy (hindsight bias).

This ability to detect social cues and retain visual social records has been tested mostly with static facial images in laboratory settings. Findings point to better memory for social objects (e.g. other people), especially among women. Because media consumption has become irreversibly entangled with the way social life is navigated, the present study tested gender differences in visual information processing of audiovisual news, using social and non-social memory measures. Women recognized human faces better, men non-facial images. Cued recall measures--testing the salience of visual memory--showed that women mentioned more social images than men. Yet, no gender differences were found for cued recall of non-social images. Education level and time emerged as noteworthy factors in assessing these gender differences.

But what drives consumers to make online endorsements? Based on the assumption that online brand endorsements serve identity-signaling goals, and that people with different self-construals seek to signal their identity in different ways, this research explores the relation between self-construal and people’s intention to endorse brands online in three studies. As brand endorsements are a way of signaling group membership with similarities among its members, and people with high interdependence seek to express similarity to and connectedness with others, we propose that interdependence has a positive effect on people’s intention to endorse brands online. Using two different measures, we demonstrate that a high level of interdependent self-construal indeed positively affects consumers’ intention to endorse brands online (studies 1 & 2) and that this effect is mediated by an increased perception of brand symbolism (study 3).",Research Exploring Individual Differences,Information Systems

In addition, it was the first to examine the mediating role of ad-specific persuasion knowledge and the moderating role of mood. An experiment (N = 127) showed a moderated mediation effect: advergame disclosures increased ad-specific persuasion knowledge, which resulted in higher brand recall, but also in more negative brand attitudes. This mediated effect was only significant for people in positive moods: a disclosure raised awareness of the advergame’s persuasive nature which subsequently led to more critical processing. People in negative moods already processed the advergame in a critical manner. These findings have important implications for theory, legislation, and the advertising practice.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems
2015-0101,2015,Poster,Neural Mechanisms of Successful Message Propagation in Speaker-Listener Communication,5,"Successful human communication depends upon the ability of speakers and listeners to share common messages. Part of this successful message propagation depends on the intention of speakers to promote their ideas, particularly by thinking about how listeners will receive those ideas. Previous fMRI studies show that neural activity within brain systems associated with mentalizing about others can predict the ability of a speaker to persuade a listener to rate a product or object as they do. Using this speaker-listener recommendation paradigm, the current study investigates whether this mentalizing activity in speakers can be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive, portable and flexible tool for neuroimaging. We demonstrate that mentalizing activity in speakers, particularly in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), can predict the correlation of speaker-listener behavioral ratings for liking of novel mobile game applications.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

Previous published research guides hypotheses about content-induced differences in mental mechanisms activated while estimating the impact of sexual versus nonsexual persuasive appeals in advertising. Furthermore, theoretically-derived differences are hypothesized about the inferential mechanisms underlying the TPP targeting specific gendered perceived audiences.

2015-0103,2015,Poster,Self-Affirmation Alters the Brain’s Response to Health Messages and Subsequent Behavior Change,11,"Health communications can be an effective way to increase positive health behaviors and decrease negative health behaviors; however, those at highest risk are often most defensive and least open to such messages. For example, increasing physical activity among sedentary individuals affects a wide range of important mental and physical health outcomes, but has proven a challenging task. Affirming core values (i.e., self-affirmation) prior to message exposure is a psychological technique that can increase the effectiveness of interventions; however, the precise mechanisms of affirmation’s effects remain unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural processes associated with affirmation effects during exposure to potentially threatening health messages. We focused on an a priori defined region of interest (ROI) in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region associated with self-related processing and positive valuation. Consistent with our hypotheses, those in the self-affirmation condition produced more activity in VMPFC during message receipt and went on to increase their activity levels more. These findings suggest that affirmation of core values may exert its effects by allowing at-risk individuals to see the self-relevance and value in otherwise threatening messages.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

To protect consumers against hidden advertising, European broadcasters are required to disclose the presence of brand placement in their television shows. Recent studies have shown that disclosures increase viewers’ persuasion knowledge, however, the circumstances under which disclosures may affect brand evaluations are still unclear. Two studies demonstrate that disclosures result in less favorable brand evaluations and increase resistance to brand placement influence for viewers high in self-control, but do not affect resistance, and even result in more, instead of less favorable brand evaluations when viewers’ self-control is low. Since a state of low self-control is perceived as the ‘couch-potato’ mindset in which people are likely to expose themselves to entertaining television content, the present findings imply that disclosures may be counterproductive in protecting viewers against hidden persuasion attempts.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

This study addresses the effects of sponsorship disclosures by means of an experiment with a 2 (no disclosure vs. sponsorship disclosure) x 2 (source: celebrity endorsers vs. brand) between subjects design. Results showed that 1) overall consumers persuasion knowledge of advertising on Facebook is well-developed; 2) a sponsorship disclosure only influences the use of persuasion knowledge when the posts is disseminated by a celebrity; and 3) a disclosure starts a process in which the recognition of advertising (i.e., the activation of conceptual persuasion knowledge) causes consumers to develop critical beliefs about the post (i.e., use of attitudinal persuasion knowledge), and in turn, decreases their intention to engage in electronic word-of-mouth.",Persuasion II: Message Features,Information Systems

Across two experiments, utilizing different ways of manipulating cognitive abstraction, we demonstrate that participants who receive an induced bridging technique are more likely to produce cognitive bridging outputs and have more abstract responses than participants who did not receive a bridging technique. Alternatively, we do not find these results among participants who experience an integrated bridging technique. Theoretically, this provides evidence for the induced process, rather than the integrated process, of construal level influence on cognitive bridging.

We conducted a total of three experiments: The first two studies investigated whether displaying a game in stereoscopic 3D, compared to HD and SD, would enhance basic user experience variables (e.g., enjoyment and presence). A third study was carried out looking into potential benefits of depth cues contained in stereoscopy on performance in a game requiring visuospatial abilities. The analyses of all three studies yielded no substantial impact of display mode on most of the subjective experience variables or objective performance measures. We conclude that stereoscopic 3D does not seem to be an important predictor of game enjoyment, perceived challenge, performance, presence, or character identification, but that there might be potential benefits when employing it to fulfill particular functions in gameplay.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

In order to provide a common ground for further interdisciplinary research, we propose a general model of experiencing virtual environments. The model builds upon automated and controlled processes of attention allocation and different modes of information processing. In line with this more general approach we propose a definition of presence, defining it as a psychological state that is attributed by an observer and characterized by focused attention allocation towards the virtual environment’s stimuli. The model assumes that virtual stimuli are processed similarly to real stimuli in that innate processing capacities are utilized.

It is often assumed that greater levels of immersive quality elicit higher levels of presence, in turn enhancing the effectiveness of a mediated experience. To investigate this assumption the current meta-analysis synthesizes decades of empirical research examining the effect of immersive system technology on user experiences of presence. Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies, it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized effect on presence. Additionally, results show that increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are significantly more impactful than improvements to most other immersive system features, including quality of visual and auditory content. These findings are discussed in light of theoretical accounts of the presence construct as well as practical implications for design.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

The present experiment manipulates normative information to be antisocial in a violent driving video game, through the use of experimenter instruction (game objectives) and confederate behavior (peer pressure). Results suggest that game objectives have the strongest influence on in-game behavior, but that this effect was strengthened or tempered by confederate pressure. In-game behavior mediates the manipulations’ influence on perceived norms and attitudes toward being a safe driver and passenger. Perceived norms and attitudes predict behavioral intentions to drive antisocially in the real world. Results indicate that communication of norms through media violence is a potentially important mechanism in antisocial media effects, and that focus on media behaviors with direct real-world corollaries may be a fruitful area of research.",Processes Underlying Communication Technology Use,Information Systems

In response, parties in society, propose that digitally enhanced advertisements should carry a label, informing consumers whether the image has been manipulated. The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge on the effects of photo retouching disclosures and literacy treatments on the processing of digitally manipulated advertisements and persuasion outcomes. The results of two experiments show that 1) photo-retouching literacy treatments attenuate persuasion by advertisements including manipulated images, 2) photo-retouching disclosures are only effective when people have not received a literacy treatment. Theoretically this implies that increasing people’s knowledge of a persuasion technique (i.e., photo retouching) raises their defenses against persuasion. Practically, our results imply that literacy treatments can be used to offset unfair persuasion by photo-retouched images in advertising, but that disclosures can be just as effective.",Processes Underlying Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Information Systems

The current study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which consumer attitudes are affected through the use of psychophysiological measures. In a within subjects design, participants were exposed to conceptually matched advertisements featuring same-sex couples or different-sex couples while heart rate and facial EMG activity were collected and time-locked to the ads.

The core of this research is based on an interaction concept of a large display like digital signage. The emerging means of interacting with these screens usually employ gesture interactivity and self-reflection in conjunction with media in public spaces; the gesture interactivity and self-reflected image are independent variables, and attitudes toward advertising, brand, and purchase intention are dependent variables for this study. Consequently, this research explores the following hypotheses: 1) experience with interactive advertising improves users’ psychological effects, including presence, emotions, and attitude change; 2) interactive advertising is significant to the advertisement’s effectiveness; 3) in interactive media, gesture interactivity produces stronger psychological effects and advertisement effectiveness than avatar self-representation; and 4) psychological effects mediate between display advertising and advertisement effectiveness.",Processes Underlying Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Information Systems

The results revealed that while behaviorally targeted online ads do have a positive direct effect on purchase intention, exposure to behavioral tailoring also sets off a negative indirect effect on purchase intention that attenuates the positive direct effect. This reduction of purchase intention can be attributed to the creepiness factor –the sense that marketers are tracking an individual’s personal information or online activities. Exposure to behaviorally tailored ads led to increased perceived creepiness, which led to increased threat, increased reactance, negative attitudes toward the ad, and ultimately negative purchase intention toward the featured product. The overall effect on purchase intention was reduced by five percent, indicating that the creepy aspects of behavioral tailoring have a real cost for marketers.",Processes Underlying Advertising and Consumer Behavior,Information Systems

Research on multitasking and food intake has found that such inattentive eating has important effects.However, another possibility is that emotional arousal from the multitasking stimuli can be carried over to the eating behavior (Wang & Lang, 2012), causing more mindless or heuristic eating behavior. This study uses a mixed methods approach and computational choice modeling to investigate the dynamic relationship between multitasking and food choice, and to differentiate these two hypotheses.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems

Participants read short magazine articles on devices with different screen sizes (tablet/mobile phone) while ads appeared at the periphery (top/bottom) of the reading screen. We measured gaze count, gaze fixation, and number of saccades as indicators of visual attention, and recognition accuracy as an indicator of memory.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems
2015-0126,2015,Poster,Multitasking Distorts Time Perceptions: Examining Time Passage and Time Duration During Media Multitasking,2,"In this study, we examine two measures associated with the psychology of time— passage and duration. Time was perceived to “fly by” in the high-entertainment condition that involved watching a sitcom, whereas time “dragged on” in the low-entertainment condition that involved reading a journal article. Likewise, estimated time duration in minutes also was longer in the high-entertainment condition than the low-entertainment condition. In addition, activity-switching had a significant effect on time passage and time duration. In comparison to the low-entertainment condition, participants perceived time to pass quickly and estimated longer time duration when switching between the low- and high-entertainment activities. Further, individual differences in multitasking habits and preferences were found to be negatively correlated with time duration estimation, suggesting automatic cognitive adjustments by chronic multitaskers to offset time distortions associated with multitasking. Implications for theory and measurement of media and communication research are discussed.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems
2015-0127,2015,Poster,Selective Attention and Selective Avoidance in the Context of Political Advertising: A Behavioral Approach Using Eye-Tracking Methodology,3,"Selective exposure refers to the tendency of individuals to select, read, or process information that is in line with their political views. This study advocates a behavioral approach to selective exposure research by introducing eye-tracking methodology as a straight-forward measure of attentional processes. We tested participants’ selective attention to and selective avoidance of political poster advertisements from one left-wing and one right-wing party. Like in real-world campaigns, participants were exposed to a screen with two different poster ads and their eye-movements were unobtrusively recorded. Findings indicate that the political orientation of the participants partially explained selective attention but not selective avoidance. Implications for selective exposure research are discussed.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems

Expanding this literature, the present study examines how emotional state may relate to task-switching on laptops. To explore this relationship the study employs novel methodologies to observe media multitasking behavior over the course of several days and in the field. This approach offers a unique dataset that affords analysis of actual media multitasking activity in natural settings throughout a week in terms of content types viewed, duration per content, number of switches, valence and arousal during the switches, and time of day.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems
2015-0129,2015,Poster,The Persuasive Effects and Underlying Mechanisms of Multitasking With Second Screen Media,3,"Multiscreening, a relatively new form of media multitasking with TV and a second screen device, has implications for the effects (i.e., memory and evaluation) of persuasive messages due to concurrent modalities (i.e., both visual). This study examined 1) whether multiscreening, like other forms of media multitasking, leads to declines in memory, and 2) the underlying mechanisms of the effect of multiscreening on evaluative outcomes. Three underlying mechanisms were examined: counterarguing, processing fluency, and enjoyment. The experiment (N = 182), in which multiscreening (i.e., TV and tablet) was compared with single medium use, confirmed the memory deficit for multiscreening. Furthermore, the results showed that both counterarguing and processing fluency are underlying mechanisms of the effect of multiscreening on evaluative outcomes.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems
2015-0130,2015,Poster,The Relationship Between Media Multitasking and Academic Achievement,3,"Concurrent with the increase in media multitasking concerns have arisen regarding the impact of media multitasking on adolescents, and particularly on their academic achievement. Although previous studies have provided preliminary evidence that academic media multitasking has negative effects on academic achievement, two main shortcomings could be distinguished. This studies will address these shortcomings by 1) examining both general media multitasking and academic media multitasking and 2) investigating three potential underlying mechanisms. To test our hypotheses we will conduct a study among Dutch adolescents between 11-13 years old. Data collection is scheduled for October to November 2014. The first data have already been collected from 560 students. Data will be collected through an online questionnaire, in which we measure the general media multitasking, academic media multitasking, study time, attention during academic activities and attention problems. Results will be presented and discussed.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems
2015-0131,2015,Poster,Time Flies and Students are Productive When Attention is Combined With Multitasking Distraction,5,"Research on motivations for media multitasking has moved beyond productivity to social and emotional gratifications (David et al., 2014; Wang & Tchernev, 2012). In a sample of college students, we examined positive affect, arousal and productivity as motivations of multitasking. Further, we introduced a fourth construct, passage of time, which was evaluated on a continuum from “time stood still” to “time flew by” (Gable & Poole, 2012). Time passage was introduced to examine absorbing multitasking experiences that create the sensation of loss of time, which is typical in flow experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

Multitasking and task-switching are demanding and complex behaviors that can be measured more accurately in real time. Therefore, using experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (Shiffman, Stone, & Hufford, 2008), three components of multitasking, number of activities pursued at a time, frequency of switching between activities, and attention to the primary activity, were used to predict motivations.",Multitasking and Selective Attention,Information Systems

We anticipated that valence, use of pronouns, and timeliness (operationalized as temporal cue words) would also increase diffusion in this context. Results suggested that across handles, increased retweeting was associated with negative emotional content, but negatively associated with positive emotional content. Typically, temporal word cues were associated with greater retweeting. However, first person pronouns were generally associated with reduced retweeting.",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems

It has been argued, that a lack of privacy literacy may explain why users unwantedly self-disclose a considerable amount of personal information and do not deliberately regulate their privacy. Building upon prior research, we developed and validated the Online Privacy Literacy Scale (OPLIS), a comprehensive instrument for measuring users' literacy, assessing users' knowledge about (1) institutional practices, (2) technical aspects, (3) data protection laws, and (4) their ability to use privacy protection strategies. The final 24-item scale was validated in an online survey with a sample representative of German internet users (N=1,959). To construct a reliable and well performing scale, we used both item response theory (IRT) and structure equation modeling (SEM).",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems

In an experiment conducted with college students, a Weblog-embedded news article from a media source incongruent with one’s political alignment, as opposed to a congruent media source, triggered hostile perception of tenor of the media, which in turn led to presumed influence of the news article on others. The presumed influence on others became a basis for assessing online climate of opinion, which affected perception of self as a minority against the online climate of opinion. The media source factor, in conjunction with user comments factor manipulated at the two levels of agreeable and disagreeable comments, also generated different levels of minority perception both online and offline, of which the latter increased rather than decreased willingness to speak out. These findings were discussed under the dual-influence framework encompassing mediated and interpersonal communications as a psychological mechanism of spiral of silence.",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems
2015-0135,2015,Poster,Online Pornography and Sexual Practice: Explaining the Uses of Sexually Explicit Material Within and Outside Committed Relationships,4,"The cliché notion of pornography consumption is that it primarily serves as a vehicle for masturbation and thus as a substitute for sexual intercourse. It is hence expected that the frequency of watching pornography declines when people start a committed relationship. We investigate how using pornography is related to masturbatory practice as well as to couples’ sexual interaction to shed light on how exactly relationship status influences the frequency of pornography consumption. The results show that the frequency of masturbation predicts that of watching pornographic material. However, masturbation does not decline among women in committed relationships and it only slightly declines among men. A committed relationship marked by intense sexual interaction can even contribute to increasing the frequency of masturbation and hence the consumption of pornographic material. We have to broaden our understanding of masturbation as autonomous sexual practice to understand the role pornography plays inside and outside committed relationships.",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems
2015-0136,2015,Poster,The (not so) Guilty Mouse Potato: How Appraisal of Online Procrastination Changes the Recovery Outcome After Online Media Use,3,"In times of ubiquitous online communication, Internet users are challenged by numerous opportunities for dysfunctional forms of online media use. Users suffering from low situational self-control in particular, are prone to engage in online procrastination. Although procrastinators seek pleasurable short-term satisfaction of hedonic needs, procrastination with media content such as watching TV can in fact reduce overall well-being due to feelings of guilt. The present study examines whether this finding can be replicated for online communication. Additionally, it expands the research on online procrastination by investigating the role of self-forgiveness based on a sample of N = 309 Internet users. Results of a two-group structural equation model indicate that self-forgiveness moderates the effects of procrastination on guilt. This, in turn, partly restores the recovery outcome.",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems

One potential contributing factor might be the experience of fluency while using SNSs which is theoretically linked to superficial processing. In this experiment, N = 72 participants read either fluent or disfluent social media profiles on a fictitious SNS, answered questionnaires about Usability, Trust, and Willingness to Self-Disclose regarding this SNS, and their Memory for the content of the fictitious SNS profiles was tested. For each memory test item Confidence ratings were collected and their Accuracy was determined. Results show significantly better Memory and Confidence for the disfluent than for the fluent condition; however, fluency had no effects on Accuracy, Usability, Trust, and Willingness to Self-Disclose. Implications for designing SNS and for users’ digital literacy are discussed.",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems

The primary goal is to understand student engagement with the university’s social media, in terms of blog views, number of comments, and social scores (i.e., proprietary scores of sharing). Based on language expectancy theory, the current paper proposes a research framework that initially employs the linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) program to explore connections between textual characteristics of blog content and student engagement (Study 1). The linguistic analysis informed development of original concepts related to engagement, which were empirically tested for predictive validity (Study 2). We propose that the results of the two sequential studies illuminates on a process that can lead to formulation of instructional materials and automated feedback systems to train blog writers to create more engaging content in the information system environment.",Computer-Mediated Communication,Information Systems

Our longitudinal analysis shows, among other things, that the bandwidth share distributions – and thus bandwidth differences – exhibit considerable path dependence where country proportions of international bandwidth in 2011 can be substantially accounted for by a preferential attachment based mixture of micro-level processes. Interestingly, our preferential attachment model, consistent with empirical data, does not predict increasing concentration of bandwidth within top ranked countries. We argue that recognizing the strong, but nuanced, historical inertia of bandwidth distributions is helpful in better discriminating among competing theoretical perspectives on the global digital divide as well as in clarifying policy discussions related to gaps between bandwidth rich and bandwidth poor countries.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2015-0142,2015,Poster,Factors Driving Adoption and Diffusion of Multiscreen Services,3,"As convergence technologies undergo swift advancement, multi-screen services are rapidly gaining popularity. The emergence of multi-screen services, and users’ simultaneous and sequential engagement with multiple devices throughout the day, has challenged marketers to develop effective communication strategies. In light of such rapid development, this study analyzes user behavior with regard to multi-screen services, focusing in particular on the antecedents of user intention. It also examines the diffusion model with regard to market dissemination of the multi-screen. A multi-state analytic approach was also proposed, whereby the research model was tested using structural equation modeling; the results were used as inputs for a neural network model to predict multi-screen adoption. The findings indicate that multi-screen quality significantly influences usability, which subsequently affects adoption of the technology. The policy and managerial implications of multi-screen development are discussed based on models of acceptance and diffusion. This study provides in-depth analysis and heuristic data on user drivers, market dynamics, and policy implications within the multi-screen ecosystem.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0143,2015,Poster,High-Choice Revisited: An Experimental Analysis of the Dynamics of News Selection in High-Choice Media Environments,1,"Explosive growth in the number of options available to media users prompts researchers to consider how selection behavior has changed as well as how researchers' theories should change to suit an era of higher-choice media. Two experiments demonstrate that choice environments offering options in smaller sets lead users to be more likely to select news content, in particular “hard news” content such as stories related to international politics. A third study incorporates theories of information processing to explain the observed effects of choice environment. The study provides evidence that smaller sets of options lead users to compare the merits of each option while larger sets prompts users to quickly scan the environment for an acceptable option. A consideration of the selection behavior observed in these studies reveals that greater numbers of available options in the media environment actually decrease the diversity of selection behavior among a population. These findings suggest that subtle changes to the media choice environment, such as a change in the number of headlines presented on news websites, can have large effects on news selection behavior.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0144,2015,Poster,"Incidental and Deliberate Cues, Credibility, and Impression Formation on YouTube",3,"Modern web pages, particularly social network sites (SNS) continue to prominently display user-data. Research in the fields of communication technology and interpersonal communication have explored effects of numerous system-generated cues (e.g., Facebook friends, Amazon star ratings, YouTube view counts). However, despite the prevalence of system-displayed, aggregate-user representation cues, there is little research that differentiates and compares their effects. This study utilized YouTube's behavioral and evaluative system-generated cue sets and found support for bandwagon effects and heuristic processing (MAIN Model). The 4 [view count] x 4 [thumbs up proportion] factorial experiment showed that message credibility, website credibility, and a target's trustworthiness, competence, and task attractiveness increased as the thumbs up proportions increased. No effect was found for manipulations of view count. These results suggest that system-generated cues may only affect judgments via the direct signal of the information, and that more complex inferences may not be used in interpreting cues online.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Three newspapers (one elite; two popular) were investigated: one daily issue every six months -- over 6000 news items. Seven dependent variables were scored (testing seven hypotheses): number of news items & pages; information vs. analysis/commentary; item length; number of visuals; frequency of future/speculative news; soft/general/hard news; internet motifs (e.g.""links""). Ten journalists/editors were surveyed as well. The Findings show a clear pattern of adaptation, although not always in the direction hypothesized.

targeted at young users, an important question is to what extent children are able to perceive
S3D and which factors determine this ability. To answer this question, we conducted an
experimental study with 62 children between 5 and 13 years. Apart from socio-demographic
variables such as age, gender and experience with S3D, we considered cognitive variables
including interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) and anthropometric variables including
interpupillary distance (IPD) and head circumference. In line with previous findings, our
results suggest that older children are better at perceiving S3D. Moreover, a stepwise
regression analysis revealed that IHTT, rather than age or IPD, explains most of the variance
in S3D accuracy rates. Our findings suggest that at early ages, the ability to perceive S3D
seems to be largely mediated through developmental cognitive factors such as IHTT, rather than anthropometric variables.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

A Conceptual and Empirical Comparison Between Television Viewing Rates and Twitter Data for TV Audience Research,6,"Social media platforms, such as Twitter, are changing the way people consume broadcast television media. For producers, social media metrics provide new insights and challenge incumbent measuring instruments, such as viewing rates. Within academia, Twitter’s relevance for audience research has developed only recently, whereby both opportunities and pitfalls are defined. In this paper, we depart from the idea that viewing rates and Twitter data enrich one another. We provide a conceptual and empirical comparison between both measures. Twitter data deepens our understanding of the viewing audience and viewing rates concurrently allow us to account for the relative importance of the tweeting audience. The data shows interesting inverse relations between ratings and Twitter traction for particular television programs, revealing low ratings in conjunction with high traction on Twitter and vice versa.

The Influence of Social Motives and Expected Outcomes on the Usage of Social TV Applications",4,"Social TV applications have become increasingly popular. Building on first results on motives for usage, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of factors that influence the likelihood of using Social TV applications. A special focus lay on the identification of the relative impact of social variables such as social motives as well as expected social outcomes in the sense of social gratifications. An online survey of Social TV users (N = 101) demonstrated that frequency of Social TV usage is not predicted by socio-demographic variables like gender and age, nor by personality aspects like extraversion or need to belong. However, the motives to communicate with others, to inform oneself and to be entertained as well as the perceived social gratification of increased enjoyment were influential. When predicting usage frequency of specific platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp, however, different patterns emerge. While WhatApp usage is predicted first and foremost by the need to belong, Twitter usage is influenced by the motive to receive information and to communicate.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The goal of our study is to analyze how terms of privacy are interactively negotiated in cases of mobile phone calls in the presence of others. In contrast to previous studies, our focus lies on the embedding of phone calls into social situations. This does not only entail the phone call itself and what happens meanwhile, but also interaction before (prequel) as well as after (sequel) the telephone conversation. Within a grounded theory approach, we combine theories about telephone conversation with Irwin Altman’s (1975) privacy concept and study privacy behavior with the help of conversation analysis and participant observation.

In this study we distributed an online survey to 70 participants in search of differences between relationship type (long-distance vs. geographically close) across the frequency of media use, perceived intimacy and media utility, and affect. Our results suggest that individuals in long-distance relationships send more text-messages, videos through photo messaging, and spend more time video chatting and on the phone with their significant others than those in geographically close relationships. Those in long-distance relationships also viewed texting, emailing, and video chatting as more useful in maintaining and building their romantic relationship than did geographically close counterparts. A disclosure task and subsequent language analysis found that individuals in long-distance relationships tend to use more negative affect, sad words, anger terms, and third-person pronouns, but fewer “we” words when asked to describe their feelings about their relationship based on communication activities.

The first aim of this study was to test how gender composition affects self-disclosure in CMC. Furthermore, this study aims to compare text-based CMC and audiovisual CMC to test whether there is more self-disclosure in text based CMC compared to audiovisual CMC or face-to-face interaction and whether there is an interaction effect of communication condition and gender composition on self-disclosure. Therefore, 132 dyads (female-female, male-male, cross-sex) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: text-based CMC, audiovisual CMC, and face-to-face communication.

They have to adapt to a constant (re-)invention of ICTs which means to continuously cope with new media technology, formats, communication dynamics and content. This paper elaborates on how individuals are coping with media change in regard of nostalgic engagement with their media past. Results of an online survey show that an active and social way of coping leads to a positive assessment of media change and does not facilitate media nostalgia. The contrary appears when individuals are denying change and are avoiding the problems they are facing in processes of media change. In these cases media nostalgia paves the way for disengaging coping strategies that help to turn away from the problem to comforting nostalgic memories treasured in one´s past life span which explains a negative attitude towards media change.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Warnings about comment deception in the form of user-to-user replies only raised people’s awareness of online review fraud if the majority of the comments on the board were in support of the product. Once people became aware of the possible deception they started to defensively process all the supportive information including the commercial and thus they eventually had less interest in trying e-cigarettes.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0160,2015,Poster,Harmonizing Freedom and Protection: Adolescents’ Voices on Automatic Monitoring of Social Networking Sites,2,"Automatic monitoring of transgressive user-generated content is a method to detect certain risks for adolescents on SNS by means of automatic text and image categorization techniques. Research on this monitoring method is focused on technological development, however insight into adolescents’ opinions regarding the desirability is needed. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N=66) between 12 and 18 years old.
Adolescents’ opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of their freedom. Whether monitoring is desired depends on the level of control of the situation and the incorporation of certain requirements, indicated by adolescents. The majority of adolescents is in favour of automatic monitoring of content they perceive as uncontrollable. The automatic monitoring is favoured but measures must be incorporated to harmonize protection with freedom of expression and control.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The result shows that 1) Chinese netizens’ knowledge production on Weibo is very limited, and direct knowledge production is far less than indirect knowledge production; 2) There is a significant gender gap of knowledge production and a rural-urban divide; 3) Knowledge production is more strongly associated with public participation than knowledge possession, and direct knowledge production has greater impact on public participation than indirect knowledge production; 4) The production of truth and belief knowledge has greater impact on public participation than mere truth or belief knowledge, and there is a positive co-relation between the production of positive and neutral belief knowledge and public participation.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0162,2015,Poster,Mobiles in Interpersonal Communication: Smartphones Serve as Intrasexual Signals,1,"This research investigated the signaling function of mobiles in interpersonal communication from an evolutionary perspective. By applying the parental investment theory and the handicap principle, two studies examined smartphones as a sexual signal in same-sex competition. Experiment one (N=183 men) revealed that men perceived a male rival depicted as the owner of a conspicuous high-status smartphone as more inclined toward short-term mating, while they rated a male rival depicted as the owner of an in-conspicuous low-status smartphone as a more desirable long-term mate from a female perspective. Experiment two (N=395 women) showed that women judged a more attractive female rival as a more desirable short-term mate from a male perspective and as rather inclined toward short-term mating, regardless of her smartphone. These results contribute to a deeper understanding as to why individuals select media and communication technologies in interpersonal communication that goes beyond the classic approaches in media psychology.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0163,2015,Poster,Climate Change and Technology: Examining Opinion Formation and Risk Perceptions of Geoengineering,1,"In recent years, ‘climate change’ has matured from a technical term employed by scientists and policy-makers to a social, political, and moral locus that has garnered widespread media coverage, public interest, and debate around the world. As evidence demonstrating the anthropogenic influence on the Earth’s climate has steadily grown stronger, climate change has come to be seen as a pre-eminent challenge of the 21st century. Until recently, most discourse regarding potential responses to anthropogenic climate change have focused on two categories of response options 1) emission mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and 2) human adaptation to a changing world (Mercer, Keith and Sharp, 2011). Geoengineering, a set of proposed large-scale technological fixes to reduce or neutralize greenhouse gas emissions, is a third emerging category of response to global climate change. This study seeks to understand which factors contribute, or alternatively, subtract from public acceptance of geoengineering through predictive hierarchical OLS regression modelling of public perceptions of a variety of factors including socio-demographics, value predispositions, and media use. Such predictive modelling can enable risk communicators and policy-makers with vital information to improve future public engagement and communication about geoengineering.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0164,2015,Poster,Effects of Similarity and Framing on Narrative Environmental Risk Communication,3,"Environmental risks threaten both human health and nonhuman entities. It was predicted that framing an environmental risk as a human health risk would improve persuasive outcomes of a message. Further, it was expected that similarity between the audience and the people and places depicted in the message would also improve message outcomes. Two types of similarity (demographic similarity and scene similarity) were manipulated in a 2 (risk frame: health, environmental) × 2 (demographic similarity: high, low) × 2 (scene similarity: high, low) between-subjects experiment (N = 568), in which participants were exposed to a message about drought framed as either a health or an environmental risk. Scene similarity interacted with message frame (health vs. environmental) for narrative persuasion and behavior-related variables. Specifically, high (versus low) scene similarity resulted in better persuasive outcomes for the health frame than for the environmental frame, whereas low (versus high) scene similarity resulted in better persuasive outcomes for the environmental frame than for the health frame. Additionally, the study found that framing an environmental risk as a health risk increased behavioral intention and behavioral expectation. Furthermore, high (versus low) personal relevance improved risk perception, narrative persuasion, behavioral intention and expectation, and response efficacy. The study has implications for health and environmental risk communication, particularly for impersonal risks that people perceive to be of low personal relevance, and opens up new avenues for research and practice in areas such as climate change communication and entertainment-education. Limitations, implications, and recommendations for replications and extensions are discussed.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Through an engagement with postcolonial empirical contexts, I problematize the deliberative model related to public participation in environmental decision-making. Drawing on Partha Chatterjee’s (2004) work, I analyze the Indian nuclear establishment’s ways of differentially addressing some stakeholders in the environmental controversy as scientific-citizens belonging to the “civil society” and others as scientifically illiterate populations belonging to “political society.” Such a governmental approach, I argue, serves to perpetuate the experts-laypersons divide and thereby fails to emerge with expertise that could be a “public resource” by integrating scientific knowledge with local concerns (Kinsella, 2004).",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The resulting public controversy, dubbed 'climategate', cast doubt on the credibility of the scientists, the CRU, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and on the science supporting anthropogenic climate change. This paper uses the Image Repair Theory (Benoit, 1997) to examine the communication strategies of the parties involved. Nine investigations, press releases, newspaper articles, and blogs were analyzed to identify image repair strategies of the scientists, the CRU and IPCC. Analysis suggests that denial, attacking the skeptics, and bolstering were prominently used by the three parties, in different measures with relative success. This paper suggests the potential for, and the need to investigate inter-organizational crisis communication to assist in reputation management, as crisis often engulfs multiple rhetors.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

S. west coast has attracted substantial attention. In response to this novel environmental issue, two experiments were conducted to examine the effectiveness of two emotional appeals. Experiment 1 compared a sadness appeal, a hope appeal and a control condition (no message), and found that, in general, both the sadness appeal and the hope appeal were more persuasive than the control condition in heightening a number of behavioral intentions, such as support for policies, information seeking, and pro-marine environment behaviors. Experiment 2 not only compared the sadness appeal and the hope appeal with a neutral message condition, but also investigated the interaction effects of the two emotional appeals with gain versus loss frame. This experiment provides initial evidence that a sadness appeal will be more effective when it is accompanied by a gain frame and that a hope appeal tends to have greater impacts when it is juxtaposed with a loss frame.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

However, their exposure to a company’s environmental CSR activity sometimes compensates their aversion with the ads, and even makes them more tolerant of being annoyed. Through a controlled experimental design, this study examines the impacts of support for environmental CSR activities on ad avoidance and consequently on brand evaluation. We found that, the impact of a company’s environmental CSR activity may not help boost the company’s popularity among the consumers, but it certainly can help the company be less averted.

Apocalyptic imaginations of Bangladesh, however, are increasingly being counteracted by indigenous perspectives through the power of blogs. This study examines the discursive strategies enacted within the blogosphere to displace narratives that speak for Bangladesh in its struggle to adapt to a changing climate. Through a critical discourse analysis of two blogs that focus on community-based adaptations to climate change in Bangladesh, this study engages perspectives that highlight the resiliency of the Bangladeshi people. Using Appadurai’s five dimensions of transnational exchange, or “scapes,” this study focuses on how transnational digital activists are using blogs (mediascapes) through the power of new technologies (technoscapes) to produce postcolonial discourses (ideoscapes) that seek collective action against climate change, and give voice to climate refugees, a new class of transnational migrants (ethnoscapes).",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The study applies modernization theory to explain the rise of mediation shows in China, and public’s overwhelming accolades for mediation than litigation. A content analysis of episodes of Gold Medal Mediation reveals significant findings on the mediator, the observer cohort and other factors in predicting successful mediation on the show. Ordinal regression is employed, and findings suggest that “secret talking” rather than transparency between disputants has significant influence on successful mediation. Additionally, “compromise of rights” by disputants is a key factor in solving disputes. Other surprising findings include the use of therapeutic activities and the neutral stance of the observer cohort. This quantitative study enhances the role of Chinese mediation shows in propagating mediation in contemporary Chinese society and supporting upheld morality values.

Although the state continues to assert significant regulatory authority through licensure and taxation, certain swaths of the Cuban economy that were previously administered solely by the state are now operating in response to market variables. One sector of the economy conspicuously exempt from these processes of economic liberalization is Cuba’s state-run media. Understanding media production and consumption as sites of cultural contestation, this paper seeks to investigate the state of the contemporary Cuban media, including its political commitments and cultural imperatives.

A number of “cosmopolitanizing strategies” are interrogated that position HRC concurrently within multiple registers: global, regional and local. Examples of these crosscutting strategies include disruption, performance, and hybridization. The hybridity present in HRC, as a central cosmopolitanizing strategy, both incorporates but also reaches beyond the local.

2015-0175,2015,Poster,One World and Still Many Gaps: A Topological Analysis of Audiovisual and Digital Developments in the Mercosur Region.,1,"This paper relates questions of power in governing communications to space and place. The argument developed is that policy documents contain a geographical dimension and thus reflect border-crossing practices of policy-making as shaped through existing international power constellations. The first part of this paper deals with the question of how geographical content is traceable in documents and brings to the fore underlying power geographies. A new framework of ‘rooting’ policy documents geographically and identifying ‘routed’ policy texts, ideas and settings is established for that purpose. In the second part, the documents from the Audiovisual (AMP) and the Digital (DMP) MERCOSUR Program are ‘geographically rooted’ and that way shown how space, nation-state and power interrelate in the design of the texts. These two cases are particularly interesting for this type of analyzes as they are first, international by nature and second, display the development of both regional audiovisual and digital policies in the MERCOSUR (Common Southern Market). Herby, the AMP stands for the cultural shaping of the MERCOSUR, whilst the DMP represents the drive for technological and economic development of the region. The analysis reveals the structure of border-crossing interactions in the development of communication policies in the MERCOSUR and displays their different scales of influence for the implementation of the ideas promoted through these inter-regional programs. The diffusion of certain understandings regarding communication policies from one geographical setting into others becomes evident as mode of multi-level governance of communicative spaces in the MERCOSUR. The regional level promotes the construction of communicative spaces through principles from outside the region and the necessity to implement these to foster the development of the audiovisual and digital sector. The analysis of each program brings to the fore different scales, as well as the missing links to policy developments in other emerging regional settings and reveals the still existing opportunity gap for the governance of communicative spaces all over the world.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Youth participation in the production of public culture is analyzed as a performance of cultural citizenship and, thus, a means of affecting social change. Such change is mediated by the creation of discursive social spaces of consuming and producing satire, as this social space (or public) becomes the site of forging new identities of political dissent.

From this rubric, one video detailing a clinic visit was produced, screened for a diverse audience and evaluated for its efficacy. This video utilized only images to convey information in an attempt to circumvent the confusion that may result while viewing media in a foreign language. Communication theories and strategies such as the Sabido method of edutainment and social cognitive theory guided the filmmaking process. Although, it is impossible to create a universally comprehensible text, the development of potentially transcultural media helped identify key issues that should be carefully considered. Effective intercultural communication strategies and an awareness of cultural concerns factored into decisions on representations of gender and nationality, shot composition and editing, as well as the use of positive, negative and transitional characters. This task resulted in both a rubric for media production as well as a reflection on transcultural communication in a broader context.

The results suggest a vast number of different cues were judged to be diagnostic of deception, most prominently hesitations (or lack thereof), the amount of detail provided, eye contact, and a general truthful demeanor. None of these cues were actually diagnostic of deception. The implications for how to “bust” the myths about deception given to and perpetuated by lay audiences are discussed.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Throughout the Middle East and Gulf region, the integration of Arabic and Latin letterforms is commonly viewed in storefronts, street signs, advertising billboards, and informational signage. This paper will explore the development of cultural globalization, by focusing on the use of bilingual/multilingual typography within the linguistic landscape of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

2015-0192,2015,Poster,Wikipedia as a Space for the Discursive Construction of Globalization,2,"The notion of globalization has yielded a rich literature, both scholarly and popular, that reveals the highly contested nature of the meaning of the term. This paper focuses on Wikipedia as one of the most popular reference sites worldwide, and compares, through computer-assisted text analysis and qualitative reading, entries for the word “globalization” in six major western languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Given Wikipedia’s model of open editing and open contribution, it would be logical to expect that definitions of globalization across different languages reflect variations related to diverse cultural contexts and collective writing. Results show, however, more similarities than differences across languages, demonstrated by an overall pattern of economic framing of the term, and an over-reliance on English language sources. Our findings support some scholars’ arguments about the inherent ambiguity of the idea of globalization, and highlight broader questions of linguistic, technological, and cultural hegemony.",Language and Social Interaction Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Issues of adaptation, accessibility, assessment, and accountability call for agile and creative leadership. This qualitative research project draws on a comprehensive review of academic leadership initiatives on the Association of American University (AAU) institution websites and 16 interviews with AAU deans and associate deans to offer their views on the state of higher education leadership development. This paper approaches the topic of academic leadership development through a communicative perspective whereby leadership itself, along with the formal methods of training and development in higher education, are accomplished through discourse. Issues of academic leadership and the role communication plays in leadership processes merits focused attention, particularly as college and university leaders address ongoing challenges in higher education both within and beyond the United States.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0194,2015,Poster,Age at Work: Explaining Variation in Frames and Stereotypes of Older Employees in Corporate and News Media,3,"Despite that the image problem of older workers is likely being reinforced by portrayals in mass and corporate media, former studies neglected the question how older employees are represented in these contexts. This study investigates frames and stereotypes in corporate and news media coverage about older workers’ employability. The data come from a content analysis of newspaper coverage and corporate media of 50 large-scale Dutch organizations, during the period 2006 – 2013, totaling 1328 items. Our results, based on multilevel modeling, reveal general support for our hypotheses: corporations attempt to avoid associations with problems related to older employees and highlight the opportunities the individual organization offers, while news media are more inclined to victimize older employees and report stereotypes. This study shows that the image problem of older workers holds in a communicative context and contributes to our understanding of the emergence of stereotypes in news and corporate media.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0195,2015,Poster,Clearing the Smoke: Understanding Communication Satisfaction in Fire Departments,1,"Fire departments face a variety of communication challenges due to their high-risk, high-consequence nature. Effective communication within and throughout such service organizations is important to understand because incorrect information could negatively influence performance. Further, miscommunication could cause serious errors. One way to understand whether communication is effective in high-risk environments is to examine whether members are satisfied with various communication patterns. Thus, this study examined the levels of communication satisfaction within an urban fire department. Findings from focus groups suggested that seven communication satisfaction dimensions (i.e., communication climate, communication with superiors, organizational integration, media quality, informal communication, organizational perspective, and communication with subordinates) were present. Personal feedback was not present. Findings further suggested a revised model for communication satisfaction to spark further research on the framework.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Fieldwork at a full-service advertising agency and 45 one-on-one interviews were conducted regarding perceptions of organizational leadership as well as ethics in advertising. Findings suggest that organizational values and ethics are part of a dynamic relationship, and that values serve as rules and resources, enabling and simultaneously constraining ethical awareness.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

These three components come together within communicative performances. This study used an ethnographic approach to explore three specific types of communicative performances as outlined by Trujillo (1985): explanatory, interpersonal, and political. Although addressed in a variety of settings, these performances can be effective strategies within an industry facing significant change: the media. This study assessed how a local news organization, a city magazine, invoked communicative performances in light of a shift in its approach to journalistic norms and market orientation after the loss of a key advertiser. Ultimately, the managers of the news organization used explanatory and political performances to explain the loss of the advertiser, describe how the organization would “survive” the loss, and justify its shift in market orientation to improve the company’s economic viability.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

At the same time there is a growing body of research finding that public institutions and organisations are undergoing processes of mediatisation, which potentially threaten their autonomy. Based on interviews with communication staff (11 informants in total) at six major Norwegian universities and research centres, this study explores the extent to which these institutions have adapted to and internalised media logic. This study finds that the public research institutions to a significant degree have adapted to their media environments in terms of both organisational structure and communication practise.

To show the role of communication in WHP, we collected survey data from 204 employees at a company with a wellness program. Results confirmed a communicative model of employees’ participation in WHP programs, which demonstrates the mediating role of organizational identification in the relationship between perceived organizational support and employees’ participation in WHP programs. In addition to filling a theoretical gap in the WHP literature, this study offers important recommendations for practitioners in this field, cautioning organizations that often outsource wellness programs.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

These tenets help to clarify the unique contributions of organizational communication to organizational studies at large. Using the example of diversity consultants, this essay also illustrates the practical use of a Techniques and Forces framework. Ultimately, this framework introduces a new metaphor for organizational analysis, the fractal.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0201,2015,Poster,The Institutional Bind: Challenging the Meanings of Volunteerism for Social Change,1,"In the United States, volunteerism is a major source of civic engagement and a tool for achieving social change. Despite its social significance, volunteer labor is often marked by difficulties and challenges. This study examines the challenging sides of volunteerism for social change in its analysis of the ways in which institutional forces pose difficulties to meaningful volunteerism. Drawing on institutional theory, this essay reports results from several types of data: semi-structured interviews with the volunteers of a U.S. food pantry, observations from the visit of a local food bank, and observations from a meeting of local food assistance organizations. Data analysis revealed that: (a) institutionalized mentalities challenge meaningful volunteerism through mainstream cultural discourses, (b) institutions contest volunteerism by creating complex dependencies for the volunteer organization, and (c) institutional endurance limits creative solutions to the problems of the volunteer organization. The results reveal that institutions contest volunteer meanings by complicating volunteer-related communication processes. Results have implications for communication approaches to addressing the institutional challenges of meaningful volunteerism.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2015-0202,2015,Poster,The Mediating Effect of Dyadic Communication Style Agreement on the Relationship Between Servant Leadership and Group-Level Organizational Citizenship Behavior,2,"This study proposes a model of dyadic communication agreement that mediates the relationships between servant leadership and group-level organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) in work groups. Our model draws upon and integrates research and theories from the servant leadership, conversational constraint, relational dyadic, and social network literatures. The model is tested by using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) with data obtained from a sample of 510 employees and 59 work groups in three Malaysian organizations. Results show that servant leadership is related to dyadic communication style agreement in the workplace at the individual level, and that the servant leadership-group-level OCB link is partially mediated by dyadic communication style agreement in the workplace. These findings partially validate our proposed model and, in particular, provide empirical support for the central roles of communication and cultural exchange processes in workgroups.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

When CCO theorizing has taken up the issue of time, the focus has tended to be oriented toward the past and articulating how the past is brought into the present. I advocate for a dual focus by including responsiveness to an anticipated future as an aspect of how organizations are communicatively constituted. The case of the state of Georgia leadership’s response to a late January 2014 winter storm is examined. In this situation, the leadership failed to take pre-emptive actions to prepare its citizens and roads for the predicted winter storm, resulting in traffic jams, stranded motorists, abandoned vehicles, and stranded school children.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The parliament has only 60 seats. In such an environment, it is easy to track the social media activities of all candidates and parties. Adding to that, Luxembourg shows the highest degree of internet penetration in the European Union, more than 93% of the population are online.
Recent studies suggest, that internet activities in general and social media activities in specific foster electoral success. It seems that especially twitter is an effective tool to mobilize voters to vote for specific candidates against the order of party list. Likewise it is a channel of communication, that enables the candidates to bypass the journalistic gatekeepers, especially in the given media landscape, characterized by a substantial degree of political parallelism.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology

This study extends the literature on the impact of digital media on political participation by examining if digital media can influence not whether individuals would participate in a protest or not, but whether people would take up the role of participation leaders. Using the annual rally in Hong Kong commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen movement in China as a case study, usage of Facebook, microblogging services, and online alternative media are found to contribute to online political communication activities, which in turn lead to participation leadership. Further analysis shows that the impact of online political communication activities on participation leadership exists only among the young rally participants.

Using the online communities of practice concept, we conducted qualitative analysis of how members of two online forums affiliated with the militia movement and the sovereign citizen movement discussed three government actions that explicitly or implicitly targeted these movements. We found evidence of group identity enhancement, violence justification, information sharing, and leadership—traditional indicators of online communities and/or extremist online communication. Additionally, we developed the concept of community sustainment, or efforts and means through which online communities maintain themselves. Most significantly, we found evidence to support perhaps the first theoretical framework for understanding how extremist online communities function when discussing government actions against movements, which may aid future online extremism research.",CAT Interactive Papers #1,Communication and Technology
2015-0211,2015,Poster,Abstract Message Construal: A Situated Cognition Approach,1,"Research on abstract mental representations relates the abstraction of concepts, actions, and objects to abstract evaluative dimension like morals, ideologies, and higher-order categories such as desirability and goal-orientation. From a situated cognition perspective the current research predicts that positive mood, individual propensity for abstract action identification, and collectivistic and long-term oriented cultures show more abstraction of a persuasive message that supports blood donation and consequently more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions to donate blood. In an experiment participants from the U.S. and Germany (N =152) were mood induced and read a short message in support of blood donation. The German subsample showed more message abstraction and abstract action identification levels. Cultural difference also related to attitude outcomes in the hypothesized manner. The cultural impact was mediated by the action identification level but not by how abstract participants construed the message.

The Bifurcation of Visual and Verbal Processing During Viewer Evaluation of Online Messages.,4,"There is some debate about how people process information online, particularly when it is associated with a virtual embodiment. This study utilized a 2 (advocate sex) X 2 (advocate image credibility) experimental design to examine the relative influence of the visual characteristics of the advocate associated with a persuasive message about illegal music downloading. The process model is tested with causal modeling techniques. The results are consistent with predictions showing that people process visual characteristics of images first and that this influences subsequently processed information such as associated text. Specifically, image characteristics influence attributions of anthropomorphism and sender credibility, which drive processing of subsequently processed information. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems
2015-0213,2015,Poster,Attentional Capacity and Flow Experiences: Examining the Attentional Component of Synchronization Theory,3,"Several decades of research has shed considerable light on the positive effects of flow experiences resulting from media exposure. However, little is known about the cognitive processes that result in flow. This may be due in part, by an over reliance on self-report measures of flow. In two experimental studies, we seek to overcome these issues by developing and validating the use of secondary task response times as an unobtrusive measure of flow. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our results show that response times are longest under the condition of flow compared to conditions of boredom and frustration. Consistent with the assumptions central to the synchronization theory of flow, this finding indicates that flow experiences during media exposure are indeed characterized by a process of highly focused attention. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the implications for the future development and application of media research on flow.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems

2015-0216,2015,Poster,Formally Modeling Attention Allocation in a Dynamic Media Environment,2,"Typical media multitasking takes place in dynamic and complex environments. These environments present communication researchers with a host of difficulties when attempting to understand how attention is allocated between different environmental tasks in the pursuit of multiple goals. In order to understand these complex task environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop formal (i.e., mathematical) models to account for the dynamic relationships between self-driven goals (endogenous motivations) and motivation activation attributable to the task environment (exogenous motivations). In order to begin developing these formal models for communication, the proposed paper will apply a variation of the channel changing model (ChaCha; Wang, 2014; Wang, Busemeyer, & Lang, 2006), to begin understanding how attention is dynamically allocated during media multitasking.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems

This content has potentially damaging implications for both society’s treatment of women and branding’s attempts to reach its consumer in a meaningful way. This study examines the differences in processing of advertisements with varying levels of sexually objectifying content between men and women. The study employs a 2 (Gender of participant: female vs. male) X 3 (Level of sexual objectification: high, medium, low) X 4 (Commercial, repeated measures) x 3 (Order) mixed repeated-measures design to uncover psychophysiological and self-reported differences in the viewing experience.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems
2015-0218,2015,Poster,Reducing Resistance to a Loss-Framed Narrative Message About Binge Drinking,2,"The present study explores how activation of the self-concept and drinking habits (heavy-drinkers vs. light-drinkers) influence resistance to anti-binge drinking narrative PSAs. Four forms of resistance in narratives processing are conceptualized: counterarguing, challenging the realism of the story, psychological reactance, and negative emotions to message quality and content. The results indicate that in general, heavy drinkers are associated with more counterarguing compared to light drinkers. However, activating the self can decrease psychological reactance and negative emotions among both heavy and light drinkers. Self-activation also leads people to perceive the story as more realistic, but only among heavy drinkers. Mediation analysis reveals that the impacts of self-activation and habitual drinking behavior on one’s risk perception of binge drinking are fully mediated by psychological reactance and counterarguing. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Attention, Cognition, and Embodiment",Information Systems

A 2 [crowdsourcing] × 2 [professional source] × 2 [Message topic] between-subjects online experiment (N = 189) found two indirect paths for the crowdsourcing effects. The crowd-as-source path suggests that crowdsourcing negatively affects content credibility and behavioral intentions through decreased perceived source trustworthiness and information completeness. In contrast, the self-as-source path indicates that crowdsourcing may have positive effects on perceived source trustworthiness via heightened perceived interactivity and sense of control. Finally, although the additional professional source on crowdsourcing sites raises perceived gatekeeping on the site, it does not have substantial influence on credibility judgments.

To examine the extent to which web interactivity can affect persuasion in prior research, we conducted a meta-analysis of 30 studies (N=5335) that met our selection criteria. The results reveal that high web interactivity is consistently more effective in eliciting users’ positive attitudes and intentions compared to low level of interactivity; with this said, users don’t necessarily form positive attitudes when there is too much interactivity. Despite the promise on persuading attitudes and intentions, no significant persuasion effect of web interactivity has been found on cognitive responses and memory. In addition, perceived interactivity shows a significantly larger persuasion effect as opposed to objective interactivity.

Exemplification and Interactivity Effects on Shaping Perceptions and Attitude of Social Issues,2,"With the rising popularity of “big data”, journalists are trying to integrate data-rich information into news content and to make them accessible to everyday news readers by accompanying them with exemplifying cases. But, these exemplars do not always fully capture the complexity of the data patterns, yet they end up playing an important role in shaping user perceptions of the issue. This study examines the effectiveness of interactivity in counteracting the strong exemplification effect through enhancing perceived vividness of, and user engagement with, data-rich information. A 2 (baserate-exemplar consistency) × 3 (presentational format) × 2 (issue topic) mixed-design experiment revealed that, compared to textual description and static visualization, interactive visualization is effective in motivating systematic processing of the baserate information, which positively influences accuracy of issue perception as well as personal attitude.

2015-0227,2015,Poster,"""I've Walked This Street"": Readings of ""Reality"" in Children's Reception of Fantasy",1,"This paper examines children’s perceptions of identifiable, ‘real’ elements in their reception of the Harry Potter series, focusing on how fantasy finds meaning in the lives of children because they connect with reality in reading fantasy. Notwithstanding the abundance of magical hexes, witches, and wand-waving that characterise the series, children’s talk is found to veer towards emotional matters, relationships and real-life elements. The paper argues that this propensity to extract touches of reality out of the world of fantasy, is not visible in aspirations towards an unreachable, ‘magic’ world hidden somewhere which children believe really exists, but rather by drawing out of the world of fantasy, elements of everyday life, complete with its characters, bonds, rapports, attachments and socio-cultural references. Analysing data from fieldwork with teen audiences of the Harry Potter series, this paper explores ways in which children find a sense of location, rooting and grounding in reading fantasy.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

We analyze whether main antagonists engage in both prosocial and aggressive behaviors (including physical, indirect, and verbal aggression). Moreover, we explore demographics of main antagonists and context of each aggressive and prosocial act initiated by a main antagonist. Results from a content analysis showed that main antagonists in Studio Ghibli tend to participate in both prosocial and aggressive behaviors, while those in Walt Disney tend to commit only aggressive behaviors to harm others. This study concludes that the difference in the portrayal of main antagonists between Walt Disney and Studio Ghibli animated films may reflect the difference between analytic and holistic thinking style.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0229,2015,Poster,Children as Players on an Adult Stage: Representation of Boys and Girls on Israeli Prime Time Reality Television Programmes,2,"Modern society views childhood as a unique phase in a person’s life, with children being recognized as a separate population having particular needs). Nevertheless, the dividing line between childhood and adulthood has become blurred since the mid-20th Century, in what Neil Postmancalled “the disappearance of childhood,” in part because of the emergence of a type of television which creates an artificial identity between children and adult worlds.
We chose two programmes as test cases: Junior Master Chef and Music School which were broadcast on Israel’s second commercial channel during 2011 and 2012. We conducted a structural-qualitative analysis following Gabaton (2001), deriving major theme-based categories reflecting the girls’ and boys’ world as opposed to that of adults. The study gave us new insights about the role of children on the small screen, as well as reflecting the changes in relations between children and adults in the Israeli family and society as a whole.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In this study, 70 3-5 year-olds watched an episode of Sesame Street about Hispanic culture (i.e., fiestas). Their reality judgments and comprehension of both factual and fantastical content were assessed after viewing. One week later, children helped plan a fiesta (assessing their transfer of learning), and were re-assessed on their reality judgments and content memory of the show. Results revealed a moderated indirect effect of age on transfer: older children remembered the content better than younger children, but were only more likely to transfer it if they gave it high reality ratings. Additionally, children’s fantasy orientation was negatively related to transfer. Generally, children gave low reality ratings to fantasy content and tended not to transfer it. Results are interpreted within Fisch’s capacity model.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Two hundred forty children and one of their parents/guardians completed extensive one-on-one interviews before and after an intervention. Participants recalled the produced materials (including Raya, a newly-introduced Muppet® who stresses latrine use, hand-washing, and sandal-wearing); however, intervention variations (one focused on personal objectives, the other on social objectives) were not detected. Results show that those exposed to either intervention, compared to those not exposed to the Sisimpur material, significantly improved across sanitation and hygiene variables. This intervention was successful, suggesting that media can impact children’s healthy development, even in a locale lacking access to even basic resources.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

As part of a larger qualitative study on parental management of communication technology use among US children with significant communication impairments, this paper examines how parents of non-speaking and minimally-speaking children ages 3-13 (N = 20) interpret their child’s engagement with new media and popular culture as an expression of the very skills in which the dominant culture often presumes them to be deficient—specifically socioemotional, cognitive, and verbal aptitude. As a result, I discuss the need for public perceptions of both disability and children’s popular culture to shift away from having to do with deficit and deficiencies (i.e. disability as an individual lack of ability, kids’ media culture as lacking educational value) and instead towards more asset-oriented models.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

2015-0243,2015,Poster,Mapping “Fields of Health Action” in Two Disadvantaged Urban Communities: Implications for Health Communication Interventions,2,"EXTENDED ABSTRACT
(575 words)

Based on analyses of multiple sources of data gathered as part of two larger, multi-year and multi-method research projects to address health disparities in two U.S. cities—a small urban community in the Northeast of the country and a larger urban center in the Southeast—this paper advances understanding of particular challenges that health interventions face in urban environments with different configurations. Both projects are guided by a socio-ecological approach to health communication and public health and, more specifically, by communication infrastructure theory (e.g., Ball-Rokeach, Kim, & Matei, 2001; Wilkin, 2013). Additionally, both projects are also guided by principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR).

Findings suggest that factors in residents’ material environment and their social construction of that environment (through everyday communication among residents, and between residents and local organizational actors) interact to produce a “field of health action” (Matsaganis & Golden, in press) within which healthcare- and health information-seeking behavior is enabled and constrained.

Methods

Both studies focused on how the social and built environments contribute to underutilization of healthcare services by residents. For this paper, we report on findings from a thematic analysis of qualitative data collected as part of each of the research projects (interviews, focus groups, community forum discussions, as well as ethnographic field observations).

In the community located in the large Southeastern city, 52 community members (14 male and 38 female; 12 were 18-35 years old; 30 were aged 36-64; 10 were 65 and older) participated in 2-2.5 hour community forum discussions. Additionally, 32 semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare workers at 1) a public hospital, 2) community clinics associated with the hospital, and 3) a federally qualified health center located within the community. Questions were designed to determine factors contributing to primary healthcare access disparities.

In the case of the smaller urban community in the Northeastern U.S., we draw on 105 semi-structured interviews conducted with 89 unique female attendees at 18 community health education events. Participants reported a median age of 49; 65% identified as African American (or as African American and some other ethno-racial group); 28% identified as White; 6% as Latino/a or Hispanic, and 1% as South Asian. We also draw on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with staff members of local CBOs (N = 20, representing nine CBOs).
Researchers from the two projects identified the “field of health action” characteristics that emerged from their respective projects. We compared and contrasted our general findings and accounted for differences in the focus of the two projects that could influence a more fine-grained analysis of the available data across both sites, interpretation, and conclusions. Subsequently, researchers from both projects engaged in a more systematic analysis of the data.

Findings & Conclusion

Four factors related to the “field of health action” of residents in both cities emerged as salient from our analysis: (1) actual availability of and perceptions of access to health resources, (2) transportation options, (3) communication resources (including interpersonal, media, and organizational) that aid health information and healthcare seeking, and (4) privacy concerns around healthcare-seeking. In discussing these factors, we highlight differences across the two urban communities studied.

Overall, our findings show how a city’s built and social environment, as well as policies that shape everyday life at the local level impact residents’ health. We also offer recommendations as to how to improve the design of public health strategies, health communication campaigns, and policy interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities in residential community contexts.

One-hundred and three participants recruited from local medical clinics completed a survey that measured LMOPPC and WTC variables, satisfaction with the consultation and demographic information. Bivariate correlations revealed that patients who perceived their doctors to be more caring and compassionate were more willing to communicate during the consultation. Patient participation was positively associated with satisfaction with care. However, satisfaction with care was not associated with treatment adherence. Only perception of care and compassion and knowledge of health concern uniquely explained significant amounts of variance in patient participation (47% and 2% respectively).

Many studies have found a greater persuasive effect of narrative messages on attitudes and intentions toward the message argument compared to non-narrative messages. However, the detailed mechanism has not yet been clearly established. We propose a pathway of narrative persuasion based on the discussion of transportation theory and the extended elaboration likelihood model (E-ELM). Although there are mixed findings of the causal relationship of narrative mechanism, these theories give an insight about the relationship. We expect that identification might be a predictor of transportation, and counterargument might be come after transportation experience. Finally, these cognitive causal mechanisms lead to changes in attitude and behavior (identification > transportation > counterargument > attitude > intention). This study expects that the greater identification with story characters in narrative increase transportation experience that reduces counterargument against the message and promotes favorable attitude toward message argument, which is skin cancer detection behavior in this study.

Findings show that specific dimensions of personal networks – density and gender homophily – and social capital – offline bonding capital – explained perceived social support. Further, perceived social support consistently predicted higher well-being outcomes and played a mediating role between personal network density and subject well-being as well as between offline bonding capital and well-being.

2015-0255,2015,Poster,Test of the Activation of Approach and Avoidance Motivations in Response to Health Messages,2,"Most extant work on health message processing assumes that people are motivated to either move toward a message-recommended behavior or away from it. Health message design has similarly focused on either increasing approach motivation or reducing avoidance motivation. This one-sided focus is based on the bipolar structuralization of motivational valence systems, in which an increase in positivity is equivalent to the decrease in negativity and thus the two cannot co-occur. The present research challenges this prevalent proposition by testing an alternative perspective—the bivariate model—in which these opposite motivations are hypothesized to be separable, and thus able to occur in both reciprocal and non-reciprocal ways. Findings from different analytical methods employed in this study (N=311, Mage=20.29; 67.5% female; 66.2% Caucasian, Stimuli=40 televised antidrug ads) demonstrate the presence of non-reciprocal activation patterns and provide empirical evidence of the merit of utilizing the bivariate framework in health communication research and practice.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A randomized experiment yielded results showing that depersonalized depictions are superior in promoting targeted policies relative to personalized depictions and a no message control group. Among the three dimensions of personalization, revealing the character’s inner states was most detrimental to audience’s narrative engagement, reducing levels of transportation, identification and empathy. Empathy fully mediated the impact of inner states description on policy support.

Three conceptual issues bear additional scrutiny in order to uncover when social norms impact action and the moderators of this relationship. First, the influence of financial incentives in normative systems remains a relatively unarticulated but potentially important point of theoretical development because there is reason to believe financial incentives might crowd out other sources of motivation. Second, a distinction has been made between perceived and collective social norms but the unique effect of each type of norm has not been well articulated nor tested empirically. Third, previous research has highlighted the important role of group identification in normative systems, but the empirical findings remain mixed. This paper addresses these issues; in particular, this study presents a theoretical model to address these issues and reports the results of a public goods experiment to test the effects of short-term monetary incentives on normative systems and behavior.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

We also tested a moderated mediation model with the source credibility dimensions as possible mediators and need for affect as a moderator for the effects of review emotionality. An online experiment conducted with U.S. adults (N = 327) with stimuli featured as reviews from Amazon.com revealed that high-emotionality reviews, when compared with low-emotionality reviews, were perceived lower in source credibility, in both perceived competence and trustworthiness, and also in content credibility perceptions. We also found that the effects of emotionality on content credibility were significantly mediated by trustworthiness of the source and this mediation was moderated by review readers’ need for affect, with the credibility-hampering effects of emotionality found only among participants with low levels of need for affect.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The present study explores two mechanisms that may explain the effectiveness of the LPF technique: self-presentation and regulatory focus. The results of three studies indicated that: (a) in a lab experiment the previously tested mediating mechanism of self-presentation concerns did not affect compliance rates or donation amounts, (b) in an self-report study, regulatory fit as a mediating mechanism accounted for variance in compliance rates in an unexpected way, and (c) evidence from the field experiment suggests that regulatory focus theory may explain LPF effectiveness.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Structural equation modeling revealed that enjoyment was directly positively related to objective and subjective knowledge. However, neither objective nor subjective knowledge were strong predictors for behavioral intentions. Appreciation, in contrast, was directly negatively related to knowledge acquisition and only weakly positively related to subjective knowledge, but was the best predictor for behavioral intentions.

2015-0263,2015,Poster,Neural Correlates of Self-Affirmation,7,"Self-affirmation theory posits that people are motivated to maintain their sense of self-integrity and that threats to self-integrity are met with defensiveness. A class of interventions called self-affirmations can restore self-integrity when threatened by allowing individuals to reflect on sources of self-worth, such as core values. Many questions exist, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-affirmation. We hypothesized that if affirmation exerts its effects through refocusing the individual on positive resources that offset the importance of threats, affirmation should be associated with increased activity within key regions of the brain’s valuation system, including the ventral striatum (VS) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Results of a region of interest analysis demonstrated that participants who were affirmed (relative to those who were unaffirmed) showed increased activity in VS and VMPFC when considering core values (compared to everyday activities), and that this effect was particularly strong for future orientated affirmations.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Our results show that review content specificity and engagement significantly affect how consumers rate online reviews. Moreover, reviewer activeness and reputation influenced consumers’ evaluations of reviews even after controlling for the effects of the review content characteristics. The findings indicate that both central and peripheral routes of message processing might be in play when consumers evaluate online reviews. Social review systems facilitate individuals’ information acquisition and decision-making through digital word-of-mouth communications. This research contributes to research on social review systems by advancing theoretical and methodological approaches to user perception and behavior on online review sites.

Thus, we observe a discrepancy between privacy attitudes and actual online behavior. We expand existing research on the privacy paradox in two ways: First, we are concentrating on adolescents’ privacy attitudes towards smartphone apps. With smartphone apps becoming more and more popular among adolescent, we see issues of potential privacy infringement as a crucial new area of research. Second, we see users’ habit strength for downloading apps as a moderating factor for the relationship between privacy attitudes and actual behavior.

Results of the study found students who participated in the course developed a deeper understanding of themselves as storytellers. Participation in the course strengthened both students’ technological skills and skills of importance in traditional journalism – the ability to write, interview, and listen well, to construct a news story, and to adapt to varied situations.

When controversies arise, groups attempt to resolve their disagreement through argumentative interaction utilizing evidence or non-evidence. We investigated group members’ communicative contribution, or an individual’s total turn-at-talk within the discussion of each quiz question over the course of fourteen quizzes (N = 56 discussions). Results demonstrated that during discussions: (1) highest ability members utilized more evidence than middle or lowest ability members, (2) lowest ability members generated more non-evidence than evidence, and (3) middle ability members appeared to be less active in articulating evidence, specifically more speaker-based evidence. These findings provide evidence that instructors should focus on teaching students how to: communicate evidence, identify facilitative versus inhibitive arguments, and respectfully acknowledge and evaluate their peers’ contributions for effective group learning.",Instructional and Developmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A second experiment using video recorded narratives of the same international TAs found that a perspective taking intervention was able to eliminate the impact of the international TAs’ ethnicity on undergraduate students’ (N=125) evaluation of the TAs. Also, male students who engaged in imagine-target type of perspective taking had the most favorable attitudes towards the TAs, and were most willing to be supportive of all international TAs as compared to male students who engaged in imagine-self perspective taking or those in the control group.

We test whether self-distancing, i.e. adapting to a distanced position towards the self, and perspective-taking, i.e. thinking from another person’s point-of-view, decrease this bias. We apply this notion to the formation of TPPs and FPPs. In Study 1 (n = 790), we measure self-distancing and perspective-taking tendencies and find no support for a relationship with TPPs or FPPs. However, in Study 2 (n = 693) we manipulate both changes in perspective. We find no effects for a desirable media message, and, thus, on FPPs. For an undesirable stimulus, both self-distancing and perspective-taking boost perceived media influence on self.

The findings were discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for research on media credibility as well as media and religion.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0295,2015,Poster,ICTs in the Third Age of Life Between Past and Future,3,"The paper will present some research data about uses of the ICTs by the young elderly.
The research project presented is based on an in-depth theoretical study about ageing; asurvey with a representative sample of the Italian “young elderlies” (65-74 years) about ICTs equipment and usage (N=900); a field-work which consists of 20 family interviews in Milan area.
Results show that (1) ICTs and Internet have a significant impact on elderly everyday life and spatio-temporal domestic routines; (2) ICTs and Internet seems to be a good opportunity for a better and active ageing, but even a risk in terms of social isolation inside and outside family.
The relation between the current young elders and the ICTs presents an interesting contradiction: on the one hand, the relation is unique and peculiar; on the other hand it offers a number of interesting clues about the generational mechanisms of domestication to the ICTs.",Lifespan Communication Theme Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

We argue that the underlying structure of communication technologies contain cultural (and capitalist) biases based on their ownership and production. As such, the communicative practices that ICTs reinforce—in addition to the audiovisual contents they circulate—are an important research area within indigenous contexts. We develop an analysis of the position of ICTs within the cultural trajectory of 12 Guarani communities in southeast Bolivia, paying particular attention to generational roles and expectations.",Lifespan Communication Theme Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0299,2015,Poster,Is Framing Coming of Age? The Use of Counterframes as an Impetus to a More Rigorous Conceptualization,1,"On the basis of a frame analysis on ‘ageing’ this paper attempts a further, more specific conceptualization of framing. Figurativeness is proposed as a special characteristic of frames, with each frame offering a different perspective on a many-sided reality. In addition, the difference between framing and counter-framing is worked out conceptually. Framing provides a problematizing definition, while counter-framing deproblematizes an issue. It is discussed why problematization may not always be the preferale approach. Based on an inductive frame analysis of newspaper content about elderly people, eleven frames and counterframes are reconstructed and evaluated. It is argued why counter-frames could occupy a more prominent place both in framing research and in the communication about ageing.",Lifespan Communication Theme Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0300,2015,Poster,Dispositional and Situational Emotion Regulation in Younger and Older Adults during a Stressful Film Scene,2,"The current study examined age differences in dispositional emotion regulation strategies and perceptions of situational emotion regulation during a stressful film scene. Younger and older adults (N = 207) viewed a film scene that elicits strong negative emotions and then indicated how they had regulated their emotions. Prior to stimulus presentation, dispositional emotion regulation was measured. Older adults showed higher levels of dispositional suppression and also higher levels of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in the situation compared to younger adults. Furthermore, individual differences in dispositional cognitive reappraisal and dispositional expressive suppression were predictive for reappraisal and suppression in the given situation. However, dispositional suppression was more strongly related to situational suppression among older adults than among younger adults. Future directions concerning the meaning of and possible implications for age differences in coping with media content are discussed.",Emotion,Information Systems
2015-0301,2015,Poster,Emotions on Facebook: What Narcissism and Empathy Tell Us About Online Sharing Behaviors,5,"The aim of the current study is to examine how narcissism and empathy among adolescents may relate to the type of emotional content (positive versus negative) someone is willing to share on Facebook. In order to explore this hypothesis, we examined 101 teen male participants across two studies in which we had them complete the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Narcissitic Personality Inventory, and measures of emotional sharing while using Facebook. Results demonstrate that sharing positive emotional information on Facebook is significantly correlated with empathic concern (r=.27, p=.013) and personal distress (r=.24, p=.029). In addition, sharing negative emotional information on Facebook is significantly associated with narcissistic exhibitionism (r=.28, p=.008) and marginally associated with personal distress (r=.20, p=.060). Overall, these findings provide insight into how different personality characteristics among adolescents relate to their emotional sharing behavior online in a social media context and may have implications for participants’ personal wellbeing and social connections.",Emotion,Information Systems

2015-0304,2015,Poster,Self-Conscious Emotional Advertising: Beyond Fear Appeals,2,"Public service advertisements using negative emotions have mainly focused on inducing basic emotions such as fear. However, several other negative emotions can be used as well, such as anger (another basic emotion) and guilt and shame (self-conscious emotions). A systematic comparison investigating all these negative emotional ads is missing. This is surprising because it can be fruitful to study negative emotions in ads that are more self-involving than fear. Self-conscious emotions might be more involving because they motivate self-evaluations and thus might make more persuasive ads than fear ads. An experiment on condom use among adolescents confirmed that self-conscious emotional ads (inducing shame or guilt) were more persuasive than basic emotional ads (inducing fear or anger). This effect was especially pronounced for shame ads. It is concluded that when behaviour occurs in a social context, it can be effective to go beyond fear and use self-conscious emotional ads to persuade.",Emotion,Information Systems

This paper examines literature across marketing, online news sharing and online public opinion sharing in order to explore the nature of sharing behavior in this digital online world. By looking into the literature of computer science, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on sharing intentions of positive versus negative content and collective emotional outcome on social media. While exploring the main effect between positive and negative emotions, mediator variables such as arousal and moderate variable of content types such as news versus non-news content were included in the analysis. Most importantly, this paper suggests that because each emotion might come from different motivational systems, therefore, it is critical to look at each specific emotion against employing a holistic approach when studying the emotional influence on sharing intention.",Emotion,Information Systems
2015-0306,2015,Poster,Surplus or Deficit? The Role of Memory Consolidation Processes in the Emotion Spillover Effect,1,"This study proposes and tests the idea that the processing of advertisements following emotionally arousing stimuli is a function of the interaction between motivational system activation and consolidation of the preceding message content in memory. The two competing hypotheses are posed: the motivational decay hypothesis and the consolidation interference hypothesis. Physiological, behavioral, and self-reported data was used to test the predictions. The results demonstrated higher levels of physiological arousal and higher levels of physiological and self-reported positivity and negativity when processing advertisements preceded by arousing positive and negative movie clips. The heart rate data showed that the appetitive motivational system facilitated higher cognitive effort (slower heart rate) and the aversive motivational system facilitated lower cognitive effort (faster heart rate). The state of cognitive overload was reached during the first 10 seconds of the ads following negative arousing clips while during ads following positive arousing clips the cognitive system was functioning at the maximum of its capacity. The results were more supportive of the consolidation interference hypothesis.",Emotion,Information Systems

2015-0309,2015,Poster,Explaining SERP Evaluations: The Influence of Brand Equity on the Quality Perception of Search Engine Results,3,"Even though a large number of search engines exists, most users worldwide rely on one provider: Google. From a technological perspective, Google’s dominance cannot be explained because the performance of the major search engines hardly differs. A possible explanation is the different branding of search engines. To test its influence, we investigated how the brand equity and result page evaluations are related. In an experimental online survey (N=400), college students evaluated one of four (manipulated) result pages. We confirmed our assumption that Google's brand equity is much higher than Bing's. However, the result pages were evaluated very similar. This suggest a differentiation between (a) global satisfaction with search engines and (b) satisfaction with search engine performance. Only for Google, we found that “trust” is related to the quality perception of its result page - a possible explanation for its global success.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0310,2015,Poster,“Tumblr is so Depressing”: Adolescents’ On- and Offline Sharing of Emotions,2,"Adolescents experience intense emotional experiences and fluctuations in their emotional state (Gilbert, 2012). Because of this emotional instability, they need to regulate their emotions (Olthof, 2005), for example by sharing their emotions with others. We already know that adolescents share emotions both off- and online. In addition, research (Choi & Toma, 2014) suggests that social sharing face-to-face might be better for one’s wellbeing, than for example on SNS. However, research on the process of adolescent social sharing via various interpersonal communication channels is still scarce. Therefore, this study tries to provide a deeper understanding of adolescents’ motivations to share specific emotions (both positive and negative ones), to certain persons (e.g. parents, other family members, friends, acquaintances, strangers, …) and via certain communication channels (e.g. talking face-to-face, calling, texting, posting on SNS, on a photo-sharing site, …) by conducting in-depth interviews with adolescents between 14 and 18 year old.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0311,2015,Poster,Broadcast Your Product: An Online Experiment on the Persuasive Effects of Product Reviews on YouTube,1,"This study deals with the persuasive effect of product reviews uploaded on YouTube. Until now little is known about product reviews in the form of a video on YouTube, which has been uploaded by a common user. To explore this web 2.0 phenomenon, a 2x2x2 online experiment has been conducted. The structure of argumentation (one-sided vs. two-sided), expertise (low vs. high) and the number of views (low vs. high) has been manipulated. To capture the persuasive effects, attitude towards the product, purchase intention, credibility, evaluation of the video and its perceived usefulness has been measured.
Results show that user concentrate on the arguments of a product review to evaluate the product and come to a decision. Product reviews without a contra argument results in a more positive attitude. Further on, experts are perceived as more credible than a layperson. To evaluate credibility, heuristic factors such as expertise and number of views are taken into account. The current study states new findings about product reviews on YouTube.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology

For the analysis, we use a combination of clickstream and trait data provided by a popular sports nutrition firm in Japan. We find that while opinion leaders do not view product related content, those with high brand commitment view more promotional related content. Conversely, opinion seekers do not view promotional related content, those with high brand commitment view more product related content. The study develops a comprehensive framework to understand the information search behavior of these two segments and provides managers with a better understanding of how different segments consume different content.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology

News readers’ prior knowledge and issue involvement, which affect their ability and motivation to process information respectively, were considered as potential moderators. In a 3 (text vs. graphic vs. text + graphic) x 2 (hyperlinks vs. no hyperlinks) between-subjects experiment (N = 360), participants read a news article concerning economic issues. Adding graphics to the news heightened the extent to which they engaged in message-relevant thinking (i.e., news elaboration), albeit only among those with higher issue involvement. However, in-text hyperlinks hindered information recall among those with less prior knowledge, creating an information acquisition gap between more and less resourceful individuals. The graphical representation of news appeared to have heuristic appeals to those less involved in and less knowledgeable about the news topic, leading to more favorable news evaluations.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology
2015-0315,2015,Poster,"Information and Communication Technologies, Overload, and Stress: The Contributors to and Impact of Information and Communication Overload",1,"Due to the proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs), overload with information and communication becomes a predominant phenomenon. Yet, very limited research has taken both the aspects of information and communication into consideration when studying overload. In addition, few studies have focused on the implications of various ICTs for information and communication overload especially outside a work-related context. This paper aims to fill these gaps by exploring and examining how use of various ICTs is associated with information and communication overload and how overload in turn affects stress outside the workplaces. Two types of overload—perceived information and communication overload and ICT use overload are conceptualized. A survey of college students at a Southwestern university reveals that the number of friends on social networking sites is the only factor that contributes to both types of overload. Only perceived information and communication overload is positively related to stress.",CAT Interactive Papers #3,Communication and Technology

Using computational linguistic software we collect a census of shutdown-related keyword geo-coded tweets from the 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia for the period surrounding the 2013 shutdown. We then conduct four side-by-side analyses in order to determine factors related to state-level volume of tweets with themes blaming politicians in general, Democrats or Republicans. While blame aimed at each group is strongly, significantly, and positively correlated to state population and congressional representation by party, we find interesting evidence of clear partisan divides when using OLS regression to predict the volume of blame or responsibility directed toward Democrats and Republicans at the aggregate state level.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0318,2015,Poster,Who am I?: The Performance and Governance of Self in Digital Communities,1,"This research seeks to reveal the effects of disembodiment through the performance of self in digital social communities. Its primary goal is to uncover the essence of the Digital Self as a modified real-world, embodied Self that is otherwise exposed to risk. It focuses particularly in arenas that facilitate the form and shape of a Digital Self through expressive digital elements, including avatars, emoticons, photo filters, and interactive social feedback buttons such as liking, upvoting, sharing or commenting.
The core hypotheses of this research is that the Digital Self, in its distancing and preservative venue, causes a reconfiguration of stake for the being, and in this reconfiguration there is a fundamental change in the necessity and meaning of truth as it relates to self-governance in digital communities.
The paper first establishes key concepts on disembodiment and the human experience on the internet from Heidegger, Dreyfus, Dourish, Winograd, and Flores. It then constructs a model for Self through application of Foucault’s work on parrhesia, rebuilt for the digital age.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology
2015-0319,2015,Poster,"The Faster the Response, the Stronger the Bond? Dimensions of Relational Closeness and Texting Response Time",3,"One effect of asynchronous text messaging is that it affords the ability to delay responses. Previous research has showed that individuals tend to respond most quickly when texting with strong bonding ties. Nevertheless, given that relational closeness consists of several dimensions, it is possible that not all of these dimensions are equally associated with rapid texting response time. This paper investigates whether texting response time varies with several dimensions of relational closeness, and examines the utility of data sonification – transforming data into sound – as a tool for exploring time stamped data. We suspect that sonification is well suited to exploring time stamped interactional data, such as the mobile text messages that we use for our analysis. After using sonification to identify reoccurring patterns in our data, we further examine the statistical significance of these patterns using statistical methods to confirm their generalizability to the larger sample.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology

However, this study had its own limitation: due to lack of content at the time of study, the authors used converted 3D video (real-time conversion of 2D video to ‘simulated’ 3D video) instead of native 3D video.
This study explored the viewers’ information processing of native 3D video and compared it with that of 2D. Physiological responses such as heart rate (index of attention) and skin conductance (index of physiological arousal) were measured on top of self-reported measures. Also explored was individual’s purchase intent of the video, operationalized as amount of money individuals were willing to pay to purchase it. While price offered was generally higher for 3D content, individuals who viewed the content in 3D tend to offer much higher price for 3D content compared to those who viewed identical content in 2D.",CAT Interactive Papers #4,Communication and Technology

In the current study, the authors tested the effect of following a Facebook brand page on brand attitudes (e.g., purchase intention, brand equity) by randomly assigning respondents to a condition in which they either did or did not follow the brand on Facebook. After one month, compared to both current followers of the brand page and non-followers, the new followers developed more positive brand attitudes.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of ad-schema congruence (ad-context congruence and ad-profile congruence) on attitude in the new context of pre-roll advertisements. A total of 80 participants took part in a laboratory experiment where three pre-roll ads were paired with short videos. The results (n = 80) show significant main effects of ad-context congruence on perceived irritation and attitude towards the ad. The results also show significant main effects of ad-profile congruence on perceived manipulative intent and attitude towards the brand. In addition, the results of mediation analyses show that perceived irritation and perceived manipulative intent are significant mediators for the effect of ad-context and ad-profile congruence on attitude respectively.

In this process, the study particularly focused on three important factors (extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, brand attitude, and Twitter usage) as important antecedents. Relationship with branded Twitter account was introduced as a mediating variable to find out how the factors actually can affect the behavioral intentions of Twitter users by proposing a model. The analysis of structural equation model showed that only extrinsic motivation and brand attitude were positively associated with relation to the branded Twitter account and this relation, in turn, was also positively associated with both retweet intention and purchase intention, mentioning a significant association between retweet and purchase intention as well.

We propose a model showing that the perceived vividness and interactivity of online product presentations can generate perceptions of local presence, which refers to the sense of a product being present with a consumer in his or her own environment. Local presence, in turn, is expected to influence the urge to buy impulsively by generating both cognitive (perceived risk) and affective (product affect) responses to products. To test this model, data from a laboratory experiment (N = 212) was analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach (SEM). The results confirm our all but one of our hypotheses.

Four versions of scenes taken from the political drama House of Cards were created: one featuring the anti-hero bodily and verbally addressing the audience, one featuring only the voice of the anti-hero (without bodily address), one providing information regarding the anti-hero’s thoughts, and a control. The results showed that bodily/verbal direct address was associated with heightened feelings of complicity with the anti-hero – feeling like one was conspiring in his evil deeds. In turn, complicity was associated with perceptions of the character as more moral and with greater liking of the character. These results are interpreted as suggesting an additional media-related variable (direct address) and resultant perception (complicity) that may play consequential roles in viewers’ attachment with anti-heroes.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems

This study attempts to validate ii using psychophysiological measures to index cognitive resource allocation as well as recognition memory. Thirty television advertisements selected from a pool of 172 (all twenty seconds in length) based on their ii/cc ratio (where cc, or camera change, is conceptualized as structural feature that leads to automatic allocation of resource) and ratings for their arousing content.
Heart rate change over time showed significant deceleration (indicative of increased cognitive resource allocation) for messages with greater ii scores. Further, recognition memory worsened as ii increased. These findings support that conceptualizing message complexity as the amount of information introduced per camera change produces cognitive processing patterns that would be predicted by a limited capacity view of human information processing.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems

To explain how identification is formed and influences persuasive effects of a narrative, this study examines audience members’ wishful thinking (their desire to be like a story character) and perceived similarity with a story character. In an experiment, after risk perception was manipulated, participants listened to a story in which story characters did or did not get in a car accident. The results showed that in both risk perception conditions, participants were more likely to identify with story characters who did not get into a car accident, indicating that wishful thinking leads to identification. In addition, wishful thinking mediated the effect of the story on participants’ behavioral intention to engage in safe driving; but identification and perceived similarity did not mediate the effect.",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems

Previous research testing the landscape model has primarily relied on reading and factual stories. This study builds on previous research by applying the landscape model to two clips from current entertainment television dramas. The landscape model explained 83% or more of variance in participant recall. The more recent dual-code version of the landscape model, which assumes separate verbal and visual representations of the story, explained 91% or more of variance in participant recall. This study also continues to explore the potential integration of the landscape model and the event-indexing model by analyzing the event-indexing model as a moderator of the relationship between the dual-code landscape model and participant recall.

Process measures (thought listing, Pinocchio circling) were obtained, but are not analyzed to date. The extant analyses showed that working memory capacity was unrelated to attitude change (post-exposure attitudes with pre-exposure attitudes controlled). Stories with strong arguments were more persuasive than stories with weak arguments. This main effect was qualified by a three-way interaction: Our results revealed that transportation increases the influence of argument quality, but only if the text’s structure is typically story-like (high narrativity).",Narrative and Media Entertainment,Information Systems

2015-0334,2015,Poster,Viewers Enjoy Being Overwhelmed by TV: Exploring the Relationship Between Cognitive Overload and Enjoyment During Television Viewing,6,"This paper reports the data from an ongoing study that applies Information Introduced (ii), a measure of information in a video message introduced by Lang and her colleagues (Lang, Park, Sanders-Jackson, Wilson, & Wang, 2006), to entertainment television shows and its viewers. Specifically, participants watched a number of minute-long television show's opening theme. To eliminate fmiliarity, all shows were selected from a pool of 102 Japanese anime that was not introduced locally by any major television stations (network and cable).
Preliminary data collected from roughly half of intended subjects (n=29) shows that as information embedded (value of ii) increases, subjects’ attention level also increases, but recognition memory performance drops, which suggests cognitive overload took place. However, increase in information also leads to enjoyment, which is consistent with findings from another study submitted to ICA 2015 for possible presentation. Furthermore, increase in information also led to individual’s viewing intent for the whole series, suggesting that causing cognitive overload may be a useful technic to increase/sustain viewership of television shows.
Target subject size is fifty or more (N > 50). Besides physiological responses during video viewing session, self-report that includes viewing intent and recognition memory test are collected. The extended abstract will include data collected to date (n = 29).

2015-0335,2015,Poster,A New Scale for Confirmation Bias,6,"Confirmation bias (CB) is a form of heuristic processing which reduces cognitive effort by selectively limiting information search to that which is consistent with prior expectations, while overlooking that which might disconfirm initial assumptions. As prevalent as CB is—influencing nearly every form of interpersonal interaction and routine communication behavior—it remains a virtually unmeasured phenomenon. Presented is a study designed to develop a new CB scale. Participants (N = 333) read online training and bias elicitation messages, and responded to items assessing general bias knowledge and CB. Results show the scale (dubbed NewCB) to be reliable and valid, with good internal consistency. Two 7-item subscales are highly correlated with each other, and the full 14-item scale is correlated with a measure of CB (Wason’s card selection task), while diverging from a general bias scale. Discussion of the results and limitations is included along with suggestions for future research.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0336,2015,Poster,A Proposed Technology Implementation Scheme for Virtual Research Environments,2,"Virtual research facilities (VRE) are becoming increasingly common in the conduct of scientific research. A VRE holds the promise of improved coordination and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists by enhancing communication and facilitating access to a shared base of information and research tools. A review of the current literature suggests that knowledge about VRE-based scientific communication and what makes it effective is relatively sparse. In this review we attempts to provide such a framework that captures the increasing complexity of VREs based on the configuration of ICTs they incorporate. We argue that based it is possible to create a continuum based on technological features present within a VRE and propose a model of VRE development. This model illustrates the steps of scientific activities, technologies to needed for those steps, and if implemented the type of VRE we will get based on technological configuration.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems

2015-0338,2015,Poster,Applying Game Theory and Signal Detection Theory to Conflict Escalation: A Case Study of a Police Investigator Viewing a Domestic Argument,2,"Human communication can be characterized in terms of game theory as competing motivations in a social game in which one person desires “winning” in terms of obtaining compliance. Another theory, signal-detection theory posits that decision making takes place on a continuum of uncertainty in which many decision are made with complete certainty while others have higher levels of ambiguity and stress. The purpose of this case study is to explore the analysis of conflict escalation by a police detective with experience in domestic violence cases viewed a videotaped session depicting marital conflict in which a wife comes home after a long day at work only to criticize her partner for violating expectations of a good meal. The police detective was asked to stop the video at any time and to write down the verbal and nonverbal (NV) signals that people put out to indicate that conflict is escalating and that they may lash out. These signals are sometimes referred to as costly signals, a concept from evolutionary biology. A content analysis was done of verbal and nonverbal cues as well as the timing of the signals in terms of how often they were noticed. The case study presents a summary of the verbal (e.g., sarcasm) and nonverbal codes (e.g., contempt, breathing) that the detective noticed. Since the detective has expertise with conflict escalation, we argue that this case study sets up a standard of comparison for future research with peoples with various degrees of abuse in their abuse ranging from those who have suffered a great deal of verbal and physical abuse to those who have very little experience with coercive conflict tactics. Results are discussed in terms of game and signal detection theories from an evolutionary perspective.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0339,2015,Poster,Conditional Process Analysis With Multicategorical Independent Variables and Multicategorical Moderator Variables,1,"Recent technological advancements make it easier for researchers to test complex statistical models. Moderated mediation is one such model, in which a process (mediation) is contingent on another variable (moderation). This tutorial describes proper parameterization of specific types of moderated mediation models: models in which multicategorical variables are used as either independent variables or moderators. This procedure is especially useful for scholars whose research often necessitates multicategorical designs, such as political communication scholars (e.g., conservative, liberal, or independent respondents) and media violence scholars (e.g., participants exposed to violent media, prosocial media, or neutral media). It allows them to test moderated mediation within such designs without altering the nature of their datasets. In other words, previously popular practices such as collapsing conditions and excluding conditions are no longer necessary with the implementation of this procedure.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0340,2015,Poster,Dealing With Measurement Error in Content Analysis Data Using Simulation-Extrapolation,2,"Conducting and reporting reliability tests has become a standard practice in content analytic research. However, the consequences of measurement error in coding data are rarely discussed or incorporated in subsequent analyses. Since both random and systematic coding errors can lead not only to biased correlations and regression coefficients, but also to severely biased estimates of category proportions, we argue that it is almost always necessary to account for these errors when analyzing content analysis data. In this paper, we introduce simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) as a viable solution for dealing with misclassified data, both in uni- and multivariate analyses. In addition, we present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation study on the effectiveness of SIMEX corrections for typical content analysis data.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0341,2015,Poster,Towards a New Research Paradigm for Presence: A Pilot Study of Deriving the State of Presence From a Wide Range of Continuous Data,5,"Presence is usually assessed using various questionnaires, which are limited both in their reliability and their validity, as they assess presence ex post facto. Our goal is to systematically induce BIPs during an extended period of media experience, for which we observe changes in continually sampled data and singular events that are predictive of BIPs. The presented approach extends existing research by accounting for a wide range of observable data rather than isolated data. After four focus groups and an online survey to assess suited BIPs, we conducted an experiment with N = 18 participants, who played a video role playing game that was modified to include 16 BIPs throughout the session. We recorded the gaming session, player behavior, facial activity, and a wide range of psychophysiological indicators. Further steps are described.",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0342,2015,Poster,Unobtrusive Assessment of Emotional States in Astronaut Teams,5,"This research assesses the emotional states of astronaut teams through the analysis of verbal communication in space. Content analysis via computer automated textual analysis has been applied extensively in the field of communication (see Gonzales, Hancock, & Pennebaker, 2010; Hancock, Landrigan, & Silver, 2007; Pennebaker, Chung, Ireland, Gonzales, & Booth, 2007; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010; Toma & Hancock, 2012), and also draws on developments in the study of associative meaning in linguistics and information science (e.g., Heylighen, 2001; Turney, 2001). For any given construct or process, a lexicon of words indicative of that construct or process is developed. The relative prevalence of those words is used as an indicator of the degree to which that construct is engaged/that process is occurring. In this extended abstract a methodology for assessing emotion is provided and an illustrative example using transcripts from the Apollo 13 mission is presented (NASA HERA and NEEMO data forthcoming).",Methodological and Theoretical Advances,Information Systems
2015-0343,2015,Poster,A Conditional Process Model to Examine the Association Between Risky Driving Television and Joyriding Intentions,2,"This cross-sectional study (N=539) of aimed to examine a conditional process model for the relationship between young adults’ (aged 18 to 24 year) viewing of risky driving television programs (e.g. Top Gear) and joyriding intentions. In particular, a moderated multiple mediator model was developed to examine the processes through which television viewing and joyriding are related and to examine the conditions under which this relationship occurs.
In line with the hypotheses, attitudes and injunctive norms simultaneously mediated the relationship between exposure to risky driving on television and respondents’ joyriding intentions. These pathways were only significant for men.
The results indicate that scholars examining young drivers’ risk-taking should take the interplay between gender, media use, social norms and attitudes into account. For prevention campaign design, the results suggest that messages should be tailored to address both norms and attitudes of young males watching risky driving television shows.",Motivation,Information Systems

2015-0345,2015,Poster,Can Incongruent Combinations of Media Frames and Emotional Trajectories Elicit Coactivation in the Motivational Systems?,2,"This article uses the LC4MP to make predictions about the motivational activation elicited by short, text-based, media frames, and how this motivational activation might interact with the motivational activation elicited by a subsequent message. Specifically, it was predicted that incongruent combinations of message frame and message content (e.g. A loss frame with a pleasant message) will result in coactivation of the motivational systems. An experiment was conducted in which the availability of cognitive resources was assessed for four combinations of frames (gain and loss) and emotional trajectory (pleasant and unpleasant). Results supported the notion that frames elicit motivational activation, and when placed in an incongruent combination, coactivation is elicited. Also, we found further support for the notion that the appetitive system can inhibit the aversive. Motivational activation over time and the subsequent effects on emotional reactions and cognitive processing are discussed in light of the results of the experiment.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0346,2015,Poster,How Thinking About Media Can Support Democracy: Media Self-Efficacy and Internal Political Efficacy as Processes Underlying Young Adults’ Political Participation,1,"News exposure has been demonstrated to leverage political participation. However, we suggest that not only does news exposure foster young adults’ participation, but that their participation is also affected by their perceptions of how effective they are in gathering information from the media (media self-efficacy) and that this perception of media self-efficacy pays into people’s internal political efficacy. Based on Bandura’s self-efficacy theory (1977), media self-efficacy and internal political efficacy are suggested as underlying processes that link news exposure and political participation. In an online survey with young adults (N = 149; Mage = 19.8, SD = 1.33) this interplay was confirmed for online news exposure and participation, but not for television news exposure and participation. We suspect that particularly the interactive nature of online news facilitates the development of media self-efficacy and internal political efficacy.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0347,2015,Poster,Motivation-Activation Measure and Media Use in Asia: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,2,"The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, it tests how the Motivation Activation Measure (MAM; Lang, Bradley, Sparks & Lee, 2007) applies in a nonAmerican context, in order to provide evidence for the universality asserted through its theoretical underpinnings as an indicator of biologically based appetitive and aversive motivation systems. It thus investigates the similarity between the MAM scores found in a nonAmerican context with those previously found in an American context. Second, the paper examines how the individual difference in motivational system responsiveness correlates with media use and interests in an Asian culture. 861 respondents completed MAM, personality measures and self-reported media preference in an online survey. Results indicate that the ASA and the DSA recorded in the Asian sample associate significantly as predicted with theoretically-related measures of key factors of human personality and had similar pattern of scores with those found in American samples. Moreover, results suggest that audience interests in different types of media can be predicted through their variation in motivation systems activation.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0348,2015,Poster,Negativity Bias and Driver Identification Predict Risky Driving Intentions When Mortality is Implicitly Salient,2,"Prior efforts to reduce risky driving through media campaigns have not been successful. The present work tested predictions of the terror management health model (TMHM) using moderately or highly intense fear-appeal messages. Participants (N = 84) saw one of four PSAs advocating driving more slowly. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that those lower in negativity bias were more likely to identify with the driver when mortality salience was activated implicitly but not explicitly. In turn, higher driver identification was associated with higher risky driving intentions. This pattern is consistent with a terror management perspective, such that implicit death thoughts activate distal defense strategies in an effort to cope with the existential threat. These findings suggest that risky driving fear appeals should avoid implicit death-related content out of concern that it will trigger defensive processing in those most likely engage in risky driving.",Motivation,Information Systems

Sixty-seven participants were recruited to take the MAM measure while brain activity was recorded using a 14 channel EEG. Data analysis is currently underway.",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0350,2015,Poster,Transparency of Audience Behavior and Co-Orientation in the News Selections of Internet Users,3,"Web metrics (e.g. click rates, comment counts) published in the context of journalistic articles – as along with user rankings (e.g. most viewed and most commented articles), which are accessible on the websites of news media and aggregators – provide information about the news selection of the Internet audience. This transparency in audience behavior might lead to a co-orientation in the use of news content online. Preconditions for this co-orientation are the sufficient awareness of Web metrics and user rankings among Internet users as well as the relevance of such information for their own news selections. Because co-orientation may argue against the fragmentation thesis, we explore these preconditions by a representative online survey in the main user group of online news sites (ages 14 to 49 years, N = 433).",Motivation,Information Systems
2015-0351,2015,Poster,Beyond Ferguson: Implicit Impacts of Source Characteristics on Crisis Attribution,3,"The current study will conduct a 2 (race of journalists: Black vs. White) x 2 (involvement: Ferguson vs. fictitious city) x 2 (timing: present vs. later) x 2 (attribution of responsibility: black victim vs. white victim) mixed subjects experiment. By doing so, this study will help journalists understand how racial characteristics can lead to publics’ tendency of responsibility attribution in a racially charged incident. In order to explore this, this study will particularly examine implicit stereotyping as a measure of journalist evaluation. Using implicit measurements that prevent socially desirable responses resulted from self-report measures of prejudice, the study will measure accurate stereotyping attitudes as participants partake in non-conscious and automatic implicit learning of stereotypes from society and media (Fazio & Olson, 2003; Mastro et al., 2009; Olson, Kendrick, & Fazio, 2009).",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems
2015-0352,2015,Poster,Comparing Implicit Frames Across Domains,1,"Automated content analysis can greatly enhance framing research. Implicit framing analysis for instance has proven itself as a powerful tool to automatically extract frames from large collections of texts. Comparisons of these frames however are typically still done in a qualitative and interpretative manner. This paper proposes to complement the implicit framing technique with a quantitative measure that creates insight in the degree to which different domains overlap: cosine similarity. The technique is tested on a case study of the Dutch nuclear energy debate, including content of three organizations, two news agencies and two newspapers. Analysis shows that the results of the two techniques of implicit framing and cosine similarity analysis are consistent with each other: the degree to which frames substantially overlap is reflected in the cosine similarity scores. Applying cosine similarity analysis empowers framing scholars to statistically compare texts between domains as well as over time.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems

A within-subjects experiment was conducted in which participants listened to 16 radio ads that had been created with different models of intonation designed to vary the announcer’s pitch range. Dependent variables were self-reported effectiveness and adequacy, skin conductance level (SCL) and recognition memory. Results showed that radio ads presented by announcers whose pitch transitioned from high frequency to low achieved better perceived effectiveness, elicited greater sympathetic nervous system activation and attained better recognition accuracy than the ads with no pitch variations and variations from low to high pitch.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems
2015-0354,2015,Poster,Message Sensation Value: A Meta-Analysis of Main Effects,2,"The sensation value of messages is a concept that can inform the construction of effective messages. However, there have been conflicting results in the literature. Some studies demonstrate an interaction between message sensation value (MSV) and sensation seeking that affects the persuasiveness of a message. Other studies, however, demonstrate a main effect for MSV. This study provides a meta-analysis of the main effect of MSV on arousal, behavioral intention, and perceived message effectiveness. Ten cases from 6 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Findings suggest that MSV has a relatively strong main effect on arousal and a moderate main effect on perceived message effectiveness, but the main effect on behavioral intention is not significant.

2015-0356,2015,Poster,Visual Attention to Anti-Drunk-Driving PSAs With Different Emotionality: Explicating How Messages’ Emotionality Affects “Seeing” and “Believing”,1,"This study examines participants’ eye movements when presented with “real-world” persuasive messages – using anti-drunk driving PSAs with different emotional tones (positive, negative, co-active) as stimuli (stimuli have been pretested and selected). As public health messages with persuasive intent tend to use negative emotional appeals to promote desired attitude or behavior change (Leshner, Bolls, & Thomas, 2009), findings about their effectiveness have been mixed. Theoretical frameworks used in this study include the dimensional approach to emotions and two motivational systems. EmployingTobii TX300 Eye Tracker system, this study intends to explicate how people’s eye movements will differ as a function of viewing messages with different emotional valence, and further explores the relationship between allocation of visual attention and later cognitive processing of the messages and promoted behavior in the message.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems

A web-based experiment among 190 participants was conducted in which participants were given limited time to spend watching a maximum of 16 audiovisual news stories that varied in content (neutral versus negative stories) and packaging (standard versus tabloid stories). The viewing time per news story was the dependent variable. Results shows that the presence of negative content is by far the most important contribution to the viewing time. However, tabloid packaging also matters, and the same applies to age and gender of the viewers: Each of these variables provides a qualification of the impact that negative content has.",Studies of Message Properties,Information Systems

A sample of 192 undergraduate students was recruited at a large Midwestern university and exposed to an online survey experiment. It was found that sponsorship disclosure or its interaction with expectancy did not have a significant effect on the aforementioned attitudes. The study did determine, however, that, consistent with Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT), expectancy of YouTube exhibited a positive relationship with attitudes towards the advertised product. It also suggested a similar relationship between expectancy and YouTube vloggers.

2016-0003,2016,Poster,Effects of Musical Complexity and Intensity on Listener Emotion,2,"Music is a powerful and prevalent mode of communication. Research continues to find that at least some of that power and prevalence comes from the relationship listeners find between music and emotion (Lonsdale & North, 2011; Rentfrow, 2012). Music consumption constitutes an event that carries with it a wide range of possible emotional reactions. However, the relationship between emotional content in music and the listener is a complicated one. Guided by Lang's (2006) LC4MP, this study explores the effect of musical qualities of Intensity and Complexity on listeners' self-reported and physiological emotional reactions. An experiment measuring facial electromyography (EMG) in the corrugator (frown) and orbicularis oculi (smile) muscles, as well as self-reported affect and enjoyment determined that intensity and complexity are distinct qualities of music as judged by the listener, and that each plays a specific role in the listener's emotional experience.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

Studies show mixed results concerning the question whether images or texts have stronger effects on the evaluation of persons. When these two units give inconsistent information (divergence of image and text) the question of interactions arises. In an online-experiment (N=466) we manipulated the textual information (positive/negative) and the visual display of a politician (high/low self-assurance) in an online news article. There is a main effect of the text for all dimensions of evaluation but not for the image. Under the condition of short stimuli reception, the visual display of self-assurance in combination with positive textual information increases the perception of competence and self-assurance of the politician. Assumed effects of a divergence of image and text do not appear: positive visual displays in combination with negative textual information do not lead to a particularly negative evaluation.",Important Media and Message Features,Information Systems

The results showed that loss framing, coupled with high-virality metrics, resulted in greater fear particularly for individuals with relatively low perceived susceptibility to colorectal cancer. However, for individuals with relatively high perceived susceptibility, loss framing resulted in greater fear when the messages were presented with low-virality metrics. Furthermore, for those with relatively low perceived susceptibility, loss framing, when coupled with high-virality metrics, indirectly increased behavioral intention through fear. By contrast, for those with very high perceived susceptibility, the positive indirect effect of loss framing through fear was significant only when the messages were presented with low-virality metrics.

A recent review suggested that a within-individuals approach might be more appropriate to investigate the role of fear in persuasion. A web-based experiment (N = 454) using tobacco warning labels was conducted to test the fear-related EPPM propositions from both between- and within-individuals perspectives, and to revisit the role of fear in persuasion. Results showed that the EPPM was not supported in the between-subjects approach, but received much stronger support from the within-individuals perspective, and that fear should play a central role in persuasion.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems

Based on the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP; Lang, 2006), this study used twelve 30-second advertisements, either fast or slow in pacing. Self-reported questionnaires including attitude towards ad and brand, as well as physiological data were collected from the subjects (N=60).
Despite the fact that cognitive overload led to some unexpected findings, advertisements shown under an immersive environment were more effective in terms of attitude towards ad, brand, and purchase intent. Also notable is that some of the effects of the immersive environment were diminished for ads edited in a fast-paced manner. This is explained in the context of LC4MP (Lang, 2006).",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0012,2016,Poster,Self-Esteem and Public Self-Consciousness Moderate the Emotional Impact of Expressive Writing About Experiences with Bias,3,"A substantial body of research has revealed the positive effects of expressive autobiographical writing on overall psychological and physical well-being (e.g., Pennebaker & Evans, 2014). The present research investigated a potential boundary condition for the emotional benefits of expressive writing: participants’ personality traits. The present work also centered on an event type that has received little attention in prior research - the experience of being the target of stereotypical or biased judgments. Results suggested that high self-esteem provides a buffer against negative emotions (even when writing about a negative event), while public self-consciousness appears to heighten negative responses, even though individuals were writing privately and anonymously. This study provides important insights into moderators of the effects of expressive writing, and extends this paradigm into the important domain of individuals’ experience as the targets of bias.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0013,2016,Poster,The Interplay of News Frames on Emotional and Cognitive Processing,2,"One of the obstacles to understanding the mechanism(s) behind framing effects in communication research is obtaining empirical evidence of the actual cognitive processing of framed messages. Guided by the “Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing” (LC4MP), this paper examines how different news frame dimensions interact to affect cognitive and emotional processing of information. Specifically, we employ psychophysiological measures to illustrate how the interplay of frame valence (gain/loss) and frame level (episodic/thematic/mix) influences attention, cognitive elaboration, information recall and emotional response. A pilot study (N=20) with 2x3 experimental design regarding the issue of child adoption among same-sex male couples reveals that information is processed differently with different frame dimension combinations. A full study (N=100) will be completed in December. Moreover, prior opinion moderates the effect of incongruent frames on cognitive and emotional processing.

2016-0014,2016,Poster,Poignancy and Mediated Wisdom of Experience: Narrative Impacts on Willingness to Accept Delayed Rewards,3,"Research on the impact of eudaimonic narrative has begun to identify a variety of psychologically and socially important outcomes. In the present study, we conceptually and operationally distinguish three distinctive responses to eudaimonic narrative: moral elevation, being emotionally moved, and poignancy. We, following work by Hershfield and colleagues (Ersner-Hershfield et al., 2008), suggest that poignancy, or a combination of sadness and happiness in response to life or narrative events, represents a recognition and acceptance of life’s transience and mixed joys and sorrows. Evocation of poignancy by eudaimonic narrative, then, should elicit responses associated with age, life experience, and maturity, which we refer to as “mediated wisdom of experience”. We find that brief eudaimonic video clips, compared to similar non-eudaimonic clips, increase acceptance of delayed rewards (i.e., reduced delay discounting, which has been found to be associated with maturity and negatively associated with risky and unsafe behavior in prior research), indirectly via the impact of these clips on poignant responses. In contrast, being emotionally moved showed an indirect path leading to decreased acceptance of delayed rewards, whereas moral elevation had no mediating effect.",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0015,2016,Poster,Arousal as a Double Edge Sword in Moderating Ad Placement Effect,2,"One of the biggest differences between online video commercial and traditional TV commercial placement is that commercials online are oftentimes not placed serially but are embedded at different time points of a video. Individual ads are surrounded more by contents than by ads. This boosts the importance of content features as they were nearer to individual ads and could exert greater influence on ad effectiveness. This study is interested in exploring how video content feature (e.g., arousal) moderates the effects of ad placement on memory. Results showed that higher emotional arousal of video contents generally benefited imagery recognition of front ads (vs. back ads) but benefited recognition of verbal contents of back ads (vs. front ads). This interesting trade-off could provide important suggestions to the advertising industry in terms of strategizing ad placement depending on memory goals (reinforcing imagery vs. pinpointing verbal ad information).",The Role of Emotion in Information Processing,Information Systems
2016-0016,2016,Poster,The Role of Mindset Construal and Psychological Distance Cues in Online Truth Judgments,3,"Current research presents a novel application of construal level theory (CLT) for predicting online truth judgments. Previous CLT research showed that people’s mindsets and psychological distance information embedded in messages can influence truth judgments in offline settings. We experimentally tested whether a consistency between people’s mindsets (abstract vs. concrete construal) and psychological distance cues in tweets (spatially far vs. spatially close) enhances truth judgments of tweets. While no interaction effect was found, the results revealed a main effect of distance on truth perceptions. Participants judged tweets involving information on spatially close locations as truer than tweets involving information about spatially distant locations. Findings suggest that under uncertainty psychological closeness in messages can act as a truth-heuristic. Further research is needed for a better understanding of construal level and psychological distance interaction on online truth judgments.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0017,2016,Poster,Why User Comments Affect the Perceived Quality of Journalistic Content: The Role of Judgment Processes,3,"User comments on news websites are frequently uncivil and lack a reasoned argumentation, and research shows that these qualities of comments can have negative effects on the perceived quality of the commented journalistic content. To date it is not clear how such effects occur. We propose three mechanisms that suggest that the comments’ impact depends on how deliberate and elaborate a commented news item’s quality is judged. This was tested in an experiment (N = 637) that varied civility and reasoning in the comments that accompanied an article, and the brand of the news website. Results show that a lack of reasoning in the comments decreased the perceived quality of the news item irrespective of brand awareness, but only at high elaboration during judgment. Incivility in the comments decreased the perceived quality of journalistic content, but only at low elaboration, and only in unknown news brands. Implications are discussed.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems

Examining the Impacts of Location-Based Social Identity on the Consumer Decision-Making Process,3,"Given the growing popularity of e-commerce activities, online consumer reviews play a key component in influencing consumer judgments and decision-making processes. This study analyzes the effects of geographic based social identity provided in online consumer reviews in regards to reviewer’s source credibility and consumer judgments. We conducted a 2 (social identity: in-group vs. out-group identity) x 2 (review valance: positive vs. negative) x 2 (product type: experience goods x search goods) between-subjects experiment. Our results found that in-group geographic identity shaped consumer’s judgments about reviewed online products and reviewers’ perceived trustworthiness. Further, we found that perceived trustworthiness predicted attitudes and purchase intentions, indicating that social identity had indirect effects on those variables through perceived trustworthiness. Implications for future research on the relationships among social identity, valence of reviews, and product types in e-commerce settings will be further discussed.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems

Building upon behavioral evidence provided by a previous experiment addressing effects of economic messages on economic risk taking, the current study focuses on the exact psychophysiological mechanisms behind these effects. We show that simple economic messages can alter brain electrophysiological responses associated with processing of risk and benefit, namely error prediction and reward anticipation signals. The study will provide support for the hypothesis that economic news, which often offers an abstract, vague, and yet emotionally valenced impression about the more general direction of the economy, bias people’s model of the economy and shape consequent economic behavior.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems

It also tested whether the amount of the bias in recall of pre-message attitude moderates the relationship between actual attitude change and perceived message effect. An online-experiment was conducted with a pretest-posttest control group design (N = 196). Results showed that when attitudes changed in favor of message arguments, participants biasedly estimated their pre-message attitudes toward the direction of post-message attitudes. Second, the amount of bias in recall of pre-message attitude weakened the relationship between the actual attitude change and perceived message effect. Theoretical and practical implications of findings were discussed.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0021,2016,Poster,What Prompts People to Participate in Online Auctions: A Study of Bidders’ Behavioral Intention,4,"Online auction is an Internet-based activity in which participants bid for products. Auction websites are currently receiving a lot of attention, as reports indicate that nearly half of consumers who shop online have bid and bought products on online auctions. Nonetheless, despite the growing research interests of online auctions among information systems scholars, little attention has been paid to the psychological underlying causes of users’ involvement in online auctions. In this research, we build upon TAM and emotion literature, and develop a strong and parsimonious model to understand online auction users’ emotional responses and behaviors toward auction systems. 250 usable observations from users who participated in an online auction experiments were collected, and applied regression and PROCESS analyses were employed to analyze the data. Our findings highlight the role of one important aspect of emotional state – dominance – in forming behavioral intention, which has not received enough attention in explaining users’ involvement in information systems. This study contributes to both information system literature and practice related to the interactions of online auction websites and their users.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0022,2016,Poster,The Influence in News Stories of Criminal Intentionality and Criminal and Victim Affective Dispositions on Support for Policy About Alcohol Crimes,2,"Two studies tested if the rationalist and intuitionist sequences for forming moral judgments about story characters, proposed by Lee and Shapiro (2014), can explain how news stories about alcohol-related crimes influence support for relevant policies. Study 1 supported the rationalist sequence: participants blamed a store owner who intentionally sold alcohol to a minor (compared to a store owner presented a convincing false ID). The increased blame was associated with an increase in support for punitive policies. In Study 2, the intuitionist sequence was supported under some circumstances. Participants blamed a disliked administrator who drove drunk and caused an accident more than a liked administrator. Participants supported preventive policies more and punitive policies less when the perpetrator was a liked administrator than when the perpetrator was a disliked one; however, this effect was moderated by the timing of alcohol use questions.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems
2016-0023,2016,Poster,Individual Differences in Intentions to Drink: Investigating the Relationship Between the BIS/BAS Scales and Accessibility,6,"Previous research has suggested that individual differences play a key role in risky decision-making. In turn, we examined how the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral approach system (BAS), characterized by a sensitivity to reward and punishment respectively, influenced the accessibility of alcohol-related norms and attitudes. We also investigated whether or not norm and attitude accessibility mediated the relationship between these two systems and intentions to drink. 421 first-year students completed norm and attitude accessibility tasks as well as completing measures of the BIS, BAS, previous alcohol behavior, and perceived stress. Results of this study indicate that a higher BIS is positively associated with attitude accessibility and attitude accessibility subsequently mediates the relationship between the BIS and behavioral intentions. Results for the relationship between the BAS scales and accessibility were more mixed, suggesting that a sensitivity to reward may manifest in a more varied manner.","Bias, Intentionality, Judgment, and Decision Making",Information Systems

The potential influence of the private vs. public nature of a conversation becomes important when considering that social media provide highly public spaces for societal debates. Results from a cross-cultural experiment revealed a publicness effect in Germany, but not in Singapore. In Germany, a higher level of publicness of a controversial discussion on Facebook reduced people’s likelihood to express their viewpoint, attenuating the influence of the opinion climate. Explanations for this effect were found in users’ fears of being offended and judged by others.

Data were collected through an online survey of KakaoTalk (an instant messaging application for smartphones) users in South Korea (N = 495). Those with higher interpersonal rejection sensitivity reported higher levels of use intensity and stress in their MIM use. However, interpersonal rejection sensitivity was not significantly associated with relational usefulness of MIMs. These findings indicate that mobile messaging is more stressful for those with higher interpersonal rejection sensitivity.

An online survey (N=517) found that U.S. participants' perceptions of injunctive norms (peer expectations) and descriptive norms (peer behaviors) were strongly and positively correlated with the likelihood of engaging in multi-communication behaviors. Participants tended to overestimate the extent to which others would engage in multi-communication. Perceptions that multi-communication violated conversational etiquette diminished the likelihood that people would engage in those activities. Greater engagement in multi-communication and perceived injunctive norms increased participants’ anxiety about being separated from their smart phone. Behaviors and norms varied depending upon the type of communication (work-related, family-related, or social life-related) and the conversational context (work, home, or social setting). Work related multi-communication was most common at work, but communicating about family and social life was most likely at home and in social settings.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This may present challenges for individuals who invest heavily in these platforms because they increase the probability of observing exchanges among their friends and the likelihood of feeling inequity. 194 participants were randomly assigned to either an over- or under-rewarded communication scenario, and psychological distress was measured and used as the dependent variable. Results suggest that although participants did not report experiencing distress in the over-rewarded condition, there was a significant main effect for the under-rewarded condition such that participants who were more heavily invested in their online social network experienced distress. Results also indicated that women experienced more distress in the under-rewarded condition, opposed to men.

The comparison of face-to-face settings and computer-mediated channels on the experience of conflicts has been largely overlooked compared to other interpersonal communication factors. An original experiment examined whether different channels (face-to-face vs. video chat) through which people experience conflicts with another person affect their partner evaluation and communication satisfaction. The participants’ physiological arousal (interbeat interval, galvanic skin response) was recorded during the conversation as well as their self-reported arousal level. Results show that people who interacted face-to-face rated themselves as more aroused than those who interacted via video chat although there was no significant difference in physiological arousal. Those who interacted via video chat were better at judging their partner’s arousal than those who interacted face-to-face. After the conversation, those who interacted via video chat rated their partner to be more likable and trustworthy and were more satisfied with the result of their conversation than those who interacted face-to-face. The overall findings suggest the benefits of distance and mediation in resolving conflicts.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0029,2016,Poster,The Positivity Bias and Prosocial Deception on Social Network Sites,2,"Can the positivity bias, observed across various Social Network Sites (SNSs), predict the use of prosocial lies in a SNS such as Facebook? The positivity bias may be a product of politeness norms (i.e., positive face concern) that have influenced communication phenomena before these sites existed. In addition, this bias may also be affected by unconscious cues or primes that promote prosocial behavior generally and on SNSs specifically. This study examined how positive face concern and surveillance primes affect prosocial lying in public and private SNS contexts. Although positive face concern and publicness predicted the use of prosocial lying, positive face concern was not affected by the publicness of the SNS context and surveillance primes did not affect positive face concern or the use of prosocial lies in this study. This hints towards the nuance of positive face concern and the potential limitations of surveillance primes on prosocial lying behavior.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Previous research has demonstrated that it is possible to develop ambient awareness (i.e., a knowledge of others after browsing social media), but it is still unclear whether and to what extent Twitter users have experiences of ambient intimacy, and what types of self-disclosure help to develop such experiences. This paper is the first to theoretically distinguish the concept of ambient intimacy from ambient awareness. The results showed that the phenomenon of ambient intimacy is not as common as ambient awareness. Users were more likely to develop ambient intimacy towards a certain person when they were more frequently exposed to the tweets of that person, had more (one-sided) interaction with that person, and when the tweets of that person were perceived as more intimate, entertaining, and informative.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

For a better understanding of the human-agent interaction, the current study examines how humans respond to the AI agent’s advice during a decision-making process when there is disagreement. We conducted an experiment (n = 88) with a 2 (Embodiment: Embodied vs. Disembodied) x 2 (Labeling: Expert vs. Novice) between-subjects design. The results show that embodiment has positive effects on participants’ perception of the AI agent (e.g., perceived attractiveness and evaluation of interaction), as well as advice-taking measured by cooperation intention and compliance behavior. The result of a post-hoc mediation analysis also show that expertise-labeling has an indirect effect on advice-taking via perceived intelligence of the AI agent.

I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce. By leveraging user data for advertising purposes, they contributed to an information environment in which every action, digitally and increasingly in real life, leaves behind traces collected by companies for commercial purposes.

However, in the context of new media, such as YouTube, it is possible that the relationship can no longer be understood as a parasocial one, but, instead, as one that is social. A survey of 449 YouTube viewers was conducted to understand the relationship that viewers believe exists between them and YouTube content creators. In particular, it explored the realities of the social interactions that the platform provides and how those interactions were affected by four independent variables: intensity, realism, identification, and interactivity. Results indicate that intensity, realism, and identification are all predictors of parasocial interaction and social connection, with interactivity only positively predicting social connection.

Due to easy-to-use posting tools, social media especially facilitate news sharing—a behavior that has the potential to increase political involvement and engagement. Drawing from the uses and gratifications theory (UGT) and the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this study investigated the effects of motives, attitudes and intentions on news sharing behavior among German social media users (n = 333). Findings show that news sharing attitude has a positive effect on intention, which in turn has a positive effect on behavior. While the motives information seeking and socializing exerted a direct influence on news sharing attitude, intention, and behavior, status seeking only directly influenced behavior. Besides, political interest was also a significant determinant of news sharing behavior.

Using structural equation modeling and based on a representative survey of Swiss Internet users, it reveals connections between four multidimensional constructs: privacy breaches, privacy attitudes, Internet skills, and self-protective privacy behavior. As hypothesized, past experiences with privacy breaches are a strong predictor of current protective behavior. Most strikingly, however, the model indicates that Internet skills are key in explaining users’ privacy behavior. In line with the “privacy paradox” argument, caring about privacy alone does not necessarily result in substantial self-protection. Internet skills are an essential asset in information societies. They enable users to reduce risks of privacy loss while obtaining the benefits from online activities that increasingly depend on the revelation of personal data. Consequently, Internet skills are—next to privacy awareness—an essential starting point for public policies regarding the governance of users’ self-help in privacy protection.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Recent Pew Research (2013) indicates that, on average, 21% of Chinese respondents believe that homosexuality should be accepted. However, parallel surveys of Internet users paint a different picture as online surveys found a more liberal atmosphere toward homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The online and offline discrepancy in attitudes toward homosexuality begs the question of whether the Internet carries a stigma-reducing function in terms of views on sexual minority groups. Guided by the contact hypothesis and parasocial contact theory, the current study investigates the de-stigmatizing effect of the Internet, especially of social media, on homosexuality in China. A web-based survey with 980 heterosexual social media users confirmed the positive role of interpersonal mediated contact with homosexual celebrities via social media venues in stigma reduction; but did not lend support to the parasocial mediated contact hypothesis.

We hypothesized that anthropomorphism on a brand’s Facebook fan page can strengthen the relationships between brands and consumers by yielding both social presence and a positive inference regarding the brand’s quality as a relationship partner. Our longitudinal experiment confirmed the effects of brand anthropomorphism and the mediating role of social presence. The results suggest that when the anthropomorphized brand had relationships with consumers, consumers showed a favorable attitude toward the brand and high brand satisfaction. Also, the participants perceived the anthropomorphized brand as a trustworthy relationship partner, and they gave more Likes for the posts from the anthropomorphized brand than those from the non-anthropomorphized brand.

Results of an experiment show that the using QR codes has a positive impact on focused attention with iPads among individuals who prefer personalized content. The effect of QR codes on felt engagement with iPads depends on the topics of personalized content people are interested in. The felt engagement with iPads decreases when using QR codes among people who are interested in business and health content, while it increases when using QR codes among people who are interested in local events. This study is the first study to examine the effect of QR code on the two different types of engagement with iPad among individuals who prefer personalized content. It confirms that engagement with technology is a flow experience and different engagement with technology could be affected by different factors. Specializing engagement with technology into different dimensions such as focused attention and felt engagement may give us deep insight about this experience.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0047,2016,Poster,Evaluating the Credibility of Online Reviewers,5,"This manuscript presents the results of an experimental study on three characteristics of online reviews: the valence of the review, the argument strength of the review and whether the review is in consensus with the overall rating of the target object on the website. Results show that reviewers who disagree with the overall rating of the target object were perceived to be less credible and had less influence on a recipient. Argument strength has a stronger effect on attitudes toward a target when the message is negative than when it is positive. Moreover, mediation analysis shows that perceived reviewer competence mediates the effect of argument strength on attitude toward the target when the message is negative. These results are consistent with Kelley’s (1973) Covariation Model and the Unimodel of Persuasion (Kruglanski & Thompson, 1999).",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Relying on the model of multi-level functionality of social media (Jung & Moro, 2014), the authors explore different types of connections between storytelling agents at the micro, meso, and macro level. Our study found that interpersonal network size and connection to community-level organizations through social media significantly affected social media storytelling and advocacy. Social media storytelling is positively associated with advocacy behaviors among farmers. The study discusses implications for future research.

2016-0050,2016,Poster,Reporting Human Rights: A Study of News Representations and Journalist Practices,1,"This paper examines the representation of human rights in the news and the production practices that determine human rights reporting. Drawing on a systematic examination of mainstream television’s news contents and practices, and based on interviews with journalists, the paper analyses the coverage of human rights issues in different levels of depth by looking at motivations and limitations, resources and editorial choices. The research unveils how proximity is now being re-shaped as a news value and reinforced by the surrounding context of the financial crisis. Therefore, proximity now is both empathetic and forced: on one hand, there is a growing and persistent interest in human rights matters at a local or national level; but on the other hand, as financial cuts are applied to newsrooms, preventing reporters from travelling overseas, journalists have no choice but to look at news events at home. In this sense, the distance to remote human rights causes is increasing. From the journalists’ perspective, this inclination is undermining the possibility of a global understanding of human rights causes, but also highlighting the need to expose sensitive situations nearby.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

An investigation on the research sample - the Chinese diasporas and diasporic newspapers in Oceania shows two results. First, the diaspora, especially the transformation of sub-Chinese diasporic groups, is a major power to the survival of diasporic newspapers, including in reader and advertisement markets, and media ownership. Second, the homelands influences (mainland, Hong Kong, etc.) contribute directly to these media’s content, audience and ownership. Subsequently, comparative studies were conducted between the Chinese and the other diasporic newspapers in the six languages. Results show: while the diasporas are the vital power to all the papers, the homeland impacts are not salient on the six languages newspapers. Two reasons for the differences rely on media owner and homeland.

The data came from the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS), waves of the mid-2000s and the early 2010s. The data show that political participation of Asian Internet users was independent of cultural norms that hindered the involvement of non-users in unconventional political action at both the individual and societal levels.

2016-0077,2016,Poster,Perceptions of Appropriateness: Receivers’ Reactions to Message Design Logics,2,"In her theory of message design logics (MDLs), O’Keefe (1988) argues that people vary in the way they construct messages based on how they view the purpose of communication. Three types of MDLs have been identified which are ordered in increasing levels of sophistication. People may view communication as a way to vent one’s feelings (expressive MDL), as a game in which the players are obligated to follow the rules (conventional MDL), or as an opportunity to display flexibility in order to achieve one’s goals (rhetorical MDL). Because of the increased concern for the “other” expressed in higher level MDLs, it is expected that users of higher-level MDLs will be more effective in achieving their own goals, and therefore more communicatively competent (Canary & Spitzberg, 1987; O’Keefe & McCornack, 1987). A number of researchers have typically found support for this expectation, often using a variation of the “Ron Scenario” created by O’Keefe in which participants imagine they are the leader of a group in which a member named Ron has been causing problems and frustration for the rest of the group.

In this study, a modified version of the Ron Scenario was used to address two issues that have garnered little attention before now. Two-hundred thirty-seven participants were asked to imagine that they were ‘Ron’ and had received a message from their group leader (Jack or Jill) written in one of the three MDL styles. Previously reported* quantitative analyses of this data revealed that participants’ motivation to comply with the leader’s request to complete one’s work for the group was influenced by MDL style, leader gender, and respondent gender. However, motivation to comply was relatively high in all conditions, suggesting that leader messages were effective in achieving task-related goals regardless of MDL used. Although open-ended responses to the leaders’ messages were solicited at the time of initial data collection, participants’ qualitative data were not analyzed at that time. For the current study, it was predicted that participants’ perceptions of the appropriateness of the leaders’ message would increase for higher level MDLs, and that gendered expectations would also influence participants’ responses. Qualitative analysis was generally supportive of these predictions, highlighting the potential relational impact of different MDLs on one’s interactions.

In turn, people who are adopted are perceived to be less likely to be successful than those raised by biological parents. This study compared perceptions of attraction and credibility between people raised by biological parents (bio subjects), those who were immediately adopted (adoption subjects), and those who were in foster care for six years before being adopted (foster subjects). The task and social dimensions of interpersonal attraction and the competence, caring/goodwill, and trust dimensions of source credibility were examined. Results showed that while there was no difference on any of the dimensions between bio subjects and adoption subjects, foster adoptions ranked lower on almost all measures of attraction and credibility than bio subjects.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0079,2016,Poster,"From “Whom to Blame” to “Nothing to Fear”: Voices, Documentary Narratives and Dependent Destigmatization of Severe Mental Patients (SMP) in Hong Kong",1,"Media often stigmatize severe mental patients (SMP) by portraying them as dumb, sluggish or violent. Conversely, TV documentary, as a particular media genre, has potential to destigmatize SMP by entrusting SMP with more authentic presence and direct voices. Drawing on narrative analysis and interviews, this article exemplifies Hong Kong case to illustrate the evolving and joint endeavor of media and mental hospital to systematically destigmatize severe mental illnesses (SMI). From 1989 to 2011, a three-episode series documentary was made by Hong Kong connections. Shifting from the narratives “whom to blame” to “nothing to fear”, the documentaries established a destigmatization scheme jointly formulated by media and mental hospital. Voices of SMP steadily increase in amount across time yet were strictly subject to the interests of mental institutions that aims to promote the rehabilitation mode of mental health care in Hong Kong. The narrative inequality between people with mental illness and mental health care institutions leads to the “dependent destigmatization” that indicates dependent power relation between those SMP and mental health institutions.",Language and Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0080,2016,Poster,Making History Together: Derogatory Online Comments on Chinese Mythic Plays as Echoes of Hegemonic Discourse,2,"Chinese internet users have mocked TV dramas for their unrealistic, overly heroic portrayal of the war against Japan. They charged the dramas with distorting history by nicknaming them Mythic Plays. As a result the representation of the war on Chinese TV became a nationwide discussion. Using Gramsci’s concept of hegemony as a framework, this article analyzes the controversy about Mythic Plays through a qualitative analysis of online comments. Specifically it examines the internet commentators’ expectation of the representation of national history. It argues that as a result of propaganda and state-controlled education internet users have been, at least in the case of Mythic Plays, active participants in the ongoing process of maintaining China’s official ideology.",Language and Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0081,2016,Poster,Apple and the Business of Mobile Maps,1,"This paper examines the business of maps: the cartographic infrastructure that sits behind, and is integrated into, many mobile applications. Specifically, the paper considers Apple Maps. Apple constitutes an interesting case study in this context insofar as it was a relative latecomer to what was an already maturing field of mobile mapping, launching its Maps service against established competition in the form of Google, OpenStreetMap, the (since sold) Nokia HERE, and others. Drawing on mobile infrastructure and political economy of the media approaches, my concern in this paper is twofold: first, to examine the means by which Apple has set about building its own maps infrastructure; second, to make critical sense of what Apple hopes to achieve by carving out its own place within the broader, and highly competitive, mobile mapping ‘ecosystem’. The picture that emerges is one where the possession of cartographic capabilities was considered crucial for Apple, both in developing further means of increasing revenue within its own ‘walled garden’ business model, and for protecting key assets and revenue streams from encroachment by its competitors (principally, Google).",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Specifically, we probe the indirect process in which different types of social values predict key dimensions of engagement with civic affairs through prevailing patterns of mobile phone use. In brief, we show that informational mobile use is indirectly associated with engagement with civic affairs mainly through informational mobile use, whereas the link between collectivism and community involvement is positively intervened by relational mobile use.

We argue that that one of the underpinning principles of mobile phones - that they pertain to mobility and that mobility is positive and agential – is called into question through our research. Drawing on empirical data and research within cultural geography, digital media and youth studies, we engage with a number of issues: the mobile phone as meaningful, mobile phones in relation to embodied mobility, and mobile phones in relation to social capital. Our aim is not only to unpack a number of concepts and assumptions underpinning the mobile phone, but also to suggest that these concepts unhelpfully (and even detrimentally) locate mobile phones in relation to the technological possibilities on offer without taking into account what is simultaneously made impossible and immobile, and for whom. Finally, when we set the digital experiences of NEET teenagers alongside the discourses around mobile phones, we find that mobility is restricted - not enabling, and that it is forged in, and articulated as part of, an everyday life that is dominated by the social and economic horizons set by the groups status as NEET.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Through the notion of digitally mediated transient sociality, I argue mobile devices as integral to experience and sociality in the public transportation systems. This allows us for the opening into the structural politics of time and space that any media technology alters, through examining the mundane and unremarkable everyday experiences and the assemblages that constitute them. This paper contribute to such an understanding by examining the moment of “passing-by” experienced through a mobile device between people on a public transportation. By doing, it explicate the co-constitutive nature of human and nonhuman entities in the experience of sociality, and attend to the centrality of mobility in the sociality of urban commuter trains by bringing together the hitherto separated categories of virtual and actual mobilities.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0085,2016,Poster,“Data is the Latest Buzz Around Here”: Navigating Expert Relationships in Analytics,3,"Analytics is an important and increasingly widespread instantiation of the now axiomatic idea that organizations can and must derive value from their knowledge assets. Whereas existing work on analytics tends to focus on the diffusion and implementation of analytics techniques, this article concerns the actual conduct of analytics work. In doing so, it conceptualizes analytics as multidisciplinary knowledge work that depends on relationships among organizational experts. Building on theories of expertise coordination and knowledge work as communicative accomplishments, the article posits and tests a model of expert relationships for multidisciplinary knowledge work. The model focuses on relational dynamics of access, trust, and dialogue. Applying the model to the results from a mixed-methods investigation of analytics work in a Fortune 50 organization, the findings confirm the model in part, but also prompt a revision that (a) makes clear the importance of expert relationships, (b) highlights the importance of freedom from existing organizational frameworks , and (c) emphasizes intertwined processes of collaborative optioning and received interpretation in analytics.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In particular, it explored how women from China, Denmark, and the United States navigate structure paradoxes in their venture creation processes. Based on 40 in-depth interviews, it was found that structure in the forms of traditional values, cultural script, policy and regulation, and governmental support to entrepreneurship created paradoxical effects in women’s enactment of entrepreneurship. While negatively influenced by structural paradoxes, women actively engaged in identity work, reframing of their career choices, and building alternatives to circumvent the negative effects of various structures. Women’s enactments of entrepreneurship in their interactions with structure paradoxes shed light to the political formations and assumptions of careers to re-envision meaningful, inclusionary, and sustainable entrepreneurship models.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2016-0087,2016,Poster,Multichannel Management Strategies of Governmental Organizations,4,"To close the supposed gap between government expectations of digital public service delivery channels and the actual use of these channels by citizens, researchers proposed a multichannel management (MCM) strategy in 2008, suggesting that citizens behave rationally in their channel choice. However, later research findings suggest that channel choice is less rational.

This research explores channel preferences and channel behavior in multichannel service delivery of local governments in the Netherlands.

Results show that rational factors are important, like task complexity and urgency, but also less rational or situational factors influence channel choice, such as propensity, computer self-efficacy, and trust.

Conclusions are that less or non-rational determinants influence channel preferences. However, complexity also does have an impact, and so does the service that is delivered. Furthermore, urgency is a moderator for complexity. Thus, when a situation is considered both complex and urgent, there is also a significant impact on channel preferences.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This involves explicating the conceptualization and operationalization of success, followed by an examination of the criteria a movement must fill to achieve that success. The model incorporates visibility, thresholds, and threats to explain the behavior not only of a collective, but also of the target of a social movement. The model is tested by analyzing the case of the Reddit boycott of GoDaddy.com, using data from the original post that started the boycott and the comment thread associated with that post. Data from media reports also provides evidence supporting the validity of the analysis.

The aim of the study is to gain insight in the prevailing frames in order to develop counterframes. Counterframes are less problematizing and are meant to be applicable in organizations’ internal communication, as it is possible that the problematizing nature of the dominant discourse can demotivate employees. First, an inductive framing analysis was conducted, using newspapers articles and texts from various stakeholders. This procedure yielded four problematizing frames and six deproblematizing counterframes. They cover both the meaning of work for the individual, and the effect that working longer has on society. To assess the applicability of the frames in an organizational context, the ten frames were discussed by HR managers by means of in-depth interviews.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Total 12 focus group interviews with Chinese veterans and newcomers, as well as ten in-depth personal interviews with newcomers are conducted in a governmental organization. A modified constant comparative analysis of findings reveals three major types of workplace emotion experienced by participants: emotional labor, emotion with work, and emotion toward work; also, Chinese participants adopt assumptions of workplace maturity that defines “the way of doing” with newcomers’ partial divergence. Following the assumption, participants employ collective strategies that incorporate normalization and collective dispersion of negative emotion. The convergence and divergence on emotion management during group socialization demonstrate newcomers’ learning about group and organizational norms and values, which also embodies personal and professional growth in Chinese workplace.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Controversial companies are more likely to receive negative comments and less likely to receive positive comments than non-controversial companies. In addition, CSR videos that (1) use information strategies, (2) take a company-dominant perspective, and (3) describe high fit CSR programs are more likely to receive negative and skeptical comments. On the other hand, CSR videos that (1) emphasize the companies’ commitment to the programs, (2) support the impact of CSR programs with anecdotal evidences, and (3) balance their CSR motives between social benefits and business interests are less likely to receive negative and skeptical comments.",Organizational Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

A few simple organizational measures and the long-standing dichotomy of evolutionary and revolutionary change are used as conduits to connect the two research areas. This proposed configurational change framework offers a clearer understanding of the internal and external forces that drive organizational transformations. This is particularly crucial for informal communication systems operating alongside formally defined organizational hierarchies, as well as those serving as the sole means of coordination within online communicative contexts. On a more fundamental level, this synthesis allows researchers and practitioners to move beyond the conception of online or offline organizational configurations as static entities and toward a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which organizations move through the spectrum of configurations.

However, traditionally neither the engagement nor the interest of stakeholders was easy to achieve for organizations, with attention divided, and a lack of under-standing and interest often hampering the effectiveness of corporate social responsibility efforts. With our research, we propose that hedonic aspects of stakeholder engagement, in particular embodied through the process of gamifying ecological, social and governance issues, might be an ample addition to more traditional utilitarian CSR communication efforts. Specifically, we propose, based on experimental research, that the addition of gamified elements such goal-achievement, challenge, feedback and reward may better attract attention through increasing the desire for information. Our research thus complements traditional research into CSR-communications with insights about the effectiveness of hedonic message factors, and is an effort to help engage stakeholders in an increasingly attention-starved communication envi-ronment.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Furthermore, we examine the role of conversational human voice in this relation. In a two-wave survey among 763 customers of an international airline, we measured customers' webcare interactions, their perception of affective commitment, and conversational human voice. The results from this study show that webcare interaction is positively related to affective commitment both at t1 and t2, but negatively related to change in affective commitment. The perception of a conversational human voice in the company’s communication attenuates this negative relation: for high levels of conversational human voice, webcare interactions no longer influence affective commitment.

The current study uses a 2 (source type: corporate vs. non-profit) x 2 (congruence: congruent vs. incongruent) x 4 (message repetition) mixed factorial design to investigate the effect of anti-texting while driving PSAs via social media on attitudes and behavioral intentions. More specifically, participants (N = 219) were randomly assigned to view anti-texting while driving PSAs that varied in source and congruence. Results showed that participants expressed less favorability toward texting while driving and expressed greater intentions to refrain from texting while driving when the PSA was posted by a non-profit organization than a corporate. Corporates are more likely to elicit the desirable persuasive effects if they were congruent to the issue of texting while driving (e.g., automaker vs. grocery store). People’s intention to interact with the messages on social media predicted their offline behavioral intentions, wherein corporates and non-profits could take advantage of this and create potentially viral messages in the persuasion process.",Message Processing and Effects,Information Systems
2016-0113,2016,Poster,From Labels to Explanations: An Integrative Framework for Attitudinal Media Effects Research (FrAMER),2,"While attitudes are a key concept in media effects research, there is no consensus on how to conceptualize and explain attitudinal media effects: different research traditions are largely inspired by different definitions of attitudes and often follow different kinds of process models that, whilst valuable in their own right, risk losing track of how they are mutually related. Drawing on the essential distinction between the functional and cognitive levels of scientific analysis, this paper proposes a integrative Framework for Attitudinal Media Effects Research (FrAMER) showing why and how the mechanisms from different domain-specific processing models can all be integrated and investigated as potential cognitive-level mechanisms underlying different functional-level media effects.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems
2016-0114,2016,Poster,"Healthy Food Identification: Food Cues, Health Claims, and Health Halos",2,"Food is a primary biological motivator that in general creates appetitive responses, especially when the food information is very directly available to the senses. These appetitive responses may get in the way of more effortful, systematic decision making in typical food decision-making; however, health halo products, or foods that are assumed to be healthier than they actually are in conjunction with the types of claims they make may alter this pattern. This paper presents an experiment that examines how health claims interact with available food cues to affect decision-making about health halo food products. One hundred twenty-four individuals were exposed to counterbalanced product images that varied by directness of cues, type of food claims, and objective healthiness across 3 different health halo food products. Participants evaluated products by completing two latency categorization tasks. In general, results support that individuals are susceptible to health halos in general but that congruency of the claims matters. Further, food cues are used to help make determinations when incongruence exists.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems
2016-0115,2016,Poster,Impacts of a Character’s Morality on Audience Perspective Taking and Audience Explanations for Character Behavior,2,"The current study examines the effects of character morality on audience members’ perspective taking processes. Through two experiments, we find people tend to take an actor’s perspective when interpreting moral characters, indicated by higher level of egocentric projection into the character, identification with the character, paying closer attention to their unintentional behaviors, and providing more mechanical causes to explain these behaviors. In contrast, when processing immoral characters, people tend to take an observer’s perspective by focusing more on intentional behaviors. This research extends our understanding of the role of character morality in narrative processing and conditions under which people would use different mental inference strategies to understand a media character.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

We propose that information engagement can be conceptualized in relation to levels of cognitive involvement and issue relevance, as three distinct behaviors that range along a continuum from least active to most active: (1) Information scanning, (2) information seeking/selective exposure, and (3) information sharing. We conclude with specific recommendations for conceptual and operational definitions and measures of information engagement, and propose a research agenda for theorizing effects and pathways of information engagement on substantive outcomes across different domains within communication.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

A Meta-Analysis on Stereotype Threat,2,"Stereotypes in the media – the prevalence and the consequences – are an important topic for communication scholars and the general public. This presentation is about the consequences of negative stereotypes and devaluing content on members of the negatively portrayed groups (e.g., women, Latino Americans, older adults). More specifically, we focus on stereotype threat, a detrimental, stress-related state which leads to performance decrements and disidentification from negatively stereotyped topics and career options.
We introduce the first meta-analytic summary of existing findings that relate negative cognitive performance and disidentification to mediated stereotypes (such as gender-stereotypical TV-ads or newspaper articles). Our search in databanks (Communication MMC, PsycINFO, etc.) and through mailing lists and social media yielded 182 potentially relevant references. A further inspection of full texts revealed 25 independent studies that are relevant, with requests for four additional studies currently pending. The results will include analyses of publication bias and several moderator analyses.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems
2016-0118,2016,Poster,Electroencephalographic Reponses to Gay Imagery in Advertising,3,"Advertisements featuring gay imagery are becoming increasingly popular, but potentially negatively affect purchase intentions and attitudes towards brands that utilize this imagery. Although self-reported anti-gay attitudes have been shown to enhance these effects, self-reported attitudes may be subject to social desirability and not accurately reflect the manner in which behavior is affected. The use of electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques to investigate this phenomenon eliminates concerns about socially desirable responding. Furthermore, EEG has the potential to elucidate the timecourse of neural mechanisms by which consumer attitudes and behavior are affected. The current study aims to examine the timecourse of early selective attention, violation of expectancies, and emotion processes in response to advertisements featuring gay imagery using EEG. The N1, N2, P3 and LPP may help reveal if purchase intentions and brand attitudes are negatively affected via attention, the “novelty” of seeing gay couples in advertisements, and/or via emotional responses to the advertisements.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

One proposed intervention to address these issues across populations is to require that chain restaurants and similar establishments provide nutrition information, such as calorie labels, on menu items. This study therefore aims to examine the effect of menu calorie labeling on food and beverage choices of emerging adults. Results of a between-subjects experiment (n = 179) revealed that calorie labeling increased the likelihood of choosing lower calorie food and beverage options. Moreover, calorie labeling only led to selecting a lower calorie food option among those with high self-control, but not among those with low self-control. This moderating effect was not revealed for beverage choice. Public health practitioners and policymakers should consider intervention approaches that address other drivers of choice, such as self-control, in addition to nutrition information.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems
2016-0120,2016,Poster,Situational and Issue Involvement as Determinants of Search Engine Usage Behavior,2,"While there is a general consensus that search engine usage behavior is mostly influenced by the ranking—the majority of users only selects the top-ranked search results linked on the first search engine results page—, both situational and personal factors are able to shape this behavior as well. Furthermore, the sole employment of the ranking heuristic poses considerable threats for users, especially when searching information on substantial topics like politics and health. Thus, we examine how differences in involvement—differentiating between involvement by situational factors, and involvement by interest in and knowledge about the researched issue—are able to influence the search process.
Search engine usage behavior of student participants regarding an open-ended informational task was observed, with situational involvement experimentally manipulated and issue involvement surveyed. Preliminary results show that while highly involved users search more thoroughly, they still largely rely on heuristics.",Advances in Audience Research,Information Systems

Yet, little is known about the ways health messages are shared on Twitter; how different conversational features of Twitter facilitate such sharing process; and the roles played by different types of organizational users in the process. The current study collected tweets during the National Diabetes Month with a focus on diabetes-related organizations (N = 17,659). By employing network analysis methods, we ran Exponential Random Graph Modeling (ERGM) to examine the patterns and structures of communication via three major conversational features of Twitter: retweet, reply, and mention. The findings will shed light on information dissemination process on Twitter: how information is exchanged and communicated among Twitter users through the three conversational features. By taking a health promotion case, the current study provides implications for health organizations in their use of social media platforms in public health promotion efforts.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems
2016-0122,2016,Poster,Convergence or Divergence: Exploring Different Mechanisms Driving NGOs’ Cross-Platform Interorganizational Networks,3,"In the context of rapid proliferation of networking among nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), these organizations today are adopting multiple technology platforms— from organizational websites to networked social media—to communicate alliance relationships to their stakeholders. With the creation of multiplex, cross-platform interorganizational relationships, there is a need to understand (1) whether and how the underlying connection logics (i.e., interorganizational partner choice) may differ across these platforms; and (2) how platform-specific features may relate to the structure of interorganizational networks. Combining institutional theory of organizations and the technology affordance approach, this paper uses the international children’s rights NGO community as a case to examine how NGOs build and communicate alliance relationships across two major online platforms: organizational websites and Twitter, with their offline interorganizational network being the network of comparison. ERGM and descriptive network analysis were used to test three hypothesized connection logics driving the interorganizational network across different technology platforms. Results identified a stronger “rich-gets-richer” tendency in the online interorganizational networks, and geographic proximity turned out as a weaker mechanism shaping organizations’ online network than their offline counterpart.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems

However, SNSs are interesting venues to investigate e-WOM because they show more complex dynamics and behavioral patterns than the ones in early online platforms do. Thus, this study intends to find out social, motivational and external factors of e-WOM in the SNS and how tie strength and message characteristics interact with them, based on the Social Capital Theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model and other concepts.

By adopting communication privacy management theory, we conducted a survey with 526 subjects and examined their privacy management on social network site and the factors and conditions contingent upon which they decide to reveal or retain private information. The results show that people set different privacy boundaries or “layers” for different types of personal information. Information about social identity anddaily life and entertainment tends to be shared more publically on SNS, while personal contact information is kept more private. We identified knowledge of and concern with technology ubiquity and companies’ business strategies using Big Data as the strongest predictors of privacy protection behavior and privacy settings on Social Networking Sites (SNS). Online trust and Facebook intensity also interact with each other and jointly predict privacy concerns.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems
2016-0125,2016,Poster,How the Depth and Breadth of Online Networks Define the Use of Facebook’s Privacy Settings,5,"Social media has made it possible to maintain a variety of relationships online. These relationships range in depth—from weak acquaintances to strong, close ties. Likewise, they range in breadth—from connections with those who are distant and heterogeneous, to those who are proximal and similar to the user. Social media sites like Facebook allows users to manage how they appear to these groups through the use of privacy settings that provide control over information privacy, accessibility privacy, and expressive privacy. The current work examines whether the types of relationships people maintain on Facebook determine their utilization of these privacy settings. Results suggest a determinant role of the tie strength: users protect information privacy based on the closeness and heterogeneity of their online connections, while surprisingly, the use of privacy settings for expressive privacy was contingent only upon network closeness. Implications for the design of usable privacy are discussed.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems

In this study, the centrality measures indicate where a cancer patient is located in the online social network developed in an computer-mediated social support (CMSS) group, which shows the patient’s advantageous position to access valued resources embedded in the social support networks. To that end, we used secondary data from two randomized clinical trials examining the effects of an eHealth system that include CMSS group services. Interpersonal communication networks were established by identifying the referred persons or targets in a message posted in the CMSS group. Out of 243 participants, 117 developed interpersonal relationships. Findings show that a person’s centrality had a positive impact on information competence when the person was included in a low-density network, while it had modest influence for those who located in a high-density group.",To Understand Communication and Social Networks,Information Systems

This study seeks to clarify how merely viewing the interactions of others can meaningfully influence impressions of the source. Specifically, this study explores responsiveness and tailoring as key facets of interactivity. The results indicate that viewing specific types of interactions impact perceptions of interactivity. In addition, there is a significant indirect effect of the source providing responses to existing messages, through participants’ perceptions that they could receive a response, on attitudes toward the source and behavioral intention. There is also a significant indirect effect of the source providing tailored responses to existing messages, through participants’ perceptions that they could receive a tailored response, on assessment of quality of future interactions with the source, attitudes toward the source, and behavioral intention.

This study conceptualized coping and coping styles based on the theoretical perspective of the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP). The reconceptualization was tested and results showed that defensiveness in the Weinberger model and cognitive avoidance in the Krohne model map onto defensive system reactivity and appetitive system reactivity, respectively. This study has the potential to enhance our understanding of variations in coping behavior and the persuasive effect of fear appeal message. It may also help message designers to craft more effective health messages for the different coping style groups.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

Specifically it is thought that aversive system activation (measure here by DSA) rises across the life cycle while appetitive system activation (ASA) falls. Results from a national survey of over 1000 adults support this hypothesis and demonstrate that these differences in motivational activation predict use of news media for surveillance and threat updating and predict preference for new vs. traditional media.,Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

Results suggest that arousal level of stimuli affects time perception with stimuli of higher arousal level judged significantly longer compared to those of the lowest arousal level. Consistent with previous findings, an interaction pattern between valence and arousal was observed. Following motivational activation trajectories, positive and negative stimuli elicited distinct time judgment responses when the level of arousal changed from moderate to high. In sum, the human motivational system modulates cognitive processes and emotional experiences that influence the perceptions of time passage. However, these effects were more salient in short durations and would disappear with 6s duration, a response which also reflects the fast and automatic aspects of the motivational activation system.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

The focus is to critically test of two competing theoretical mechanisms: priming and motivated preparation. Instead of employing technology, masks (Kashian et al., 2012) were used to test the Proteus Effect in two original experiments.

The aim of this experimental research is to derive a better understanding of the inspiring effects of unsuccessful story characters on people’s motivation. We suggest that people in an experimentally induced regulatory state of prevention-focus (i.e., striving to avoid disasters) are most motivated by unsuccessful story characters, because the character illustrates a feared self and also information how to avoid possible failure. In contrast, if people are in a regulatory promotion state (i.e., striving to achieve an ideal self and success), they will only be motivated by a successful story character. As another contribution to research on narrative persuasion, we also expect that the effect of regulatory fit (consistency between people’s and the character’s regulatory state) on motivation will be mediated by transportation.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

Their effects on recipients’ well-being and motivational states, however, received relatively little attention. Building on exemplification theory and social comparison theory, the current study examines effects of student exemplars on readers’ intentions to change their learning behaviors, and studies the role of subjective well-being in this process. Respondents read an article that was manipulated regarding (1) the success of the depicted students (very successful vs. very unsuccessful), (2) gender (male vs. female exemplar), and (3) origin of feedback (self-evaluation vs. from external sources). Findings show that successfulness and origin of feedback affect students’ learning-relevant behavioral intentions, and that these exemplar effects are moderated by respondents’ gender and relationship status. All three dimensions of subjective well-being (positive affect, negative affect, and current life satisfaction) mediated the effect of exemplar successfulness on behavioral intentions.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems
2016-0135,2016,Poster,The Motivated Affective Behavioral System: A Neurocomputational Model of the Complex Psychological Dynamics of Communication,2,"Presented is a neurocomputational model of how motivation drives a complex psychological system to communicate. The Motivated Affective Behavioral System (MABS) fills in the general sketch given by Bowlby (1969) of his behavioral systems meta-theory (of which attachment is one domain). Bowlby’s theory is both an evolutionary and developmental theory in which specialized innate systems become tuned by the environment. MABS is a model of one such system that shows how individual differences arise from experience through self-regulatory processes. MABS specifies the organization of psychological components: a schematic frame (or working model), motivation, and emotion that mediate between different attachment situations and message production. These patterns of experience self-organize from the decision rules of individual psychological components to produce support-seeking, protesting, or dismissive message contents. The model shows how self-regulatory processes respond to uncertainty of interpersonal outcomes and how, over time, these responses can lead to chronic biases in communicating.",Motivated Cognition and Behavior,Information Systems

2016-0137,2016,Poster,Advertising Strategies for Hedonic vs. Utilitarian Brands: The Risk of Omitting Warmth or Competence Dimension,2,"Research has shown that consumers perceive brands, just like people, on two basic dimensions: warmth and competence. As a result, the so-called hedonic brands try to create a pleasant experience for the costumer, thus highlighting the warmth dimension, while utilitarian brands emphasize the competence dimension. Research on the innuendo effect has shown that if a person is described positively only on one dimension, people make negative inferences on the other. In the present study, we are interested in determining if this effect also emerges in the advertising context when a brand is only described on one of the two dimensions. Furthermore, we investigate what differences exist when different types of brands (hedonic vs. utilitarian) are promoted and how this connects with consumers’ attitudes toward these brands. Using a 3x3-experimental design, we find an innuendo effect that is independent of which type of brand is promoted and what dimension is omitted.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

The present research focuses on a previously under-researched advertising strategy to imbue human traits onto a product, namely human product naming. It sheds light on whether and why products that are christened with a human name instigate more positive consumer responses than products with non-human names. In addition, it examines whether the directionality and intensity of these responses is affected by the valence of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on the product. Results from two experiments show that human-named products (vs. non-human named products) have a positive indirect effect on product attitudes through the process of anthro-pomorphism. In addition, the valence of eWOM is demonstrated to weaken (negative eWOM) or strengthen (positive eWOM) this indirect effect.

Results revealed that (a) the third-person perceptions did take place in the context of celebrity endorsed advertising, (b) all three celebrity credibility variables were negatively correlated to advertising skepticism, but only celebrity attractiveness and expertise yielded direct effects, (c) indirect effects by the first-person perceptions were stronger than those by the third-person perceptions on advertising skepticism. Theoretical implications and practical insights were discussed to indicate that Taiwanese consumers did not want to be perceived as celebrity followers for a self-enhancement purpose, but their presumed influence on themselves played a more active role than their presumed influence on others in mediating their perceptions of celebrity credibility and diminishing their skepticism toward celebrity endorsed advertising.",Advertising and Branding,Information Systems

The determining brand-related drivers of this behavior, however, are still largely unexplored. Based on the assumption that consumers publicly engage with branded content in part to communicate their identity to others, recent research found that the main domains of social and brand perception, warmth and competence, are strong predictors of liking brand pages on Facebook. In line with this notion, and analyzing 14,993 Facebook messages and 54,653 tweets of 19 different for- and nonprofit brands, the present study investigates to what extent brands’ warmth and competence predict the financial effort needed to achieve engagement from consumers with branded content.

This study examined how these biological motivators affected responses to food ads. Ads initially portrayed food as very appetizing and ready-to-eat or in packages and not ready-to-eat. The ads also varied in presence of a sexual appeal. In general, results support that unpackaged food is more appetitive overall.

Prior research argued that broad- (sharing with many) and narrowcasting (sharing with one or few) are distinguished by stronger default egocentrism during broadcasting. This leads to self-enhancement driven sharing, which is only replaced by more effortful social cognitions when the situational social complexity is low during narrowcasting. In contrast, social and cognitive neuroscience support a sociocentristic perspective on sharing, where self-related and social cognitions are not mutually exclusive, but co-occur during both narrow- and broadcasting. Narrowcasting should further engage both cognitions more intensively, because smaller audiences allow more in-depth scrutiny of contextual information. Our fMRI data support a sociocentric sharing framework, suggesting more in-depth message processing both in terms of self-relevance and social impact of shared content during narrowcasting. Narrowcasting might thus allow for stronger message effects on sharers and their audiences.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0149,2016,Poster,Neural Mechanisms Associated With Social Influence Predict Social Influence on Driving Risk,9,"Social influence is pervasive throughout life and adolescents are often more susceptible. We tested whether neural regions previously shown to be involved in susceptibility to social influence on recommendation behavior, including reward processing and mentalizing (considering the mental states of others) regions, also predicted social influence on driving risk one week later in a full-cab driving simulator. Results demonstrated that neural activity functionally defined by conformity in the fMRI recommendation task (VS+VMPFC) predicted risky behavior in the presence of a risky peer. In addition, results demonstrated that differences in rTPJ activity, a region commonly associated with mentalizing, was significantly associated with safer behavior in the presence of a safe peer during the driving simulator session. These results provide insight into neural underpinnings of social influence that extend from the fMRI lab to social influence on risk-taking in an important context relevant to real-world life and death decisions.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems

Breaks in presence (BIPs) are an interesting alternative, given that the researcher can assess them correctly. Prior studies on the psychophysiology of BIPs followed an exploratory approach by not providing a cognitive mechanism for BIPs and lacking in external validity. We argue that BIPs can be considered a special form of orienting responses involving both the real and the virtual world. In the first of the presented studies, we investigated, which types of BIPs can be differentiated and to what degree they impact the user experience. In the second study we modified a commercial video game by introducing the previously identified BIPs and recorded psychophysiological measurements. The results are in line with findings on orienting responses und should provide fertile ground for future research.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems
2016-0151,2016,Poster,When Faces Blur the Uncanny Valley: Physiological and Cognitive Responses to Category Conflict,1,"Many scholars and designers have chased the elusive uncanny valley (UV). Mori’s (1970) theory claims that as artificial entities increase in human likeness, people are attracted to them until they reach a tipping point, and are then rejected due to an unsettling feeling of intense discomfort. Some research suggests that instead of affinity and humanness, UV reflect a person’s ability to identity artificial objects (i.e. virtual character). Objects blurring category lines may create mental conflict that engages the autonomic arousal system, and thus strong emotional responses. Participants viewed images from different categories: singular categories (human, animal, and robot) and crossed categories (human-human mixes, human-animal mixes, and human-robot mixes). Preliminary examination of the data suggest that differences exist in how participants physiologically and cognitively respond to the various categories, with high arousal levels associated with mixed categories and higher levels of reported creepiness.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems

In this study event-related potentials (ERP) was measured while 20 Japanese college students looked at emotional pictures selected from the International Picture System (IAPS). In addition heart rate (HR) was measured while they were watching two video clips of positive and negative emotional content. Preliminary results suggest that the affective system reactivity measure (ASA) of MAM has a main effect on ERPs while looking at pictures and the SS measure has a Valence×SS interaction on the same data. When looking at the behavioral measures, SS and BAS explained drinking behavior better than ASA. However, participants’ interest in drug use was only explained by MAM. The importance of understanding relationships of these various individual trait measures with processing and behavioral variables is, on its own important, but even more important is to begin to investigate if results found with American youth generalize to youth of other cultures.",Psychophysiological and Neuroscientific Perspectives in Communication,Information Systems

Evaluative ratings recommend for what age groups particular media is suitable while descriptive ratings illustrate the specific category of detrimental content. However, media ratings are said to instigate an undesirable side effect as they may increase the attractiveness of the media product; the forbidden fruit effect.
An experiment was conducted in order to investigate whether a combination of evaluative and descriptive ratings have a more appealing effect on minors than restricting media with either evaluative or descriptive ratings.
The results clearly signify that neither evaluative ratings nor descriptive ratings increase the perceived attractiveness, whereas personal traits and demographic factors were proven to have an effect.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

In doing so, we first explore the prominent role of agency in the literature on contemporary (participating) audiences. Through a sociologically informed analysis of taste cultures, we explore to what extent contemporary audiences make individually informed choices on media preferences. We thus study insofar structure-informed stratification informs these genre preferences, which in their turn lead to identifiable group preferences. Second, we aim to contribute to the understanding of media consumption in general and film consumption in particular, by studying youth – a group well known to adapt with ease to new technologies. Grounded in a representative sample of 1015 respondents aged 16 to 18, we will argue that research on contemporary media practices can greatly benefit from sociologically informed understanding of consumption.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

In the area of intimate relationship study, romantic attachment style is the primary theoretical framework. Meanwhile, the use of Social Networking Sites is prevailing among college students. And surveillance is found to have potential positive effect on relationship quality. The present study aims to explore the influences of romantic attachment style on relationship quality, and the moderate effect of surveillance during this process from individual and couple level. Study 1: Based on the survey of 320 college students who were in or once had been in a relationship, we found that: (1) two dimensions of romantic attachment, both anxiety and avoidance had negative effects on relationship quality. (2) Surveillance can relieve the decline of relationship quality caused by avoidant attachment, not by anxiety. Study 2: 250 college dating couples were recruited in. By adopting the Actor and Partner Interdependence Model, we found that: (1) for both male and female students, anxiety and avoidance dimensions had negative effects on the partner’s relationship quality. (2) Male’s surveillance on Social Networking Sites had moderate effect during the process of female students’ avoidance predicting relationship quality of male students. Conclusion: (1) Both anxiety and avoidance have negative effects on the self’s and the partner’s perceived relationship quality. (2) Surveillance can alleviate the drop of relationship quality caused by avoidant attachment only. And the compensation for relationship quality that is damaged by the partner is only effective for males.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Aiming to enhance public awareness about the parent-child relationship, Chinese television has produced some entertainment-education programs about the parent-child relationship, of which Babaqunaer (“Dad, where are we going?”) is one. This article analyzes the effect of Babaqunaer using different designs and participants. Two studies were conducted—a longitudinal study using college students as a sample and another using married people with children. Both studies involved audience interaction and media exposure, which are core variables in the mechanism of the entertainment-education effect. The results indicated that 1) the degree of parasocial relationships partly predicted the entertainment-education effect; 2) parasocial relationships will change over time but cannot predict the long-term effect of the entertainment-education program; 3) interpersonal communications related to the entertainment-education program predicted the entertainment-education effect; and 4) for college students, more frequent viewing of the entertainment-education program led to a stronger effect.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This study wants to investigate the personal and social factors that might explain adolescents’ sharing of personal information about school on Facebook. The Theory of Planned behavior was used as a theoretical base, extended by problematic Facebook use, online risk behavior, socio-economic situation and depressive feelings in order to explain the adolescents’ disclosing behavior. Based on a sample of 1359 adolescent, the results show that the normative aspect of self-disclosing behavior explains a significant amount in adolescents’ sharing of personal information about school, but that personal and socio-economic influences might not be neglected. Prevention and intervention strategies towards the safe sharing of information online should thus aim to target not only the adolescents’ at risk, but also the broader social context.","Children, Adolescents, and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Supporting the mobilization hypothesis, rural residents’ use of basic functions of mobile technology helped increase their involvement in information seeking about impending disasters. Individuals’ risk perception and information seeking were significantly directly and indirectly related to preparedness behavior through information sharing. Moreover, the relationships between various predictors -- information seeking, communication with the core network, voluntary participation, and receipt of general social support-- and preparedness behavior were mediated by the receipt of disaster-related tangible social support.

Attribution theory suggests that how we determine the cause may shape our judgment of responsibility, motivation, and policy attitudes. This study tests the mediation model, examining the relationship between media use, attribution to self and a government, risk perceptions, and behavioral intention concerning three epidemic diseases: foot-and-mouth disease, mad cow disease, and H1N1 flu. The nationwide online survey (N = 1,001) revealed that media use increased attribution to self and a government. Also the findings indicated that attribution to a government predicted risk perception and then risk perception increased behavioral intention. Analyzing the mediating relationships in the model, we found that media use had significant indirect effect on behavioral intention when attribution to a government and risk perception as mediators were used. The finding suggests that attribution to a government and risk perception are key mediators in the model.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2016-0183,2016,Poster,Role of Information Seeking and Brand Medication Preference in Prescription Medication Consumption as a Response to Direct to Consumer Advertising,4,"Among the major concerns regarding direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of pharmaceuticals is that it lead consumers to prefer specific brand-name medications over their generic alternatives, thereby increasing medical expenditures. As consumers have been employing more diverse practices of information seeking subsequent to DTCA exposure, this study investigates how different information seeking practices (i.e., professionals-involved and self-directed information seeking) influence the brand-name medication preference and prescription request. To explore this question, consumers’ self-reported exposure and response to DTCA was drawn from the MARS (Multimedia Audience Research Systems) OTC/DTC Pharmaceutical Study of 2013. By using Bayesian estimation, this study shows that (1) DTCA prompts both self-directed and professionals-involved information seeking, (2) the effects of DTCA on brand preference is mediated by information seeking, in which brand-name medication preference was strengthened by information seeking, and (3) in turn, DTCA exposure indirectly increases Rx medication request.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We found that patients’ affective attitudes and injunctive norm were the intervention targets. As a next step we developed messages that target these determinants together and separately to test the combined and single effects on cancer patients’ affective attitudes, injunctive norm and intention. We used a pre-test post-test design with four conditions (attitude message, norm message, combined message, information message).We found time-effects for all the determinants but no differences between the conditions. A second data-collection was conducted to examine whether the time-effect was caused by exposure to a message or a baseline questionnaire. Again we found the time-effect in all conditions. These results indicate that exposure to a baseline questionnaire can already yield differences in patients’ affective attitudes, injunctive norms and intention to express concerns.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Both waves were answered by 965 students from 10 schools (average age is 14.5 years). Separately for cannabis and hard drugs, seven effect variables were measured: positive and negative consequences of use, attitude, intention to use, intention to use when friends use, curiosity, and awareness of the risk of addiction.

Although these perspectives were derived from Western countries, it is important to obtain empirical evidence on how nurses actually use them, especially within the context of an Asian country like the Philippines. In July 2015, a semi-structured interview was conducted among staff nurses (N = 18) working in government and private tertiary hospitals in Metro Manila, Philippines. Results show that SM use is primarily through mobile instant messaging applications and its use serves as a means to achieve information, social and emotional needs.

Although individualizing medical care is not a new concept, precision medicine’s ability to identify diseases early, and to tailor treatments that align with a patient’s genetic characteristics more accurately, promises a substantial improvement over the one-size-fits-all approach often used today. However, the success of precision medicine is reliant upon patient uptake of genetic testing, and recruiting a cohort of demographically diverse patients to develop treatments for a wide selection of patient subgroups. To do so, historically low rates of research participation among minorities must be overcome. Therefore, this study used an online survey to assess current levels of public knowledge, and identify differences in the most salient perceived benefits and harms of precision medicine between African Americans (n=420) and Caucasians (n=420).

Research on the topic shows that expert endorsers are especially effective in enhancing product evaluation and positively affecting purchase intentions. Consequently, when working with celebrity endorsers, a match between product and endorser is most effective for advertising. However, advertising with celebrities bears the risk that their public image might change over time (e.g., through scandals), which in turn might have negative consequences for the endorsed product. This study investigates if negative information about an expert endorser spills over to product evaluations and whether this is dependent on judgments about competence or warmth. Results indicate that negative information about the endorser’s warmth actually increases perceived competence, which in turn is more relevant for product evaluation and purchase intention.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Current discussions on using stereotypes in comedy are in need of empirical research that speaks to its influence on the recipients, most importantly, on members of stigmatized groups. Previous research on stereotype threat suggests that the communication of negative stereotypes leads to an elevated stress response and increased monitoring, resulting in decreased performance and domain disidentification. Sense of humor, however, is supposed to buffer the detrimental influence of stereotype threat. We will present an experimental study examining the effect of gender stereotypic (vs. neutral) comedy material on women’s performance in an intelligence test.

As such, the presence of a negation alters the way individuals process otherwise identical information. Based on this line of research, the present paper presents the results of two experiments that explore how using a negative frame (negation) impacts (1) the extent to which people perceive pro-social behavior to be normative, and (2) the ways in which individuals attribute responsibility of unfortunate circumstances, which can lead to greater or smaller levels of empathy. Consistent with our hypotheses, negations influenced the extent to which participants found pro-environmental behavior to be normative (Study 1) and empathized with a rape victim (Study 2).

We hypothesize that a minimal amount of behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human-computer interaction. Further, in line with results from STEM research on female role models, we assume that especially for female learners a same sex agent will be beneficial. In a 2(student gender)x2(agent gender)x2(rapport behavior yes/no) between subjects design, we investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants’ performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. Female and male participants (N = 128) interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm the expected main effect of rapport.

investigate the potential of social media to support learning. Among the social media platforms, YouTube is a video-sharing website that has been utilized widely for educational use. Yet, knowledge about factors influencing YouTube usage for learning remains limited. This study thus attempted to understand YouTube usage for learning from the social cognitive perspective, which emphasized the interactions among personal, behavioral, and environmental influences. Specifically, this study drew on the social cognitive perspective to investigate the interactions of learning outcome expectations and attitude towards learning on YouTube (person), the social features of YouTube (environment), and prior experience (behavior) and their influence on the usage of YouTube for learning. A survey was designed and administered to 150 YouTube users. The findings of this study revealed several interactions among personal factors, environment, and behavior. First, it was identified that personal factors, in terms of learning outcome expectations and attitude towards learning on YouTube, predicted YouTube usage for learning (person —> behavior). This study also found that the influence from the environment, in terms of the social features of YouTube, would lead to a positive attitude towards learning on YouTube (environment —> person), while the behavioral influence, in terms of prior experience of learning on YouTube, could have an impact on the learning outcome expectations of using YouTube (behavior —> person). The results also indicated that personal factors could act as mediators. Specifically, attitude towards learning on YouTube mediated the influence of social features of YouTube on YouTube usage for learning, while learning outcome expectations mediate the relationship between the prior experience and YouTube usage for learning.

2016-0217,2016,Poster,Effects of Exposure to and Presentation Format of News Reporting Conflicting Scientific Evidence on Perceived Issue Uncertainty,1,"This study investigated the effects of exposure to and presentation format of news reporting conflicting scientific evidence on perceived issue uncertainty. Prior studies have compared conflicting coverage and one-sided coverage in their effect on causing uncertainty and examined effects of conflicting coverage on various perception variables. It is unknown what personal characteristics might determine the effect of conflicting coverage on perceptions. It is also unknown whether presentation format would generate different levels of issue uncertainty. There are at least two formats to present the same conflicting information. First, a single news story reporting two conflicting studies. Second, two news stories with each reporting one of the two studies. An online experiment (N=491) found that prior issue knowledge moderated the effect of exposure to conflicting coverage on perceived issue uncertainty, and perceived issue uncertainty did not differ between the one-story format and the two-story format.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2016-0218,2016,Poster,Gender-Role Portrayals in Television Advertising Across the Globe,3,"Although there are numerous studies on gender-role portrayals in television advertising, comparative designs are clearly lacking. With content analytical data from a total of 13 Asian, American, and European countries, we study the stereotypical depiction of males and females in television advertisements. The sample consists of N = 1,755 ads collected in May 2014. Analyzing the gender of the primary character and voiceover, as well as the age, associated product categories, home- or work setting, and the working role of the primary character, we find that gender stereotypes in TV advertising can be found around the world. A multilevel model further shows that gender stereotypes are independent of a country's gender indices such as Hofstede’s Masculinity Index, GLOBE’s Gender Egalitarianism Index, the Gender-related Development Index, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Global Gender Gap Index. These findings suggest that the role of culture in shaping gender stereotypes in television advertising is smaller than commonly thought.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

In the United States, Hispanic families now make up 17% of the population and have one of the highest poverty rates. This paper examines data from two surveys to describe where Hispanic parents of young children go to for parenting support. Study 1 describes how Hispanic parents seek out parenting advice and information from offline and online sources. Study 2 explores how lower- and middle-income Hispanic parents directly seek out parenting advice and information and indirectly find such support on social networking sites. Results provide descriptive data on how Hispanic families seek and find parenting information, including how the digital divide may impact online opportunities for such social support. This paper has implications for future research and intervention studies that aim to both level the digital divide and support parents in novel, cost effective ways.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Research conducted several years ago using print advertisements indicates that heterosexual audiences, and men, in particular, respond negatively to these advertisements. The present study aimed to investigate if these attitudes persist. To do so we conducted an experiment using audiovisual advertisements—half using same-sex couples and the other half different-sex couples. Dependent variables included purchase intention, positive attitudes toward the advertisement and product and negative attitudes toward the advertisement and product. The use of same-sex couples only significantly affected attitudes of male participants. For male, but not female participants, advertisements featuring same-sex couples were liked less, perceived less positively, and resulted in lower intentions to purchase the product.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Applying Schattschneider’s classic model of interest group political conflict to communication by those who publicly resisted messages debunking the misperception that vaccinations can cause autism offers insight into how misperceptions evolve and survive in public discourse. It also extends the model, establishing its relevance for contemporary forms of political conflict. Faced with debunking, believers socialize conflict, inviting audiences to join the struggle on their side. They alter the debate’s terms such that discussion escapes control by authorities. Resulting political debate is a moving target with changing standards of evidence.

Consistent with the predictions of Intergroup Contact Theory, reliance on direct personal contact was negatively associated with stereotypic beliefs, negative emotions, and support for harmful policies. Reliance on media-based vicarious contact for information about Muslims produced the opposite results. Results revealed that perceptions of Muslims as aggressive and negative emotions towards Muslims mediated the link between contact and support for harmful policies.

beneficial because it substantially reduces the risk of injuries and fatalities.
Consequently, mediated health-communication campaigns (MHCCs) have been used
to promote seat-belt use. Especially, shock appeals that deliberately startle the
audience have often been utilized to gain attention and encourage cognitive
processing. We investigated whether the temporal delay between the shocking event

memorizing. We utilized a 2 (shock tactic: no, yes) x 5 (temporal delay in the
presentation of risk awareness information 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 seconds after the shocking
event) factorial experimental design. A television commercial promoting seat-belt use
among children in rear seats was used as the health communication stimulus. Analysis
indicated that the shocking event improved memory only when the risk awareness

Herein, the current hype of posting selfies on social media is typical, although selfie-behavior is hardly studied. The present study aimed to profile ‘typical’ selfie-makers, and examine the extent to which underlying selfie-related behaviors leading up to actual selfie-posting are interconnected. An exploratory survey profiled ‘typical’ selfie-makers as mainly concerned with the social aspects of selfies (e.g., making selfies with friends and family), while entertainment and retention of moments are main reasons for selfie-taking. Findings further confirmed the newly developed Selfie-Stadium Model which represents various stages of selfie-taking and its underlying motives, as well as selfie-selection and selfie-editing before actual self-presentation through online selfie-posting occurs. This first study on profiling selfie-makers and their selfie-behavior tapped into a new media effects research domain and holds promising implications for future research.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Given the interactive nature of social media environment, we attempted to distinguish social media use from passive exposure to content. Focusing on two types of social media behaviors — profile maintenance and social grooming, we investigated whether these behaviors would be more significantly related to body image than overall exposure. Results indicated that the behaviors of profile maintenance and social grooming were positively associated with body image concerns, and these relationships were found to be more consistent and significant compared to those of mere exposure. The mediating role of appearance comparison was found among both Koreans and Americans, while there were cultural differences in terms of body image concerns and the extent to which people were influenced by social media behaviors.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This paper investigates reading styles and recall of the news from reading ‘E-editions’ and compares them with the printed version. The study aims to theoretically understand the effects of the medium interface (tablet versus paper) on reading style and learning and to provide insight for publishers who are faced with declining circulation and advertising income.
The study (N=90) showed that reading styles in digital editions are comparable to paper versions. Unlike other digital newspaper devices, such as news websites, tablet newspapers were not read in a more fragmented, selective or elaborate manner than their printed counterparts. On average, readers learned less from the E-edition than from the printed version, but the differences were small. The study also showed that ‘digital innovators’ learned more from the tablet newspaper than from the printed newspaper.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This study investigates the effect of a mode tailored health website as compared to non-tailored websites on younger and older adults’ recall of information, employing a 5 (condition: tailored vs. text only, text with illustrations, audiovisual, or combination) × 2 (age group: younger [25 – 45] vs. older [≥ 65] adults) between-subjects experimental design (N = 544). For older adults, mode tailoring increased attention to the website, which consequently improved information recall. For younger adults, mode tailoring had no effect on the attention-recall relationship. Remarkably, younger adults recalled more from non-tailored information such as text only or text with illustrations. Website designers should acknowledge younger and older adults’ different needs for the information delivery mode.",New Opportunities Offered by Media Technologies,Information Systems

The Effects of Collaboration and Competition Among Players of Human Computation Games,3,"Human Computation Games (HCGs) harness human intelligence through enjoyable gameplay to address computational problems that are beyond the power of computer programs but trivial for humans. With the increased use of HCGs in mobile information sharing, collaboration and competition have emerged as the most commonly used game genres. Yet, there is a dearth of research examining the effects of such genres on players’ perceptions. Thus, this study investigates the effects of collaboration and competition on perceived satisfaction of motivational needs and output quality in mobile content sharing HCGs. Using a within-subjects experiment, 160 participants were recruited from two local universities. The findings suggest that the non-game application was perceived to yield better quality output than both HCGs but the latter offered a greater satisfaction of motivational needs which may, in turn, motivate individuals to continue playing them. Taken together, the present findings inform researchers and designers of HCGs and similar contexts that games could serve as a motivator to encourage participation; however, the usefulness of HCGs may be dependent on how one can effectively manage the entertainment-output generation duality of such games. This article concludes by presenting implications, limitations, and future research directions.",New Opportunities Offered by Media Technologies,Information Systems
2016-0238,2016,Poster,The Consequences of One-Way and Two-Way Collaborative Processes in Online Knowledge-Construction Systems,2,"In light of recent developments in content and knowledge generation, we propose the concept of ""one-way collaboration"" to describe processes in which individuals pass their collaborative work from one person to the next rather than engaging in simultaneous discourse with one another. This form of collaboration, which is increasingly exhibited in online environments, offers certain advantages over traditional two-way collaborative interactions that place social pressures and other restrictions upon participants. Collaborative teams may engage in a mixture of one-way and two-way processes, falling along a spectrum between the two dichotomous poles. We intend to investigate the effects of these unique approaches by examining one-way and two-way collaborative processes on Wikipedia.

However, it also possesses new characteristics that can’t be fully explained by extant collective action theory. First, individuals participate in collaborative knowledge production online for social and hedonic reasons with or without private utility gains. Second, individual participants of collaborative knowledge production make personal decisions that are public and interdependent. Third, online collaborative knowledge production networks are systems with blurred boundaries and little top-down organizational structure. Online collaborative knowledge production is thus a system sustained by collective action of a network of geographically dispersed actors, who voluntarily interact through mediated-communication and self-organized collaboration to produce public knowledge goods. A social network perspective that emphasizes social relations and interactions among potential contributors can complement traditional collective action theory in explaining features of collaborative knowledge production online.",New Opportunities Offered by Media Technologies,Information Systems

To ascertain this, the current research simulates a phishing attack on Facebook and examines the extent to which users’ bridging and bonding social capital predicts their likelihood of phishing victimization. Results indicate that users’ bridging social capital in terms of their “network fame,” i.e., the more visible they are and the more sought after they are by others, increases users’ likelihood of victimization.

Loss of self-control resources has been linked to using media to procrastinate at work, and generally higher levels of media use. However, this media use could represent either self-regulatory failure, or attempts at restoring self-control. Self-determination theory proposes that satisfying intrinsic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) aids the recovery of self-control. Media use perceived as satisfying autonomy, competence, or relatedness needs has the potential to repair self-control. A two-wave survey (N = 413) measured self-control capacity at the beginning and the end of participants’ evenings, along with their perceptions of leisure activities. Respondents with more self-control capacity before primetime generally experienced more intrinsic need satisfaction during using television, social media, reading, sports, and socializing.

In doing so, we analyzed a panel of 111 countries examining global Internet bandwidth capacity per 100 population, eigenvector centrality scores in the global Internet network, gross national income (GNI) per capita, domestic Internet users per 100, and knowledge embedded within the economy as measured by economic complexity index (ECI) scores. Taken together, our results suggest that ECI and connection to the global Internet matter for economic performance. These results are consistent with our theoretical perspective that the information content of contemporary economies is growing and that, in turn, this growth is catalyzed by relatively easy access to the global pool of ideas represented on the Internet.",Online Communities and Media Technologies,Information Systems

Especially on the WWW, hundreds of millions of websites compete for audience attention. However, websites with certain “innovative” formats, frequently noted by scholars, journalists and gurus, seem to retain the capacity of exerting global influence across the World Wide Web. Contributing to a burgeoning scholarship on how people engage with this high-choice media environment, our study focuses on digital media infrastructures (especially website formats) and empirically examines their connection to patterns of of global attention online in a holistic manner. To achieve this, we (1) develop a typology for website-level media structures, (2) appropriate network-based measures for capturing various aspects of global online attention, and (3) analyze global web usage data sourced from comScore and examine the evolving status of different website formats in global attention economy.",Online Communities and Media Technologies,Information Systems

Additionally, there is reason to think that that playing a video game with a sexualized female avatar may affect the player differently than simply watching the videogame with the same character. Specifically, interactive performance may increase the likelihood that the content will affect the player. Finally, exposure to sexualized female avatars under conditions of cognitive load may influence the extent to which players are affected by the portrayal. The current study examined how all three variables (sexualization, interactivity, and cognitive load) affect attitudes toward women. A total of 300 undergraduate students participated in a 2 (manipulated cognitive capacity: load, no load) X 2 (characters: sexualized, non-sexualized) X 2 (interactivity: watch, play) between subjects experiment.

Robots could serve as a potential useful partner in practicing public speeches. Results of an experiment demonstrated participants reported significantly higher levels of public speaking anxiety when anticipating being evaluated by a robot rather than another human.

Both dramas highlighted the experiences of “comfort women,” Korean women forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers. This study analyzed the representations, technical factors, and newspaper discourses of each drama to examine how each drama constructed collective memories related to the comfort women issue. By investigating the similarities and differences between the two dramas, this study argues that while collective memory is a construction that can change over time, the media’s role (especially television drama) is critical in this process.

It shows how Hollywood’s well-known role as adjunct to the War Department in WWII has an important precedent in the Great War, during which such legitimation was negotiated. The idea of a film star’s testimonial on behalf of war mobilization was a novel construction because entertainment professionals had no prior government sanction in the public sphere. I chronicle the respective mobilization efforts of both world wars, focusing on the activities and implications of film stars in their off-screen roles as patriotic citizens. Such war work represented a new manner of linking state power with popular culture to regulate national identity. Stardom’s political authority constructed through war mobilization should be seen as both an object and instrument of cultural policy underpinning the governmentalization of social life beyond the exigencies of wartime.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

As it evolved over the 1970s, the Style Section established a distinctive form of narrative journalism that eventually was imitated all across the industry. Far from being a fully developed model at its inception, the Style section came together in a process of trial and error, reflecting contested notions of journalistic values, professional practices and readership expectations.

These contests, therefore, have played key roles in defining journalism’s development as an autonomous field while also evolving alongside historic shifts in journalistic practice. In particular, the agents who oversee and participate in journalism contests represent powerful players who reinforce the doxa of the field. Using data from the 1969, 1998, and 2008 editions of Awards, Honors & Prizes, we examined the ways major journalism awards programs have evolved in three key periods. The resulting analysis sheds light on the key players in journalism awards, including founders, sponsors, judges, and participants, as well as the influence of awards’ geographic areas, scope, and qualifications for entry.

Schalek’s writings and photographs were very popu-lar, but also sharply criticized in some quarters for their alleged lack of objectivity and a tendency to glorify the war. Her most prominent critic was the Austrian writer Karl Kraus, whose negative judgement dominated Schalek’s historical reputation for many decades. Focusing on Scha-lek’s assignments to the Italian front during 1915-1917, this paper looks at the working conditions faced by Schalek as a female war reporter and reconstructs the war images she transmitted to the public through her writings, photographs, and lectures. Moreover, it asks to which extent Schalek’s work reflects a female perspective on the war.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Among many emerging advertising practices, data-driven real-time bidding advertising (or RTB advertising) has attracted a lot of attention.
The process of RTB advertising refers to a new approach to sell advertising inventory on the network by targeting right audience and assigning each impression to the viewer. However, in order for this data-driven practice to function properly, the collection and analysis of massive consumer behavioral data are indispensable. Nevertheless, these often applauded Big Data and consumer analytics practices have severe ramifications for consumer privacy. This study explores emerging regulatory and policy issues to better understand the potential impacts of Big Data, consumer analytics, and RTB advertising on consumer privacy in a growing data-driven economy.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2016-0264,2016,Poster,The Demise of Communication Policy: The Case of WHUT's Fight for Survival,2,"WHUT is the only Black owned public television station existing in the United States and it currently faces the risk of being sold. WHUT is housed on the campus of Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, District of Columbia. This station provides programming geared towards a Black audience and also serves as a forum for undergraduate students within Howard’s School of Communications to develop their skills as future electronic media professionals.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the rise and the demise of minority owned TV stations in the United States since the “Ultravision rule” of 1965, implemented by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). According to the Multicultural Media, Television and Internet Council, “the Ultravision Rule imposed overly stringent financial qualifications on new broadcast applicants.” This had a direct impact on Black ownership, which made it so that those who had the power to communicate would be the wealthiest applicants who could afford to run their operations; thus, setting up Black and other minority owners for failure. This rule established a precedent that made space for not only the commodification of information, but also a space for the hegemonic ruling of the broadcast industry.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This paper explores the two aims of open data policy – transparency and economic growth – and how these policy aims are being served in practice. Through an analysis of the use of open data by over 100 businesses in the United States, this paper illustrates how open data policies are being built to serve private interests over public, and highlights the potential ramifications of relying on industry to serve as an interface for publicly available information. This paper holds that open data policies must be implemented with a greater vision of ‘openness,’ and include within them a plan to bridge the financial and technical divides that work to make open data inaccessible to a majority of citizens.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

While heightened levels of policing block public and private sites to the movement, the activists take advantage of the ambiguity in a special category of space, privately owned public space (POPS), and appropriate it as its site of contention. After the taking over, OWS transforms the spatial rules and repurposes the space for political claim making. Yet, unsympathetic public opinion, intensifying policing and surveillance, as well as unfavorable court rulings privileging property over speech block the possible spatial structural transformation. As privatization of space gets intensified both in the US and worldwide, this study anticipates to offer some insights on the possibility of reversing this trend through social movements.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Widely framed as “the Republican Obama,” Rubio was considered a potential candidate for vice-president in the 2012 election and, in the last three years, as a presumptive and now actual 2016 presidential candidate. This essay analyzes such news discourses, including comparisons between Rubio and Obama and discussion about Rubio’s potential to appeal to Hispanic/Latin@ voters and to be the first Hispanic/Latino vice-president or president. In particular, the essay focuses on the ways that race/ethnicity, Latin@ identity, and the presidency are constructed.

In consideration of these distinct encounters, I used reports of critical incidents experienced by multiethnic/racial individuals to qualitatively analyze recalled interactions that were perceived by participants to have led to marked understandings of self in terms of their ethnicity or race. Participant reports indicated five supra-types of critical incidents that informed processes of meaning-making across five discernible stages of identity development.

Biographers have to negotiate between an unknown subject and a far-too-well-known subject in the Victorian time. Ada is the Eccentric Victorian Woman who was either a Genius or a Wreck in biographies. When she failed, she failed as a scientist; when she was praised, she was praised as a woman scientist. While fictional account based on Ada's life has the potential to unfix gender relation and to unsettle gender difference, the Ada character in films and literary work is even less complex: she is seen as a childless, unmarried woman.

2016-0287,2016,Poster,Networked News Time: How Slow—or Fast—Do Publics Need News to Be?,1,"What kind of news time does a public need? The production, circulation, and interpretation of news have always followed timelines and rhythms, but these have largely been seen as artifacts of press sociology, not central aspects of journalism’s public mission linked to the design and deployment of journalism infrastructure. Motivated by the temporal needs of one type of public (a pragmatic public that ensures a public right to hear), this paper proposes a unit for studying news time (the temporal assemblage), and traces it across four intertwined sites in the contemporary, networked press: labor routines, platform rhythms, computational algorithms, and legal regulations. Beyond this essay’s investigation of this public in relation to these dynamics, my aim is to contribute to the emerging ""slow journalism"" movement by asking how slow—or fast—do different publics need news to be? And how are networked press paces set?",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study draws on four complementary sets of data to explore this disparity and the reasons behind it. The authors argue that the disproportion stems not from a lack of able and available female experts but rather from a combination of journalists’ news production processes and women’s perceptions of appropriate social norms and roles. A high proportion of woman experts surveyed lack confidence, saying they fear they will be perceived as self-promoting and “pushy” for wanting to appear on air. And broadcast journalists report women need to be persuaded and wooed, acting like “princesses” and therefore making male experts less trouble to recruit.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Two research methods, intensive interviews and a nationwide telephone survey, were employed to collect data for this study, and the telephone survey resulted in 1002 valid telephone calls. This study found that Yahoo news did not produce its own news, but it was perceived by the respondents to be equivalent to television news and that the respondents perceived the strengths of Yahoo news and television news to be very different. Therefore, this study predicts that the two media would be able to coexist in Taiwan’s news media market.

However, it remains largely unclear whether specifically valenced reader comments affect a reader’s perception of a company, respectively, an individual actor (allegedly) involved in a mediated scandal. An online experiment showed substantial effects of valenced reader comments on a recipient’s perception and evaluation of a mediated food scandal, a scandalized company as well as a scandalized manager (e.g., understanding of a mediated scandal, demand for punishment of a company/scandalized individual).

Besides tabloidization, an opposed strategy to react to these challenges is to strengthen the articles’ quality. Data journalism – involving data gathering, analysis and presentation – can be understood as such a quality strategy. However, no study has yet investigated the effect of the data journalistic presentation.
Hence, our study refers to journalism studies, persuasion and entertainment research to predict the impact of data journalistic presentation on reading experience and credibility assessment. An experiment was conducted to observe the influence of the amount of numerical evidence and the kind of visualization. Our findings indicate mixed effects of the data journalistic presentation. Whereas a higher amount of numerical evidence seems to constitute a barrier for the cognitive accessibility to the article, a higher elaborated visualization improved the credibility assessment.

The results show that the “new media” discourse demonstrated a trend of rise and became another dominant discourse besides the “ideal” discourse. The production of the ""ideal"" discourse lies in the dichotomy of “ideal” and “reality”, as well as the conflict between ""past"" and ""present"". Collective memories of the Republican China, 1980s, and “golden age” of Chinese journalism industry, as well as personal experiences are strategically utilized as symbolic resources to produce the myth of “ideal”. On the other hand, the ""new media"" discourse mainly relies on the dichotomy of ""new media"" and ""traditional media"", as well as on the tension between “future” and “present”. Journalists strategically construct the myth of ""new media"" or ""traditional media"" based on their senses of positions in the journalistic field to legitimate their choices over career change. Along with the dramatic transition happening in Chinese journalism industry, the ""ideal"" discourse and the ""new media"" discourse tend to contest over meanings and jointly form a hybrid discursive web and power relations among Chinese journalists within the multiple contexts of ""past"", ""present"" and ""future"".",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

When large quantities of negative messages against an organization or person suddenly spread in social media we speak of an online firestorm. By covering the online outcry journalists bring it to the attention of a potentially much larger audience. We used content analysis to explore how journalists working for German-language media cover this phenomenon. Based on a typology of online firestorms we find that the majority of cases address events of perceived moral misconduct. Vilification of an organization or person appeared in a much smaller number of covered firestorms. Thus, journalistic coverage of online firestorms focuses on the rectification attempts of an aroused public.

In experiment one, 80 participants viewed manipulated news stories measured as high and low on satire, while in experiment two, 64 participants viewed manipulated satirical stories with high-reputable and low-reputable sources from entertainment and science news. Results show believability is different across news types.

As national policy shifted from class struggle to economic reform, the Chinese media, including its advertising, contributed to this reorientation since 1979, when China began advertising practices, and after 1992, when it instituted its form of market economy. This study explores the dynamics between China’s advertising and economy in the context of various economic factors and time periods. It was found that consumption, industrialization, and economic openness positively predicted ad spending, and advertising moved in the same direction as economy in China. Furthermore, the elasticity of advertising to economy is greater after China transitioned to a market economy in 1992, while the relationship between print advertising and economy is stronger than that of broadcast advertising and economy.",Media Industry Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Scholars have argued that simulacra experience should be discriminated from that of photography. This research aims to object it by adopting theories of Barthes and Deleuze. Barthes’s concept of punctum explicates the distinctive sensation a viewer achieves from an encounter with a photograph. This research proposes that a feeling equivalent to punctum can be sensed in simulacra experience. In order to define it, this research traces the phenomenological influences on Barthes’s works and re-reads punctum, concentrating on the conditions of noeme and l’air. Simultaneously, Deleuzian concept of affect is introduced as a modality for understanding human interactions with simulacra image. Adopting Deleuzian interpretation, the virtuality of l’air is illuminated as it is an essence within actuality. From Deleuzian reading on self-referential characteristic of simulacra, this research reveals that simulacra have no difference from photography. Ergo, this research discovers a sensation that encompasses both facets of punctum and affect, proposing it as ‘Punctum-Affect’.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Two theories frequently used by researchers are narrative transportation and character identification. Although researchers use these concepts as explanatory mechanisms in narrative communication, they have been found by many scholars to be under-defined, overlapping, and at times at odds with each other. This essay elucidates both narrative transportation and character identification, and raises a proposition to clarify the ambiguity in the field. First, existing literature is used to develop conceptual and operational definitions for narrative transportation and identification. Second, an inside/outside story perspective in understanding involvement constructs is proposed as opposed to a narrative/character involvement distinction. Lastly, a higher-order concept termed “narrative experience” is proposed and explicated.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In other words, media may allow one to cultivate a cosmopolitan capital. However, far from everyone is recognizing this potential. This study argues that cos-mopolitan ‘readings’ of the contemporary media landscape should be understood in relation to cultural capital. Analyses from a national survey and in-depth interviews, conducted in Sweden, disclose a tendency among those in possession of cultural capital to recognize and exploit cos-mopolitan capital in their media practices. Those in dispossession of cultural capital are signifi-cantly less prone to approach the media in this way. Relying on various media practices in order to exchange one capital for another exemplifies what Bourdieu called reconversion strategies. As social fields become more global, media offer opportunities for those occupying positions of rela-tive (cultural) privilege to remain privileged – to change in order to conserve.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In my response, I mobilise the interpretative focus afforded by a set of concepts around meaning and interpretation from the literary hermeneutics of Wolfgang Iser and Hans Robert Jauss. I identify the richness, challenges and possibilities of hermeneutic theory in making sense of interpretive work with the internet, and the continuing need for audience researchers, indeed media researchers, to address an unanswered critique that hermeneutic theory faces – the apparent absence of critique in hermeneutic theory, and its seeming tendency to escape from politics into the world of phenomenology.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Evidence has grown that predispositions and social contexts affect how facts are retained and perceived, and the availability of information in the contemporary media environment may exacerbate these biases. We reexamine political knowledge from the bottom up. We look at what citizens themselves treat as relevant to the task of understanding public affairs, and how they use this information. We draw upon our research in two different projects involving observation of political talk to do so. We observe that people give preferential treatment to personal experience. Our results suggest that facts usually used to test political knowledge may not be most appropriate for gauging civic competence. By focusing instead on understanding how experiential knowledge informs people’s political perspectives, we offer an alternative to the Jeffersonian model that expects good citizens to simply be highly informed about political facts.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The Conservative government of Canada’s appeal to coherence, to defend their amalgamation of foreign trade and development priorities, is used to investigate this question. Identified as circular reasoning and connoting objections as incoherent, the myth presented in ‘coherence’ is rejected as a legitimate defense for democratic decision-making. This communication frame morally preempts critical thinking and thereby makes specific types of critical public engagement taboo. The reliance on myth demonstrates how power makers distance their selves from those they govern as reasonable objections to policies are confined by the scope of the stated rational.

However, we will look at the other end of the spectrum - the anti-fans, or haters – an often-neglected segment in audience and reception studies. Apart from being famous, Xiaxue is also infamous. Her liberal use of digital photo editing, straightforward personality and “no holds barred” style of communication, among other reasons, have made her a target for haters. These anti-fans, people who strongly dislike Xiaxue, can be just as engaged and organised as fans, albeit in different ways. Their actions against Xiaxue range from online flaming, to entire forum boards dedicated to loathing her. Using user comments on Xiaxue’s online video channel Xiaxue’s Guide to Life, and anti-fan platform Guru Gossip’s Abhorred Bloggers (Xiaxue) forum as texts, this chapter will analyze how anti-fans read and construct the image of this celebrity blogger. Findings show that her anti-fandom is driven by a moral economy related to her self-presentation, femininity and nature of her celebrity.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2016-0321,2016,Poster,Binge-Watching Motivates Change: How the Uses and Gratifications of Streaming Video Viewers are Challenging Traditional Audience Research,2,"In this paper we explore how binge-watching is changing the ways viewers understand and interact with television. We propose that the motives and rituals of binge-watchers can be used to expand uses and gratifications (U&G) theory. We conducted qualitative audience interviews to understand how and why people binge-watch, and how they feel about binge-watching. The findings indicate that 1) audiences’ motivations for binge-watching are: catching up, relaxation, sense of completion, cultural inclusion, and improved viewing experience; 2) the portability and navigability of streaming video technology influence binge-watching rituals; and 3) audiences are ambivalent about their binge-watching. We propose that a viewer attentiveness spectrum (VAS) is a more accurate descriptor of contemporary TV watching than the passive/active dichotomy. We further argue that the changing motives and rituals of TV audiences can be used to bolster the quantitative surveys often employed in U&G research and to address the lingering criticisms of U&G theory.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This paper approaches the Ilbe community’s peculiar culture and conventions based on Hebdige’s subculture theory (1979) and Bourdieu’s concepts of social distinction and social space (1984; 1989). This study finds several recurring themes and sentiments that are shared widely within the group. Also, beneath these ill feelings towards others, the Ilbe community shares particular norms among its members. This research suggests that anonymous online communities, like that of Ilbe, need to be understood as a special form of the subculture that reflects Millennials’ insecure social position and frustration about the future.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In this article, we engage in a discussion about the symbolic functions of humor for members of co-cultural groups, particularly Spanish gay youth. We approach this discussion through a rhetorical analysis of the five most popular videos that Spanish Queens shared by in 2012 and 2013. Spanish Queens is a collaborative YouTube channel where LGBTQ youth from diverse parts of the country share their experiences, thoughts, and opinions about being queer in Spain. SQ video bloggers (“vloggers” hereto) often used verbal and tonal cues to emphasize the humorous nature of their videos. The main verbal cue was a disclaimer- sometimes also presented in writing- warning audiences that what vloggers said in their videos was not to be taken seriously. When not stated explicitly, humorous disclaimers often through alteration of vlogger’s voice.
Vloggers often used double speech to address, and sometimes challenge: 1) Stereotypes, often by repeating them; and 2) Exclusionary and marginalizing discourses by calling them out. The use of double speech, however, does not seem to come without a cost. In the case of SQ videos, challenging stereotypes and dominant discourses not only poses the threat of perpetuating those addressed, but, the discourse in SQ videos also often reaffirms other stereotypes and normative ideas of gender and, sometimes as a consequence, further exclude certain members of the community.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Televised documentaries of pregnant transmen, by definition, confront this link and undermine the dependence of gender identity upon confirmation of certain anatomical sex differences. This essay provides a close reading of episodes of three documentary television series, the 20/20 special, “Journey of a Pregnant Man” Discovery Health’s Transgendered and Pregnant (2009), and ITV/Channel 4’s Bodyshock: “Dad’s Having A Baby” (2011), which focus on the pregnancy of a transgender man to argue that a visual medium can affirm the possibility of opting out of the body/sex/gender equation.

2016-0326,2016,Poster,What is Objectification Without Sex? A Reading of Sexual and Nonsexual Objectification in Preteen-Popular TV Shows,2,"Analyzing objectifying narratives of a number of prime time television shows popular with preteens, this paper redresses the reduction of objectification to sexual objectification. Results show that non-sexual objectification is much more prevalent than sexual objectification. Additionally, rather than existing in a binary, many objectifying acts fall somewhere on a continuum between the sexual and the non-sexual. Opening up the research perspective to include non-sexual objectification creates room to interpret more subtle forms of objectification that have a gendered undercurrent. Finally, it is shown that context is key in studying objectification in media content. Narratives can either maintain gendered power imbalances through the continued, banal use of male-on-female objectification as a plot device, or deconstruct them by explicitly contextualizing objectification as a problem, leaving very different impressions for the viewer. This indicates that studying media objectification by simply counting occurrences does not adequately represent the genre-related nuances of objectification narratives.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The different forms of capital are used as the theoretical framework of the analysis. This study shows that the impartment of visual competence empowers the mentally ill by increasing their cultural capital. At the individual level, visual competence transforms into social capital through changes in the participants’ lifestyle.

2016-0330,2016,Poster,Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Japanese Manga Culture: A Preliminary Analysis,2,"The past two decades have witnessed an exponential growth in visual representations of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in popular culture. Among many visual forms, manga, Japanese comics, is one of the fastest growing yet under-examined mass media that contributes greatly to the increasing visibility of NSSI in Japan. This preliminary study analyzes 15 manga with 17 self-injuring characters published between 2000-2015 to interrogate how NSSI experiences are portrayed. Findings indicate that NSSI characters closely reflect stereotypical perception of the “self-injurer” as a young female wrist-cutter. For many of these characters, NSSI serves as a coping mechanism to alleviate negative emotion or overcome dissociation. Yet, we also identify an emergent trend among recent manga for male readers to label women who self-injure as “menhera,” mentally unstable and attractive young girls. We argue that this framing may downplay underlying causes of NSSI and instead invite a fetishistic gaze on the self-injured female body.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

2016-0333,2016,Poster,Threat Appeals: The Fear-Persuasion Relationship is Linear and Curvilinear,3,"Drive theory, developed by Hovland, Janis, and Kelley (1953), may be seen as the first scientific theory of health and risk communication. But, its prediction of a curvilinear association between fear and persuasion is generally held to be incorrect. A close rereading of the Hovland et al. paper revealed that within- and between-persons processes were conflated. Using a message that advocated obtaining a screening for colonoscopy, this study (N = 259) tested both forms of the inverted-U hypothesis. In the between-persons data, the results replicated the linear effect in observed in earlier investigations. But, the data showed an inverted-U relationship in within-persons data. Hence, the relationship between fear and persuasion is linear or curvilinear depending on the level of analysis. There was no indication that affect orientation moderated the fear-persuasion association in either form of the data.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

One standard method of tailoring is to use a character who is similar to the target audience, so that the message is perceived as more engaging and effective. However, objective character-audience similarity is only one gateway to perceived similarity, and the sources of perceived similarity are diverse. If the audience does not see the shared characteristics as important or fails to recognize the similarity, then the tailoring strategy may not succeed. We examined the effect of objective and perceived similarity between audience members (i.e., study participants) and smoker characters shown in anti-smoking messages, as well as the moderating role of character ambiguity. Objective similarity does not exert direct effect on message effectiveness, but indirectly affects key outcome variables via perceived similarity.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

This investigation examined the influence of age on consumers’ responses to different advertising messages via two experiments. Study 1 showed that older consumers preferred experiential purchase whereas younger consumers preferred material purchase. Study 2 extended study 1 by examining if framing the message as ordinary or extraordinary would influence the findings. The results suggested that message framing moderated the relationship between age and purchase types such that younger participants displayed stronger purchase intention when the experiential purchase used an extraordinary frame, whereas older people preferred experiential purchase especially when it was presented in ordinary frame. Furthermore, it supported the proposition that self-brand connections mediated the relationship between purchase type and purchase intention.

Abstract

Attitudes toward objects and persons are often measured using the summative model (Fishbein, 1967). The model holds that a person’s attitude (A) can be calculated from the formula, A = ∑ (b * e), where b = the perceived likelihood a belief is true and e = the evaluation of a belief. How variations in belief accessibility affect the attitude is not fully understood. In the current study, participants listed their beliefs about one of three candidates in the 2008 presidential election. Contrary to hypothesis, the ability of the summative model to predict an independent measure of attitude toward the candidate was not improved by taking into account the frequency (f) with which each listed belief was thought about. The study also asked whether beliefs listed early in the list or last in the list were stronger predictors of an independent measure of attitude toward the candidate.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

To test the hypothesis, participants conducted a speeded categorization task (“I like” or “I don’t like”) on 75 images that contained varying ratios of positive/negative emotional content, ranging from completely positive to more positive than negative, equally positive and negative, more negative than positive, and completely negative. Each valence combination contained food and non-food images. Equally positive and negative images were categorized the slowest mimicking a ""freeze"" effect described in the defense cascade model. Images with primary motivators were categorized faster than images with secondary motivators. These findings support our hypothesis of implicit attitudes as expressions of directional motivated behavioral response.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

Based on the dynamic human-centered communication system theory, implicit measures of attitude assess the initial motivational activation elicited by an object, and explicit attitude measures assess an attitude that incorporates the initial motivational activation with the later on deliberative processing. The current study proposes that when the motivational relevance of an object is strong, the elicited motivational activation will be hard for conscious brain to suppress. Therefore, people should have more consistent explicit and implicit attitudes towards the object with high motivational relevance. The hypothesis is tested and supported in the current study design. The implications of the result for persuasion studies are discussed.","Cognition, Attitude, and Persuasion",Information Systems

Audiences reported more positive attitudes with more positive heuristic cues and stronger argument qualities depending on their involvement conditions; however, interaction effects are inconsistent with the models’ predictions.

While this strategy may increase their likeability, research suggests that an increase on this dimension is often accompanied by a decrease in perceived competence. A possible strategy to counteract this “innuendo effect” might be to use pop culture references that explicitly include a political context, thus addressing the competence dimension as well. The present study tested this assumption by conducting an online experiment in which participants read an interview with a politician who claimed to watch a popular TV series, either stressing a political context or not. Results showed that the politician was indeed perceived more likeable and less competent when referring to an up-to-date TV series without a political context; however, referring to a political series can counteract this effect to some extent.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems

However, time affluence was positively related to political knowledge and this relationship was mediated by political media use. Similarly, information seeking self-efficacy predicted political knowledge through an increase in political media use.

2016-0355,2016,Poster,Temporal/Spatial Abuse in Online News Flow and Credibility,2,"This study examines how the repetitive news publishing on the Internet has changed our evaluation of credibility of the press and the news aggregators. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the Internet have accelerated repetitive publishing of almost identical news content with different headlines in order to attract online traffic. Based on a nationwide survey involving 1,000 citizens, we found a statistically significant association of repetitive news with age, education, motives for using portals, and reliance on portals for news. We also found that, through hierarchical regression analyses, repetitive news block was the strongest and negative predictor of the press and portal credibility. The more frequently one was exposed to repetitive news and the more seriously one perceived it as being problematic, the less likely they were to regard the press and portals as credible. These results have implications for online news flow and credibility research.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems
2016-0356,2016,Poster,How New Is the Millennial News Landscape? Exploring the Generational Divide in Digital News Consumption,3,"Using comScore data on digital news consumption this study seeks to address the following research questions: 1) What types of websites play a central role in the digital news networks of young and older adults? 2) Do different clusters of websites compose the digital news networks of young adults and older adults? We employ an innovative analytical approach to construct network maps of digital news use. These “digital news usage networks”, when constructed separately for different age groups, reveal to what extent young people’s news usage on the Internet differs from older generations that were socialized into the pre-digital media environment. Ultimately, this study contributes to the knowledge on digital citizenship by addressing the heated issue of how young adults get news online through our use of high-quality data, an improved methodology, and a novel analytical approach.",Processing Political and News Information in an Age of Entertainment and Overload,Information Systems
2016-0357,2016,Poster,Permanently Online and Permanently Procrastinating? The Mediating Role of Internet Use for the Effects of Trait Procrastination on Psychological Well-Being,9,"Initial evidence suggests that online media are frequently used, but psychologically detrimental ‘tools for procrastination’. The present study thus investigated the relationship between trait procrastination, Internet use, and psychological well-being in a representative sample of N = 1,577 German Internet Users. The results revealed that trait procrastination was associated with an increased use of entertaining online content as well as impaired control over Internet use. As a result, individuals high in trait procrastination showed a higher risk of experiencing negative consequence of Internet use in other life domains. These negative repercussions of insufficiently self-regulated Internet use partially accounted for the detrimental effects of trait procrastination on stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings clearly underline the role of Internet use as an instrument for dysfunctional task delay. The implications of the results are discussed with regard to research on media use and self-control in general and procrastinatory media use in specific.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems
2016-0358,2016,Poster,Stressed by Smartphone Use? The Interplay of Motivation and Mindfulness During Instant Messaging,2,"The number of smartphone users worldwide is rapidly rising. However, there are only few and contradictory scientific findings about the users’ well-being in the context of smartphone use. The most popular applications are instant messengers (IM). Our study aims to understand under which conditions IM is related to stress. Based on Self-Determination Theory, we assumed that an autonomous motivation to use IM is associated with less stress. Furthermore, inferred from research on the relationship of mindfulness with well-being, we suspected a negative relationship between mindfulness during IM and stress. Finally, we hypothesized that a day-specific mindfulness might indirectly reduce stress by empowering people to use their devices more autonomously. We conducted a diary study with 211 participants who answered 868 short questionnaires on five consecutive days. The results of regression analyses supported our assumptions. We discuss implications of our findings and further methods of analyses.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Using structural equation modeling, we tested a two-step model that investigates (1) the extent to which adolescents’ need to belong and need for popularity were associated with an increased Facebook use, through fear of missing out and (2) the extent to which adolescents’ fear of missing out was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use, through an increased Facebook use. Adolescents (N = 402) completed paper-and-pencil surveys. Results indicated that adolescents’ need to belong and need for popularity were associated with an increased Facebook use through an increased fear of missing out. Fear of missing out, in turn, was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use through Facebook use. These results emphasize the role that fear of missing out plays in adolescents’ lives.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

However, little is known about whether app users are aware of and concerned about the data collection and usage practices of apps, whether they perceive themselves able to protect their privacy, and whether they actually engage in privacy protection. This study assesses app users’ current status of privacy knowledge, concerns, self-efficacy, and protection behavior, by surveying 1.593 app users about the 12 most popular mobile apps in a Western European country. The results demonstrated that app users know little about the data collection and usage practices of apps and that they are not very concerned about their privacy. Moreover, app users did not feel able to protect their privacy in apps and they did not engage much in privacy protection. Comparisons between apps and between differently concerned users showed that levels of privacy knowledge, concern, self-efficacy, and protection behavior may vary per app and per privacy-concerned segment.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

As predicted, high self-monitors were more likely to write about all four types of information typically posted on Facebook (location, action, social, and personal information) than low self-monitors. As the same time, high self-monitors were more concerned about authoritative figures and marketers finding their information on Facebook than low self-monitors. In addition to self-monitoring, different types of privacy concerns were associated with users’ likelihood of posting various types of information on Facebook: Concern for marketers had a negative influence on posting location information and concern for authoritative figures had a positive effect on posting what they are doing and whom they are with.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems
2016-0362,2016,Poster,Primacy and Recency Effects of Positive and Negative Cues About Online Privacy,2,"This study aims to understand the underlying psychological mechanisms of users’ disclosing behavior in media technology use by identifying factors that either facilitate or prevent the disclosure of personal information. In particular, this study investigates how the positive (i.e., site seals) and negative interface cues (suspicious download advertisements) drive users’ attitudinal changes and decision-making regarding information disclosure, and whether the position of cues on Websites matter. It employed a 3 (first order: no cue vs. positive cue vs. negative cue) x 3 (second order: no cue vs. positive cue vs. negative cue) fully-crossed factorial between-participants online experiment (N = 146). The results show the primacy effect of a negative cue, indicating that when people evaluate a Web site, they are more likely to be influenced by first impressions formed by the presence of a negative cue.

2016-0363,2016,Poster,Processing Online Privacy: Which Heuristics Matter Most?,2,"Internet users leave their digital footprints on myriad information systems each day, ranging from posting their locations on social media to conducting online transactions on shopping sites. Yet, it is still unclear how they assess the security of online systems and reveal their private information online. Some scholars presume that users carefully evaluate the benefits and risks of information disclosure, following a “privacy calculus.” However, other scholars question this proposition and claim that users are driven by cues in the interaction context, which trigger cognitive heuristics about the safety and security of specific online transactions. This study examines 18 potential heuristics via a scenario-based survey of a representative sample of US nationals (N=786) in order to identify those that most strongly predict online information disclosure. First-cut analyses of data reveal that heuristics relating to sense of community and self-presentation promote disclosure whereas those pertaining to mobility inhibit disclosure.",Emerging Problems Associated With Media Use,Information Systems

Building on exemplification theory, social comparison theory, and the intersectionality hypothesis, the current study investigates if exemplar characteristics alter recipients’ general stigma-related attitudes towards individuals with a disability, and examines the role of recipient characteristics as moderators of the proposed relationships. Respondents read an article about an individual with a disability before completing a questionnaire that assessed five facets of stigmatization. Articles were manipulated regarding the gender, type of disability, immigration background, and sexual orientation of the depicted exemplar. Results support the assumption that exemplar characteristics affect readers’ general attitudes towards social groups, and that recipient variables play an important role in this process.

We introduce Newsflow: an R package for analyzing content homogeneity and diffusion patterns using computational text analysis. The content of news messages is compared using techniques from the field of information retrieval---similar to plagiarism detection. By using a sliding window approach to only compare messages within a given time distance, it is made easy to compare many sources over long periods of time. Furthermore, the package introduces an approach for analyzing the news similarity data as a network, and includes various functions to analyze and visualize this network.",Innovative Approaches and New Measures,Information Systems

Selective exposure is largely considered to be the result of psychological biases for worldview-congruent information, whereas filter bubbles are primarily used to describe how content recommendation accounts for previously revealed preferences. However, it is the nature of modern recommendation systems to incorporate further information beyond revealed preferences. We present a study to identify the extent to which filter bubbles can encourage selective exposure relying solely on manipulating one's reported location to a search engine.",Innovative Approaches and New Measures,Information Systems
2016-0367,2016,Poster,Determining Political Text Complexity: An Analysis of Measures and Applications,2,"Language is the medium that communicates politics to people. Political texts (whether a political speech, a news column, or a press-release) vary in their use of language. The variation is not simply in content, but also in the structure of language. Recent studies found that e.g., newspapers differ in linguistic complexity across genres, or that the complexity of political texts decrease with time. Previous research has shown that political text complexity has a direct impact on the ability to process and acquire political information, and therefore on the politics as a whole. However the measures used to operationalise complexity are different across the studies implementing them. This study proposes to analyse whether various complexity metrics are measuring the same construct and develop an automated content analysis method to determine the complexity of political texts, and to test this method practically applying it to a sample of political newspapers.",Innovative Approaches and New Measures,Information Systems

With this purpose, the present research relates to the recent rise of entertainment research, embracing more and more contexts in which entertainment with media products may occur. At the same time, it addresses a methodological issue which has rarely been addressed in communication research (cf. Kühne, 2013). Focusing on two of the most often used measurement instruments in entertainment research and on three different media formats (political talk shows, comedies, and dramas), the study finds evidence for configural, metric, and scalar invariance for at least one scale.

2016-0370,2016,Poster,Towards a Preliminary Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Dissonance for Communication Research,2,"Individuals’ motivation for information selection and processing alters after making a decision (Fischer & Greitemeyer, 2010). Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; Festinger, 1964), individuals may experience cognitive dissonance after they make an important decision. Cognitive dissonance leads to the re-appraisal of both attitudes and behavior (e.g., previous decision), and possible reversal of behavior through regret (Das & Kerr, 2010). Accordingly, communication messages differ in their effect depending on whether they were received pre-decisionally versus post-decisionally. This study empirically validates a preliminary measure of cognitive dissonance for the purpose of communication research. Based on factor analysis (N = 204), the proposed shortened scale synthesizes six multidimensional measures from extent literature in psychology, advertising, and consumer behavior. The short form validated the test-retest reliability after participants selected messages in an experimental context designed to induce cognitive dissonance. The scale has clear applications in the field to identify the extent to which individuals may select messages differentially as a result of experiencing cognitive dissonance after a decision.",Innovative Approaches and New Measures,Information Systems

Participants from the U.S. and Germany were induced with a positive or negative mood prior to reading a persuasive call for blood donations. The study uses the thought-listing technique and introduced a new coding procedure for thought listings to measure the concrete or abstract construal level of media users. Results show that individuals in a positive mood (vs. a negative mood) and from with collectivistic cultural background (vs. individualistic) show more positive attitudes, report stronger intentions to act, an judge blood donation to be more relevant, partially because the participants showed a more abstract construal of the blood donation message.

The present study uses M3D as a frame of reference for reviewing computer and information science studies that utilize large social datasets to examine how messages are propagated online. We systematically searched for articles from engineering-specific platforms, and classified articles into the six levels outlined in M3D. Findings indicate that computer and information science journals are interested in empirically testing the social network and geotechnical levels of meme diffusion, and less attention were given to the meme and individual levels. This offers an opportunity to bridge computer and social science, in which social science provides theoretical frameworks for computer scientists to empirically test memetic diffusion at multiple levels using data-rich models and simulations.",Innovative Approaches and New Measures,Information Systems

Prior research has indicated that a personality trait, sensation seeking can be one of the significant predictors for media multitasking, but to this date, the construct has yet been examined in relation to task performance in the media multitasking literature. The current study investigated the role of sensation seeking in media multitasking and how it affects memory tasks and task performance. Participants (N = 270) were exposed to single-task or multitasking condition with simple or complex music. As expected, participants in the multitasking condition scored lower on cued recall, recognition, reading comprehension than those in the single-task condition. Also, participants who multitasked with complex music scored lower on cued recall and recognition than those in the single-task condition.

In three experimental studies, we seek to overcome these issues by developing and validating the use of secondary task response times as an unobtrusive and real-time measure of the attentional component of flow experiences. Framed by assumptions central to the synchronization theory of flow, and consistent with theoretical predictions based on a limited capacity model of attention, our results show that response times are longest under the condition of flow compared to boredom and frustration.

The primary aim of this experimental research is to better understand this identification processes. By using two different stories, we provide evidence whether exposure to narratives can lead to an automatic increase in the activation of character traits (implicit identification measured via an Identity IAT) in the mind of the recipient, and specifically, whether exposure to a narrative can cause temporally changes in the explicit self-views.

Using a longitudinal design, the current study examined whether experimentally manipulated exposure to romantic media content influenced one’s beliefs about romance using a longitudinal experimental design. Results indicate that exposure to romantic films affected endorsement of romantic beliefs over time with the effects being strongest for individuals in the high romantic film condition. Additionally, our results indicate that romantic film exposure did not have a “spreading activation” on other relational variables (i.e., relational expectations), and thus are unlikely to be attributed to demand characteristics. These findings are integrated into the current body of literature on media effects and attitude change resulting from media consumption, and the implications of these findings are discussed.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

Participants (N = 116; 63 women, 53 men) were either exposed to music videos high in sexual objectification or low in sexual objectification. Afterwards, participants’ eye movements were measured while viewing images of 36 females with varying degrees of body shape (i.e., ideal size model, plus size model) and degree of dress (i.e., fully dressed, scantly dressed, partially clad). Our findings suggest that sexually objectifying music videos increase the sexual gaze among women, but not among men. Thus, women who were primed with sexually objectifying imagery absorbed the presented gaze pattern and looked more on female bodies than on female faces. This effect was independent from the body shape and the degree of dress. This suggests that all kinds of women may be targeted by visual sexual objectification.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

The study employed a 2 (pro-social versus neutral song) x 2 (testimonial versus objective message), between-subjects factorial experimental design. Pro-social song lyrics significantly decreased anti-social thoughts compared to neutral lyrics but cognitive thoughts are unrelated to any of the bystander decision variables. In line the general learning model and decision processes of bystander decisions, pro-social music directly increased responsibility perceptions.

2016-0387,2016,Poster,It's No Game: Testing if Generative Music Systems in Video Games Increase Flow in Players,1,"Flow is “the optimal experience"" and originally proposed by Csíkszentmihályi. It is a pleasant state of deep concentration where the outer world melts away and a person focuses intently on the task at hand. When a person is in flow they are only able to focus intently on the task at hand when the difficulty of the task is closely paired with their ability. This means a person is always challenged, but also able to succeed. Although Csíkszentmihályi initially used flow to describe the pleasurable deep concentration observed in painters and sculptors, subsequent research reports people experiencing flow while doing a wide range of hobbies, from chess to rock climbing. People have also reported experiencing flow while using video games or listening to music. The study combines these two media sources to see if the musical soundtrack in games influences the sense of flow players experience while playing them.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

A Test of the Synchronization Theory of Flow,3,"Flow is a positively valenced psychological state characterized by focused attention and reward that is thought to result from a balance between task challenge and individual skill. The central prediction of the synchronization theory of flow understands flow as an emergent property of a network synchronization process that manifests itself in functional connectivity between attentional and reward structures during flow-inducing media use. However, there is no well-established procedure for experimentally manipulating the construct. In three behavioral experiments, we validated a protocol for manipulating flow. This included the development of an open-source video game stimulus that allowed for a high degree of experimental control while providing a log of in-game events. Three conditions were manipulated: (1) boredom – low challenge/high skill, (2) frustration – high challenge/low skill, and (3) flow – balanced challenge/skill. This procedure was then replicated in a brain-imaging (fMRI) context where the results were largely consistent with theoretical predictions.","Processing Stories, Films, and Music",Information Systems

The MIME holds that insulation from media content challenging one's moral views fosters polarized values within ideological groups and reduces openness to divergent views. In order to better understand how moral themes in the news serve as indicators of political affiliation and selectively appeal to specific ideological groups, we have developed the News Narrative Analyzer. The NNA integrates the best techniques from human content-analysis and computational language processing to produce a complex and rich information system comprising both mainstream and radical sources. Our goal is to use those techniques to essentially sequence the moral DNA of latent narratives in news coverage, providing new insight into the reciprocal processes of media selection and effects outlined by the MIME model.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems

Examining Spoilers as Impediments to the Intrinsic Rewards of Narrative Engagement,7,"Conventional wisdom suggests that narrative spoilers can ruin entertainment experiences, but research on the effects of spoilers on enjoyment is mixed. Building on a mental models approach to narrative processing, this study proposes that narrative engagement increases enjoyment by satisfying intrinsic psychological needs. Spoilers were expected to decrease enjoyment by disrupting need fulfillment. Undergraduate students (N = 220) were randomly assigned to receive a narrative spoiler, or no spoiler before viewing a TV show episode in pairs. Results revealed that competence and relatedness rewards mediated the effect of narrative engagement on enjoyment. Exposure to a narrative spoiler decreased competence, and in turn enjoyment. This effect interacted with viewing social context, applying to spoiled participants who viewed the episode in the presence of a coviewer who was not spoiled. Findings contribute to understanding the narrative engagement process, the effects of spoilers, and the role of social context in media effects.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0391,2016,Poster,Don’t Tell Me How It Ends: Testing Effects of Narrative Spoilers for Film and Television,2,"Recent research into narrative spoilers shows modest impacts, both positive and negative, on users’ enjoyment. These effects appear to be mediated by processing fluency and moderated by needs for cognition and affect. However, the evidence is largely based on literary short stories, which produce low baseline involvement. Three studies were conducted to make use of a variety of television and film stimuli, testing various aspects of narrative engagement that might account for spoiler effects. Study 1 used television and film clips to replicate previous findings, and reconsider the role of genre. Study 2 used film posters to test how genre preferences and the framing of a spoiler message affect enjoyment, as well as psychological reactance. Study 3 surveyed viewers of a popular television series adapted from a book series, testing earlier findings but also examining attitudes towards spoilers, social contexts, and spoilers that are discrepant between adaption and source material.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0392,2016,Poster,Explicating the Influence of Character-Audience Similarity on Narrative Processing,1,"Story-based messages have the potential to persuade through engaging plot lines and relatable characters. Experiential involvement is central to narrative-consistent belief, attitude, and behavior change, though little is known about the message factors that inspire experiential involvement. The present investigates the impact of gender, race, and social role audience-character similarity on forms of narrative involvement (identification, transportation, and narrative engagement) when viewing a comic strip message. Viewers who matched on social role (i.e., the social group or role) of the character had significantly higher levels of identification, transportation, and the sub-dimensions of narrative presence and emotional engagement. Gender and race similarity did not predict involvement. The study provides implications for features that inspire narrative processing.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems

2016-0394,2016,Poster,Mirror and Mentalizing Systems: Fluctuating Activation During Narrative Engagement as a Function of Trait Empathy and Production Techniques,1,"This study is part of a larger research project that examines narrative engagement as a dynamic process unfolding over time. The audience is not always experiencing the narrative world through the eyes of a character, but instead alternates between identification and spectatorship. In the realm of human cognition, this entails fluctuating activation between the mirror and mentalizing systems. This study will utilize fMRI technology, and examine fluctuations between the mirror and mentalizing systems as a function of trait empathy components, varying camera angles, and what skilled filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock termed ‘disparities of knowledge’ between the audience and story characters.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2016-0395,2016,Poster,The Importance of Imagery for Effects of Narratives in Health Education Materials on Knowledge,3,"This research examines the role of imagery for the effect that narratives in health education materials have on knowledge. It focuses on the effects of two strategies to apply the narrative format in health education materials. These strategies are (1) replacing the traditionally used non-narrative texts with narratives, and (2) adding testimonials to non-narrative texts. Secondary data analyses are conducted using path modelling on data from three previously conducted experiments. Results show that both strategies can increase imagery, but that the effect is stronger for the testimonials strategy. However, it appears that the effect of testimonials is primarily caused by the repetition of information rather than the narrative form of testimonials. Imagery both has a direct and indirect effect on the cognitive effort that is invested, which in turn has a positive effect on knowledge. Hence, the facilitation imagery is an important factor for establishing effects on knowledge.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems

In order to elucidate how form features of audio-visual stories affect this response the present study investigated the effect of shot scale distribution on theory of mind responding in film viewers. Animated movies were annotated for shot scale distribution and presented in a within-subject design. Employing a mixed method data collection participants were asked to retell the story of the films and fill in questionnaires on narrative experience. Skin conductance was also measured during exposure. Story-descriptions were content analysed for theory of mind responses. In a Poisson-regression model shot scale distribution predicted theory of mind response indicating that increasing spatial proximity triggered higher activity of theory of mind. The findings elucidate how formal properties of character presentation affect audiences’ mental models of a character.",Narrative Processing,Information Systems
2017-0000,2017,Poster,"A Journey of “Waste”: Reflections About Research, Creation, and teaching",1,"This submission is a half-hour television documentary program that was broadcast on the most watched free-to-air television channel in Hong Kong in late July 2016. It was the tenth episode of an educational documentary series “Nature and Man in One” produced by the public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong. The series addressed a wide range of sustainable issues and explored how different countries tackled and solved the many pressing environmental problems. Except the first episode that aimed to provide an overview, eight episodes presented substantial facts, figures and also considerable technical details. I was invited to write and direct the finale episode that was, however, designed to be more “conceptual” and “inspirational” in tone.

Considering that it is a rare opportunity to combine research, creation and production for a one-off production for a major local broadcaster, I started to venture into various subjects relating to sustainability and environment conservation. Through intensive research into the case of Sweden, the finale settled with a core question that would underlie the program.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0001,2017,Poster,A Platform Ecology of Creative Work,1,"I consider the subcultural sphere of crafting as a best case scenario for realizing the promise of digital platform technologies and creative work. The companies in this space, Etsy and Ravelry, are committed to social change as well as profit and most crafting expertise lies with people outside the privileged mainstream, particularly women and people of color. Understanding the problems that develop when the dream of crafting entrepreneurship meets the reality of day-to-day precarious labor, as well as how crafters respond to these challenges, is thus key to creating a broader picture of societal and economic change in the context of digital technologies. Building on Haraway (2016), I argue that crafters’ creative work on digital platforms must be conceptualized as an ecology, a sympoietic system rather than a collection of autopoietic cybernetic systems.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

This three part immersive study will examine the lives and work of ten Black activist media makers in Austin, Texas and develops thick description through ethnography, critical discourse analysis and methods of visual anthropology. Austin provides a unique context for this study given its historical segregation of Black residents and recent gentrification during its rise as a cultural and economic juggernaut.

2017-0009,2017,Poster,Insider Positionality: Creating Tools and Translations to Investigate Audio Description,1,"The U.S. National Park Service – the caretaker of many of the country’s most revered places – has a causality dilemma in relation to its service of blind and visually impaired visitors. Not many patrons with vision problems come to the parks today, and audio-description service is not given a high priority, making its presence spotty or nonexistent. Blind and visually impaired people acknowledge that they generally don’t visit national parks, but almost three-quarters of them say they would, if better audio description became available (RNIB, 2003).
The American Foundation for the Blind (2016) estimates vision loss is experienced by 22.5 million adult Americans. U.S. federal laws, such as Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, address the imperative for equivalent access by persons with disabilities to the bureau’s public facilities and learning materials (National Park Service, 2016).

2017-0012,2017,Poster,Making and Doing: the Data Walkshop,1,"This is a participatory session demonstrating a 'data walkshop' process for democratizing knowledge and opening conversations about data. In a walkshop, a group of citizens assembles for a brief conversation before heading out to walk and talk in the city. In an approach influenced by the Situationists and by Baudelaire, walkers step out to try and identify evidence of data in space, and brainstorm ways of seeing and (possibly) resisting. We walk and talk together, observing and documenting city spaces that are:

- data rich
- data calm
- data resistant
- where data is valued
- where value is contested
- where data and citizenships collide

The walks invite participants to photograph, document, map and describe these elements. After 45 minutes of walking, participants return to narrate their group’s journey to others and to present a creative assessment and intervention based on their discussion. We photograph and map data walks and create contributions that add to the growing repository of material describing the data walk, and to an open-source ‘pattern language’ for data walks. This session demonstrates how data walkshops can be used to build new epistemologies and ontologies for data.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0014,2017,Poster,Open TV Presents: Scaling Production Value,1,"The networked environment has opened the TV market, troubling conceptions of “high production value.” Networked television encompasses YouTubers who profit with relatively small crews to Netflix series outpacing cable television in production budgets. I argue productions have different values at different levels of scale. “Small scale” production critiques dominant trends in networked television by shifting value assessments from artificial scarcity to building capacity attendant to diverse needs and communities. Queer producers are especially equipped to re-scale television, shifting time, space, and cultural representation considerations on set from limitation and competition to value creation. Using data and experiences from developing Open TV beta, a Chicago-based platform for community-based networked television, I show small-scale production reveals heretofore under-recognized aspects of production value. I focus on the experience of producing the first four pilots we released under Open TV Presents, a series of pilots about queer and intersectional artists exploring alternative (non-normative) relationships.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0015,2017,Poster,Payphone Portraits and Urban Imagination,2,"With their allure of urban decay, payphones have provoked a number of reimaginings, from libraries to art installations (Stokes et al., 2014). Themes that tend to coalesce around these projects include use and reuse, public access and local memory. This project investigates the payphone as a site of imagination, combining interviews with photographic documentation to ask, what is the work of a payphone? How and by whom are they used, repaired and repurposed? What do these practices reveal of media politics and urban futures? Methodologically, we address these questions in two modes: interviews and photographs. We use photographs to document payphones in multiple states of use and repair. As a counterpart, we recruit people who rely on payphones in some way, whether as a form of communication, income or employment. Our open-ended interviews with these individuals allow us build a narrative around use, repair, communication and memory in technologies of urban landscapes.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

Due to the multifarious nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children, the intervention presented benefited from moving away from traditional methodologies and employs a game-based approach. After 18-months of research and design in Colombia, a pluridisciplinary team developed a role-playing game, Por Nuestras Calles, in which participants gain a deeper understanding of risk factors and reporting mechanisms. By creating a space where participants can think ‘as someone else,’ new avenues for collaboration can be explored.

This paper aimed to examine how the protest networks established on Twitter encompassed more publics and what motivated them to involve in sustained participation.This study hypothesized that the more users receive a reply, feedback, or attention from people within the protest networks on Twitter, the more likely they remain in the networks and the more likely they were involved in the sustained participation. The results provided general support for the hypotheses of this study. The findings of suggest that retweets can be understood both as a form of information diffusion and conversations and emphasize the role of organizational actors as an active neighbor who can activate ordinary users’ involvements.

In Israel, online political talk is often extremely volatile, going beyond impolite to threatening the norms of democracy. In contrast, this paper examines two groups, constructed on the mobile-messaging application WhatsApp, in which heterogeneous publics engage in vibrant cross-cutting political discussion, and manage to do so in a civil manner. Groups are examined through a combination of content analyses, interviews, and ethnographic observation. To analyze how the groups maintain civil cross-cutting political talk, I analyze three levels: individual member proclivities, the social norms of groups, and the affordances of WhatsApp as a technological context. The three aspects are shown to work in tandem in shaping the political talk that is enabled, with design implications for those seeking planned interventions for the promotion of civil cross-cutting political talk.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology
2017-0037,2017,Poster,Interactive Chat and Candidate Impression Formation: How Social Presence Mediates and Enhances Political Evaluations,3,"While much academic research has considered the impact of large scale social media activity in the aggregate (Neuman et al., 2014; Papacharissi, 2015; Shah et al., 2015), less attention has been given to the psychological mechanisms involved in second screening—and to the evaluative consequences of interactive involvement on featured content. This study summarizes the results of two studies, the first conducted immediately after the 2008 U.S. presidential election and the second just before the 2016 election, in which users were placed in interactive political settings, then asked to chat or tweet during the presentation and evaluate the political figures depicted afterwards. Preliminary analysis of the 2008 data (reported below) indicates that interactive engagement evokes the sense of social presence, which in turn mediates political evaluations irrespective of what users actually say about the content presented on screen.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology

The decades old debate about normalization and equalization effects of digital media has barely been tested in African elections. This study tested this debate through a qualitative study of a regional election in South West Nigeria. The election was contested between a digital media savvy incumbent Gov. Kayode Fayemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) whom political analysts and most of the media predicted would win, and a challenger Mr. Ayodele Fayose of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) who openly claimed that he did not think social media was any useful to his campaign. In the end, Fayose won handily with his populist rhetoric, surprising the country and raising questions about the effectiveness of digital media for campaigning.

Social media uses algorithms and social networks to replicate individual choice-based selective exposure, organizing content based on likelihood of preference for users. We distinguish between deliberate, individual selective exposure, and de facto selective exposure that shapes media environments for users to create an ecologically valid interventionalist experimental manipulation of filter bubbles on Twitter. We address this by exposing participants to different levels of attitude-challenging content on Twitter for one month to examine the effect long-term dissonance introduction on a primarily friendly medium has on political polarization. We expect to find decreased levels of political polarization among participants in the experimental conditions.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology

Results suggest more gender variability in favorite media personae among LGB youth. LGB teens were more likely to have PSRs with LGB media personae than heterosexual youth, particularly if they lacked LGB peers in real-life. Exposure was positively correlated with PSR strength for all teens, but loneliness was only positively correlated to PSR strength for LGB youth. LGB youth were also more likely to report their favorite media personae as important sources of information for a wide range of issues related to adolescent socialization. Though most research on PSRs suggests they complement real-life social relationships, PSRs may be supplementary for LGB youth filling a relational void left by the lack of real-life LGB peers.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Based on the theory of digital divide and knowledge gap theory, the research probes the digital literacy of undergraduates from the perspective of education equity. The methods of questionnaire survey and in-depth interview are adopted. The research found that there is a difference between the digital literacy of the two groups of undergraduates. The digital literacy level of undergraduates from the urban areas is relatively higher than that of rural students. The differences may impair the healthy development of rural students, and consequently, may lead to new inequity in higher education. Detailed differences between the two groups are analyzed with an effort to probe deep into the factors attribute to these differences.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0042,2017,Poster,"Analyzing Youth Digital Participation: Aims, Actors, Contexts and Intensities",4,"Participation is often used as a blanket term that is uncritically celebrated; this is particularly true in the case of youth digital participation. In this article, we propose a youth-focused analytical framework, applicable to a wide variety of youth digital participation projects, which can help facilitate a more nuanced understanding of these participatory practices. This framework analyzes the aims imagined for youth participation, the actors and contexts of these activities, and the variable levels of participatory intensity, in order to more accurately assess the forms and outcomes of youth digital participation. We demonstrate the value of this framework by applying its dimensions to two contemporary cases of digital youth participation: an informal online community (Nerdfighters) and a formalized educational initiative (CyberPatriot). Such analyses help us move towards normative assessments of youth digital participation, which enable us to better assess what participation is good for, and for whom.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Movement as a youthquake, a student movement, a social media revolution and a
movement characterized by generational divide. In-depth interviews were conducted
with 14 students, teachers and principals from four schools. It was found that student activists were unable to mobilize their schoolmates to support their cause and join the school strikes. Contrary to popular belief, social media played little role in mobilizing the Umbrella Movement at the secondary school level. Traditional forms of communication such as face-to-face discussion and negotiation were far more instrumental. Although a generational divide was observed in the use of media, members of the younger and older generations did not differ significantly in their understanding of the movement.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Using a college student sample (N = 402) this study examined the role of technologically assisted communication (TAC) on college students’ family communication outcomes and personal well-being. Findings showed that there were direct negative effects of multimodal communications on feelings of depression and loneliness. However, the relationships were no longer significant when family communication outcomes were introduced as mediators. Mediation analyses showed that the relationships were indirect: mind reading, discipline and routine interactions mediated the relationship for depression while structural stability, emotional support, mindreading and routine interaction mediated the relationship for loneliness. The findings highlight the importance of considering different aspects of family communications when examining the relationship between TAC among family members and personal well-being.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

The bias is particularly present in children aiming to seek social approval from their caretakers. Yet, little attention has been given to social desirability in media use studies among this age group. Based on a survey conducted in spring 2015 with elementary school children in Italian-speaking Switzerland, this study demonstrates the need to account for social desirability when assessing the use of television, Internet, and video games. Children’s reported time spent with these media was significantly negatively related to their propensity to social desirability responding, even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Likewise, social desirability was significantly negatively related to entertainment media use but no relationship was evident for educational media use. Social desirability was measured with an Italian version of the short Children’s Social Desirability scale (CSD-S-I), whose psychometric properties were evaluated using Item Response Theory.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

However, little is known on how mediated ideals on other appearance standards influence adolescents’ satisfaction with their appearance. The current cross-sectional study among 374 adolescent boys and girls (Mage = 15.75 years, SD = .81) aimed to fill this gap by examining relationships between media exposure on hair ideals, and control beliefs about hair styling, reward beliefs about hair styling, surveillance of hair styling, and satisfaction about hair styling. A structural equation model indicated that exposure to messages on fashion and hair styling messages in magazines, YouTube and Blogs related to increased control and reward beliefs of hair styling. In turn, the reward value predicted adolescents’ involvement in regularly monitoring their daily hair styling. The monitoring of hair styling was related to increases in dissatisfaction about hair styling.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

This study reports the results of an online survey amongst a group (N = 172) of adolescent readers of a celebrity teen magazine. Results show that maintaining stronger emotional connections with well-liked stars coincides with having stronger connections with disliked stars. Secondly, the strength of these celebrity connections was associated with respectively more negative and more defending bystander behaviors towards these celebrities online.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Liberal and conservative politicians differ in the complexity of their language and the noun usage. Yet, the present study takes the multi-dimensional nature of European political system into account and theorizes that language use correlates with pro- vs. anti-European ideology. Using a computerized content analysis, we measured the complexity and noun use of politicians from seven German parties between 2006 and 2015. The results show that a higher use of nouns is correlated with anti-European ideology, while linguistic complexity is not. Contrary to the expectations, conservative politicians use more complex language. The use of nouns and complexity does not differ over time, challenging the hypothesis that language use changes during situations that cause insecurity.

Constituting the single most commented issue in the FFC’s history, the organization found itself unable to analyze the “big data” comprising the “Open Internet Docket,” the public file pertaining to net neutrality. As such, the FCC turned to data scientists at large on the internet, publicly soliciting help on their website blog and publishing the Open Internet Docket data corpus. In response to the FCC’s call, this work uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to create topic modeling of the entire corpus of comments in the Open Internet Docket (N ≈ 3.7 million). With LDA, 1000 topics were generated and manually coded by two researchers, revealing 47 salient topics containing the most unique and telling words pertaining to net neutrality. The Open Internet Docket comments contain geographic data by state, city, and zip code, so the 47 significant topics were used to run multiple linear regressions with US Census data from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results reveal that the majority of comments were concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois; linear regressions show a distinctive use of word choice in comments according to household income; and political affiliation and household income are the strongest predictors for rates of comments submitted to the FCC among the 100 most active zip codes.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

In journalism studies for instance, there is considerable concern about journalists’ extensive reliance on subsidized content from sources and news agencies (‘churnalism’). Since journalists typically reformulate and rearrange source information rather than literally replicating it, computational approaches that focus on the literal copy-pasting of entire texts overlook an important dimension of source reliance. This study presents a semi-automated approach to trace this journalistic 'patch writing' by comparing source texts to news texts on a sentence level. In addition to offering a more refined view on churnalism, the approach can be used to study a variety of related research problems, including questions on news diversity (to what extent do news media re-purpose each other’s material?), sourcing bias (is the material of official sources systematically preferred over alternative sources?), and transparency (is the source attributed?).",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

2017-0069,2017,Poster,Exploring Beliefs and Behaviors Regarding Sleep Health Among Users of a Popular Mobile Wearable Sleep Tracker Device,5,"Intro
Poor sleep is a pressing concern, but also a modifiable risk factor for a variety of negative social and health outcomes. Approximately one third of the population is severely sleep deprived (Liu et al., 2016) , and sleep deprivation increases risk for hypertension, stroke, and type II diabetes (Buxton & Marcelli, 2010; Gupta & Knapp, 2014; Jackson, Redline, & Emmons, 2015). Intervention research shows that sleep behavior is largely modifiable (Brown, Berry, & Schmidt, 2013; Carter, Dyer, & Mikan, 2013), and thus a suitable area for research on evidence-based behavior change approaches. Mobile technologies, like wearable activity trackers, have been touted as promising behavioral methods for increasing population health, including sleep. This study describes the formative steps in a unique collaboration between academic and industry partners (makers of a highly popular sleep and activity tracker) to design an evidence-based sleep health education intervention.

Method
We chose a survey-based methodology for the formative stage of this research project to identify belief and behavior targets for the next phase, in which we will test the impact of specific message. We recruited active users of the tracker for the survey (N = 652). The industry partner identified, recruited, and contacted potential participants for the study. Surveys included validated scales to assess Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep (DBAS), sleep hygiene index (SHI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), as well as general health and demographic components. We computed descriptive statistics and assessed bivariate relationships between beliefs, behaviors and the primary outcome, sleep quality, to identify promising message targets for the next phase of this research.

Results
One third of respondents (32.5%) were female. Most participants (67.0%) were between 25 and 54 years of age. The average respondent had a body mass index (BMI) of 27.7 and recorded (based on data from the sleep tracker function of the mobile application) 6.38 hours of sleep per night in the last 14 days. Using a scale from1 (never) to 5 (almost always), respondents most commonly reported sleeping on an uncomfortable bed (m = 4.1, s.d. = 1.1) and sleeping in an uncomfortable bedroom (m = 4.1, s.d. = 1.1, see Table 1) as negative factors affecting sleep hygiene (Table 1). These responses were also significantly, inversely related to sleep quality (having an uncomfortable bed: r = -.09, p < .05; uncomfortable bedroom: r = 0.16, p < .01). Using a scale of agreement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), many participants also reported a belief that that medication was the only solution to sleeplessness (m = 5.7, s.d. = 1.4) and that they cancel obligations after a night of poor sleep (m = 5.4, s.d. = 1.6; see Table 2). Both beliefs were inversely correlated with sleep quality (medication: r = -.25, p < .01; cancel obligations: r = -.19, p < .01). We used these results to identify the five most prevalent behaviors and beliefs that were significantly associated with sleep quality for inclusion as message targets in the next phase of this research – an evidence-based campaign to promote sleep health in users of the sleep and activity tracker.

Conclusions
Mobile wearable trackers are increasing in popularity and hold promise for improving modifiable risk factors like poor sleep. We (academic researchers) are engaged in a unique partnership with the makers of a widely popular, wrist-based sleep tracker to design an evidence-based program tailored to improve sleep health among current users of these sleep and activity trackers. This study describes survey-based methods to identify the knowledge gaps and poor sleep behaviors to identify relevant message targets for a behavior change program that will be designed based on evidence, then delivered to individuals using these sleep trackers to assess behavioral and attitude change toward healthier sleep habits.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0070,2017,Poster,Subliminal Voices: Barriers to Healthcare and Proposed Interventions by International students and Their Families at a Large Research University in the Midwest,1,"Despite the rising number of international students in the U.S. as well as their contribution to the U.S. economy, voices of international students are rarely heard or communicated within the discursive spaces of the American academe. This study takes a step towards filling that gap and examines, in particular, barriers that international students at a large Midwestern university faced while accessing healthcare facilities for their families. Using a culture-centered approach to health communication, this study creates a discursive space where international students and spouses communicate vivid narratives of the problems – both practical as well as communicative – that they encountered while negotiating the American healthcare system. This study also presents ideas of communication-related interventions that international students proposed to redress the problems they faced. And in the course of their narratives, interviewees communicated the deeper issue of structural indifference that often underlie and exacerbate the barriers to proper healthcare.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Although ASD can be reliably diagnosed by age two, most children are not diagnosed until after age four, and many miss out on critical, effective early intervention. At this time, researchers have not examined social media’s role as a tool for promoting early screening for ASD. Social media messages designed to promote early developmental screening for social communication milestones and ASD were framed and presented to parents in a 2 (message framing: gain and loss) x 3 (message type: narrative, didactic, and a hybrid of the two), online, experimental, between-subjects factorial design. Participants’ impressions of message quality, involvement, attitudes, reactance and behavioral intentions to “like” or share the message, and to ask their doctor about developmental screening, were analyzed to inform the development of social marketing campaigns to parents of young children.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0073,2017,Poster,Getting Road Safety Messages Across: On Whom to Focus in Texting and Driving Prevention PSAs?,3,"Smartphone-use while driving is a serious and relevant public health issue. While most unhealthy behaviors have negative effects only on the actor’s health, risky driving behaviors also put uninvolved people at risk. Popular framing strategies commonly either vary the form in which (un)healthy outcomes are presented or depict different types of outcomes resulting. In the case of smartphone use while driving, however, another framing strategy might be effective: varying the person who suffers from the negative consequences of an accident. Based on evidence from framing theory and several health behavior models, we presume that (1) person framing and (2) severity of the health risk in texting and driving prevention PSAs influence behavioral intentions. We expect (3) health-related attitudes and (4) emotions to function as mediators of these relationships. To test these assumptions, we conducted a 3 x 2 between groups online experiment. Preliminary results show mainly indirect effects.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0074,2017,Poster,Interpreting the Truth: Online Comments About Video Alleging to Show Planned Parenthood Selling Body Parts,2,"This study in progress examines beliefs about abortion by analyzing how people in Internet user comments interpreted a video released in July 2015 that purported to show Planned Parenthood selling the body parts of aborted babies. Planned Parenthood, in response, insisted that they do not sell fetal tissue, but rather accept cost reimbursement for aborted material that is donated to medical research.

To ensure broad diversity of articulated viewpoints, we collected user comments on news articles about the video from five distinct classes of website, stratified along axes of articulated partisanship and extent of focus on abortion. From each of these five sources, we selected the first news article published on the site about the Planned Parenthood video that garnered at least 50 user comments. Although the makers of the video ultimately released a series of videos, we focus on the response to the first video as it represented the first broad public engagement with what to most people was new information about these practices. The sampled articles yielded 3,053 comments (see Table 1).

Table 1: Websites and Comments

To analyze the comments, we identified recurring themes relating to how commenters interpreted the video and the articles about the video. We used open coding based on a grounded theory approach.

Our analysis demonstrates stark divergences in 1) how commenters interpreted the same “facts” and 2) which “facts” they considered relevant and important. Different people offered fundamentally opposing interpretations of the same information.

Disagreement about what the video depicted, i.e. what the “facts” were, was embodied in discussions about whether the video depicted sale or donation and whether the aborted material was properly called “tissue” or “parts.” Some cited evidence in the video that convinced them the transaction was a sale; others discussed the transaction as a donation. Similarly, many comments referred to the aborted material as “tissue” while others referred to it as “baby parts” or “body parts.”

In addition to such differing interpretations of what the video depicted, we also identified disagreements about which facts mattered to commenters. While one group of comments described the emotional tenor of the people in the video as callous and inappropriate, others argued that the same behavior was necessary professional detachment. Similarly, many commenters argued that the editing of the video was misleading and misrepresented what actually takes place at Planned Parenthood. Others argued that the editing did not meaningfully alter the content of the video. In other words, there was disagreement as to whether callousness and editing were even relevant criteria for interpreting the video.

Importantly, these are more than just factual interpretations; they are the foundation for moral evaluations, and often extend beyond evaluations of the video content to include evaluations of Planned Parenthood and even of abortion itself. Intertwined with opposing factual interpretations are opposing moral interpretations, which line up in evident ideological patterns, such that certain positions (donation, tissue, professional detachment, editing matters) correspond to pro-Planned Parenthood stances, while other positions (sale, parts, callousness, editing doesn’t matter) correspond to anti-Planned Parenthood positions. In addition, positions toward Planned Parenthood often expand to exhibit positions toward abortion.
While we are still situating these findings within existing literature, and full consideration of the contributions of this research is still underway, there are likely implications for the notion that misunderstandings about abortion can be corrected with better facts. Ideological frameworks seem to complicate both how “facts” are interpreted and what information is considered a relevant fact.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

The Effect of Using Humor in Health Campaign Spots About STD on People’s Willingness to Talk About STD,3,"This study examines the effect of humor in PSAs about STDs on people’s willingness to talk about STDs and related intentions as a function of their disposition to use humor as a coping strategy. A 2 (humor) × 2 (control factor spot) between-subjects online experiment was conducted (N = 229), in which participants randomly saw one of four PSAs about STDs. The results illustrate the complexity of using humor in health messages. People who are low on Coping Humor are motivated by humorous spots to use condoms. While humorous spots encourage people high on Coping Humor to talk about STDs with their partner, there is a risk that their intentions to use condoms are decreased. Besides providing insights into the effects of humorous health messages, our study also points to the relevance of interpersonal communication for health behavior.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Much of this difficulty arises from a constrained understanding of this concept based on a socio-cognitive framework, which emphasizes human cognition as a source of stigma, rather than a structural framework that accounts for the interplay of different social, economic, political and historical processes that intersect to produce stigma and discrimination in society. Drawing on critical theoretical framework and ethnographic research related to HIV/AIDS in Delhi, India, this paper argues for a structure-centred approach to health interventions and communication that are based on the lived experiences and narratives of affected and marginalized communities (including those living with HIV) in a bid to eliminate the burden of HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Nevertheless, these consequences a considerable amount of adolescents engages in binge drinking. These alarming facts suggest that current alcohol interventions fail to elicit changes in adolescent binge-drinking behavior. Therefore, there is a need for effective interventions targeting adolescent binge drinking. To inform existing and future interventions that target adolescent binge drinking, the main objective of this study is to identify three kinds of beliefs which are part of theoretical frameworks such as the theory of planned behavior: behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs. To do so, we distinguish between beliefs of popular and unpopular adolescents and we apply deductive qualitative content analysis of beliefs that adolescents’ have expressed in peer-to-peer conversations about alcohol.

The visual appearance of a product is even more important in an online shopping environment in which consumers can only view a product without touching, hearing, smelling, or tasting it. Product visuals can elicit initial impressions and inferences about other aspects of a product which may bias subsequent information search. This is because people tend to systematically process information in favor of their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (confirmation/congenial bias). In this study, we manipulated the levels of product visual appeals in a 2 (bad vs. good package design) x 2 (low vs. high image quality) factorial design randomized experiment. We examined the impact of visual conditions on information exposure via brand attitudes, and how perceived product quality and seller credibility can mediate these effects. A contrast analysis confirmed an increasing linear trend in positive selective exposure as the product visuals become richer; and a structural equation model showed that the relationship between visual conditions and selective exposure was mediated by brand attitudes, perceived product quality, and seller credibility.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

These studies highlighted watching television together as a valuable family routine, structuring the rhythm of daily life and familial sociality. Still, ever since, we have witnessed changes in both family structures and the ways television is consumed within the household. This begs the question whether earlier findings considering family closeness still hold up.

Drawing upon insights from literature on family rituals and media generations, this survey study indicates that despite a robust prevalence of family viewing, alternative social patterns emerge, which coincide with the appropriation of screen technologies beyond the living room television. Further analyses reveals that deviations from family viewing are associated with lower cohesion between generations.

This article shows the specific strategies adopted by different level officials: the suppression approach will be taken by the local officials first, if the suppression failed, the rumor refutal approach, actively guide approach, propaganda approach will
continue to be adopted by the higher-level government.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0102,2017,Poster,Incidental Exposure to News on Social Media in Four Countries,2,"People are exposed to news ‘incidentally’ if they encounter it while intending to do other things. Whilst the existence of incidental exposure to news on television has been demonstrated, the same cannot yet be said of social media. We use data from the 2015 Reuters Institute Digital News Report survey to examine incidental exposure on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in four countries (Italy, Australia, US, UK). We find that (i) those incidentally exposed to news use more online sources, and engage with news more, than non-users (ii) the effect of incidental exposure on number of sources used is strongest on Twitter, followed by YouTube, then Facebook, and (iii) only those who intentionally use multiple networks for news use more sources, and engage more, than those incidentally exposed. Our findings suggest that the move to media environments characterized by selective exposure is accompanied by incidental exposure via social media.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

An Analysis of the Chinese Grassroots Celebrity Physician Phenomenon",1,"This study explores Chinese grassroots celebrity physicians’ self-perceptions of their multiple identities of being medical experts and celebrities in cyberspace. Interview results suggest that grassroots celebrity physicians in China prioritized their professional identities to their identities of being celebrities during online interactions with their fans. This kind of perception was primarily reflected in their persistent in promoting opinions that they considered to be “scientifically correct” but were not widely accepted by the general public. Nevertheless, celebrity physicians still managed to acquire a large group of fans because the unstable celebrity-fan relationship was consolidated by well-developed expert-layperson connections. The study indicates that social media not only facilitate the transfer of doctor-patient and celebrity-fan relationships from real space to cyberspace, but also foster the development of new types of connections. These new connections have blurred the boundaries between conventional categories of relationships.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Survey conducted with 206 participants from India, the country with highest depression rates in the world (WHO, 2011), revealed that parasocial interaction with the celebrity mediated the effect of exposure on intentions and efficacy perceptions reharding seeking mental healthcare. Our study expands the research on celebrity influence on health condition in an international realm and in a mental health context. The findings have immense practical implications and may raise awareness about mental health in India given the popularity and reach of Bollywood among audiences in India and beyond, the level of stigmatization attached to mental health issues in India, and the lack of available resources for care.

The Internet has brought gaming to people’s homes, and online gambling ads (OGA) have spread throughout all type of media. This study explores people’s perceived influence of gambling advertising, what Davison (1983) called the Third-Person Effect (TPE), and its consequences on people’s willingness to support censorship or public service advertising. Our findings show that despite the difference on the perception of the effects of OGA, it scarcely accounts for the behavioral outcomes analyzed.

Moreover, the media’s views on games and attribution of game-related social problems (N= 154) are explored. This study found out that in the interplay among press interests and state’s and social actors’ importance setting, not only politicians’ policy preferences drive media ideology, but social actors’ policy preferences also drive media orientation. Yet, the mainstream media are ambivalent about game issues and such journalistic behavior makes game issues more complex and may have biased/dualistic views on games and game regulation to the public.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

It is often claimed that evening media use contributes to bedtime procrastination, but only rarely verified. How people’s state level of self-control relates to these associations, is also unknown. A sample of 234 first year students participated in a survey charting their activities during the preceding day and subsequent bedtime behavior. Results indicated that ego depletion was directly related to earlier bedtimes, explained by its similarity to fatigue. Ego depletion indirectly leads to later bedtimes, however, because it reinforces the propensity to procrastinate bedtime. Television viewing had a dual role in this model. Ego depletion was related to watching television longer than intended, and this fostered earlier bedtimes on the one hand. On the other hand, it fostered later bedtimes through a positive association with bedtime procrastination.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

A sample of urban residents in China was drawn to survey their attention to news about China in U.S. media, their perceptions of the influence of China news on themselves and on Americans. Results support the third-person effect. Chinese respondents believed that news about China in U.S. media had a greater effect on Americans than on themselves. However, the more they paid attention to such news, the more they perceived the news as credible, the greater was their perceived effect on themselves. Additionally, SEM analysis shows that credibility mitigated against negative emotions elicited by news about China. Finally, perceived effects of news about China in U.S. media on the self and negative emotions elicited by the news predicted support for the Chinese government’s global profile-raising campaigns.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

A Qualitative Meta-Analysis for the Development of a Conceptual Model of Mediatization Processes in the Legal System,1,"Court cases that have proved sensational in the media regularly provoke discussions about the independence of the judiciary: The main concern is that the increased importance of the media would result in a mediatized judiciary that is rather oriented to the media logics than to its own mode of operation.
However, there is little systematic knowledge on the mediatization of the law within social sciences. A significantly larger body of research has been published from legal scholars, that provide arguments for the significance of the media for the justice, but have not been systematically recognized by communication scientists.
Aim of this paper is to develop a thesis-based model of the mediatization of the law by using a qualitative meta-analysis of judicial publications. This model contributes to the theoretical progressing of mediatization research and provides a conceptual basis for future research on the impact of the media on the judiciary.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

In the first phase, we investigated the connections among authors, theories, and journals through semantic network analysis to examine the development and diffusion of the subfield of sport crisis communication over the last 25 years. In phase two, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the foundational scholars and publications on which sports crisis communication has been built. The resultant generational whole network view demonstrates how theory application links authors, how theory clustering depict the ways that theory application doubles as an applied assessment tool, deciphered the most central journals in the network, and shows that the subfield’s theoretical development is shaped by crisis communication theories and apologetic rhetoric.

For collegiate student-athletes, the stress that accumulates across their dual roles as a student and an athlete is arguably unavoidable. The purpose of this study was to test the stress-buffering model and to examine how social support influences, if at all, the stress-coping process for collegiate student-athletes. This study included N = 459 Division I collegiate student-athletes nation-wide. It was predicted that stress would negatively predict self-efficacy (H1 supported), social support would moderate the relationship between stress and self-efficacy (H2 not supported), self-efficacy would positively predict performance (H3 supported), and self-efficacy will mediate the relationship between stress and performance (H4 partial mediation) in both an academic and athletic setting.

It focuses on the form of non-professional, live theater festival as a popular communication conjunction that operates across and through the “small places” of a regional community, but with ambitions and reach beyond this space, at the outer borderland of Europe. The theatre festival is examined as a platform that sustains and is sustained for almost two decades on the basis of a. motivation of political concern to intervene in the local cultural and social life; b. bring out and bring in the borderland articulations of transgression and contestation across various borders and c. function as a public service actor in an attempt to counterbalance the violence of deprivation, poverty and exclusion. We explore here the dynamics of its organization, its method and strategies of sustainability and its history within the context of specific pressures and fluidities experienced at the “edge” of Europe.

It situates this process in the context of broader debates about the ‘smart city’ and proposes a method and approach for developing and sharing knowledge within and between people living in cities. This approach intervenes in the technocentric, narrowly focused understanding of the smart city and provides ways to generate alternative forms of knowledge, engage with the production of new civic narratives about data, and demonstrate ways to engage with alterity, partial knowledge and new modes of ethics. Building on walking practices from several different traditions as well as on theories of ‘critical making’ and feminist epistemology, the walkshop process critically intervenes and transforms discussions of smart urbanism and big data.",Theme Interactive Poster Session: Interventions,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Teaching communication undergraduate students on the design, skills and methods of academic research faces at least four eminent, but serious challenges. (1) This generation, the so called Millennials (born between 1980 and 2000), like to be in control; ask for choice; are inclusive, group-oriented and excessively social; treasure their leisure time; are technological confident (IEAB 2008). In short, today’s communication teachers face a generation of students that demands much; knows and uses technological resources much better than they do, and; has an easy access to all kind of information. (2) Technology is an extraordinary tool, but it is also expensive and can be very distractive. (3) Plus, even when information and communication technologies (ICT’s) are present in almost every classroom, teaching adapts slowly to these technological changes. (4) Millennials’ particularities are combined with traditional trends about students’ resistance to learn research methods. Learning academic research design and methods (particularly statistics) is not usually perceived as relevant, at the time these courses have never been among the sexiest or most popular. This GIFT (student produced youtube tutorials on how to conduct academic research and writing a final paper) responds to the challenges imposed by the Millennial generation; by classroom changes induced by the ICT’s, and; by traditional struggles of teaching and learning research design and methods.

2017-0127,2017,Poster,GIFTS: Exercising Persuasive Speaking Through Mock TEDxPublic Speaking,1,"Persuasive Presentation Assignment
Mock TEDxPublic Speaking
** Student Submission

Assignment Objectives:
• To effectively adapt a presentation to the audience and the occasion.
• To prepare a well-organized and fully developed formal outline and reference page.
• To choose appropriate persuasive strategies.
• To develop persuasive arguments using various forms of proof.
• To develop persuasive arguments using supporting materials that are well documented and supported in the presentation.
• To clearly organize a persuasive presentation.
• To use interesting opening and closing materials/strategies.
• To demonstrate effective vocal and physical delivery.

1. General Purpose: TO PERSUADE
To change an audience’s opinions or behaviors by using logical, emotional, personal, and/or narrative appeals.

2. TIME LIMIT: 4 to 6 minutes. Your speech is expected not to exceed six minutes nor be under four minutes. A wider range is given due to the experimental nature of this assignment. Time yourself in rehearsal so that you don’t go over or under time. If you go over or under time in practice, reduce or add material; don’t assume you’ll adjust for time problems during the actual presentation.

3. TOPIC SELECTION: For this assignment you will think of an idea for change you want to share with your classmates and try to persuade the class to take action. Use Monroe’s Motivated Sequence to construct your speech. The main elements of this assignment are announcement of the topic – draw our attention; the description of the issue – show us the need; present ideas for a solution – the satisfaction; show us what life would be like if the idea was implemented – the visualization; and tell us how we can adopt or implement your idea – the call to action – make this very clear and simple.

4. SUPPORTING MATERIALS: You must include in your presentation a minimum of three (3) different valid sources from research you conduct. Use a variety of sources; no more than one quote. Please remember: it is very important that you cite your sources orally during the speech, as well as in-text citations and a reference list that you turn in with your outline.

5. AUDIENCE ANALYSIS: Speaking effectiveness is greatly dependent upon how well you analyze your audience and adapt your speech to them. You may survey your audience to determine their attitudes, existing knowledge, and beliefs about your topic (best approach); you may research demographic data about students at UNM. Your speech must reflect audience analysis.

6. ORGANIZATION & WRITTEN WORK:
The organizational pattern that you must use for this speech is Monroe’s Motivated Sequence. If you really feel this organization pattern doesn’t work for your speech, please ask me in class to give you guidance after you’ve selected one of the other structures from the textbook. Structure your ideas and draft an outline, using supporting material for substance. The presentation should be clearly organized. It should include an attention gaining strategy, a central idea or thesis statement, a preview of your main points, appropriate supporting materials, and a memorable conclusion. The typed outline you hand in the day you speak should conform to the format provided in class. Also include a References page of all sources used in your speech. For this format, refer to the APA style information provided in the back of your text or using the online links provided in your syllabus. You can also find information online at www.apastyle.org or other websites we have discussed in class.

7. DELIVERY: Dress the way TED speakers dress – usually professionally or tied in to your idea - on the day of your presentation. Remember, this is NOT a manuscript speech; thus, you should not read your speech! Most TED speeches are memorized, but you are not required to do this. Your notes should contain brief key words to cue your memory. Your best delivery is extemporaneous. It is especially important to engage your audience for a persuasive speech. You must use charisma – PATHOS.

8. VISUAL AIDS: Visual aids enhance any speech. Typical TED speeches have minimal or no visual aids. You can use them, but make sure they are necessary, simple, and specific. Objects used to demonstrate your idea are welcome. Additionally, consider the effectiveness of the words you use enabling the audience to create a visual image in their mind.

9. SPEAKER INTRODUCTION: You are required to write your own intro to be used the day of the speech. The intro should be 3-5 sentences and written on a notecard or half-sheet of paper to be turned in the morning of your speech. The intro should include your speech title and your name. Example:

Think about what makes you comfy and cozy. Is it a warm, fuzzy blanket? Is it when you’re in your sweet spot at work? How about when you’re relaxing by the beach? Our next speaker, a recovering comfort-seeker will challenge our thoughts about comfort and show how we can have a better life by Embracing the Uncomfortable. Please welcome Kimm Oostman.

10. EVALUATION: A 0 to 5 point scale rubric will be used to evaluate your persuasive speech. This speaking assignment is worth 45 points plus 15 points for your outline. (Note to reviewer: the rubric was included with the original assignment.)

**Overall, this assignment was a favorite with the students because they stood on a red circle rug and shared ideas they were passionate about. Another surprising success was the introductions students prepared. One designated student was the MC reading the intros. This approach helped with the flow and feeling of a realistic TED event.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2017-0135,2017,Poster,Hot Politics: Physiological Responses to Political Communication,3,"The “hot cognition” hypothesis suggests that every political construct is emotionally charged in the brain. The initial positive and negative emotions towards politics affect the ability to make rational decisions. Negative emotions occur when a person is exposed to counter-attitudinal political communication, while positive emotions should occur when a person is exposed to pro-attitudinal political communication. The current state-of-the-art employs self-reported survey items to measure the experienced emotions which mix the emotion with a cognitive rationalization of these emotions. Accordingly, we do not know politics is hot as we would expect based upon the “hot cognition” hypothesis. In a lab-study we assessed physiological responses – arousal (Electrodermal activity; Electrocardiography) and valence (Electromyography) -- to pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal political communication. In a sample of 146 adults, we find that exposure to counter-attitudinal political communication increases the heart-rate with 1-2 beats per minute. Accordingly, we provide evidence that politics is indeed ‘hot’.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0136,2017,Poster,A Neural Propagation System: Neurocognitive and Preference Synchrony in Information Sharers and their Receivers,5,"What is the essence of successful information propagation between communicators? We propose that propagation between information sharers and receivers is driven by neural synchrony in brain systems associated with subjective valuation, self-reflection, and social cognition. To test this hypothesis, we measured neural activity as well as content-related preferences in information sharers while they were exposed to news articles and in receivers exposed to sharer-composed messages about the same content. We show that neurocognitive synchrony between sharers and receivers exists selectively within the hypothesized regions of interest, and only for communication partners, not randomly paired individuals who processed the same content without interacting. Further, the extent of neurocognitive synchrony covaried with the successful propagation of content-related preferences. Our results suggest that information propagation is supported by the transmission of sharer's content evaluations through sharer-receiver synchrony in a neural propagation system consisting of regions associated with valuation, self-reflection and social cognition.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0137,2017,Poster,Neural Correlates of Social Influence Across Socioeconomic Status,5,"People routinely change their preferences and behaviors in response to social influence. Early development, however, may change the way that the brain responds to social cues, and as such people from different cultural upbringings may be influenced through different neurocognitive pathways. Consistent with this logic, one potential moderator of brain-social influence relationships is socioeconomic status (SES). In our sample of young adults, those from high and low SES backgrounds conformed equally often; however, higher SES was associated with greater activity in one set of mentalizing (DMPFC) and positive valuation (VMPFC) regions, whereas lower SES was associated with activity in a different set of mentalizing (TPJ) and inhibitory control (inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus) regions when conforming to peer feedback. Thus, those from high and low SES backgrounds recruit different neural processes when conforming to peer feedback, despite the fact that their ultimate behaviors appear similar on the surface.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0138,2017,Poster,Neural Prediction of Population Sharing Behavior Relates to Domain Familiarity,5,"Sharing information is fundamental to human society, but our understanding of when and why information is shared is largely incomplete. We built predictive models that used brain responses to news articles to predict sharing of these articles in the broader population. We found 1) there were large individual differences in the predictive capacity of brain valuation responses and 2) these differences tracked with frequency of engagement with similar articles in daily life, such that frequent readers showed high ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) responses in general, whereas infrequent readers showed high vmPFC only to heavily shared articles. Follow-up analyses revealed that vmPFC predictivity tended to track with predictivity across a global brain network encompassing regions associated with valuation, social cognition, and controlled attention. These results provide a model of variability in brain predictive capacity for population sharing behavior, and identify individual differences in domain familiarity as a psychological source of this variability.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0139,2017,Poster,Reproductive Effort Interacts With Socioeconomic Status to Influence Support of Censoring Government Criticisms,2,"Drawing on life-history theory, we tested an evolutionary explanation of why individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more supportive than higher SES individuals of censoring government criticisms. According to this explanation, suppressing dissent helps enforce a secure environment, which will support one’s high reproductive effort (e.g., to reproduce early and in large quantities) better than an insecure environment. Lower SES individuals have stronger desires for collective security because they generally reproduce earlier and in large quantities. Indeed, our analyses of survey data (N = 34,986) showed that household fertility partially mediated the negative correlation between SES and support of censoring government criticisms. Household fertility also interacted with SES such that its effect was stronger for higher- than for lower SES respondents. This suggests that increases in reproductive effort render higher SES individuals more risk averse. These findings qualified a system-justification hypothesis and offered a novel explanation of “working-class authoritarianism.”",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Researchers refer to this phenomenon as cyberbystander effect. It is frequently observed, yet little is known about factors that contribute to this effect. The goal of this specific experiment is to develop an initial understanding of how differing levels of message aggression induce certain physiological responses, and how those physiological responses impact subsequent intervention behavior. In this study bystanders were introduced to messages which gradually increased in the levels of aggressiveness their physiological and behavioral responses were measured. Participants felt more arousing and more negative as the level of attack severity increased. They felt less positive as aggressiveness severity of the messages increased. Physiological responses showed similar patterns. Participants avoided responding to messages with higher levels of aggressiveness severity.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Using a 2 (gender: male and female) x 2 (condition: control and violence) true experimental design, the individual difference variables of psychopathy and empathy are explored as traits that influence attitudinal outcomes.  This research begins with an exploration into the neurophysiological as well as the conceptual importance of empathy and psychopathy.  Finally, a mediated model of moral response is presented, which could explain why a small percentage of the population reacts with negative outcomes after playing video games. Results suggest that exposure to violence positively predicts post gameplay guilt. Furthermore, psychopathy emerged as an individual difference variable that is also able to positively predict attitudes towards violence.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Drawing on this research, we examined the signaling function of luxury smartphones in a mating context by exploring how owning a conspicuous smartphone affects male and female perceptions of potential mates. We used images of attractive/unattractive men and women and presented them as owners of a luxury/non-luxury smartphone. Using a sample of N = 294 (45% men), we found that men who owned a luxury smartphone were perceived as more interested in the pursuit of a short-term mating strategy than men who owned a non-luxury smartphone. Unexpectedly, the same was found for male participants rating female targets. Furthermore, women preferred a man depicted with a non-luxury smartphone as a long-term partner which fits with the finding that these men are perceived as being more interested in long-term relationship (relative to men owning a luxury smartphone).","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0143,2017,Poster,Can Evolved Sexual Strategies be Observed in Online Dating Profiles?,7,"Sexual strategies theory (SST) posits that men and women seek different traits in mates depending on their sexual strategy. In short term mating, both sexes are primarily focused on partners that provide high quality genes for their offspring, whereas long term strategists seek potential good parents as partners. Though much past research has examined how the sexes differ in how they evaluate short term and long term mates, few studies have examined how people advertise their sexual worth depending on their sexual strategy. In this study, we conduct a content analysis of photos from online dating profiles (N = 497) as well a survey of women who evaluated men’s profiles. Our survey results are largely consistent with the predictions of SST, but SST was not supported by the results of our content analysis, indicating further need to theorize and study how people communicate their sexual strategies.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology

In this paper, I use a behavior genetics theoretical framework and twin study data from the 2013 Midlife in the United States (MIDUS III) survey to examine factors that contribute to social network site (SNS) use. I demonstrate that approximately 67% of the variance in frequency of using social media for communicating with friends is attributable to additive genetic traits; 40% of the variance in using social media for communicating with family living outside the household is explained by genes; unique and shared environmental factors account for the remainder of variance. Implications for media use and effects are discussed.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology

Using two USA datasets at the state (N = 48) and county (N = 3,144) levels, consistent evidence emerged of a suppression effect that lead to a change in sign (i.e., a negative to positive multivariate association) between parasite-stress and social capital after other explanations are accounted for. These results suggest that parasite-stress may contribute to more rather than less democratic and civic participation, a finding that contradicts both theory and previous empirical research.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0146,2017,Poster,Causes and Effects of Indirect Interpersonal Aggression: A Review and Synthesis,2,"This contribution explores potential causes and effects of indirect interpersonal aggression, which consists of covert, socially manipulative tactics (e.g., malicious rumor spreading, social exclusion). In this review, indirect aggression is explored from an evolutionary perspective, considering aggression arising from mate competition, resource competition, and status competition. Victim and perpetrator characteristics considered include age, sex, relationship status, physical attractiveness, sexual strategy, ratio of males to females and resource scarcity in one’s social environment, social network size and strength, and personality characteristics such as risk aversion, social intelligence, and empathy. Extant literature suggests that perpetrators and victims of indirect aggression face similar adverse outcomes, including increased risk of loneliness, depression, and peer rejection. Perpetrators of indirect aggressors are often seen as popular and high-status among their peers, though they are not generally well liked. Building on existing knowledge of predictors and outcomes of indirect interpersonal aggression, directions for future research are suggested.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0147,2017,Poster,The Evolution of Sex Differences in Aggression: A Costliness Continuum Perspective,2,"This theoretical piece examines the nature and causes of interpersonal aggression from an evolutionary perspective, ultimately making a case for the consideration of evolutionary theory in the study of interpersonal aggression within the field of communication. First, human aggression is defined as an adaptation, and its myriad adaptive functions are outlined. An evolutionary explanation for empirically observed sex differences in aggression is provided, drawing from sexual selection and parental investment theories. Next, an economic cost-benefit analysis perspective is employed to explain sex differences in aggression—evolutionary theory and research suggests that males and females engage in mental cost-benefit aggression calculations to determine when aggression is deemed necessary and which form (e.g., direct or indirect) the aggression will take. To conclude, this evolutionary perspective is applied to the study of aggression within the field of communication and some preliminary future research directions are suggested.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0148,2017,Poster,Reconceptualizing Physical Sex as Continuous: Are There Sex Differences in Video Game Preference? (Top 5 Paper),2,"With video games representing a rapidly growing media platform, current events have highlighted conflicts surrounding gender and games. Previous research has established sex-typed cognitive advantages and game genre preference. Potential explanations of how these align have been inconclusive. Concurrently, research on sex development has suggested that binary categorizations of sex (physical sex; male or female) don’t capture the full variation of individuals and are thus inferior measures of sex. This study uses two continuous markers of physical sex (hormonal 2D:4D finger ratio, and continuous skill-based performance) to predict game preference and playing. Using univariate effect and equivalence tests, we find that binary markers of sex predict game preference, while theoretically more valid continuous markers do not. Our results challenge the notion of binary sex differences and suggest a more complex relationship between physical sex and video game preferences. Implications for future research on video game playing and sex are discussed.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology

By performing a historiographic discourse analysis of nonfiction works on these two movements, I analyze their references to and about each other in order to determine the received view of the relations between the two groups. The historiographic discourse is approached here as an institutional contributor to the foundation of emergent public memory. Findings suggest that, while references between groups are common, they are brief and shallow. Analysis of the texts finds three major themes of commonality, opposition, and intellectual contributions. Examining their contours, I argue for the importance of memory studies that examine the processes of creating public memory, even those that may not yet have solidified. Such cases offer an opportunity for scholars to potentially intervene, as seen here in the complexities involved in coalition building across social movements.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It considers the workings of the photography studio in the U.S. and Britain between 1839 and 1900, concentrating on three connected varieties of photographic “material”: the body as object; furniture intended to guide and shape the pose; and accessories that served to support self-presentation, by offering supplementary visual information about the sitter or distracting the sitter from the experience of being photographed with the aim of creating a more “natural” expression. In each of these instances, techniques of posing connect with broader discourses surrounding photography’s capacity to represent individual identity, and help to illuminate the shifting nature of culturally appropriate and revealing self-presentation.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It has been known that this violence was perpetrated by the state of South Korea that with its rigid cold war ideology recklessly accused civilians of being either communists or communist sympathizers. After decades of silence, in 2008 the South Korean government built the Jeju April 3 Peace Park, a memorial site that commemorates the April 3rd killings.

Against a backdrop of rising immigration, global visual culture, and American intervention in foreign affairs, the burgeoning educational technology industry—including manufacturers of stereographs, slides, and magazines—made inroads into schools by endowing technology with the capacity to “bring the world into the classroom” and serve as an economical substitute for travel. Aligning themselves with the rhetoric of progressive reformers, media manufacturers highlighted their products as tools for teaching “world citizenship,” an ambiguous ideal that emphasized both the promotion of intercultural tolerance and the performance of American nationalism and exceptionalism. This paper thus provides a critical historical touchpoint for contemporary discussions about the importance of global and mediated learning in American education.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The FBI ultimately tried to understand the extent to which Quaker beliefs shaped the actions of the American Friends Service Committee.

Even though the more illegal downloaders were aware of the illegality of movie copyright infringement, the more they perceived the law as deterrent; they continued downloading movies. The results also indicated that perceived deterrence has no direct correlation with attitude. Furthermore, attitude was found to be the strongest determinant of illegal downloading intention.

Responses were analyzed based on four variables: timeliness, completeness, format, and fees assessed. More than half of municipalities did not provide timely or complete information. However, most municipalities provided records in an electronic format, and charged no fees. This study finds that state public records laws can be as problematic as the federal FOIA, although the types of problems are different. Local records officers may resist releasing information if they fear upsetting residents, are wary of the requester’s intent, or encounter software problems. Interactions with records officers suggest that informal conversations, rather than formal FOI requests, may be more effective for accessing local information.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Those GWLs were adjudicated as unconstitutional on the ground that they unnecessarily infringed tobacco companies’ free speech without sufficiently advancing the government’s public health interests. This paper tests whether less extensive alternatives to the original full-color GWLs, including black-and-white GWLs and text-only options, have similar or divergent effects on visual attention, negative affect, and health risk beliefs. We used a mobile media research lab to conduct a randomized experiment with two populations residing in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities: biochemically confirmed adult smokers (N=313) and middle school youth (N=340). Results indicate that full-color GWLs capture attention for longer than black-and-white GWLs among both youth and adult smokers. Among adults, packages with GWLs (in either color or black-and-white) engendered more negative affect than those with text-only labels, while text-only produced greater negative affect than the packages with brand imagery only.

2017-0167,2017,Poster,Imagining a progressive gender order: The career girl and the working mother in Chinese “inspirational women serials”,1,"This paper interrogates how popular television serials in China imagine a progressive gender order within the rocky ecology of Chinese feminism. The study analyzes two figurative types – the career girl and the working mother – in Chinese “inspirational women serials” as well as the media discourse about the serials. The analysis situates gender ideologies embodied in the two figurative types within the social context of Chinese feminism, which is the simultaneous embracement of liberal feminist notions and the championship of the neoliberal individuals. I argue that such historical coincidence, along with the inadequate social conditions for feminism, enables these “inspirational” women characters to possess progressive gender meanings while also delimiting gender politics to the individual terrain. The analysis of the two figurative constructions shows that (1) the figure of the career girl clearly denies traditional gender norms, but is also transformed into a personal striving story predicated on an individual woman’s quality; (2) the working mother is empowered to retain her career after childbirth, but is constructed to be an entrepreneurial, all-capable person, leaving the persisting gender inequality in work-family labor distribution unexamined.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The study shows that young Chinese females’ viewing experience of sexually explicit video is strongly informed by the patriarchal discourse of femininity. Differentiating erotic film from pornography, Chinese women take erotic film as a feminine sphere where they belong to. While these females locate their viewing practice in their curiosity, desire to learn, and seeking of pleasure, the perceived personal significance of sexually explicit videos differs for sexually experienced and inexperienced women as it is based on the (in)comparability with real-life sexual experience and the phallocentric discourse on sex that the function of the videos are defined. The viewing practice also raises a dilemma for heterosexual female viewers as their tendency to paying more attention on women’s bodies is perceived as “natural” for their heterosexual femininity but “unnatural” for their feminine heterosexuality. In Negotiation with the patriarchal gender discourse, Chinese young females construct sexually explicit videos as a political site for rebellion and subversion while largely fail to take concrete actions to exploit its potential.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The current datalogical turn foregrounds the digital datafication of everyday life, increasing algorithmic processing and data as an emergent regime of power/knowledge. Scholars celebrate the politics of big data knowledge production for its omnipotent objectivity or dismiss it outright as data fundamentalism that may lead to methodological genocide. In this feminist intervention into gender-, race-, and geography-blind 'big data' ideologies I call for ethical, anti-oppressive digital data-driven research in the social sciences and humanities. Data studies, in turn, show the urgency for renewed feminist ethical reflection on dataficiation from the perspective of responsibility, intersectional power relations, human subjectivity, and the autonomy of research participants over their own data.

Over the past several decades, women have steadily gained access to the masculine hegemonic world of sports media (Hardin 2005). However, gender inequality remains stagnant. Women continue to endure copious issues men do not… sexism, objectification, ageism, unequal compensation, as well as lack of longevity (Hardin 2006: Hardin 2005: Miller 1995). Sport feminism scholarship has gained interest over the past two decades (Caudwell 2011; Gill 2001; Hall 1997; Oglesby 2001; Semerjian 2001), however it is still an emerging field with complexities. The purpose of this in-depth interview-based study is to examine the phenomenon and dynamics of the “new” football sideline television reporter from the perspectives of those within the industry.

2017-0171,2017,Poster,A Feminist Analysis of Writings by Incarcerated Women and Their Advocates,1,"The primary purpose of this interdisciplinary dissertation study is to investigate incarcerated women’s resistance to silence and victimization in prisons through their media activism. The timing of this investigation is significant given the rapidly growing female prison population in the United States, particularly, women of color, the expansion of women’s prisons, and the various abuses that characterize incarcerated women’s prison experiences. Given that women’s prisons are particularly defined today by race, gender and class, even less is known about how African-American women experience institutional silence and oppression. Investigating the voice (i.e. social and political viewpoints) and activism of incarcerated women in California prisons through first-person accounts can expand what is known about the prison experience and specific problems that women “on the inside” struggle with during their periods of incarceration.

The research questions guiding the project are: “What are the constraints on incarcerated
women that are identified through their media activism? How do incarcerated women
demonstrate resistance to constraints they experience? What are the major issues and viewpoints contained the newsletter publication and published essays? How do the findings between the two data sets compare? In other words, do women who have the opportunity to write longer, better developed narratives differ in voice (i.e. the issues they raise or their perspectives) than those who write shorter pieces for the newsletters? How do advocacy and voice contribute to the
formation of an incarcerated women prisoners’ public sphere? The data and methodology is
based on three years of engaged document research on incarcerated women’s essays published in academic books and journals and in a quarterly newsletter (The Fire Inside) published by the California Coalition for Women Prisoners. The study is guided by the concept of voice in Feminist Communication Theory and the Model of Women’s Media Activism.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Describing social interactions of 15 preteens in after school care, this paper explores the functions of sexuality-related discourses in these girls’ and boys’ daily struggles for empowerment. Special attention is given to the social value of aggressive sexual behavior, and how this intersects with the gendered power struggles of the preteens. The observations reveal how co-existence of compulsory asexuality and sexualization makes sexuality a taboo yet attractive subject for preteen power play. However, the embedment of these children in a sexist primary school playground culture leaves girls as easy victims of sexualized bullying. It is recommended that sexualization research puts more effort into exploring the subtle ways sexism flows through our primary schools as it does through society at large, addressing the root of the problem rather than its sexualizing symptoms.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Although the AP is one of only five international media outlets with Pyongyang bureaus, it was short-staffed, with most of the articles written by a single person in the capital. In contrast, NK News had 26 people writing from three continents, including people with expertise in diplomacy, the military, and technology.

Public debates about issues like immigration and integration are difficult and complex and they are often accompanied by meta-debates concerning what should be understood as acceptable or unacceptable utterances and legitimate or illegitimate voices. Consequently they can be challenging both to take part in and to facilitate. From this perspective debates about immigration represent an interesting case for studying editorial ideals and practices, and questions relating to the boundaries of the public debate.

It is asked for their trust-levels and evaluation of the political performance to further examine what determines the political trust of journalists on the individual level. The study uses data from 775 interviews with journalists, representative for Germany. First, findings indicate that journalists report healthy skepticism towards politics and second, that they are critical about the institutional performance. Furthermore, results reveal that the journalists’ evaluation of performance (regarding democracy, politics, corruption and scandals) as well as social trust are influencing their political trust-levels. Contrarily, political journalists’ trust is determined by the performance of politics and working experience only.

This paper explores the discursive choices evident over three days of broadcast and cable coverage to elucidate taken-for-granted ideological stances common to several of the reports, with particular emphasis on two clips from CNN and Fox News that bear significant formal distinctions concealing close substantive similarities.

Though researches into trust of journalists in their sources are not scares, one debate into where trust is located – in sources or information – remains unresolved, and an epistemologically vital aspect of it, reporters’ justifications for trust, remains understudied. Based on reconstructions of interactions between news reporters and 180 of their news sources, the paper presents qualitative categorization of reporters’ justifications for doubting their sources, as well as preliminary quantitative codification of the type of sources more likely to be doubted and the news practices reporters employ differently when dealing with information that arrives from them.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

To determine how journalists combine these different tropes, we conducted a large-scale content analysis of Dutch printed news discourse (54,851 words). We find that typical combinations of metaphor and hyperbole are found in nouns and adjectives, showing that such combinations differ from the use of either trope in isolation. For hyperbole and irony, we find a relation between the two tropes in that ironic utterances contain more hyperbole than non-ironic clauses. In contrast, for metaphor and irony, we find no empirical evidence that metaphor use differs between ironic and non-ironic clauses. Analysis of clauses containing the three tropes shows that these may not always reflect novel and creative word use. Instead, various of these cases contain conventional uses of metaphor and hyperbole.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Yet, market-driven journalism seems to be increasingly prevalent during such situations of societal contestations since they imply a high newsworthiness. We argue that media coverage cannot be understood in terms of being either normatively or commercially driven, instead coverage about conflicts has a hybrid character. In order to identify the specific mixture of a normative and a commercial logic in the media coverage about conflicts, we holistically analyze distinct styles of media conflict coverage by clustering the content features ascribed to these two logics. Finally, we seek to investigate the impact of conflict phase and type as well as a media outlet’s genre as antecedents of the conflict coverage patterns.

Finally, this reasoning is tested empirically using data from a comparative case study on the representation of the Greek and Euro crisis in 2009/10 in major German and Spanish daily newspapers.

Inexpensive cameras, online distribution, and social networking have reduced barriers to producing, circulating and networking through community media. ITC's have provided small groups scaleability in distributing their media while ""communities"" are no longer principally constituted in physical space. Yet community media exists alongside other material forces of space and scale that have marginalized communities, including neoliberalism, globalization, and gentrification. This paper draws from critical geography and studies of infrastructure to think about the relationship of space and scale in understanding community media and politics. I use a case study of public access TV in SF to exemplify the material conditions that are at stake in community media practice, and to suggest how telecommunications policy, urban development, studio location and production studio spaces, all coordinate a broad community infrastructure that remains significant in today's online media ecology.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the public-facing websites of major SNS platforms—beginning with Friendster in 2002—were sampled at six-month intervals, with promotional language and visuals examined for authenticity claims. We found that nearly all SNSs invoked authenticity—directly or through language like “real life” and “genuine”—in their promotional materials. What stood out was the profoundly reactive nature of these claims, with new services defining themselves against legacy services’ inauthenticity. We analyze the cycle of one-upmanship in terms of authenticity's *reactive dynamism*. Born in reaction to modernity’s instrumentalism, the authenticity ideal is, for the same reason, susceptible to promotional uptake. As a result, the ideal is fundamentally unstable and nomadic. We conclude that social media scholars should take authenticity more seriously.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Recent years’ changes in Chinese social, political, economic and after all media environments have introduced a variety of values and ideas to journalistic role perceptions. New elements in journalistic perceptions bring tremendous uncertainties to not only media products but also this increasingly mediated society. Like most existing studies, this study recognizes the predominant role Chinese leadership plays over media structures. However, the reality of everyday news production is more complicated than political censorship and self-censorship. It involves organizations, institutions and agencies. Unlike those studies which overwhelmingly focused on the political dynamic of Chinese media, this study also recognizes the roles that individual journalists play in negotiation with these media structures. Lefebvre’s concept of alienation will be adopted in the paper to analyze everyday performance of journalists. However, given that the Chinese media context is different from capitalist society that Lefebvre critiqued in his theory, this paper also offers a malleable understanding of the concept of alienation. It argues that everyday performance of journalists involves constant negotiations of alienation and de-alienation from a variety of dimensions.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Based on these findings, this project identifies a medial continuity of experimental science: how persistent ideas about the capacities of media can engender continuity in experimental techniques. Bringing together media theory and the history of science, this project demonstrates the persistent interrelations of experimental science and media.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2017-0199,2017,Poster,A Sociocultural Approach to Study Public Connection Across and Beyond Media: The Example of Norway,2,"This article presents an approach to cross media use analysis suited to answer the question of how citizens of different socio-cultural groups experience their freedom of information. The approach is based in normative democratic theory, attentive to the dimension of culture and media that lies beyond the predefined political, and designed to analyse, from a citizen the perspective, how people experience a public world where shared problems are addressed. To illustrate the approach, the article draws on analysis of two empirical examples, one of a representative sample of the Norwegian citizenry and one of Norwegian students. We conduct latent class analysis as well as multiple correspondence analysis to help improve our understanding of the consequences of fragmented and personalized media use by shedding light on the implications of changing patterns for the experience of freedom of information, and thus for the role of media in democracy.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Therefore, the goal of this study was to draw upon established empirical operationalizations of incivility as a means of better understanding how the various features of uncivil talk relate to one another. The results of a regularized partial correlation network indicated the most central nodes in the variable network were the self-reported desire to exclude political opponents from deliberation and the desire to discredit one’s perceived political opponents. Conversely, the results suggested that use of threat and the purposeful attempt to undermine faith in the democratic system were the least central nodes.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It does this taking into account the role of ICTs in media systems. We first present the main points of concerns related to the HM theoretical framework and discuss the work of some authors that already attempted to revise it. Then, we consider the changes that ICTS brought in the relationship between media and politics and explain why such transformations require a revision of the HM theoretical framework. The third section discusses our revised version of the HM theoretical framework: we updated their four original variables including ICTs-related dimensions transversely and we added two new variables so as to account for citizens’ role in shaping media systems. Conclusions point out the main strengths and limitations of our theoretical model and propose some steps further in the study of media systems.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Political humor can inform and persuade viewers. However, not all political comedy programs are equal. John Oliver leads a trend of long-form political comedy that is better researched and more deeply analyzed. The current study employed an Elaboration Likelihood framework to design and execute an experiment to investigate the mechanism through which political comedy influences knowledge acquisition and attitudinal congruence. The study explores and explicates the role of elaboration, the impact of the evolving structure of presentation and distribution on social media, and the moderating influence of an individual’s affinity for political humor. Though traditional political comedy persuades viewers through the peripheral route, long-form comedy relies on greater elaboration.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It takes one of the most widely used forms of social media, known as weibo, as a case to investigate how social media enable people to articulate their previously unspoken experiences and memories in contemporary China. By dissecting several contested debates on weibo over historical events and figures in the Mao era, this study argues that social media embraces a wide variety of diverse individuals as subjects who contribute to various mnemonic practices, facilitates the crowdsourcing and aggregation of alternative narratives of the past as counter-hegemonic discourse, and cultivates the production of historical knowledge as an easily retrievable and re-activatable process. It concludes that the integration of fragmented, individual memories into historical knowledge and the facilitation of diversified mnemonic practices on weibo re-construct the maintenance and production of historical knowledge while questioning the authenticity and accuracy of official history in the long run in society.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

To test whether interactivity is a solution to this problem, a 2 (interactivity level: low or high) x 2 (issue involvement: low or high) experiment was conducted, accounting for issue involvement because it is a factor that could alter the effects of interactivity. Results indicated that interactivity enhanced memory, which means it does hold the potential to help readers overcome the information overload often encountered online.

We distinguish four types of frame transitions in real-time frame contests: The follow-up speaker can engage in a discourse on the initial speaker’s frame and (a) elaborate on or (b) challenge that frame; or they can disrupt the framing and (c) shift to another frame or (d) clear the frame. As expected, speakers who favored austerity policy towards Greece preferred other frames than speakers who favored bailing out Greece. Disruptive frame transitions were much more frequent than discursive frame transitions. Challenging and shifting frames was associated with higher levels of conflict while elaborating on frames was associated with lower levels of conflict.

Evidence about how Iranians approach these important shifts, attitudes about their country, its future and its priorities remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, it is not clear what factors affect Iranian citizens’ attitudes on these issues, nor the role media plays in shaping political attitudes, values, and perceptions. Towards filling these gaps, we conducted a field study among a systematically recruited sample of Iranian citizens. Our analysis reveals that use of non-state regulated sources such as satellite TV and online news websites have a negative impact on citizen attitudes about Iran. In contrast, relying more on state media contributes to more satisfaction with the status quo in Iran. Finally, we used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to identify the relationships between sources of information, religiosity and attitudes about Iran. The results of our exploratory SEM-PLS analysis suggest that religiosity is the strongest predictor of attitudes about Iran and it also has a full mediating effect between what information sources Iranians use and optimism about Iran’s future.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 second screeners partook in online political activities. After thematically analyzing interview data, we identified motivating and inhibiting factors affecting second screening for political participation. The findings show that second screening facilitated young users’ cognitive presence in exploring, integrating, triggering and verifying political content. Second screening that created users’ perceived social presence (i.e., virtual presence and sense of community) encouraged their political participation and increase social capital. In contrast, concerns about internal and external risks of second screening curb the usage. Impression management, discussion disagreement, and privacy protection are key reasons that lower second screeners’ online political participation. Due to political threat and mass media distrust, young second screeners who perceived higher risks tended to feel wary of participating in online politics and disguised personal identities.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2017-0210,2017,Poster,The Effects of Metaphorical Framing on Political Persuasion: A Systematic Literature Review,4,"Effects of metaphorical framing of political issues on opinion have been studied widely by two approaches: a critical-discourse approach (CDA) and a response-elicitation approach (REA). The current article reports a systematic literature review (N = 109) that examines whether these approaches report converging or diverging effects. We compared CDA and REA on the metaphorical frames that were studied and their reported effects. Results show that the CDA frames are typically more negative, nonfictional, and extreme than REA frames. Reported effects in CDA and REA studies differ in terms of presence, directionality, and strength, with CDA typically reporting strong effects in line with the frame, compared to REA. These differences in effects can be (partly) explained by the different frame characteristics. However, differences in the methods applied by CDA and REA could be (partly) responsible for these differences as well. In all, we conclude that the research field is fragmented on the impact of metaphors in politics.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2017-0211,2017,Poster,The Search for Common Ground in Conflict News Research: Comparing International Conflict Coverage Over Time,2,"Media coverage on violent conflict has been shown to focus on violence and opposing elites, sidelining reconciliation and often disengaging rapidly. Especially during escalation, ethnocentrist coverage has been linked to escalation and radicalization. However, few studies have looked beyond salient conflict events, mostly focusing on few conflicts with major Western involvement. In this paper, we compare the coverage of six selected conflicts inside the conflict areas and abroad, over a time range of four to ten years. Capturing patterns in the use of 2000 relevant concepts in almost 900.000 news texts from 66 news outlets, we examine the respective media biases over both escalation and routine phases. Highlighting systematic contingencies in the occurrence of these patterns, we discuss the role of situational and contextual factors in shaping conflict coverage.

Drawing on theories of media effects, this paper investigates whether traditional media use has a negative (media-malaise-hypothesis) or a positive (virtuous-circle-hypothesis) impact on trust in the national government. For that reason, the study introduces a novel measurement for trust in government and suggests a serial-mediation model. To test the model empirically an online survey with 1115 German respondents was conducted. The results suggest that traditional media use has a positive direct impact on trust in government. The positive effect is further mediated by people’s evaluations of politicians and their evaluations of political processes. In addition, there is a positive serial-mediation effect of traditional media use on trust in government that runs first through evaluations of politicians and second through evaluations of political processes.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Some posit a “contrast” model that sees personal interest as incompatible with civic virtue; others propose an “extension” model that perceives political life as an extended field of personal life. To shed light on this debate, this study focuses on Facebook, the most popular social media site in the United States, to investigate whether and how the seemingly non-political Facebook uses (i.e., personal and entertainment uses) relate to political participation among a diverse online sample of American adults. Results show that personal and entertainment Facebook uses are positively related to political participation only indirectly, through political communication in the form of political expression on the site and/or political discussion in offline settings. Moreover, personal and entertainment Facebook uses are differentially associated with political discussion offline and political participation. Overall, findings of the study help clarify the underlying processes by which these uses contribute to political participation and the distinctions between the two types of non-political Facebook uses.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

A methodology based on the Freudian technique of free association was used to research viewers’ narratives about the programme. Many spoke about the show in terms that make use of internalised neoliberal discourses about the limits to entitlement to public healthcare as well as self-responsibility for staying healthy. Many also reflected on the treatment of the patients and expressed they were not being exploited for economic purposes. The narratives that reflected such discourses were of an ambiguous nature and the respondents produced contradicting views in the course of each interview. The data discussed may account for associative-discursive shifting in the respondents that is located at the intersection of consciousness and the unconscious. I theorise such shifting with Sigmund Freud’s concept of ‘negation’ whereby an idea is rejected by the subject in order to avoid further engagement with it. Rather than accusing the viewers of lying or having false consciousness, psychoanalysis as a mode of attention opens up nuanced ways of interpreting the data. As both a theoretical and methodological framework, Freudian psychoanalysis helps us to understand how individuals are (un)consciously positioned in contemporary austerity and crises discourses around healthcare. Given their ambiguous narratives, I conclude that the current economic climate in the UK, and its media representation, has resulted in subjectivities who struggle to makes sense of it as they simultaneously resist and embrace it.

Such works demonstrate the incorporation and disarmament of gay identities into popular media discourses, which are relatively static and eventually coalesce with heteronormative expectations (Avila-Saavedra, 2009). In contrast, the second season of American Crime is unique in its exploration of how whitening occurs within the neoliberal project of subjectivity formation among white bodies whose perceived sexual deviance threatens to destabilize or reorient racialization and sexualization processes within the formative years of youth.

Therefore, understanding millennials’ unique characteristics and features would serve as a basis to create an effective communication strategy to motivate them to engage in online and offline pro-environmental actions. However, millennials are found to show supportive intentions to green product, but ironically engage in less pro-environmental behaviors. Therefore, at the intersection of millennials’ unique characteristics and motivational elements related to pro-environmental actions, four factors will be tested as potential variables that may affect the success of a pro-environment communication campaign targeted toward millennials. In the context of recycling campaigns, message enjoyment, tie influence, psychological proximity, and perceived effectiveness of actions will be investigated as influencers of online campaign supports and behavioral intentions for recycling efforts.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 6,Communication and Technology
2017-0233,2017,Poster,How Young Adults Engage With Science on Social Media,3,"Social media affordances give people the opportunity to engage actively with content without having to go through traditional gatekeepers. While much research has looked at online participation for topics such as creative content and politics, very little has focused on the important area of science communication. Analyzing unique survey data collected in summer 2016 about a diverse group of young adults’ engagement with science content on social media, this paper fills a gap in the online participation literature by considering a heretofore neglected topical domain. Results suggest that a large portion of young adults engage with science content online, although they are much more likely to do so on Facebook than on Twitter. This finding is notable given the considerable focus on Twitter as a potential site for communicating about science to the public. The paper sheds light on the potential of social media to connect people with science.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 6,Communication and Technology
2017-0234,2017,Poster,If A Tree Falls in a Forest: Experimental Investigation of Level of Immersion in a PSA and Resulting Prosocial Behavior,3,"Popular press frequently espouses the virtues of VR as the “empathy machine,” (Alsever, 2015; Constine, 2015) yet most research in this area is anecdotal, leaving gaps in our understanding about the types, and levels of persuasion that may be more effective through a VR storytelling mechanism. The overarching research question of this project is whether the sense of presence or “being there” created through immersion resulting from the use of VR technology, specifically 360 video, will make an issue of environmental conservation more personally relevant and accordingly, more likely to lead to more robust advocacy behaviors than the same message created for a traditional 2D viewing experience. The current study utilizes an experimental method where viewing type is manipulated (immersive, non-immersive) among 200 participants. The results shed new light on the power of immersion and presence in 360 video in predicting advocacy behavior.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 6,Communication and Technology
2017-0235,2017,Poster,Supporting Causes on Facebook: Effects of Public Commitment and Future Interaction Expectation on Participation Intentions,2,"This study adds to the communication and technology field by investigating the underlying mechanism that makes social media technology effective for advocacy efforts. This study investigates whether public commitment on social media sites affect individuals’ intention to engage in advocacy behaviors and whether that effect is influenced by the expectation of future interaction with social media audiences. Preliminary findings suggest that publicly committing to a social cause has positive effects on individual’s consumption of information related to the cause. In addition, increased intention of joining an advocacy organization suggest that the affordance of social media technology can sustain long-term advocacy efforts through bringing in new members for the cause. This study has important implications for communications and technology scholars who seek to further understand the use of social media technology for promoting and sustaining social causes.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 6,Communication and Technology

2017-0237,2017,Poster,Development and Application of an Analytical Framework for Analyzing Social Behaviors With Social Relations Models in CMC Groups,3,"This paper introduces an analytical framework for theorizing the medium aspect of communication in the increasingly multimodal and immersive media environments. We argue that by incorporating a heterogeneity of communication medium into the social relations models developed by David Kenny, researchers can better understand the role of communication from a multi-theoretical and multi-level perspective. To demonstrate this potential, we draw from previous theorizations of communication technology in group decision-making, relationship development, and social identity process, and connect them with components of a social relations analysis. We also present an example of analyzing interpersonal perceptions in bi-national task groups using either face-to-face or computer-mediated communication. The paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications of deconstructing social processes with the proposed framework to theorize information communication technology and computer-mediated communication.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Our goal is to theorize creativity in the Internet age, suggesting a potential framework for understanding its complexities and examining how creative processes have evolved as a result of recent sociocultural and technological shifts. Without falling into the trap of technological determinism or overly romanticizing the role of technology, we ask: what is the role of the Internet in (re)defining creativity? What, if anything, is new or special about online creativity? In an attempt to answer these questions, we introduce a multidimensional analytical framework centered on five key questions: who (actors), where (places), when (times), how (processes), and why (motives). By analyzing online creative participation along these interrelated dimensions, a more nuanced and complex understanding of online creativity emerges - one that is sensitive to both sociocultural and technological influences, as well as to the way these factors intersect in online spaces.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Results of an online survey (N = 1,155) using stratified quota samples showed that use of GMO-related SNSs for information predicted respondents’ likelihood of participating in GMO activities offline and their likelihood of expressing opinion on the issue on SNSs. Moreover, these relationships were found to be strengthened by bridging social capital, and to be lesser extent, bonding social capital. Implications of the results concerning SNS as an emerging sphere for public deliberations in China were discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0241,2017,Poster,Explicating Textisms in Mediated Communication: A Codebook for Analyzing Nonverbal Cues in Text Messages,3,"Text messages facilitate interaction across interpersonal, organizational, intergroup, small-group, and mass media contextual levels of communication. Though some people compose formal text messages using proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation, others integrate non-standardized textual cues such as emoticons, intentional misspellings, exaggerated capitalizations, abbreviations, and acronyms. Several studies describe and organize these emergent cues within labels such as cyberlanguage (Christopherson, 2011), textual adaptations (Cingel & Sundar, 2012), textese (Drouin & Driver, 2012), textisms (Kemp, 2010; Kemp & Bushnell, 2011; Powell & Dixon, 2011), and computer-mediated communication cues (Vandergriff, 2013). Yet, with many different labels, it becomes difficult to accurately track and describe this phenomenon. This study posits that the label textism can be used to unite this grouping. The goal of this paper is to explicate textisms and outline a coding scheme that can be used to expand research on how they function in mediated communication.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

To be specific, the research question explores how bandwagon heuristics interact with different identity heuristics in credibility heuristics on an individual level. The MAIN model (Sundar, 2008) and warranting theory (Walther & Parks, 2002) served as the theoretical framework to examine the effects of bandwagon cues and identity cues embedded in retweets and users’ profile pages for health and risk online information processing. A post-test only experiment with self-report online surveys was conducted to investigate the research questions. Results indicate that different online heuristic cues impact the judgments of competence, goodwill, and trustworthiness at different levels.

Vital to the success of using smartphone-based technology for volunteers is to determine whether privacy issues affect user participation. Thus, an online experiment (N=217) was conducted to investigate the influence of privacy-related data control options on user acceptance of a smartphone-based system to facilitate volunteer engagement in crisis situations. Building on agency models and control theories in the context of information privacy, the results show that higher control options led to a more positive evaluation of the app, which was mediated by perceived privacy concerns. Among people with a high career motivation, higher control also led to a higher willingness to actively participate as volunteer in the system.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A content analysis of Facebook profiles and an online survey were conducted with senior citizens aged 60 years and older who have used Facebook for at least one year (N = 202). A series of hierarchical regression analyses showed that while status updating and posting personal stories are associated with activity and community-building gratifications respectively, profile customization is key for obtaining agency-enhancement gratification, and participating in conversations on comment threads plays an important role in providing interaction gratification. These findings advance our understanding of social networking site use among senior citizens, and provide interface design recommendations that specifically address the needs of senior citizens.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Based on a survey of university student users of a SQA site in China (N = 426), this study finds four kinds of gratification sought that drive people to use SQA sites, including social/affective, cognitive, entertainment, and fashion needs. Individual user’s activity on SQA site can be categorized into two types—participation and lurking. Although most gratifications motivate SQA users to use more, fashion inhibits regular usage. Moreover, Social/affective gratification turns out to be the only predictor of participating in SQA content generation, while lurking is predicted by all four types of gratifications. Furthermore, answer quality evaluation has an indirect effect on SQA sites use through arousing users’ cognitive, entertainment, or social/affective needs. The implications of SQA sites as online public sphere and the contrast between research approaches of technological determinism and personal authority are also discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Specifically, considering that masculinity-threatened men attempt to resolve negative psychological states caused by the threat by engaging in behaviors that exaggerate masculinity to compensate for the threatened identity, we investigated the effect of masculinity threat on muscular customization of self-avatar. We also examined how the compensatory avatar customization influenced physical endurance. Data from 238 male college students revealed that masculinity-threatened young men customized their avatar to have greater muscle definition than did their non-threatened counterparts, and greater muscle definition of the customized avatar predicted greater physical endurance on a handgrip task. Furthermore, muscle definition of the customized avatar significantly mediated the relationship between masculinity threat and physical endurance. None of these effects were moderated by masculine norm conformity.

Prior work suggests violation of responsiveness expectations can lead to negative evaluations, but this has not been studied within the modern communication ecosystem, where ubiquitous mobile devices and connectivity enable constant contact with friends and colleagues. We present results from a lab-based experiment examining how violation of such expectations can affect interpersonal attraction. In studying pairs of known acquaintances, we find that low-responsive partners are rated lower in social attraction than high-responsive partners. We also provide an exploratory analysis of chat logs from the experiment which indicates that responsiveness behavior is part of an interactive process where parties involved negotiate for each other’s attention over time.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A theoretical framework using SIDE theory and common voice informs a content analysis of Imgur posts and comments in which the Imgur subculture is identified. Evidence of SIDE, which provides the basis for subcultural development, was found in communication regularities and social identity maintenance. Building on initial qualitative work, quantitative evidence is found for common voice, elucidating the Imgur subculture through identification of commenting strategies employed within Imgur. This research seeks to shift away from studying individual users to subcultural analysis. Findings may be extended to other similarly structured sites, particularly those that utilize a hierarchical bidirectionally-voted commenting system. Results provide evidence that cultural study of site-bound digital subgroups is possible, informing future digital media and cultural research by providing a theoretical and methodological framework for examining digital subcultures.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Previous heartbeat communication studies have used consistent heart rates. To our knowledge, the effects of a target’s varied heart rate on an observer’s emotions, level of empathy with the target, and perception of social presence have not been explored. In this paper, we present the results of an investigation using varied heart rates to increase empathy when the variation is paired with narrative changes within a target’s speech. Forty-four participants watched a recording of a virtual human telling an emotional story about being adopted. For two-thirds of the participants, the recording was accompanied by visual and audio representations of the heartbeat of the virtual human, which was either of a consistent rate (one third of participants) or varied rate (one third of participants). For the final third of participants the recording was not accompanied by any heartbeat representation. Results demonstrated that the most empathy occurred in the varied heart rate condition, and that this effect is a result of cognitive empathy as opposed to emotional empathy.

Twenty Tinder users each evaluated about 50 Tinder profiles, while explaining the reasoning behind their evaluations. The study shows that Tinder users evaluate profiles in a hierarchical order. Their first evaluation of a profile owner is based on physical appearance. If that does not lead to immediate dismissal of a profile, people then continue evaluating potential partners in terms of their subcultural identity, personality, cultural background and age. Moreover, Tinder users evaluate profiles in a hierarchical order: potential partners’ perceived physical attractiveness is assessed first, and evaluators subsequently make assumptions about other characteristics of the potential partner. Our study shows that in online dating, even on Tinder, impressions are not based on physical appearance alone, but that people use the available information to form complete impressions of others.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Some early visions of human-computer relationship such as persuasive computing (Fogg, 2002), ubiquitous computing (Weiser, 1991), and affective computing (Picard, 2003) have come to life in various forms. The present work seeks to understand how individuals may form group relations with computer agents by applying the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects to the Computers are Social Actors Paradigm. The findings suggest that sharing the same color cues with multiple computer agents could lead to users’ group identification with computer agents. Group identification with computer agents could further exert influence on group conformity, conformity intention, group attraction, and group trustworthiness.

TAM was conceived as a simplified version of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) aimed at making it more efficient to conduct technology adoption research. TAM’s continuing development and expansion has come at the cost of its greatest advantage: parsimony. In addition, the theoretical sprawl of TAM has left it incapable of adapting to new perspectives on technology itself. In this paper, we revisit the evolution of TAM and critique the latest iteration of the model (TAM3). We argue that TAM has devolved from parsimony to chaos, and argue for a return to the reasoned action framework. Additionally, we argue that by utilizing this more parsimonious theoretical framework, we can extend our understanding of technology adoption and use by deriving testable hypothesis about the role of technology affordances.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Slaughter (2004) describes the emergence of horizontal intergovernmental networks for exchanging information and pest practices while Finnemore and Sikkink (1998) describe the networks of norm entrepreneurs in establishing and socializing international norms. Through interviews with current and former government officials from countries within the FOC and participant observation at annual meetings, this article investigates the history and labor of the FOC as an intergovernmental network. This article introduces new empirical data on intergovernmental information policy coordination and global politics in the emergence of a norm for human rights online.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

It also enables the political participation of diaspora. It is important to understand such phenomena because they portray how online interaction and ensuing social movements can be extended beyond geographical limitation. This research explores online communities’ role as one of the centerpieces of various social movements, and how people construct a new order of discourse and mobilize social movements within the online space. Drawing upon a critical discourse analysis of Korean digital diaspora and their online and offline social movements, this study aims to explore the possibilities of the online communities as critical active agents in initiating social changes in transnational contexts. It will further enrich the discussion on how diaspora members position themselves in the transnational, social engagement.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study aims to compare the reliance on interpersonal and mass media sources of women in their health information seeking behaviour from India, Vietnam, Singapore and the United States (US), countries with contrasting levels of individualism, power distance, and economic stages. A total of 2,070 responses were collected. Our findings revealed that women in the US relied more on medical professionals and less on family and friends for health information as compared to women in Asian countries, potentially due to the higher degree of individualism and lower degree of power distance in the US as compared to Asian countries. Online media was also found as becoming a very important, if not the most important, source of health information across all four countries.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Researchers should adapt methods to avoid mismatch with cultural norms but little systematic guidance for how to do so exists. For focus group research, the targeted use of a systemic framework (Hymes, 1972) enables identification of social group settings conducive to the type of interaction required. We tested the approach in a mediated communication campaign targeting driving behaviors in the Arabian Gulf, identifying a common social setting—the majlis—in which to conduct the groups. We succeeded in eliciting the open discussion desired and argue researchers across the globe can utilize the same process to identify and leverage group settings, increasing the likelihood of successfully gathering the data necessary for effective communication campaigns of all types and thus saving lives.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A sample of 772 women from Switzerland (516 German-speaking and 256 French-speaking) aged 30 to 49 years (M = 39.35, SD = 5.84) participated to the research. As expected, the CFAs confirmed the one-factor structure for both scales in both groups and acceptable psychometric properties (i.e., internal consistency). Micro-cultural invariance was found between the two groups of women on both the Short Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale and the Health Empowerment Scale (with the exception of the item 3). Consequently, cultural differences between French-speaking and German-speaking people could be studied for trust in doctors and health empowerment and new lines of research could be established.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The Pillarization of Switzerland’s Language Regions in the Swiss Media,4,"This paper discusses a potential pillarization of the Swiss (media) public sphere on the basis of a secondary analysis of a content analysis of three Swiss quality newspapers. The Swiss public sphere is characterized by its particular feature of the four official languages (German, French, Italian, Rhaeto-Romanic), which result in at least three different public spheres defined by language and culture. As a basis for modern democracies, mass media communication and the sufficient representation of all cultural groups is crucial for social and cultural integration. As indicators for a pillarization of the public sphere, the empirical analysis examined the sufficient representation of other language regions in news agendas as well as the proportion of exclusively featured topics. The results support the hypothesis of a pillarization of the Swiss national public sphere and proof low attention on national topics as well as a strong thematic focus on the own language region.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This project seeks to analyze how residential tenure and residents’ use of media and/or interpersonal communication impact their knowledge and use of health-enhancing resources (i.e., grocery stores, farmer’s markets and community gardens, and places to exercise) during a time of rapid neighborhood change. It uses data from surveys and focus groups in a gentrifying neighborhood in Los Angeles. Preliminary analyses of data suggest that communication network composition seems to play a greater, significant role in knowledge and use of health-enhancing resources among residents who are newer to a neighborhood, with media and interpersonal communication facilitating knowledge or use of different resources.

These attributions influence everyday routines and apply within the business context, which is nowadays characterized by worldwide networking and intercultural exchange. The aim of the present study is to ascertain a) which cues are most decisive for job suitability ratings, b) how cues interact, and c) whether there is intercultural consensus. For this purpose, we conducted an online experiment (N = 2231) with a European and an Asian subsample. In a 2 (applicants’ sex) x2 (facial attractiveness) x2 (body weight) between-subject design, participants were presented with a picture of a job applicant and evaluated job suitability for female-typed and male-typed jobs.

Interventions focused on how to support victims of cyberbullying are limited by a lack of focus on what types of messages are most valued. This study considers supportive messages that emphasize emotional comfort, attributions of responsibility, and beliefs that people can change as relevant to this context and examines how perceptions of these messages differ based on whether support providers have or lack experience with cyberbullying. We extend resaerch on the indirect effects model of supportive communication by randomly assigning participants (N = 304) to message and source conditions and assessing their perceptions of the messages, providers, and participants’ outcomes after reading the messages. Impressions of messages mediate their influence on outomes. Certain messages, most notably those that contend bullies can change, are less effective when delivered by a source who lacks experience with bullying.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

As part of the efforts of the Gates Foundation-funded Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI) to address supply-side factors, the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP) worked with the State Ministries of Health and local partners in Nigeria to conduct a five-day training for family planning service providers in Benin city and Zaria. Methods: This study used a pre- and post-training simulated client (SC) approach patterned after the GATHER framework to assess the effects of the training on quality of care from the client’s perspectives. Results: The data showed significant improvements in ratings on individual GATHER (Greet Ask, Tell Help. Explain, Return) dimensions and an increase in overall client satisfaction, including perceived competence and trustworthiness of the provider and likelihood of recommending their services. Nonetheless, the data revealed some significant residual weaknesses in provider skills, especially in relation to the Return Greet, Explain and Ask dimensions. Conclusion: These findings suggest that for ongoing family planning programs, a five-day training could be sufficient to improve the quality of client-provider interactions at a magnitude that could be perceivable to individual users and lead to higher satisfaction in the client pool. Nonetheless, there is need for facilitative supervision and periodic refresher training to continue to support trained providers.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study draws on the relational turbulence model (Solomon & Knobloch, 2004) to identify features of romantic relationships that are associated with a deficit in received support, which predicts increased illness uncertainty and decreased treatment compliance. Participants were 500 individuals who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and currently involved in a romantic relationship. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze our predicted model. Results indicated that relational uncertainty and interference from partners were negatively associated with received support. In addition, received support was negatively associated with illness uncertainty and positively associated with treatment adherence.

This study examines whether sharing affects future tobacco-related behavior. It further examines whether sharing consistently or inconsistently with one’s intentions will affect whether one implements those intentions as behavior. Using a nationally representative rolling cross-sectional (N=9115) and re-contact (n=2,413) survey of 13-25 year olds, this study found that compared to those who didn’t share, pro-tobacco sharers and pro-e-cigarette sharers at Time 1 were more likely to be smokers and vapers, respectively, at Time 2. Significant interactions suggested that sharing consistently with one’s pre-existing smoking or vaping intentions increased and sharing inconsistently reduced the likelihood of implementing those intentions six months later. These findings suggest that the way one shares about tobacco or e-cigarettes may affect one’s actual behavior, above and beyond pre-existing intentions.

This study, therefore, examines attitudinal stance-taking in interactions about Biafra agitations within two Nigerian digital communities, namely, Nairaland and Nigeria Village Square. The study engages the appraisal framework (AF) together with the socio-cognitive approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in its methodology. AF guides a critical analysis of evaluative language in the data and CDA is used to uncover the ideological orientations and discursive practices that inform varied positions about the Biafra situation, as well as the implicit meanings that are generated while interactants take stances.

The design of the app represents a departure from “old school” dating sites as it leaves plenty of space for pictures, but only minimal room for self-description. This might change the way individuals decide to portray themselves. It might also affect their privacy perceptions as these services are location-based and often include personal conversations and data. Based on a survey collected via Mechanical Turk, we assess how Tinder users perceive privacy concerns. We find that the users are more concerned about institutional privacy than social privacy. Moreover, different motivations for using Tinder – hooking up, relationship, friendship, travel, self-validation and entertainment – affect social privacy concerns more strongly than institutional concerns.

2017-0304,2017,Poster,Research Into Digital Strategic Communication Networks: Advancing Public Relations Research Through Netnograph and Social Network Analysis,2,"Advances in information and communication technologies revolutionize strategic public relations practices in new ways. This essay advocates the use of a mixed-method approach that blends netnography with social network analysis to study public relations practice on digital platforms. This method offers a new methodological lens through which both the network structure and emerging meanings of virtual interactions between organizations and publics can be examined at a large scale. We elaborate our hybrid approach by 1) explaining taxonomy of strategic networks that identify types of social networks that can be studied in public relations research; and 2) offering an instructive mixed-method framework that illustrates research design procedures that researchers can take to combine netnography and social network analysis. Finally, we offer discussion about the hybrid approach and its future deployment in the field of communications and public relations.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

An Examination of Linguistic Intergroup Bias in Media and Public Reponses to Corporate Crises,3,"Through the application of the linguistic categorization component of the Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB) theory to crisis communication, this study investigated the associations between linguistic abstraction, attribution perception, crisis emotions and coping strategies. Through a content analysis, linguistic categories used in both media posts reporting three types of crisis and public comments on Facebook were examined. The publics’ emotions and coping strategies on Facebook were also examined. Results indicated that linguistic abstraction in both media post and public comments describing the crisis varied based on crisis type, suggesting that the level of linguistic abstraction reflected perceived attribution of responsibility level. Language used to describe preventable crisis tend to be more abstract than those used to describe accidental and victim crisis. A clear connection among linguistic abstraction, publics’ crisis emotions and coping strategies was also established.",Public Relations Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0307,2017,Poster,8-Minute Meditation on Standing in a Sugar Cane Field: Landscape-Based Memory Practices and the Unrepresentability of the Violence of Slavery,1,"This project conjures an affective experience at a plantation museum in Puerto Rico to think through what possibilities landscape-based evocative practices might hold for moving communication studies of museums beyond discussion of best practices in representation. The project has two parts. The first is a performative slideshow meditation that introduces the subject and scene while demonstrating through enactment the possibilities of evocative practices themselves. The second part transforms the “8-minute” structure of the performance into eight bodies of knowledge that intersect this topic: Liberalism and anti-blackness; visual proof; the hypervisible invisible black body; memory; museums; sites of slavery; the afterlife of slavery; and hauntings. The written form offers slices into the different literatures and themes that a single landscape of memory unfurls onto, demonstrating the power and potential of theorizing and practicing the idea that, “the land gives the phantasmic form.”",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0308,2017,Poster,A Usable Cold War Past: Comparing the American and Canadian Memorials to Victims of Communism,1,"Over the past decade, the U.S. and Canada have proposed memorials to the victims of communism. I argue that the process by which each nation memorializes these victims represent a broader attempt to craft narratives of their past involvement in the Cold War to suit present day needs. These memorials provided visual and rhetorical platforms through which each nation can strategically address and naturalize the past. The American memorial was used to create a historical continuum of extremist ideologies that have required American intervention at a time when the government was seeking support for the Iraq War. The Canadian memorial frames itself as memorializing immigrants who sought refuge within its borders at a time when immigration is again a contested issue. Three aspects of the commemorative process are analyzed, including the memorials’ origin stories, their design aesthetics, and the rhetoric used to discuss, debate, and critique the memorials.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0309,2017,Poster,An Exploratory Study of Visual Metaphors in Direct-to-Consumer Drug Commercials,1,"This study identified and analyzed the content and structure of visual metaphors (including personification) present in a sample of 212 unique DTC prescription drug commercials hosted on iSpot.tv. Seven visual metaphors are identified, including medicine as a person/character, medicine as an instrument, human organ/tissue as a person/character/animal, illness as an object/person/character, illness as a natural disaster, illness as a state of being, and symptom as an object/animal. Personification is favored by pharmaceutical advertisers. While personification of medicines helps build brand personality, personification of illness and human body separates the illness from the person, giving illness autonomy that is out of a person’s control. Visual metaphors also translate abstract concepts related to illness and subjective feelings of patients into tangible forms, which may help patients communicate their symptoms more efficiently. The danger portrayed and the fear generated from visual metaphors ultimately promote the consumption of the advertised drug.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Specifically, we use Symbolic Convergence Theory and its related method, fantasy theme analysis to examine the visual rhetoric of the European refugee crisis that emerges on this site, and the images that were most popular with the site’s viewers. Our findings indicate that while mainstream media images marginalize and dehumanize refugees by portraying them as pollutants and terrorists, alternate sites such as HONY do not function under traditional journalistic norms and routines, and are expected to provide alternate portrayals. The three fantasy themes that emerge are: refugees are skilled, normalized, and are ideologically American. The overall rhetorical vision is a social master analogue that indicates that refugees are capable of assimilating into American life.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Reddit posts and visuals shared through candidate subreddits will be examined. Because Clinton is running as the first female major-party presidential nominee, portrayals of the candidates are expected to reinforce traditional patterns in political party genderization, meaning that Republicans will be presented as masculine and Democrats as feminine. A content analysis of Reddit posts and visuals will offer insight into the electorate’s view of the candidates and the engagement of candidate supporters during this election. Most content analyses examine candidate portrayals constructed by professional news media or self-presentations by the candidates themselves, including speeches.

2017-0312,2017,Poster,How Health Messages Reach our Brains: Coupled Neural Dynamics During Effective Antialcohol Videos,4,"Health communication via mass media is an important strategy to reduce risky drinking, but many questions remain about how health messages achieve their effects. Here we examine how the brains of young adults - a target group for alcohol prevention - ‘tune in’ to real-life health prevention messages about alcohol. A first study characterized a large sample of audiovisual public service announcements (PSAs) on established measures of message effectiveness. The second study used inter-subject correlation fMRI to examine shared brain responses to high and low effective PSAs. We find that more effective messages evoke more similar responses in the brains of their receivers. The effect is most pronounced in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the insulae, and the precuneus - regions previously implicated in narrative engagement, self-relevance, and attention towards salient stimuli. We suggest that more effective health prevention messages have a greater potential to ‘reach into the brains of audience members’.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0313,2017,Poster,Coherent neural activity in the brain’s value system during antismoking messages is linked to reductions in smoking,6,"Cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of preventable death in the United States. One common strategy for reducing the prevalence of smoking and other health risk behaviors is the use of graphic warning labels (GWLs). This has led to widespread interest in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of GWL effectiveness. Here we investigated differences in how the brain responds to negative, graphic warning label-inspired antismoking ads and to neutral, compositionally matched ads, and we probed how this response related to future behavior. A group of smokers viewed negative and neutral antismoking ads while undergoing fMRI, and their smoking behavior was assessed before and one month after the scan. We found that greater coherence in activity within the brain’s valuation network during negative, behaviorally relevant ads than during neutral ads preceded behavior change, suggesting that the integration of information about message value and importance may be key for message uptake.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0314,2017,Poster,Virtually “In the Heat of the Moment”: Insula Activation Distinguishes Men Who in Real Life Were Sexually Risky Versus Safe,9,"HIV is most prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and although most MSM use condoms consistently during casual sex, some take risks. To better understand the psychology of those risky decisions, we examined neural correlates of playing a virtual sexual “hook up” game in an fMRI scanner in MSM who had, in the past 90 days, previously been sexually risky (N=76) or safe (N=31). We found that during potentially risky sexual choices, previously risky MSM had more insula activity – typically associated with desire and urge – than previously safe MSM. Trait measures provided greater clarity. Real-life sexual risk was related with trait negative urgency; this relationship was mediated by neural activity in an insular-centered network. Trait negative urgency could drive sexual risk by increasing the likelihood of taking a risk during safe sex negotiation.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology

The present study used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to test media imagery and peer feedback combinations on neural activity related to thin body ideals. Twenty-four healthy female participants rated body sizes of bikini models (‘too thin’ or ‘normal-weight’), directly followed by ostensible peer feedback (‘too thin’ or ‘normal-weight’). Consistent with prior studies on social feedback processing, results showed increased brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral insula in incongruent situations: When participants rated media models as ‘normal-weight’, while peer feedback indicated the models as ‘too thin’ (or vice versa). This effect was stronger for young females with lower self-esteem.

We propose that self-transcendence, the process of redirecting attention from self-interests to the wellbeing of others, is a key component promoting receptivity. To test this, sedentary adults were randomly assigned to a self-affirmation, self-transcendence, or control task before listening to health messages promoting physical activity in an fMRI scanner. Both self-affirmation and self-transcendence exercises elicited greater activity in the brain’s subjective value network (ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC]); however, self-transcendence exercise also recruited greater right temporal parietal junction activity, implicated in social cognition. In the subsequent health messages task, the affirmation and transcendence conditions produced comparable increases in vmPFC activity (relative to controls), a plausible neural index of message receptivity, which predicted decreases in sedentary behavior. These findings support self-transcendence as an effective health intervention strategy, and contribute to previous debates on the mechanisms of self-affirmation.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology

Discussion of Femen activism around the 2015 shooting at the free speech event in Copenhagen unveils the layering and interlacing of often hidden elements. This paper charts salient topics and concepts relating to the audio account of the attack, live-tweeting of the aftermath, and international media and Twitter discussions swarming around Femen leader Inna Shevchenko’s involvement in the event. Analysis of media artifacts relating to Shevchenko in the 2015 Copenhagen shooting event shows the thickness of actor-networks. Particular attention is paid to how Femen activism perseveres and makes effective use of event, vulnerability, witnessing, and social media. Layering upon layers of (re)mediation through the close-textual, audio, and qualitative Twitter analysis reveals that activism is almost equally dependent upon the contingencies of chance-encounters, as well as the persistent trail-blazing through multiple digital screens towards its own ethic of truths.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication

I argue that Papi’s rising to fame is a production of self dependent upon a very elaborate and powerful new media environment. Such environment has several technological and cultural features. First, there are burgeoning mobile phone users and micro-video consumptions on the mobile devices. Second, the technological capacities of mobile apps have enabled people to easily produce and share micro-videos. However, those apps are inherently gendered, with an emphasis on attracting young female users. Third, Chinese internet, under the stringent political control, is increasingly characterized by consuming entertaining content. Consequently, the popularity of Papi Jiang as a micro-celebrity is a process of employing networked technologies to construct an individual identity that caters to the broader online culture dominating current China.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication
2017-0320,2017,Poster,Is an Intervention Needed? Reframing Mobile Media Use to Encourage Critical Reflection,2,"Devices, once viewed as viable threats to the public sphere and public decorum, are now a ‘taken for granted’ presence in our daily interactions (Ling, 2012). This shift in perception has happened over the last 15 years with it ever increasing over the last four years with the proliferation of smartphone growth. Our paper begins at this nexus, between user, device, physical surroundings and the growth of virtual platforms. We attempt to consciously mark the emergence of a modern mobile media lifestyle to examine the possibility that the immersion of users into their devices and the immersion of devices into our physical/embodied environments may inhibit our ability to critically reflect on this technology. Utilizing data from five studies, researchers in London and New York identify entry points for reframing what is known about mobile media use to cultivate critical reflection that is need to guide future research.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication

This paper unpacks the concept and offers evidence of how “the possibility of connecting in transition” helps foreground how mobile communication is, and will continue to be, a uniquely meaningful context of media use.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication
2017-0322,2017,Poster,The Influence of Time Perception on Mobile Media Use,4,"This papers deals with the relation between sense of time, acceleration and the use of mobile media. The focus is as well on theoretical approaches towards the subject (from communica-tion studies, sociology and media-sociology) as on the empirical data from our quantitative study.
To avoid a retrospective consideration on media consumption, the study is conducted, using the Experience Sampling Method. This will be discussed on previous experience with the ESM and the specific requirements in our case. The Panel has 104 subjects (N = 2808 meas-ure points) and data was collected over the course of one week. The respondents were asked about their usage of the smartphone each of the last two hours.
The study shows a correlation between sense of time and electronic media use. Those correlations are to be considered closer, to tease out which factors are the context of (accelerated) sense of time. Furthermore clustered chronotypes are to be presented, which base on the self-evaluation-scale of the perception of pace of time in a given period.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication

This exploratory study investigates gratifications from posting food on Instagram and its relationship to personal traits like narcissism and shyness. Moreover, how these gratifications and personal traits can motive users’ attitudes and behaviors of posting food photos on Instagram. The results show that Instagram users who post food have six primary gratifications: self-promotion, escapism, information sharing, archiving, creativity and self-disclosure. Narcissism was a significant positive predictor of all six gratifications, while shyness positively predicted escapism. The implications of this study are discussed.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication
2017-0324,2017,Poster,Heartrate as an Implicit Measure of Event Segmentation,5,"A prominent status of psychophysiological measures’ application in communication research can be awarded to the observance of heartrate in the context of perceptual attention’s resource allocation. While research findings in the realm of the LC4MP (Lang, 2006) in particular support the measurement of heartrate as a reliable factor in order to address attention focused processes of mediated message processing, less research has focused proximately on working memory based mental representation processes that account for observations of memory formation, and retrieval as exemplarily observed in cognitive event perception research. Thus, our research draws on linking theories of event perception to heartrate as an implicit measure of audiovisual media processing. A common observation of research findings on heartrate’s orientating responses is that heartrate decelerates before people expect a change of an event or ensuing from unexpected occurences. Our preliminary findings suggest that these orientating responses likewise occur prior to event boundaries.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

A laboratory experiment including a pre- and post-survey was conducted. As an indicator of arousal (activation of the SNS) during stimulus exposure, participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA) was used. Data were analyzed by means of Structure Equation Modelling (SEM). Results indicate that physiological arousal indeed informs the cognitive processing of (persuasive) media messages in “opposing” directions. If physiological arousal is high, reactance is attenuated which is accompanied by a more positive message judgment. This counteractive pattern accordingly results in strengthened attitudes.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

A gap in our understanding is the way in which intrinsic rewards associated with a task motivate sustained control allocation. In three behavioral and one functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we use a naturalistic and open-sourced simulator to show that changes in the balance between task difficulty and an individual’s ability to perform the task result in different levels of intrinsic reward, which motivates dynamic shifts between networked brain states. High levels of intrinsic reward associated with a balance between task difficulty and individual ability are associated with increased connectivity between cognitive control and reward networks. By comparison, a mismatch between task difficulty and individual ability is associated with lower levels of intrinsic reward and corresponds to increased activity within the default mode network. These results implicate reward processing as a critical component of cognitive control.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0327,2017,Poster,Neural Sensitivity to Implicit vs. Explicit Communication,3,"Categorization represents the over-simplification of a near-infinite amount of information, so rather than become overwhelmed, people can rationally make sense of their experiences. However, doing so can also result in poor decisions when the “sense-making” is over-generalized, based on stereotypes, or biased towards the potential of negative consequences. Surprisingly, recent research reveals whether the categorization is expressed explicitly or implicitly can influence the subsequent decision and has been examined the categorization-decision paradigm. Temporally precise event-related potential (ERP) waveforms from scalp electroencephography (EEG) are well-suited to map neural activity onto sequential social cognitions processes like the categorization-decision paradigm. In particular, studying both P3 and CNV components can provide important insights about the way multiple components differentially process explicit versus implicit categorization and their effects on subsequent decisions. In addition, the temporal precision of neural correlates can help distinguish between implicit automatic stereotyping versus potentially more resource intensive constructive processes.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

For a long period of time, communication scholars have employed self-report measures of memory to answer this question. However, self-report measures may not necessarily provide an accurate index of what people remember. In the research reported here, we use a novel eye movement measure of memory for political information. We report here that eye movements can accurately detect memory for political information even when self-report responses fail to do so. Our results suggest that self-report measures may underestimate the amount of political information citizens learn from the media environment and highlight the utility of eye movement measures in accurately assessing what people remember.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Known as knowledge brokering, this process is commonly associated with unprecedented innovation. In utilizing brokered knowledge, researchers can fall victim to an “offramp problem” in which the underlying biological, psychological, or social mechanisms which were imported continue to advance in their specific subfields but remain static in media psychology. In this paper, the Limited Capacity Model for Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) is put forth as an example of brokered knowledge which has fallen victim to the “offramp problem”. To demonstrate, the LC4MP is reviewed with a focus on important findings and instances where results observed do not fit LC4MP predictions. We then introduce recent developments in related fields which help explain these anomalous findings, providing empirically testable paths forward. We conclude with practical suggestions for mitigating the “offramp problem”.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

It is hypothesized that hostile perceived gay-related public opinion (PGP), negative personal experience, and internalized homonegativity (IH) lead to reduced willingness to express one’s homosexuality in public. An empirical study among n =28.730 gay and bisexual men in Germany showed that positive PGP was associated with a higher, IH with a lower willingness to express homosexuality in public.

2017-0332,2017,Poster,Transitions in Polyamorous Identity and Intercultural Communication: An Application of Identity Management Theory,3,"This thesis examines the intercultural communicative strategies and non-monogamous identity formation of polyamorous individuals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the identity management tactics that polyamorous individuals utilize to navigate a society in which monogamy is the norm. Interactions of polyamorous individuals within a monoganormative society are treated as a type of intercultural communication due to the contrasting cultural identities and communication rules. E-interviews with 38 polyamorous individuals provided basis for phone and Skype interviews. The Retrospective Interview Technique (Huston, Surra, Fitzgerald, & Cate, 1981) required interviewees to recall development of their polyamorous identity and interactions with monogamous others from the past to present day. Twenty-two interviews produced the phases of identity management, including Trial and Error, Enmeshment (Mixing Up), and Renegotiation. Analyzing interviewees' communication also produced the themes of managing stigma and impressions of the relationship identity. Implications of the study include a richer understanding of polyamorous identity management, polyamory as a relationship orientation, and a new perspective in applying identity management theory.",Interpersonally Communicating About Sexuality,Interpersonal Communication

More specifically, this study (1) explores the relationship between communication during and after sex and tests whether orgasm mediates this relationship, and (2) examines whether communication during and after sex is associated with relationship satisfaction. Three-hundred and nineteen adults (237 women, 82 men) ranging in age from 18-32 years old (M = 19) completed a survey within two hours of a recent sexual episode addressing their communication during and after sexual activity. Results revealed that disclosures during sexual activity predicted the likelihood of orgasm, controlling for participants’ biological sex. More specifically, individuals who disclosed more positive feelings during sexual activity were more likely to orgasm than those who disclosed fewer positive feelings. Additionally, the more individuals disclosed positive thoughts and feelings for their partners during sexual activity, the more likely they were to continue disclosing such feelings immediately following sexual activity. Lastly, results revealed that disclosures during sexual activity were related to relationship satisfaction, as mediated by post sex communication. The implications of these findings for research on sexual satisfaction, relational health, and the post sex disclosures model are discussed.",Interpersonally Communicating About Sexuality,Interpersonal Communication

An Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior,2,"As smartphones have become an essential part of children’s lives, risks associated with smartphone use have raised concerns among parents. Parents implement a range of strategies to intervene in children’s media consumption. However, little is known about how parents deal with the new challenge, and why they make the choices they do regarding their children’s smartphone use. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study examines parents’ attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, and intentions regarding parental mediation of children’s smartphone use. A survey conducted with parents of young smartphone users aged 10-17 shows that parents tend to perceive discussion-based active mediation to be more desirable as compared to control-based restrictive mediation. Findings also indicate that the extent to which parents believe that they have control over their parental mediation practices plays the most important role in forming positive intentions to practice parental mediation, regardless of the mediation domain. We also discuss the implications of these findings and directions for future research.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication

A survey amongst 500 respondents indicates that digital natives hold significantly less prohibitive attitudes towards phubbing than do digital immigrants. Results also suggest that this difference is mediated by phubbing behavior, as digital natives were found to engage in phubbing behavior more frequently which, in turn, impacts their attitudes for the better. This suggest that perspectives on the social propriety of mobile phones are not universal, but dependent on generation and personal behavior.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication
2017-0338,2017,Poster,It’s How You Phub That Matters: An Experimental Study on Factors Explaining the Effect of Copresent Phone Use on Relational Outcomes,2,"This study investigated whether co-present phone use impacts impression formation, perceived conversation quality and perceived relationship quality more negatively when (1) the phone user’s posture and gaze display greater absorption in the phone, and (2) the co-present phone use is unannounced. To that end, a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment was conducted. The findings of the experiment revealed a main effect of absorption: when the phone user displays greater absorption in the mobile conversation, participants consider the phone user as less attentive and polite, and perceive the conversation quality and social attraction as lower. There was no main effect of announcing the behavior, nor was there an interaction effect. These results indicate that the non-verbal behaviors expressed when using one’s phone during a co-present conversation play a central role in explaining any negative effect.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication
2017-0339,2017,Poster,"How Does the Presence of the Typing Awareness Indicator, Length of Response Time and Message Brevity in Instant Messaging Platforms Affect Interpersonal Relationships?",1,"Instant messaging has grown rapidly to involve millions of users spanning a variety of platforms. Through an online experiment, this study offers a focused, quantitative test to examine the impact of the presence of the typing awareness indicator, length of time waited for a response and message brevity in instant messaging platforms on interpersonal relationships. Findings highlight that the presence typing awareness indicators build up the anticipation and anxiety for a profound response only to disappoint users with the inevitable banality of what their partners actually says. Rapid and detailed response is highly valued in the texting. The results on the social etiquette of IM use provides a window on when people think others, and presumably themselves, should be responsive and reply in detail in an IM conversation in order to maintain a healthy interpersonal relationship.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication

But what happens when large networks of people who are members of multiple overlapping teams try to microcoordinate their actions using a group-based mobile application? This case study of a pediatric hospital that encouraged their care providers to use a group-based mobile app on their personal mobile devices to coordinate patient care uncovered three primary considerations unique to microcoordinating at work. These included: the legacy of microcoordinating norms, population network complexity, and varying degrees of anonymity of hospital professionals. Together these themes explained why these care teams used a mobile app much like a dyadic interpersonal interaction. There was an additional thread that wove through these themes: disparity. Specifically, the disparities of hierarchy and power differences further explain microcoordinating at work.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication
2017-0341,2017,Poster,Mobile Sourcing: A Case Study of Journalistic Norms and Chat Apps Usage,2,"Since 2011, mobile chat applications have gained significant popularity worldwide and the leading chat apps have surpassed social networking platforms in user numbers. These apps have become the hosts for everyday communication among a wide variety of users, and (thanks to the functionalities of certain chat apps) have taken on significance in reporting. Especially in Asia, journalists have turned to those apps to complement face-to-face interactions to gather the news. Drawing on in-depth interviews with foreign correspondents based in China and Hong Kong, this article examines journalistic sourcing practices on mobile chat applications in contexts of surveillance and censorship. In light of theories of journalistic norms, this paper discusses three approaches journalists have taken when sourcing on chat apps: trust, master, or abandon the network. By studying journalistic practices using these three prisms, this paper provides an understanding of how journalists have constructed journalistic trust with sources using chat apps. This paper offers an exploratory study of how foreign correspondents socially constructed mobile chat apps as tools of reportage and as essential links in journalists’ networks of information.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication

Analyzing survey data from 527 young Chinese workers, the results show that Chinese young working adults primarily rely on using smartphone for work-related communication, followed by for achieving understanding and orientation goals. Organizational norm is the most influential factor which is associated with three dependency relations. Time criticality is found to be positively associated with understanding dependency and communication dependency, while task interdependence is positively associated with communication dependency. Task mobility has no association with work-related smartphone dependency relations. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0343,2017,Poster,Five Days Without a Smartphone: The Paradox Association Between Smartphone Use and Subjective Well-Being: Results From a Deprivation Study,3,"The study examined the association between smartphone use and subjective well-being (SWB). SWB is defined by cognitive (satisfaction with the current day and with social relations) and affective components (negative and positive emotions). Data were collected with a prolonged quasiexperimental deprivation study using qualitative interviews (n = 11) and quantitative diaries (n = 210). Generally, smartphone use seemed to have positive influences on SWB. However, results point to a paradoxical association concerning satisfaction with social relations. On one hand, the participants were significantly more satisfied with their social relations when they used their smartphones. On the other, social interactions via smartphone caused strong negative emotions. This paradox is interpreted by the concepts fear of missing out and the availability dilemma.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0344,2017,Poster,Mobile Communication in Interpersonal Relationships: The Effects of Relational and Interstitial Communication Patterns,3,"Mobile communication makes it easy to stay permanently in touch with friends and acquaintances. The classic relational communication pattern (less frequent, but long and intimate conversation) has been complemented by the interstitial communication pattern (frequent, but short and rather superficial messages). However, it is not clear whether and how these changed communication patterns influence relationship satisfaction. The present paper extends these studies by focusing on a broader range of relationships (friend vs. acquaintance; same vs. different city). In the first step, we examined how emotional closeness and geographical distance affect communication patterns via various channels. In the second step, we examined how frequency and content of messages affect relationship satisfaction. We found evidence for both, relational and interstitial communication, depending on the channel. In case of long text messages, intimacy was still an important predictor of relationship satisfaction; for short text messages and voice calls, frequency was more important.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication

Researchers called for investigations into collective and cooperative uses of the technology. Responding to these calls, we explored Myanmarian fishers’ use of mobile phone to fulfil a range of information needs in the individual, social and business realms. Interviews with 23 fishers in three regions in Myanmar suggested that both social and commercial as well as individual- and community-oriented uses were prevalent. A nuanced picture of use and non-use of mobiles emerged alongside fishers’ socio-economic status and patterns of fishing.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication

The paper examines those who were not yet adopters as well as those who had embraced the technology. In addition, the paper examines the situation of those who were exploiting the “spillover efficiencies” of mobile telephony by borrowing (sometimes for pay) the phones of others. The findings of the paper suggest that the early adopters reap efficiency benefits while those who lag behind have a weaker position. The paper also examines examples of some small-scale “sideline” activities enabled by the mobile phone, e.g. phone owners selling airtime to non-owners. At the same time, the affordances of the device threatened the core of other small-scale entrepreneurs.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication

This paper focuses on the transformation of the so-called informal economy, here in the form of street markets. Departing from stories of the women themselves we argue that the mobile phone, not the least through mobile money, changes the street market to also include non-street transactions in interesting and hybridized ways. Furthermore the women included in the study also bear witness on attempts – from city officials as well as local loan sharks – to formalize and control these women and their businesses, processes in which mobile telephony play an important role. On basis of these stories we argue that the celebration of the informality of these economies with its promise of empowering women financially needs to be reconsidered.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication

Results showed that all three motivational uses of mobile application – informational, relational, and recreational—had positive relationships with online expressive civic engagement. The results of the study further indicated that all three motivational mobile application uses led to continuous growth of online expressive civic engagements over the three-year period examined (2013-2015). The study advances the literature on mobile communication by introducing results of a longitudinal study that provides evidence for support of positive relationships between different motivational mobile uses and online expressive civic engagement that have in the past been speculated about but rarely put to an empirical test.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication

Although the phenomenon has be noticed by social scientists for decades, there is no systematic evidence on how persistent the impact a protest can be, how far it can transmit in geography, and what factors determine the transmission speed. Exploiting a unique dataset of collective actions happened in China between 2014 and 2015, we find that the influence of a protest on future protests can last for around a week in the same location, and for four days in neighboring prefectures. This pattern is also most salient for labor protests. Furthermore, no evidence indicates that the spatial correlation between protests is driven by common shocks, or the transmission can go beyond the first degree neighbors. Prefectures with higher fiscal capacity are more likely to experience protest diffusion.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Presenting a historical perspective, the paper argues that, though the liberalization of the media sector has enabled the media in Tanzania to focus more on issues that concern the viewers, listeners and readers, the post-colonial media, particularly Radio Tanzania - Dar es Salaam (RTD) in the 1970s was more successful in the war against corruption than the present media. The study findings established that factors such as media’s limited economic resources, the influence of politicians, the absence of laws to protect both the journalists and sources of information, death threats for refusing to take the money and kill stories related to grand corruption and lack of leaders with moral authority and a political will to hold high-level leaders accountable for their vices undermined the anti-corruption reportage efforts of the current media in the country.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The emergence of visually affective activist groups such as Femen disrupts hegemonic power structures and unveils potentials to see and act anew.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I
2018-0003,2018,Poster,"Capitals, Censorship and Risks: The Role of Social Media in Localised Small-Scale Environmental Protests",1,"Social networking media transforms contentious environmental movements in China. Unlike large-scale environmental protests in China, the small-scale protests are featured as isolated, disconnected and contained. However, social media is redefining voice articulation, power balances and capital accumulation in small-scale environmental movements.

By analysing seven cases of localised environmental movements, this paper explores the role of social networking media in helping and hindering localised small-scale environmental protests for local communities in China. It intends to critically assess how the use of social media affected the logics of a loosely self-organised local communities’ field in small-scale environmental protests. In doing so, it examines how social media afforded capital accumulation, employing Bourdieu’s theory of field. The results of this investigation indicate that social media has helped local protesters to acquire certain amounts of various forms of capital, namely cultural, social, symbolic and economic capitals, albeit in a limited way.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This paper introduces a Public Speaking for Social Justice Model that can be utilized in the introductory public speaking course. The model requires that students thoroughly examine a timely social justice issue, situate themselves and their classmates within the issue while featuring marginalized voices and narratives, seek a critical, well-researched understanding through sustained analysis and interrogation, and offer pragmatic solutions envisioned by those most affected by the issue in order to affect change. The model reflects many of the tenets of Critical Communication Pedagogy (CCP) and Communication Activism Pedagogy (CAP) and the paper discusses appraisals and limitations after utilizing the model for four years in introductory public speaking courses.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

A purposive survey was conducted of students attending two universities in Nigeria: the University of Lagos and the Rivers State University in Port Harcourt. Quantitative data were collected between May-June 2015 using a face-to-face, paper-based survey. Survey results indicate that mobile social networking applications (WhatsApp, 2go, Eskimi, Facebook, Badoo and YouTube) were used most by the protesters to plan, coordinate and mobilize for the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Some respondents used these applications to document their participation in the protest. Of the seven platforms analysed, Facebook was the most used for protest purposes while Eskimi increased the likelihood that a student attended the first day of the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Previous studies on the use of social media to facilitate participation in contentious politics have examined established legacy democracies or authoritarian regimes. Participation via social media in nascent democracies has been less well-documented – e.g. in those countries that democratized between the 1970s and the 1990s including those that recently returned to democracy from military dictatorship such as Nigeria. This study has been conducted to fill such a void.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Although existing studies about social media in political participation has investigated the diverse aspects of social media, there is a remaining question of how social media mobilizes resources from the fragmented online public. The present study conducts a qualitative textual analysis of the 274 posts on the Women’s March Facebook page to understand how different types of recourses were attained for the March. With the use of resources mobilization theory (Edwards & Gillham, 2013) as a theoretical framework, three themes were found to be a distinctive feature of the March: transparency, spreadable and participatory media, and legitimacy of the March. Each theme with illustrative examples will be discussed.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

This movement is active mainly on Facebook and stands for ethno-pluralism (i.e., diversity of cultures, each in a homogeneous society). Without a clear classification to a political wing, social-media users getting in contact with posts created by the GIM might have difficulties assessing what this movement stands for. For this reason, the current study examined strategic frames in memes (n = 184) posted by this movement on Facebook, with memes (usually image macros) being the GIM’s main form of communication. This study identified four strategic frames that represent a plurality of social issues; most of them were framed negatively. Solutions for problems were one-sided and focused on supporting the movement (e.g., financially or through protest). Since strategic frames represent the GIM’s collective identity, this study found indicators that classify the movement as right wing.","Activism, Communication and Social Justice Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In the present study, we determined children’s cue reactivity by measuring their attentional awareness via eye-tracking and considered all three theoretically derived aspects. Participants’ visual attention to unhealthy and healthy food cues (i.e., type of food) presented in different levels of interactivity with a character (i.e., level of integration) was recorded while children were viewing a self-created media content. Afterwards, we asked children about their hunger level (i.e., individual susceptibility). Our results indicated that children dwell on unhealthy food cues longer than on healthier ones, but first fixation duration didn’t differ between healthy and unhealthy food. Furthermore, an increase in the level of integration led to an increase in visual attention. Our findings showed no moderating impact of hunger.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

In an experiment, we showed children a cartoon, either presenting no food, presenting one child eating raspberries, or presenting all children eating raspberries. As a mediator, children’s majority awareness, that is, awareness of other peers’ liking of raspberries was measured. As the dependent variable, we assessed children’s choice of raspberries and tested the moderating role of food neophobia measured by parental surveys. We found that children in the majority condition did not increase their awareness of other peers liking raspberries compared to the control condition. The minority condition, however, led children to conclude that most peers do not like raspberries compared to the control. This decreased their own consumption of raspberries. In addition, children with high levels of food neophobia exposed to the minority stimulus were less likely to choose raspberries compared to children in the majority condition.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Building on John Bowlby’s Attachment Theory, we focused on how mothers' smartphone use is related to maternal sensitivity. Using the Mini-Maternal Behavior Q-Sort method and a post-survey questionnaire, we collected data from 89 mother-child dyads on playgrounds. Results showed that mothers who used their smartphones longer had lower sensitivity ratings, whereas there was no association between low sensitivity ratings and the frequency of use. With regard to particular kinds of smartphone use, we found that mothers who communicated more with friends or family were more sensitive to their children when we controlled for duration and frequency of use. We discuss the boundary conditions of how using a smartphone for certain reasons and time-periods might be compatible with being a sensitive caregiver.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

From the analysis emerges that adolescents have internalized a series of stereotypes and myths of romantic love that can be very dangerous because they justify violence of men towards women. But it is the same series representation that leads viewers to question the myths, and thus, to talk about gender violence among adolescents, to reflect on it and the dangers of romantic idealization. This happens because the series presents a risky representation and raises the dilemmas openly, without trying to be moralizing with the audiences.","Children, Adolescents and the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

While these emotions are invaluable to promote greater human connectedness, an outward orientation, prosociality, and human flourishing, to date, researchers are not well-equipped to identify them either on mass media or private communication channels. Approaching from an interdisciplinary perspective, we aimed to construct a computational tool that can empower researchers to identify and analyze self-transcendent emotions among textual messages. To that end, we constructed and validated a dictionary tool that can be uploaded into the mainstream, textual analytic software (e.g., LIWC) to identify terms associated with transcendence-related emotional experiences as expressed in spoken and written languages.

A similarly important task is to improve organizational decision-making in financial investment firms. Financial companies invest public and private resources and thus their returns fundamentally affect retirement funds and planning, corporate earnings, and economic growth. Despite the far-reaching implications of good organizational decisions, the question about how communication dynamics within companies can result in collective intelligence requires further investigation. Can different patterns of communication or changes in the content of communication over the course of decisions be used to improve decisions? In this study, we show that collective intelligence signals deduced from communication patterns predict the movement of the market.

These limitations are a product of the very real limitations on human attention that prevent scholars from watching every movie that has been released. As such, we propose a computational approach for estimating the latent political positions, what we refer to as \textit{film slant}, of over 5 million films. To do so, we adapt a Bayesian item response theory model for large sparse matrices intended for roll call analysis and apply it using an Expectation-maximization algorithm to trace user data in the form of film reviews (N=~20,000,000). We find that this method is valid, both in regards to the ideological positions of films, but also their viewers. We finally turn our attention to some substantive results and demonstrate, through an analysis of the dynamics of the central tendency of our set of films, that the film industry does not have any specific liberal bias, but rather partakes in a form of negative polarization in which the system responds in opposition to the ideological position of the sitting American president.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

2018-0022,2018,Poster,Reexamine Third Person Effects in the Context of Collective Actions,2,"Abstract
This study employs the third-person effects hypothesis to examine media effects in promoting public engagement in fighting climate change as a collection action.
In line with the collective interest model, which emphasizes that individuals’ decision of participating in collective action depends on their perception of others’ performance and individuals’ worry about free-rider effects would refrain them form taking action, this study reexamined both the perceptual and behavioral components of TPE. A nationally door-to-door survey was conducted in Singapore (N= 705). The results showed that individuals’ perception of others’ media attention leads them to develop third-person perception of media influence. In regards to behavioral component, the more people believe that others are influenced by media messages than themselves; the more likely they would engage in pro-environmental behaviors. This relationship was shaped by attitude, social norms, and collective efficacy.

However, the 21st Century has seen increased skepticism towards the scientific community. Studying expert-to-expert communication among low carbon energy professionals may help to reverse this trend by suggesting ways to facilitate a sense of identification between the lay public and energy professionals. Textual analysis of these interactions indicates that the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry’s identity is shaped by the frontier myth, which remains central in US culture. Awareness of their common reliance on this mythology may contribute to public identification and engagement with wind energy specifically, and energy-related science more generally.",Environmental Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Although initially reactive, there has been a recent uptick in corporate communication about climate change. While several studies have evaluated business actions and communication about climate change, they have several limitations: idiosyncratic nature of studies that limit cross-country comparisons and benchmarking, understudy of corporations outside the US and Western Europe even if they feature in lists of top companies, and less robust methodologies of frequency counts, among others. This study compares top New Zealand companies—a country advertised as “100% pure” for its clean and green image—with top Australian and Fortune Global 500 companies on corporate communication about climate science, and opportunities and barriers for business engagement with climate change. Based on a indices developed from previous studies, a quantitative analysis of 59 corporations latest (2017) non-financial reports finds that New Zealand companies largely lag behind Australian companies, who appear to perform equally, if not better, compared to the top Global 500 companies on different dimensions of business communication and engagement with climate change. Over half of the companies reported several climate science dimensions, while only a minority of companies reported or agreed with scientific consensus. External and internal stakeholders, regulation, and new opportunities were identified as primary drivers. Few barriers were reported, including company’s growth offsetting emission reductions, uncertainty in policies, with uncertainty about the science and impacts of climate change reported scarcely. Findings indicate that business has reached an inflection point on climate change, with businesses reporting more opportunities than barriers.

A total of 70 participants (47.1% men) took part in a lab experiment that manipulated stereotype threat (i.e., the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one’s group) between playing a video game (Bejeweled 3). Participants performed generally worse after reading a fictitious article on gaming research that women would still play less and perform worse in games than men (ST condition). In contrast to males, however, female participants reported greater frustration from reading this article than their colleagues who read that women and men no longer differ in terms of playing frequency and performance skills (no ST condition). Interestingly, a reverse pattern of results was obtained for male participants, who reported a stronger negative effect of the article in the no ST condition on their ability to show their best gaming performance.

Research has shown that playing certain video games can improve visuospatial skills, which has been linked to predominance in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), where women are vastly underrepresented. With large gender gaps in STEM, video games may be one of the most culturally-pervasive media able to spatially train individuals. Adams and Mayer (2012) proposed that the Matthew Effect could explain females' lack of play: those with higher spatial skills, traditionally men, seek out and play games with higher spatial demands, thus beginning the cycle of enjoyable spatial training. In this study, we assess whether non-gaming females prefer games which match their spatial abilities, or if preferences are predicted by gender themes/level of interactivity. Results indicate little influence of ingoing spatial ability on preference, and an unexpected preference for masculine games. Implications for games, their gendered themes/appeal, and potential use as a spatially education tool are discussed.",Game Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Using a between-subject experiment (N=115), we compared the results of 360-degree advertising provided by devices with different levels of perception naturalness (Head-mounted display, mobile device, and computer as high, medium, and low natural mapped perception systems, respectively). The results revealed that participants who watched IVR advertising using a more natural mapped perception system reported greater levels of perceived naturalness than did those who used devices with lower levels of naturalness. Furthermore, the natural mapped perception was positively linked to the sense of presence, which, in turn, enhanced advertising enjoyment and further improved the immersive virtual reality advertising effects, thereby yielding a three-step serial mediation model.

Conceptualizing dialectic values advocacy outlines the changing values among contemporary, common stakeholders as well as the means for communicating these values superficially to promote unanimity among publics and organizations.

The perception that cyberbullying is beneficial for the bully in turn predicts engagement in cyberbullying. In addition, peer group talks are directly associated with cyberbullying perpetration. These relationships however only hold true for adolescents who do not yet perceive themselves as sufficiently autonomous. The results may inform bullying preventing programs as they show that fostering prosocial means of becoming more agentic and independent may prevent teenagers from engaging in cyberbullying.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

A mobile app was created to encourage students report their emotions about the STEM related course right before class throughout entire quarter. Initial evidence suggests that as the quarter progressed, the arousing negative emotions were reported more often while the arousing positive emotions were reported less. At the midterm exam day, arousing negative emotions were also more prevalent compared to arousing positive emotions. The impact of these reports on academic performance will be assessed once the quarter ends.

We postulate that early socialization processes affect political expressive behaviors indirectly through different patterns of media use. Adding another layer to the existing scholarship, we propose that personal values such as institutional trust and perceived freedom to talk provide important cognitive antecedents that not only guide media use but also channel media’s effects on expressive behaviors. This dynamic is examined with a particular focus on how digital media contribute to civic development. Most importantly, we compare the effects of key socializing forces on different forms of political expression across generations, providing a fuller understanding of how contemporary citizens take shape.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The most common ethical violations were revealing client confidences; then lack of loyalty, competency, and honesty. Legal professionals who are major characters tend to violate more ethical responsibilities, and bring about more consequences to clients and the society. Televised portrayals did not differ according to the race or ethnicity, age, or gender of the characters, or their practice setting, and did not differ according to provider (i.e., broadcast, cable, or Internet). Results were discussed using the theoretical framework of mass media influence, suggesting that program viewing contributes negatively to seeking legal services, due to the confidentiality issues and negative consequences. This can become more pronounced, as providers offer increased access to television programs.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

Four dimensions of factors – language, country attributes, communication resources, and economic power – were used to explain country presence on Twitter in five languages. All Tweet mentions from each of 210 countries were derived from the service of Crimson Hexagon. Findings identify trends that differ substantially from the pattern found in news flow literature. The salient countries on Twitter overall are more diverse and vary dramatically from language to language. The worlds presented and discussed in the five examined languages are significantly different, with English Tweets distinguishing themselves from those in four other languages. Shared language factor is found to predict well for Tweets in Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, and Portuguese but not in English. Country attributes predict better for Tweets in English while economic power of countries is positively related to their Tweets in both English and Chinese.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

For this purpose, a content analysis and subsequently a meta-analysis were applied. I find the basic assumption of a positive education-knowledge relationship to be clearly supported. The size of the relationship depends on the topic, the knowledge measure, the study design, the sampling method, the education measure and the method of data collection, but appears unaffected by the setting, the country of data collection, the data type, and publication bias. The central assumption of the original knowledge gap hypothesis, that an increase of mass media information within a social system fosters knowledge divides between those with lower and higher formal education, is overall not strongly supported by the findings of the here examined literature. Thus, doubts about the validity of the knowledge gap hypothesis were not dispelled, but rather nourished.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

How the media portrays cities and whether such representations are positive or negative have also not received significant academic attention, however. The purpose of this study is to investigate how different media portrays a metropolis. Specifically, this study examines how city promotional videos and television dramas portray a city, whether positively or negatively. This study identifies three information sources that affect city image perceptions, which are induced, autonomous, and organic forms of communication.

Building on these findings, the present study examines the possible effect of exposure to a fictional character on persuasive outcomes of an advertisement starring the same actor. In an experiment, individuals watched a segment from a movie in which the same actor played a role of either a sympathetic character or a villain. Then, participants watched a public service announcement (PSA) in which the same actor endorsed a charitable hospital. Results support social-psychological theories of attribution and theories of celebrity persuasion. Upon exposure to the actor in a role of a villain, viewers rated the actor’s personality less positively, listed more anti-advertisement thoughts, and were less persuaded by the PSA than viewers of positive character version of the movie. These findings advance theories of media psychology and offer practical implications.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session I

The project proposed that different romantic trajectories, or being on-time in romantic initiation compared to off-time (either early or late), might alter the media effect relationships found. Findings from young adults between 18 and 23 (N = 695) indicated that past romantically-oriented television exposure directly influences penetrative sex estimate discrepancies and indirectly influences dating and romantic relationship estimate discrepancies but does not directly or indirectly influence oral sex estimate discrepancies. Generally, whether participants themselves were early, on-time, or late in terms of their romantic development had little influence on the media effects found.

However, the majority of models depicted in advertisements are strongly physically dissimilar to average individuals in society. The following study attempts to gain insight into the level of model physical attractiveness in advertisements and the influence it has on a female’s perception of their own body. Specifically, the study will examine whether the attractiveness of the model will be impacted by consumer attitudes regarding their own self-esteem, body image, and social comparison tendencies. A quasi-experimental design compared exposure to a non-gendered product advertisement featuring either an attractive model, a realistic-looking model, or no model. Findings revealed that the no model condition was most effective for the likelihood to purchase a non-gendered product.

By applying Hall’s encoding and decoding and Habermas’ public spheres, three research questions were addressed regarding audience members’ polysemic interpretations of social and cultural constructions in Chinese mainstream media. Via a thematic analysis of audience moments under each post on its official Sina Weibo account of Oriental Pearl Live Newsroom, this study identified three themes from the online public sphere concerning controversial social issues: 1) Government is the core; 2) Request for the rule of law; 3) Media is a paradox. This study supports conceptualizing audience members as citizens. It demonstrates how audience members deconstruct the dominant interpretations of social values and their attempts to elaborate less-favorable voices in transitional Chinese society. Active audience citizenship implies audience members’ desires in creating diverse public spheres and promoting civil society.

This study examines how dimensions of perceived trust in mobile advertisers (ability, benevolence and integrity) mediate the negative effect of privacy concern on intention to use app-based LBA. Analyzing web survey data from 658 Taiwanese smartphone users with LBA experiences, the SEM results show that privacy concern negatively affects intention to use app-based LBA; however, mediated by perceived trust, privacy concern turns to a positive effect on use intention. Among dimensions of perceived trust, integrity is the only mediator influencing privacy concerns and use intention of app-based LBAs. Specifically, privacy concern negatively predicts integrity of mobile advertiser which turns to a positive effect on use intention.

The Labour government went to great lengths to silence or cripple the remaining continental commercial broadcaster – Radio Luxembourg -- that sought to resume its pre-war influence among British radio listeners. The abysmal state of the consumer market in post-war Britain made the job easier. Also, the government, along with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), tried to bolster the commercial-free public service model in most areas under British influence.

Nevertheless, research on the hands-on education is scarce. Drawing on the theory of professionalization, this analysis examines journalists’ attitude toward the traineeship in the early 20th century. Therefore, debates in the publications of the two major journalistic organizations were investigated: Deutsche Presse (DP) of the bourgeois Reichsverband der deutschen Presse and the social democratic Mitteilungen des Vereins Arbeiterpresse (MdVA). All in all, 46 articles were analyzed over the period of 1913 to 1933 by means of a qualitative content analysis. The study reveals that bourgeois journalists discussed the Volontariat mainly with respect to social issues and vocational prestige. More practice-oriented, social democratic journalists reflected the practicability of traineeships for their partisan newspapers.

The finding of this study suggests that improving website usability benefits not only web users with disabilities but also users without disability.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0092,2018,Poster,The Effectiveness of Disclosure Modality and Explicitness on Perceived Sponsorship Transparency,2,"As the lines between User-Generated commercial and noncommercial content are blurring, it is becoming more challenging for audiences to identify and understand the commercial intent and content. Regulators have developed guidelines that require vloggers to disclose any sponsored content. Yet, the rules are unclear on what disclosures should look like. Moreover, scarce research attention has been focused on the effectiveness of disclosures. Only recently has a measure been devised to assess the extent to which audiences perceive the commercial intent revealed by a sponsored message – the perceived sponsorship transparency (ST, Wojdynski, Evans, & Hoy, 2017). In a 3 (Disclosure Modality: Single Visual, Single Verbal, Dual) x 2 (Disclosure Explicitness: High, Low) x 2 (Message) within subjects experiment, this study examines the effects on perceived sponsorship transparency. Dual-modality and verbal disclosures can help viewers identify their commercial intent and content, as compared to visual disclosures.

Based on a study of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS), this paper explores alternative agents of communication policy. More specifically, through document analysis we examine the way in which the Rural Utilities Service has shaped rural broadband policy in the United States over the last three decades. The implications for this research are wide, as it brings another policy actor into the policy making melee, and pushes communication policy scholars to consider the role that non-traditional communication regulators, particularly utility regulators, play in the communication policy making process.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

An Empirical Analysis on U.S. County Government Online Portals,4,"Although many studies have investigated how website accessibility standards such as Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 have been implemented on government websites., very little research has been done about what could influence the accessibility of e-government sites. Based the organizational innovation model proposed by Berry, this study examines 342 websites of U.S. county government websites and analyzes how several factors, such as government resources, external pressure and government leadership, influence the accessibility of the sites. The result indicates that per capita income, population with disabilities and educational attainment of county residents are the most important predictors of county government websites. County budget and the regional impact of large cities are also potential influencers. The findings of this study have implications for improving the accessibility of e-government as well as the online portals of more general organizations.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This study is among the first to compare three different ethnic groups in their political knowledge, and four types of online and offline participation. ANOVA results reveal that each ethnic group does better than others in a different kind of engagement. Multiple regression models show that older, male, and richer individuals have a higher level of political knowledge. The ethnic majority has a higher level of online-civic participation, and men are more likely than women to be involved in online-political participation. Therefore, both a digital divide and democratic divide still exist today.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Literature suggests that adequate access to credible health information is essential to achieve better health outcomes. However, few studies have systematically examined U.S. Hispanics’ health information seeking beliefs and behaviors. Based on bidimensional model of acculturation and comprehensive model of information seeking, our study investigated how U.S. Hispanics’ acculturation to U.S. and Hispanic cultures is related to their trust and seeking health information from Internet, interpersonal sources, and traditional media. We conducted structural equation modeling analysis of data from 2009-2012 Annenberg National Health Communication Surveys. Results suggested that U.S. Hispanics had different acculturation strategies, which were differentially associated with their trust and seeking health information from various information sources. Trust in an information source mediated the relationship between acculturation and health information seeking from the source.

We supposed that ethno-cultural heterogeneity of these eight republics should somehow correlate with the number of ethnic media registered and issued there. In other words, the bigger the size of titular nation in the republic, the bigger the number of ethnic media there, and thus the bigger opportunites for ethnic groups to voice up their opinions, values and needs in a broader social context. The research revealed a number of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of online ethnic media, the challenges they face today (lack of original content in ethnic languages, clear dependence of the number of ethnic media upon the level of digital inequality in the country, etc.), some trends of their development, the role of the state in creating and supporting such media, and much more.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

By drawing upon semi-structured interviews with diverse individuals in Australia, who are from a range of cultural and migratory backgrounds, this paper examines how participants construct racialised ‘Otherness’ and engage with difference. It draws upon the notion of political listening, paying attention to the anticipatory positions that open up the potential for mainstream media to transcend representational binaries that oscillate between silence and sensationalism. However, it also analyses the paradoxical forms of anti-Muslim sentiment that are simultaneously deployed by participants in their criticism of media. This paper concludes by considering how certain media outlets might better facilitate political listening, utilising the participants’ conceptualisations of key spaces for enhancing everyday mediated recognition.",Ethnicity and Race in Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Yet the same events can also be interpreted as new opportunities for people to voices their demands. Thus Trumpism is paradoxical: it is democracy suppressing when it is used right wing movements against non-dominant groups, but it can enhance democracy if inverted, akin to using a master’s tools to dismantle the master’s house. But on a lighter note, Trumpism can be equated to the return of the carnivalesque, a tradition that gave voices to the common people by suspending rules of social engagement. Trumpism, just like during the carnival, removes hierarchy and allow fools to become wise, kings to eat with beggars and facts to be accompanied with fiction. This suspends normal non-carnival life.

Through the lens of feminist theory and embodiment, this study examines how the gendered experience plays out for women in a particular niche of photojournalism, concert photography. Considered a branch of lifestyle journalism, concert photography provides a glimpse into our society and culture. In-depth interviews with male and female concert photographers show women still face a form of patriarchal oppression in the field.

These stereotypes are continually communicated to various audiences through different media channels, including works written by women of the area. The continued representation becomes problematic as the women of the region internalize the stereotype, which leads to the appearance in their works even if they do not agree with that representation. The worst of these stereotypes allow women of the area to be dehumanized and essentially become a caricature to be referenced as hillbilly or mountain women. Using a literary analysis of three short stories produced by recognizable female authors of the region, the stereotype is identified within their works and leads to the discussion of the potential consequences for communication, as well as what the appearance of this stereotype means for the women themselves.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

During the campaign, the spouses were reported on more frequently than during previous campaigns; one couple was gay, and one was straight. What the newspapers reported about the spouses, how balanced the coverage of them was, and how intimate issues in the relationships were described in public were analyzed. The method was a qualitative content analysis. The results show the role of the spouse was treated as was traditional in newspapers, but a gay spouse muddled the traditional gendered frames a little. The level of privatization seemed to be high, and the couples used different strategies to protect their privacy. In addition, methodological challenges and the political meaning of the coverage of the spouses are discussed.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Given the issues above, this study utilizes a culture-centered approach to health communication (Dutta, 2007) to interrogate critically the discourses of the residents of Charleston, in the heart of Appalachia, surrounded by coal-mining industries and chemical plants. The study investigates how the residents belonging to low socio-economic status (SES) received information about the chemical spill, and the ways in which they made sense of environmental disaster as they experienced it.

The results showed that the largest share of message postings on the selected discussion boards concerned perceived barriers of isotretinoin. This suggested that acne sufferers were able to realize side effects of the medication. However, the discussed side effects (i.e., dryness and initial breakouts) are not the most serious. Physicians should more address adverse effects of the medication (i.e., miscarriage and hepatitis) with patients. Significant differences across the two message boards regarding perceived susceptibility and benefits of isotretinoin, self-efficacy, and cues to action in the posted messages were also found.

Despite the high rate, most Koreans tend to perceive suicide as something unrelated to them or a problem for someone else. Stigma surrounding suicide is associated with increasing suicide rates. Although suicide stigma affects blind recognition of suicide risk across culture, the existence of stigma itself is a complex sociocultural issue. Above all, since stigma is formed and reinforced through social interaction, understanding the sociocultural context can help address the underlying structure of suicide stigma and antecedents of suicide stigma. The purpose of this study was to examine the cultural attributions affecting suicide stigma in Korea.

It argues that the transition of the East German press cannot be understood without taking into consideration early media policy influences and market pressures of the West German media industries. For this it focuses on the lobbying efforts of the major (West German) publishing houses Heinrich Bauer (Hamburg), Axel Springer Publishing House (Berlin) and Gruner+Jahr (Hamburg). What is being presented is the early “the behind the scenes” work that made for media policies still influencing current distribution structures in the Eastern part of Germany.",Media Industry Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0128,2018,Poster,Polishing a Scratched Record; or the Epideictic Power of Record Store Day,1,"Record Store Day is a celebration that stands against a music market that attributes value to mediums which maximize profit through storability and ease of reproduction. I read RSD as an epideictic text, which aims to praise as virtues music’s synesthetic qualities in order to generate a disposition for action in music consumers. Its celebration “baits” customers into record stores, where they can rediscover, by means of practice, the qualities that differentiate music mediums outside of digital and web-based technologies. I use Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of “habitus” to explain why the synesthetic qualities of music proper to analogue technologies are hard to point out and to commensurate with other mediums. I then propose that, Record Store Day, as an epideictic text, is an exceptional way to revive record stores, and show how epideictic discourse provides an escape from a socially imagined false binaries and the concept of obsolescence.",Media Industry Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This paper explores the emergence of certain cultural discourses articulated in artistic, architectural, and social spaces in rural Estonia. More specifically, the paper argues that the metamodern (Vermeulen & Akker, 2010) expressions in rural Estonia’s art, architecture, and social movements serve as alternative spaces where the post-Soviet, postmodern urban hegemony and nihilism can be resisted. The utopian hope for a progressive country life expressed in these platforms keeps rural Estonians searching for something they may never find, which is why they never stop the search for it, and act as if (the better) rural life does exist.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This urges us to constantly think about the functionality and positionality of deadness of sound dynamically and contextually. Starting from a revisit of classic Marxist labor theory, I examined the particularity of sound in the live musical performances in the 1970s by analyzing two videos. I examined how sound is represented, appropriated, and interpreted by studying the connection between the physical gestures and sonic results of the performers. I hope to further push the boundaries of sonic intermundane by putting it into a conversation with postmodernity. I argue that sound is a legitimate intersectional point to articulate the interrelationship between the intermundane, (televised) musical performances, and labor theory.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0133,2018,Poster,Financial Literacy as Human Capital: Self-Responsibility in the Age of Neoliberal Governmentality,1,"This paper considers financial literacy in terms of neo-Foucauldian notions of governmentality. It traces the origins and evolution of the term, arguing that the notion of financial literacy is reflective of contemporary neoliberal governmentality. In support of this argument, a close reading is conducted of the entire corpus of The New Times’ articles that include the term financial literacy, from the term’s inception to the present, with special attention paid to the ways in which the meaning of the term has changed over time. Drawing on Thomas Lemke, Wendy Larner, and other scholars of Foucauldian governmentality, this paper concludes that contemporary deployments of the term are reflective of the ascension and hegemony of governmentality. It further suggests that contemporary use of the term serves to naturalize neoliberal values of self-improvement and self-entrepreneurship that are themselves imbricated with a discourse of human capital that underpins neoliberal governmentality.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0134,2018,Poster,Opening the Black Box of Online Rating Systems: The Co-construction of Users and Uber’s Rating System,1,"While the discussion has largely focused on how online rating systems help provide “objective” knowledge to inform consumers’ decisions, little attention is paid to how the identities of rating systems and users are mutually constructed. This paper demonstrates how the social construction of technology (SCOT) and semiotic approaches within science and technology studies help open the black box of rating systems. A preliminary assessment of the utility of these approaches is gleaned from a case study of Uber’s rating system. I identify Uber and its drivers as relevant social groups and search for their multiple interpretations of the rating system. I contend that Uber appealed to its “community guidelines” and design decisions to script the rating system as a form of labor management. Yet, Uber drivers articulated various tactics to resist or game the rating system. This case affords opportunities for considering the interpretative flexibility of online rating systems.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Touching on overlapping concepts from rhetoric, gender studies, disability studies, and queer theory, the discussion explicates fictional encounters with radical alterity in the films ""Her"" and ""Frank"" to show that attempted respite from frustrating, confusing, and frightening interactions limits our voice and voices by rejecting difference as a rhetorical construct, as opposed to the unifying persuasive intent that generally pervades, which more likely involves an attempt to change Others rather than allowing our mutual differences to generatively remain.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2018-0139,2018,Poster,Urban Preserves: Coworking and Middle-Classed Resilience,1,"This essay explains how urban infrastructure can placate the sense of middle-class dislocation. Commonly called “a happiness business,” the coworking movement indicates how telecommuting, or its providence of branded coffee and cool workspaces, may represent a utopia of information work. Given that many coworking users are precarious freelancers however, this utopia is necessarily also an attempt to stitch together a fraying sense of middle-class coherence. Using fieldwork interviews and discourse analysis of coworking materials, I argue that coworking allows us to understand first, an affective politics, namely the reframing of precarity from a structural condition to a state of individual loneliness. Second, it indicates a reengineering of the middle-classed good life, where acts of resilience are described to bring people closer to true happiness. Last, coworking infrastructure materializes these affective conditions through human and non-human factors.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

To put this case in perspective, this paper draws on Althusser’s theory of Ideological State Apparatus to analyze how popular nationalism coalesces with state-led hegemony. Supported by textual and semiotic analyses, it reveals that the state-centric ideology is realized through the interpellation of spontaneous popular expressions and the recourse to local and traditional cultural symbols; and that political power is thereby extended into the private and aesthetic realms. It shows how a global music genre and youth subcultural resources could be co-opted locally to strengthen the state’s ideological control. In the end, this paper critically assesses the limitation of this ideotainment project through the lens of Benjamin’s notions of ""aura"" and ""allegory"", pointing to the risk of hollowing out local cultural symbols for politically didactic ends.","Philosophy, Theory and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We conducted an online experiment with a between-subjects design. Participants (N = 228) read the same news story, but were told that the news was from an either pro-Republican, neutral, or pro-Democrat news outlet. We found that attributing a news story to a news outlet aligned with an opposing party influenced the perception of news bias, irrespective of the leaning of the story. More importantly, partisans perceived the news to be biased only if they had pre-existing skepticism toward the news outlet. Our findings suggest that cross-cutting exposure (i.e. consuming news from outlets aligned with an opposing party) may not produce desirable outcomes because pre-existing skepticism towards an out-group news outlet can undermine the perceived credibility of the news produced by the outlet.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We show through topic modeling of 21,919 articles how Breitbart established itself as the counterpublic top-tier outlet for the right-wing, how it covered both topics from the mainstream as well as from the far right, and show that Fox News and Breitbart influence each other’s election coverage, specifically on the topic of immigration. We are thus able to show that Breitbart functions as a bridge between the far-right and the more moderate right-wing.

Using examples from American religious freedom jurisprudence, I argue that Christian liberalism helps us to better understand the unequal distribution of accommodations for religious groups. The concept also elucidates the tension between claims that Christianity is a generic feature of the American public sphere, as well as a set of beliefs requiring specific state protections. This dual dimension of Christian liberalism helps to account for the ways that so-called neutral religious expressions (such as “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance) go uncontested while other specific theological claims become the basis for religiously-based exemptions from federal law (such as the Hobby Lobby decision, upholding corporations’ right to refuse full compliance with the ACA’s contraceptive mandate).",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

2018-0162,2018,Poster,Representing Anxious Parents in China: a study of ‘Parenting Science’ magazine 1980- 2016,1,"This paper analyses the representation of parental practices in Parenting Science, the first and longest running parenting magazine published in China since 1980. Drawing on Foucault’s work on governmentality and biopolitics, this paper critically investigates the discourses that surround parental practices relating to the health and development of young children, exploring issues of medicalisation, intensive parenting, responsibility and self-management. Based on a qualitative content analysis of 2,295 items from 37 issues of the magazine (1980-2016), including editorials, feature stories, standard articles, Q&As, adverts and other short items, this paper has identified three major discourses of parental practices in monitoring and facilitating children’s health, development and wellbeing: 1) the medicalisation of children’s health problems, 2) the rise of expert authority, 3) and the responsibilisation of parents. This paper argues that these discourses underpin the construction of an intensive and anxious parenting culture in China, a country characterised by rapid socioeconomic and cultural changes.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0163,2018,Poster,"The NFL Takes a Knee: Corporate Appropriation of Patriotism, Race, and Activism",1,"On Friday, September 22, 2017, President Trump described any National Football League player who protested during the national anthem as a “son of a bitch” deserving to be fired. In response, during the following NFL games’ performance of the national anthem, entire teams linked arms, knelt, or stayed in the locker room. This paper will use these events to explore the nature of the NFL’s brand and its ability to appropriate notions of patriotism, race, and activism. As a part of the military-industrial-media-entertainment network, the NFL has branded itself as simultaneously being an apolitical space and being politically unified in favor of American militarism. The commitment to these values is strong enough to hijack activist pregame actions associated with raising awareness of racist policing and social injustice, and turn them into messages consistent with the league’s brand.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2018-0164,2018,Poster,Mimetic Production in Children’s YouTube Toy Unboxing Videos,2,"This paper contributes to research on children’s participation on social media by analysing children’s ‘toy unboxing’ videos. Toy unboxing videos are a popular genre on the video-sharing platform YouTube, in which children and adults record themselves unpacking various commercial toys.

Drawing on data produced through a content analysis of 100 recent toy unboxing videos, this paper analyses five key categories – production, actors, narration, products, and branding. The findings indicate that children’s modes of production as amateur content producers both shape and are shaped by the shared and standardised conventions of this genre.

We argue that the reciprocal relationship between professional and amateur content production can be best understood through the concept of ‘mimesis’, which characterises the qualities of play and commercialisation within the toy unboxing genre.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

I analyzed 25 popular, online promotional videos through the lens of social memory to explore how these companies are constructing binge-viewers through the memories of 20th couch potatoes. My findings indicate that these commercials use nostalgia for 20th century public service announcements (PSAs) to paint fears of prolonged television consumption as outmoded through the rhetorical devices paromologia and reductio ad absurdum. In so doing these they fix the social memory of 20th century broadcast television outside of contemporary streaming video technology and binge-watching culture. This polemic use of memory serves to brand binge-viewers as culturally ambivalent, self-aware, and agentic, while reinforcing the contemporary narrative of TV’s “platinum age.” Furthermore, the use of nostalgia in these promos subverts convention and complicates the term’s articulation in memory studies.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

As with media, fashion involves bodies, rituals, material reality as much as fantasy, imagination and creativity. Both, for nearly two decades now, have been defined as part of the creative industries, those key economic activities that derive their economic value first and foremost from their symbolic rather than their material value. This suggests a lack of robustness: that these are luxury goods and therefore suspect. Querying how media and fashion are understood will show how the current regard for the creative industries is predicated on modernity’s deeply split roots. On the one hand there is the critical and rational lineage of Enlightenment thought, on the other romantic sensitivity and openness to magic and creativity. RuPaul’s Drag Race will serve as focal point.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

His rhetoric lacked any contextual understanding of Chicago’s violence and offered no productive pathways for collective solutions. Alternatively, I argue in this paper that an emerging crop of Chicago hip hop artists were producing musical discourses in 2016 that not only challenged Trump’s negative rhetoric, but also spatialized a multilayered narrative of the intersections between hip hop and activism in the city. Through textual analysis of three tracks from three breakout artists in 2016, my goal is to show how hip hop musical discourse allows audiences to spatially imagine Chicago’s 1) structural resistance to violence in the city’s communities of color, 2) a sense of place and community belonging amongst the city’s youth, and 3) a loving and unapologetic ‘black liberation’ lens to social movements in the city.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Turkey’s foreign policy has drastically changed since 2012 due to international changes that have occurred, such as the Syrian Refugee Crisis, the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. At the same time, domestic challenges such as the Gezi Park protests in 2013 and a failed military coup in July 2016, have led Turkey to drift away from the West. Five years later, this study follows up on Turkey’s current public diplomacy strategies and tactics through a qualitative content analysis of Twitter messages published by seven Turkish officials’ accounts between August 23 – November 1, 2017 N = 1,220).

Resorting to linguistic-pragmatics and international relations theories, it firstly aims at conceptualizing amicable actions and their potential to thwart escalatory processes or initiate, maintain, and restore solidarity-based and deference-based relations in interstate communication. On the basis of 2,180 amicable actions performed by a variety of international actors in a range of communicative contexts and corroborated by eight senior foreign affair policymakers, a classification that points to variations, goals, and prevalence of amicable actions is suggested. In the conclusions, I argue for the empirical importance and practical applicability of amicable actions and point to six challenges (situational, intentional, interpretative, power, cultural, and media-related) that need to be confronted in the future in order to answer the overarching question: Under what conditions do amicable actions achieve their ends?",Public Diplomacy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Earlier studies have shown that cyberbullying victimization is associated with mental health and well-being problems in the short run, such as a few months or years after being cyberbullied. Until now, no study has investigated the possible long-term impact of being a victim of cyberbullying during adolescence. The goal of the present study was to investigate long-term consequences and to compare these for online and offline bullying. To this aim, a retrospective study was conducted among 1,010 emerging adults aged 18 to 25. The analyses showed that online and offline bullying are associated in similar ways with negative outcome measures in the long run, such as being less satisfied with life, having a more pessimistic and less optimistic life orientation, and feeling less resilient. Independent of the form of bullying, the frequency of the victimization during adolescence plays an important role.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Two common cues are the number of other viewers looking at a product (i.e., hotel) page and the number of recent reservations. The present study investigated how the social cues influence the viewers’ perception of social presence on the webpage, and how the induced social presence further affects their intention to book the hotel. Specifically, three different serial mediation routes that attitudes, social norms, and perceived scarcity play mediating roles between the induced social presence and the behavioral intention were tested. The results demonstrated a significant interaction effect between the two cues on social presence, and the induced social presence further affected behavioral intention through two serial mediation routes via social norms and via perceived scarcity.

This raises the concern that recipients receive like-minded information instead of a broad and comprehensive overview of current events. However, there are limited studies available concerning the actual amount of algorithmically personalized media people use and who uses them. We conducted a representative online survey in Germany to measure a) the (absolute and relative) exposure to algorithmic news based on a new typology of sources and b) user characteristics associated with algorithmic news use. The share of algorithmically personalized sources in total news use is on average 25% (SD = 27%), which indicates a relatively high importance of these sources. Results of a multiple regression model show various factors associated with algorithmic news use, such as demographics, personality traits and general tendencies of media use.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

At the same time these audiences are becoming more diverse than ever, with increasing recognition that sites need to be inclusive. This paper examines how the visual choices communicators make in designing their online messages via websites impact the sense of ambient belonging, or the sense of belonging to a community or a culture, felt by users of such sites. We report results of an experiment, which presented two content-identical webpages for an introductory computer science course to college-aged participants. The sites differed only in aesthetic features such that one was perceived as masculine while the other was gender-neutral. Our results confirm that young women exposed to the masculine page are negatively affected, reporting significantly less ambient belonging, interest in the course and in studying computer science broadly. They also experience significantly more concern about others’ perception of their gender relative to young women exposed to the neutral page, while no similar effect is seen in young men. These results suggest that gender biases can be communicated through web design, highlighting the need for inclusive communication design for the web.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

(2) Does the Internet news use amplify or reduce participation gaps that exist among individuals at various socio-economic strata? (3) Does press freedom of a country as a contextual factor shape the role of the Internet in participation gaps? The results based on an analysis of nationally representative multi-country survey suggest that Internet news use for political purposes increases the likelihood of protest participation in the Arab world while it also deepens socioeconomic stratification in participation. However, this intervening role of the Internet is largely shaped by national press freedom. Theoretical implications of these findings for political inequality literature and the practical consequences for the Arab world are discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

However, little attention has been paid on the impact of status updates frequency on psychological well-being, explained by the underlying mechanism of social comparison. Due to the amounts and valence of Likes and comments for one’s posts could be signals for popularity, which signify public acceptance within one’s social environment, it is plausible that individuals may compare the amounts and valence of feedback with others to acquire affirmation on popularity. Yet presentations of others’ favorable images due to positive and strategical online self-presentation often make others’ posts with a great number of Likes and comments, which leads an individual to engage in negative social comparison easily. Therefore, the present study hypothesizes that those who update status more frequently may have more opportunities to engage in negative social comparison about posts’ feedback to evoke envy, which, in turn, undermines individuals’ psychological well-being. And self-esteem might moderate the relationship between status updates frequency and negative social comparison frequency.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Based on approaches to explain bystander behavior offline as well as Just World Theory, we aim at investigating the perceptual mechanisms that inhib-it bystanders to help a victim of cyberbullying. Drawing on an online-experiment with 240 partici-pants, we show that an incident containing threats (compared to insults alone) is more likely as-sessed as severe, which in turn leads to a higher willingness to help the victim. Yet, an incident that is evaluated as less severe results in a higher tendency to blame the victim, which in turn may in-hibit bystanders’ social support.

The aftermath of attacks are thus unique periods where people’s values may temporarily be shaken. Moreover, social media now offer a platform where such immediate reactions can be observed.
We study this phenomenon in the context of the 2015 Paris attacks.

Bearing much resemblance to Twitter in its initial design, Weibo is often regarded as Twitter’s Chinese counterpart. In this paper, we delineate the historical evolution of Weibo as a social media platform (2009-2017). Rather than focusing on individual case event, we showcase how Weibo evolves over the years in the push-and-pull forces of commercialization, capitalization and political control.
Upon examining the political economy of Weibo, platform interface design and functions, we explore both the technological and socioeconomic dimensions of Weibo. Through a historical periodization of Weibo’s development, our study analyzes Weibo in its relationship with Sina Corporation, in its struggles with profitability and economic viability, and in its journey to define the meaning of the platform amidst the country’s increasingly stringent internet control environment. We argue that how Weibo maneuvers user interfaces and articulates its value as a “platform” to stakeholders, users, advertisers and developers is not only important in unpacking the political and economic tensions but also bears significance understanding the contexts within which Weibo platform emerges and its implications for Chinese society.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Drawing from 150 Lexis-Nexis articles from leading U.S. media between June 2015 and October 2017 I will identify key historical analogies journalists invoke to make sense of Trumpism. Using critical discourse analysis on select newspaper articles I will evaluate the nominalization and passivization associated with Trumpism.

This study, conducted with a community sample (N =139), seeks to assess how the publicness of a channel and severity of a situation affect message features, and the degree to which those features may predict an individual’s level of frustration. The specific message features we seek to examine include the type of account used and the valence of the account. We also intend to assess how channel publicness may affect the discrepancies between self-reported attributions, and the attributions present in a message.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0196,2018,Poster,Using Social Media to Discern Variations in the Temporal Structure of Sociability Across American Cities,4,"Though social researchers have been interested in how temporal patterns of sociability vary within and across cities, the study of city-level dynamics at short timescales has traditionally been difficult due to an absence of data or tools for analysis. Social media data provide new quantitative methods to investigate this. In this study, we use aggregated social media data collected over three months to infer the temporal structure of sociability within American cities and investigate the variation in these patterns across cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types and show that their patterns are strongly shared within types. This classification of American cities echoes existing understandings, but also reveals previously unidentified differences in daily social life. The results also emphasize the methodological utility of bringing to bear interpretable statistical methodologies to social media data and the power that these data hold for answering classical communication research questions.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

sexually-dimorphic and stable proxy for androgen levels (i.e. testosterone) during prenatal sex development (Manning, Scutt, Wilson & Lewis-Jones, 1998). Studies have linked 2D:4D to a wide array of topics relevant to social scientists including sexual orientation/sex role identity, health factors, cognitive ability, psychoticism, neuroticism, sensation seeking, and dominance (Putz, Gaulin, Sporter & McBurney, 2004). While some trends are established, however, inconsistencies remain, including patterns, significance of left vs. right hands, strength of effect sizes, and reliability of various methods of measurement. In this paper, two methodological studies are presented; one compares indirect and direct measures, and the other compares two different hand orientations during direct measurement. Pearson r and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) reveal high reliability of measurements in both studies. Implications of these findings in light of empirical and meta-analytical findings are discussed.",Communication Science and Biology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Given that university health services across the nation struggle to meet rising mental health needs (NSCC, 2012), and because students themselves are often reluctant to seek out counseling and/or treatment (Eisenberg et al., 2007), preemptive interventions that proactively address personal well-being are necessary. Virtual Reality (VR) tools may provide an unique opportunity to promote student health through an affordable and immersive meditative platform. This project examines the effectiveness of VR meditation and immersive mindfulness through a longitudinal, quasi-experimental research design. Biometric feedback, combined with Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and participant self-reports, informs the potential for VR interventions on college campuses. Results indicated that VR could be an effective intervention method.

The study is situated within the empirical context of rural-to-urban migrant workers’ issues. Drawing from the conceptual framework of alternative media and communication for social change, I analyze a local NGO’s community newspaper for migrant workers and an online advocacy media targeting at female migrant workers. Based on semi-structured interviews with editors and migrant worker authors, and textual analysis of the published articles and readers’ responses, I examine the two media’s thematic contents and processes of production and distribution. The two cases present sustainable and organized modes of alternative media production that enable deliberation spaces for migrant workers’ collective expression. Migrant workers’ articulations through alternative media constitute a daily mode of activism and resistance, which is in line with the group’s rising consciousness and demands of rights and justice. The study shows that to provide communal and organizational support could mobilize underprivileged groups to participate in alternative and collective media production for social inclusion and equality. I argue that the conceptualizations of alternative media need to be contextualized, and integrating local politics is crucial to explicate the possibilities of alternative forms of media and uses of ICTs for social change.

This worry under cultural imperialist thinking is common in Hong Kong as its collaboration with mainland China grows quickly while the local production is marginalized. However, as many successful films in China market were co-produced with Hong Kong, the “marginalized Hong Kong” could be questionable. This article uses network analysis to explore HK film workers’ influence in these projects and indicates that the participants in the developing/planing team are mainly from mainland China while the Hong Kong members are more influential than the others. Therefore, this article concludes the Hong Kong film industry has been revived through co-production, which implies that the core of empire could move to a new place to prolong its own life.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study finds that, different from western way of seeing Africa, China has presented a general positive image of Africa, especially during the Maoist era. The effort to romanticize Africa in the socialist era is conceptualized as a “socialist gaze” which functions as a counter-representation of the “colonial gaze”.

Health organizations have experimented with new approaches in order to go viral, but reap mixed results. With spreadable EE, this paper provides an alternative approach that strives to meaningfully embed storytelling in the technical, economic, and social contexts in which audiences consume, create, and (re)circulate media.

The results of a national survey (N=544) indicate that, in a nation of avid TV users, newspaper use could be the best predictor of social trust and life satisfaction. However, when controls for social background were entered in the models, all media use variables lost their predictive power. Trust in television news did not moderate the relationships between TV use and social trust and life satisfaction, but was a significant predictor of social trust. The results support previous research that pointed to the flaws in Putnam’s original hypothesis of the negative impact of television use on social capital. Due to the lack of explanatory value of media use variables, this study calls for the reexamination of the use of media use variables in models that predict social capital outcomes.",Global Communication and Social Change Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

In Korea, the rapid growth of webtoons has created one of the most unique youth cultures, and the local entertainment industries have depended on webtoons as new sources for their own cultural forms. As several movies, such as Secretly, Greatly (2013), Misaeng (2013), 26 Years (2012), and Inside Men (2015), which were transformed from webtoons, became huge successes, many film directors and television producers intend to continuously develop webtoon-based films and television dramas. By employing media convergence supported by transmedia storytelling as a major theoretical framework, this article historicizes the evolution of Korean films according to the surrounding digital media ecology, driving the change and continuity of the manhwa industry, now focusing on webtoons, over the past 15 years. Also partially developing a textual analysis, it investigates not only the recent emergence of webtoons as the source of transmedia storytelling for Korean cinema, but also the reasons why webtoons reflecting contemporary socio-political milieu become popular resources for local films.

This paper presents findings from an experiment in which participants engaged in a one-on-one online chat with an apparent political opponent, and were assigned to perform an imagined interaction task prior to the chat. Preliminary results suggest that increases in chat-partner assertiveness lead to more negative communication and a bolstering of voting intentions, without having a persuasive effect on beliefs or attitudes.

This study not only showcases a plurality of voices from ethical vegans whom are also companion animal guardians (i.e., “pet owners”), but it also seeks to expand our knowledge of the communicative constitution and function of human-animal relationships as related to individual identity/ies. Thirteen participants were interviewed and data were analyzed using iterative qualitative analysis. Data illuminated propositions of the Communication Theory of Identity (CTI). Identity enhancements were discovered for participants’ personal-enacted identity regarding companion animal adoption and personal-enacted-relational identity regarding companion animal agency and shared, specialized space. An identity gap was also discovered pertaining to personal-enacted identity regarding spaying/neutering and companion animal diets that conflicted with ethical vegan values. However, these were communicatively negotiated via personal-relational identity. These findings illuminate the dynamic and fluid nature of identity for ethical vegans whom are also companion animal guardians. Ethical vegan identity was communicatively constructed as independent of, yet interdependent on, identification as a companion animal guardian in this context, thus, consistent with theoretical propositions of CTI. Findings also reveal how identities are communicatively negotiated among CTI’s four intersecting frames. Implications of these findings are discussed as related to extant theory and research as well as ways that identity and human-animal relationships can be further researched and theorized within communication studies.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The opposite is the case for the US coverage, which in general has a lower degree of narrativity, mainly uses unexcited story types, and provides a higher deliberative quality. In both cases, narrative writing does not consistently account for higher or lower deliberative quality. The picture is more distinct for Germany, with a less unambiguous use of narrativity and story types, and a mixed deliberative quality, the relationship between higher narrativity and deliberative quality is most salient.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0229,2018,Poster,"New Zealand Newspaper Editorial Representations of the National Standards Education Policy: Media Populism, the Journalistic Identity and the Parent as Citizen-Consumer",1,"This paper analyses newspaper editorial coverage of the National Standards education policy to argue that, following Ernesto Laclau, a populist articulatory logic structured representations. ‘Parents’ functioned as a synecdoche for ‘the people’, a hegemonic signifier which excluded teachers and represented the conjoined interests of government and media institutions in ensuring the successful implementation of a policy which sought to implement an audit regime within schools. The policy’s near uniform support in the editorials was linked to its carving of a niche for the New Zealand journalistic identity in its traditional role as the fourth estate. This is a politically agentive role which simultaneously affords the disavowal of that agency. A politically engaged public could be constructed which desired league tables through a shared belief in objectivity, whereby journalists are merely the transmitters of factual information on the political realm. This paper therefore argues for increased attention towards journalistic identifications in studies of media representations of education policy.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0230,2018,Poster,"The Brahmin as ""Culture"": Problematizing Caste in India’s Media Event Space",1,"In this paper, I discuss how the caste category of ‘Brahmin’ emerges in English language news in India through the construction of a media event space. Building upon anti-caste critiques of how English language news media scripts lower-castes – Dalits and Bahujans – through themes of death, violence, deprivation and abjection, I argue that in contrast, Hindu upper-castes, particularly Brahmins, emerge in culture, lifestyle, and technology news as representative of the historical and cultural ethos of India. The news media’s caste discourse therefore reveals differing parameters for how Brahmins predominantly experience (and therefore, express) their caste privilege as “culture,” while Dalit-Bahujans experience their caste location as oppression. These scripts of the lived experience of caste, I suggest, create a news episteme where coverage of violence against Dalits becomes a convenient substitute for more critical understandings about the operationalization of caste through institutional power structures, and in particular, elite caste oppressor groups.

News organizations and journalists must learn to operate several social media channels simultaneously. Furthermore, social media are multifunctional and can be applied in all phases of news production and distribution. The main objective of the present study is to systematize the multiple uses of social media in journalism and to explore related newsroom strategies. Therefore, we surveyed editors-in-chief of German internet newsrooms (n=105, response rate: 70%). Results show that Facebook and Twitter serve multiple journalistic purposes. In contrast, blogs and YouTube are more specialized tools. We conducted a cluster analysis to explore if and how these patterns vary by different strategic approaches in organizing the social media use in the newsroom. While the overall pattern remains stable, especially more experienced and strategy-oriented newsrooms tend to use Twitter more often for various tasks.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

An Exploration of Mediatization Strategies of Science Policy Stakeholders,1,"The paper explores the mediatization (adaptations towards journalistic news media logic) and strategies of mediatization of German science policy stakeholders from the perspective of decision-makers. Both, mediatization and strategies of mediatization are being explored regarding organizations that are relevant stakeholders in the German science policy constellation: Political parties, political advisory boards, funding organizations, universities and non-academic research organizations as well as disciplinary associations. Results are based on 35 semi-structured in-depth interviews with decision-makers within those organizations. The paper aims to identify similarities and differences considering the extent of mediatization and mediatization strategies. For example, certain organizations within the field of science policy follow progressive media strategies and advance structural adaptations, while others seem to adapt in order to guard themselves against media influences (defensive mediatiza-tion). The aim of the paper is to provide a typology of science policy stakeholders and develop theses that explain differences.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2018-0233,2018,Poster,Shifting Epistemologies? How BuzzFeed and VICE Craft an ‘Experience of Involvement’ in the News,1,"Over approximately the last decade, an interesting counterpoint to the dominant narrative of ‘crisis’ has been the rise and entrenchment of digital native news media (Carlson and Usher 2016). In a fraught and challenging news environment, companies such as BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post, Vice and Vox have grown in size and stature to the point where they now compete with legacy news media for attention and advertising (Nicholls et al. 2016).

Corresponding with the conference theme of ‘voice’, this paper explores how news workers at two digital native news organizations, BuzzFeed and VICE, relate to the traditional journalistic norm of objectivity, both rhetorically and in practice, and what consequences this might have on the epistemology of journalism. The findings of this research are based on data from 22 semi-structured interviews, as well as a comparative content analysis of news content, gathered over two separate weeks in 2016 and 2017.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

They are consistently found to be more influential than statistic base-rate information. However, little research has compared vox pops with more vivid sources (e.g. experts) talking about public opinion. Moreover, most research focusing on vox pops assumed they are included in the news because of their audience attraction. However, it is not known whether vox pops indeed attract audiences and whether audiences are positive about them. We test this using an experiment with artificial television news items. This study shows that news items containing vox pops are perceived as less attractive by participants than items containing experts. There is no difference between vox pops and experts in their influence on perceived public opinion. However, vox pops have a bigger influence on audiences’ personal opinion.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Players must negotiate what counts as ‘sporting’ (gameplay-appropriate; or ‘fair play’) kinds of manipulation. The ‘sporting’ resource (an inherently moral concept) is used to manage instances of deceit (an inherently amoral concept). In this abstract, we show how players draw on the ‘sporting’ resource to negotiate and collaboratively manage the acceptability of attributed deceptions. We compare four examples from a corpus of 30 hours of competitive board game play as an initial conversation analysis of how manipulations are called out and treated as reasonable or unreasonable during board game interactions. We show that contingencies of timing of the attribution and receipt of the manipulation are as morally concerned as the original manipulation itself.",Language and Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

By examining public media discourses on re-emigration within radio, television, and online content, the study seeks to answer (1) what communicative resources and forms are utilized when Latvians engage in the discourse of remigration? (2) what do these communicative forms and their enactment say about the local cultural notions of action/agency literally as well as metaphorically? (3) how are these cultural notions linked to the larger historical context? The preliminary results show how the presence of the blaming takes shape of a ritualized communicative form and provides participants with communicative resources but also restrictions for negotiating culturally legitimate emigrant action.",Language and Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

It specifically analyzes argumentation presented at the March 25th, 2015 press conference. The analysis offered in this study shows that advocates designed their arguments around the narrative of Brittany Maynard to legitimate the authorization of legal and medical procedures designed to enable qualified individuals to structure their dying process to fit their personal preferences. More fundamentally, we argue that Brittney’s Maynard’s voice created the discursive space in in which advocates would appear as authentic and credible.

I argue that hegemony critique is essential to the study of reactionary discourse on social media in order to fully account for the struggle surrounding immigration and racism. The data set consists of a sample of 1103 tweets clustered around three main hash-tags (#stopinvasione, #norazzismo; and #bastaclandestini ). I apply a multi-layered methodology, including content analysis and thematic analysis, which combined allows the researcher to explore a considerable large data corpus while still being able to perform an in-depth reading of the tweets.

2018-0239,2018,Poster,A Content Analytic Study of Media Indexing in the Context of Transgender Rights (WORK IN PROGRESS),2,"According to the media-indexing hypothesis first articulated by Bennett (1990), news media discourse on contentious political issues tends to follow the contours of debate among political elites, such that official (usually Congressional) debate “sets the parameters of media debate, establishing the boundaries or agenda of public discussion.” As an additional corollary of this core hypothesis, Bennett further suggested that the inclusion of non-elite voices in news media discourse would nonetheless be constrained in their range of opinions expressed to those viewpoints already circulating within elite debate. This study tests the indexing hypothesis in the context of transgender rights in order to illuminate the dynamics of media and governance that drive both public opinion and policymaking on transgender issues. Preliminary results indicate that the indexing hypotheses does not apply to the contemporary transgender rights context and that the press exerts notable levels of independence from elite political agendas.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

As noted by Gal, Shifman, and Zohar (2017, p. 1699), “[w]hile public discourse (and the personal narratives constituting it) is central to the construction of any collective identity, in the LGBTQ case, it is critical, as the group of origin – the family – is not always relevant to its formation”. Further, the identity unique to LGBTQ centers on the realization that individuals are differentiated from their social and family groups as well as from a kind of life-style or “life narrative” which was expected or anticipated. Social media networks in general enable collective identity formation through the interaction of various publics and the employment and deployment of tools, rules, resources, etc. available on the social network.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Although potentially liberating for queer scholars when it questions the visibility of “queerness,” its ability to destabilize heterosexual dominance is debatable, particularly since queer sexual desire remains muted or ignored on television even as queer characters increase. This paper asserts that despite a similar growth in visible transgender roles, comedic scenarios continue to promote inherently transphobic assumptions regarding cis/trans sexual relationships, particularly between cisgender men and transwomen. The sexual explicitness of modern television has promoted a shift from one scenario, the “tranny surprise,” when the transfemale character is rejected prior to a sexual encounter, to another scenario, the “tranny chaser,” when cismale partner is denigrated after a sexual encounter. By utilizing a pejorative term, “tranny,” for each, I highlight how queer sexual desire remains a punchline, reinforcing the “perversity” of trans sexuality and denigrating trans women as voiceless, subhuman sexual objects.","Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Hence, smartphones are conceptualized as social agents suggested to elicit social responses in their human users. In a laboratory experiment (n = 85) participants interacted with a talking phone which replied to them either politely or impolitely. Participants evaluated this specific phone twice, before and after they had received the phone’s feedback. ANOVA revealed polite phones to be evaluated significantly better than impolite phones. Comparing evaluations before and after the feedback showed that polite phones were revaluated regarding friendliness but not regarding competence. In contrast, second evaluation of impolite phones worsened both friendliness and competence. Furthermore, the gender of the phone’s voice impacted the evaluation: impolite “male phones” were evaluated less positively regarding their competence, impolite female phones were not. Results are discussed as empirical contribution of conceptualizing “smartphones as social actors”.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

2018-0246,2018,Poster,Use and Perception of Emoji among University Students in China,2,"This research applies uses and gratifications theory (U&G) to examine the use of emoji in WeChat among university students in China. Emoji enjoys increasing popularity in China with the prevalence of micro-messaging apps, such as WeChat, especially among youngsters such as university students. Emoji has become a new medium to communicate and express emotions in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Although not identified, previous studies have followed the U&G approach to understand emoji in various perspectives (psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, etc.), investigating different variables (including age, gender, cultural background and so on) that affect the use of emoji. As for university students in China, the emoji is playing an important role in their daily online communication. This research, as the title indicates, argues the use and perception of emoji in WeChat. In other words, this paper focuses on two parts of the issue: why and how. The question of why university students use emoji in their online communication looks at both the users and the media content, i.e. emoji itself. We attempt to understand why users choose emoji during their online communication in WeChat and what is the perception or affordance of emoji itself, i.e. the content of emoji affords certain functions or meaning to direct their users behavior. We also examine how emoji is used in WeChat. In other words, we test and argue different determinants of emoji use and perception. Previous studies have found contradictory results on variables that determine the use of emoji or emoticon, such as gender. Fullwood, et al. (2013) believe that there is no difference between genders in the range of emoticons used while Tossell, et. al. (2012) hold research results that identify differences between genders in amount and variety of emoji use. This research however, argues, gender is not the major determinant of divergence in emoji use. It is the chat partners that have a more positive correlation with differences in the frequency and choice of emoji on WeChat. Gender does not constitute a key determinant in emoji use but it causes a huge gap in understanding the content and indication of different emoji in WeChat. Data from this research is drawn from empirical study and experiments with university students in China.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

I argue that by visualizing US women's voting rights geographically, the suffrage map legitimized woman suffrage, projected the movement's power, and signaled that their success nation-wide was inevitable. Mapping women’s voting rights gave the suffrage movement legitimacy by exaggerating the influence of the movement on national politics and depicting women’s voting rights as spreading across the nation. The black and white coloring of the map envisioned the equal suffrage states in the US West as more civilized and moral than the nonsuffrage states in the East, which challenged traditional meanings of the West.
