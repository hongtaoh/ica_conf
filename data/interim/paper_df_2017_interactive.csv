2017-0000,2017,Paper Session,"A Journey of “Waste”: Reflections About Research, Creation, and teaching",1,"This submission is a half-hour television documentary program that was broadcast on the most watched free-to-air television channel in Hong Kong in late July 2016. It was the tenth episode of an educational documentary series “Nature and Man in One” produced by the public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong. The series addressed a wide range of sustainable issues and explored how different countries tackled and solved the many pressing environmental problems. Except the first episode that aimed to provide an overview, eight episodes presented substantial facts, figures and also considerable technical details. I was invited to write and direct the finale episode that was, however, designed to be more “conceptual” and “inspirational” in tone.

Considering that it is a rare opportunity to combine research, creation and production for a one-off production for a major local broadcaster, I started to venture into various subjects relating to sustainability and environment conservation. Through intensive research into the case of Sweden, the finale settled with a core question that would underlie the program.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0001,2017,Paper Session,A Platform Ecology of Creative Work,1,"I consider the subcultural sphere of crafting as a best case scenario for realizing the promise of digital platform technologies and creative work. The companies in this space, Etsy and Ravelry, are committed to social change as well as profit and most crafting expertise lies with people outside the privileged mainstream, particularly women and people of color. Understanding the problems that develop when the dream of crafting entrepreneurship meets the reality of day-to-day precarious labor, as well as how crafters respond to these challenges, is thus key to creating a broader picture of societal and economic change in the context of digital technologies. Building on Haraway (2016), I argue that crafters’ creative work on digital platforms must be conceptualized as an ecology, a sympoietic system rather than a collection of autopoietic cybernetic systems.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0002,2017,Paper Session,Always Already? Cultural Production and the Subject of Marriage,1,"This project explores some of the questions posed by Judith Butler’s essay “Is Kinship Always Already Heterosexual?” against the backdrop of a video showing the making of Time’s April 2013 cover, which prophesied “Gay Marriage Already Won.” How is the subject to whom marriage is addressed produced? By what affective means? Drawing on which cultural resources? I seek to excavate my own and others’ subjective investments in marriage and its associated representational strategies at a time when, as Butler argues, it is becoming increasingly difficult to think of and represent coupling and kinship outside of the narrow norms that legitimated and legalized marriage makes.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0003,2017,Paper Session,"An Interactive, Digital, Tactile, Collaborative Learning Experience for Young Visitors to the Missouri Botanical Garden",1,"The Brookings Interpretive Center is a new exhibit space within the award-winning Missouri Botanical Garden that opened in the spring of 2016. It uses interactive digital technology to engage visitors with plants through sight, sound, and touch while facilitating collaborative interaction. One exhibit, “The Collection of Curiosities,” is an innovative interactive, digital learning experience that helps visitors better understand the species within the Garden. Using QR codes and responsive web technologies, visitors swipe real nature artifacts under a digital reader which triggers an interactive display of information about the object. By swiping the artifact, visitors can learn where the plant resides within the Garden and around the world. Visitors also learn information such as the artifact’s threats and dangers and what we are doing to protect it. This exhibit is as an example of a communication tool that delivers educational content via physical, collaborative interaction.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0004,2017,Paper Session,Black Activist Media Producers of Austin,1,"The latest epoch of Black activism in the United States has emerged in response to the brutal treatment of Black citizens at the hands of law enforcement. Digital production software and networks have allowed Black citizen media producers to circumvent traditional authorities of knowledge production such as news media and have also engendered pathways to develop new and counter knowledge about racial and social inequality. This three part immersive study will examine the lives and work of ten Black activist media makers in Austin, Texas and develops thick description through ethnography, critical discourse analysis and methods of visual anthropology. Austin provides a unique context for this study given its historical segregation of Black residents and recent gentrification during its rise as a cultural and economic juggernaut. This study makes theoretical contributions to critical race theory, Couldry’s (2010) concept of voice along with developing nuanced ideas about citizenship, journalism and design.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

The work is situated between ecotourism and what Robert Pratten (2015) names Transmedia for Change (T4C), a way of engaging audiences with the aim of inducing social change through transmedia storytelling, which in turn is a technique which provides a story experience across multiple platforms and formats.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0007,2017,Paper Session,Futurewomen,1,"Blackness as a site of struggle and progeny of empire sparks debates over representation and politics, particularly when it comes to branding and consumption. These dialogues about black material culture and the construction of the black body as a commodity play out on the large stages of traditional television, film and novels. Yet amidst nationalism, media fragmentation and expanding niche markets, race and identity cannot be constrained to such spaces, yielding meaning-making that elides the boundaries of public and private spheres, as well as personal and consumer politics. This exhibit seeks to locate racial identity as a brand, examining race as a site of cultural meaning , meaning-making, and production.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0009,2017,Paper Session,Insider Positionality: Creating Tools and Translations to Investigate Audio Description,1,"The U.S. National Park Service – the caretaker of many of the country’s most revered places – has a causality dilemma in relation to its service of blind and visually impaired visitors. Not many patrons with vision problems come to the parks today, and audio-description service is not given a high priority, making its presence spotty or nonexistent. Blind and visually impaired people acknowledge that they generally don’t visit national parks, but almost three-quarters of them say they would, if better audio description became available (RNIB, 2003).
The American Foundation for the Blind (2016) estimates vision loss is experienced by 22.5 million adult Americans. U.S. federal laws, such as Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, address the imperative for equivalent access by persons with disabilities to the bureau’s public facilities and learning materials (National Park Service, 2016). Legal pressures therefore just add to the inherent ethical, moral, and economic motivations to do something about this situation.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0012,2017,Paper Session,Making and Doing: the Data Walkshop,1,"This is a participatory session demonstrating a 'data walkshop' process for democratizing knowledge and opening conversations about data. In a walkshop, a group of citizens assembles for a brief conversation before heading out to walk and talk in the city. In an approach influenced by the Situationists and by Baudelaire, walkers step out to try and identify evidence of data in space, and brainstorm ways of seeing and (possibly) resisting. We walk and talk together, observing and documenting city spaces that are:

- data rich
- data calm
- data resistant
- where data is valued
- where value is contested
- where data and citizenships collide

The walks invite participants to photograph, document, map and describe these elements. After 45 minutes of walking, participants return to narrate their group’s journey to others and to present a creative assessment and intervention based on their discussion. We photograph and map data walks and create contributions that add to the growing repository of material describing the data walk, and to an open-source ‘pattern language’ for data walks. This session demonstrates how data walkshops can be used to build new epistemologies and ontologies for data.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0014,2017,Paper Session,Open TV Presents: Scaling Production Value,1,"The networked environment has opened the TV market, troubling conceptions of “high production value.” Networked television encompasses YouTubers who profit with relatively small crews to Netflix series outpacing cable television in production budgets. I argue productions have different values at different levels of scale. “Small scale” production critiques dominant trends in networked television by shifting value assessments from artificial scarcity to building capacity attendant to diverse needs and communities. Queer producers are especially equipped to re-scale television, shifting time, space, and cultural representation considerations on set from limitation and competition to value creation. Using data and experiences from developing Open TV beta, a Chicago-based platform for community-based networked television, I show small-scale production reveals heretofore under-recognized aspects of production value. I focus on the experience of producing the first four pilots we released under Open TV Presents, a series of pilots about queer and intersectional artists exploring alternative (non-normative) relationships.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0015,2017,Paper Session,Payphone Portraits and Urban Imagination,2,"With their allure of urban decay, payphones have provoked a number of reimaginings, from libraries to art installations (Stokes et al., 2014). Themes that tend to coalesce around these projects include use and reuse, public access and local memory. This project investigates the payphone as a site of imagination, combining interviews with photographic documentation to ask, what is the work of a payphone? How and by whom are they used, repaired and repurposed? What do these practices reveal of media politics and urban futures? Methodologically, we address these questions in two modes: interviews and photographs. We use photographs to document payphones in multiple states of use and repair. As a counterpart, we recruit people who rely on payphones in some way, whether as a form of communication, income or employment. Our open-ended interviews with these individuals allow us build a narrative around use, repair, communication and memory in technologies of urban landscapes.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0016,2017,Paper Session,Por Nuestras Calles: Participatory Research and Design of a Game-Based Intervention,2,"Sexual exploitation of children represents a significant global problem, with an estimated 1.8 million children exploited each year (ECPAT, 2016), with children living in areas of armed conflict particularly vulnerable. Due to the multifarious nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children, the intervention presented benefited from moving away from traditional methodologies and employs a game-based approach. After 18-months of research and design in Colombia, a pluridisciplinary team developed a role-playing game, Por Nuestras Calles, in which participants gain a deeper understanding of risk factors and reporting mechanisms. By creating a space where participants can think ‘as someone else,’ new avenues for collaboration can be explored. This paper details formative research involved in game development, team processes, and lessons learned.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0019,2017,Paper Session,Sexual Representation and Visual Communication in the Editorial Design Space,2,"This media exhibit and presentation brings together a sexuality scholar and a graphic designer to examine a cultural space where public intellectual work meets the creative industries. Through a monitor-based slideshow that combines images and text, we examine the relationship, and occasional tension, between sexual representation and visual communication in the editorial design space of alt-weekly magazines in Las Vegas, a city that is both highly sexualized and surprisingly sexually conservative. How, we ask, do the politics of sexual representation play out in the world of general interest magazines? In this creative collaboration we explore the line between sexual decorum and excess, and discusses what constraints, as well as possibilities, exist for the cultural production of sex-positive discourses, images, and interventions in the popular media sphere.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0021,2017,Paper Session,Spirits of Rebellion,2,"SPIRITS OF REBELLION: BLACK CINEMA FROM UCLA documents a group of critically acclaimed, but relatively unknown black filmmakers named the Los Angeles Rebellion by film historians. The 50 filmmakers associated with this movement – including Zeinabu - attended UCLA between the “Watts riots” of 1965 and the “urban uprising” in LA that followed the Rodney King verdict in 1992. Headlined by Julie Dash, Charles Burnett, Jamaa Fanaka, Haile Gerima, Billy Woodberry, Barbara McCullough, Ben Caldwell, Alile Sharon Larkin and Larry Clark, the LA Rebellion filmmakers collectively imagined and created a black cinema against the conventions of Hollywood and Blaxploitation films. They are the first sustained movement in the United States by a collective of minority filmmakers who reimagined the production process to represent, reflect and enrich the daily lives of people in their own communities.

These films highlight personal stories of union members in the Fight for 15 and Justice for Janitors campaigns. The short format of this documentary series shows how media-making and distribution practices of activists and filmmakers mirrors the temporal nature of contemporary social movements. The project complicates celebratory notions of participatory culture and digital revolutions by critically studying the political economy of social media, the labor of community organizers, and the power relations embedded in race and class.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0025,2017,Paper Session,The Measure of Everyday Life: Social Science Radio,5,"Many social scientists lament the disjuncture between their academic publications, public policy decision-making, and public discourse. To bridge that gap, a team involving a public radio station, a nonprofit research institute, and universities have developed The Measure of Everyday Life, a weekly show on social science that debuted in January 2015 and has appeared weekly on Sunday nights since then. Thus far, the experiment has been a success, as the show has improved WNCU’s ratings over a previous show in that time slot and its archived podcasts have been downloaded in more than 50 countries around the world. We want to bring the show to life at the next ICA conference, and will play two years of past episodes on a loop in one of the conference’s shared spaces as well as provide our host, Dr. Brian Southwell, to answer questions about the show’s development and future directions.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

In this project, the coast serves as metaphor and method - a way to challenge boundaries and narratives in addressing climate-disasters. The shore line is a site of change and resilience - where the land meets the sea, where excessive development meets the power of nature, and where climate change impacts lives and ecosystems. Change at the shoreline is often spectacular with storms that result in massive destruction, displacement and death. Yet changes are also gradual, involving the seeping of toxins into the water or the displacement of shoreline communities. Likewise, resistance at the shore is also a slow strengthening, enacted through processes that involve creativity, a deepening knowledge of coastal ecosystems, and collaborative frameworks.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing

2017-0029,2017,Paper Session,Visible Histories,1,"The Visible Histories Project gathered two groups of participants from ages 19 to 80, with participants from three different countries who shared intimate memories in the forms of writing and storytelling over three months. The groups, mostly novice dancers, were then taught improvisation tools to transform their memories into a collective body of movement – in essence - to dance in one another’s memories.

The groups co-choreographed dances based on their collective movements while also engaging in group improvisation to build physical rapport. In addition to performing their works before family and friends, they reflected on the impact of memory sharing and joint movement exploration, which revealed several social implications for individual participants. The creative process and reminiscence sharing deepened existing friendships, influenced career choices and on-the-job demeanors for students and a nurse participant, and helped others come to different terms with long buried memories by reliving them through movement.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0030,2017,Paper Session,Waterline: Giving Voice,1,"This presentation is based on a photographic response to post-Katrina flooding in New Orleans that has traveled and gathered viewer interactions in the form of comments written on installation panels next to photographs. I propose to make the voices of the hundreds of people who wrote on the panels come alive in a 12- to 18-minute video. The visual component will be a montage of Waterline images, both individual photographs and shots of installation panels and comments on the panels. The sound track will be voices speaking the comments written on the panels. I will use the project’s social media sites to invite people who have long followed the project—some of whom might well have written a comment on a panel—to submit their own recorded voices speaking comments, and will engage current students to assist in giving voice to comments and constructing the video. The project book, a poster and weblinks will also be displayed.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0031,2017,Paper Session,"“O Say Can You See?” Patriotism, Performance, and Sport",2,"The tradition of playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before athletic competitions continues at amateur and professional events across the country. What do these public performances of patriotism communicate? How can we understand popular conceptions of citizenship through the anthem’s presentation at sporting events? How does the anthem’s performance serve as the contested ground upon which questions of nationalism, naturalization, belonging, and “home” are actively communicated and negotiated? How can we understand the “boundaries” of citizenship through renditions of--and reactions to--anthem performances that remix, re-arrange, and transcribe it from its “original” form?
This submission creates an interactive exhibition, showcasing a selection of renditions of the anthem. Excerpts from fifteen dynamic performances repeat, encompassing diverse musical genres and performer identities, with an introductory animation explaining the project’s objectives. Interspersed throughout the audio-visual clip, “pop-up” animations feature contextualizing facts and figures pertaining to the anthem and its relationship to American notions of “freedom” and citizenship.",Making & Doing Exhibition,Making & Doing
2017-0032,2017,Paper Session,Multilevel Analysis of Networked Movements in Digital Age,3,"This study is aimed at advancing data analysis and predictive approaches for identifying and better understanding structural features of movements in this fast-moving digital media age. Our primary contribution would be to help analyze social media data in a more contextual manner by taking into account variables at three different levels: network-infrastructure, networked-space, and socio-political levels. We propose to empirically test and refine our multilevel model for its ability to analyze and predict mechanisms and outcomes of interactions among the three levels. Our interdisciplinary team including communication scholars and computer scientists will also develop algorithms for analyzing network topologies associated with movement success including identifying influencers who affect the outcome of movement activities. The data calibration and combination techniques developed as part of this research will help future research studies that attempt to provide a more complete understanding of social interactions in the networked information age.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology

2017-0035,2017,Paper Session,The Importance of Attention in Twitter Based Collective Action: Retweeting Behaviors in Twitter Protest Networks,1,"This study explored the diffusion of Twitter-based collective action through social network analysis. This paper aimed to examine how the protest networks established on Twitter encompassed more publics and what motivated them to involve in sustained participation.This study hypothesized that the more users receive a reply, feedback, or attention from people within the protest networks on Twitter, the more likely they remain in the networks and the more likely they were involved in the sustained participation. The results provided general support for the hypotheses of this study. The findings of suggest that retweets can be understood both as a form of information diffusion and conversations and emphasize the role of organizational actors as an active neighbor who can activate ordinary users’ involvements. This paper contributes to an understanding of the dynamics of collective action, which is important not only in how we approach the hybridity of the collective action in the current media landscape, but in how we frame future conversations of collective action.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology
2017-0036,2017,Paper Session,How Politically Heterogeneous Israeli WhatsApp Groups Engage in Civil Cross-Cutting Political Talk,1,"While political talk is of much value to citizens in a democracy, cross-cutting political talk is identified as a challenging endeavor. In Israel, online political talk is often extremely volatile, going beyond impolite to threatening the norms of democracy. In contrast, this paper examines two groups, constructed on the mobile-messaging application WhatsApp, in which heterogeneous publics engage in vibrant cross-cutting political discussion, and manage to do so in a civil manner. Groups are examined through a combination of content analyses, interviews, and ethnographic observation. To analyze how the groups maintain civil cross-cutting political talk, I analyze three levels: individual member proclivities, the social norms of groups, and the affordances of WhatsApp as a technological context. The three aspects are shown to work in tandem in shaping the political talk that is enabled, with design implications for those seeking planned interventions for the promotion of civil cross-cutting political talk.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology

This study summarizes the results of two studies, the first conducted immediately after the 2008 U.S. presidential election and the second just before the 2016 election, in which users were placed in interactive political settings, then asked to chat or tweet during the presentation and evaluate the political figures depicted afterwards. Preliminary analysis of the 2008 data (reported below) indicates that interactive engagement evokes the sense of social presence, which in turn mediates political evaluations irrespective of what users actually say about the content presented on screen.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology
2017-0038,2017,Paper Session,“Digital Media are for Elites”: Framing and Using Digital Media for Political Campaigning in Rural Africa,1,"Does the introduction of digital media change the dynamics of the relationship between elites and citizens, empowering citizens’ voices? The decades old debate about normalization and equalization effects of digital media has barely been tested in African elections. This study tested this debate through a qualitative study of a regional election in South West Nigeria. The election was contested between a digital media savvy incumbent Gov. Kayode Fayemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) whom political analysts and most of the media predicted would win, and a challenger Mr. Ayodele Fayose of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) who openly claimed that he did not think social media was any useful to his campaign. In the end, Fayose won handily with his populist rhetoric, surprising the country and raising questions about the effectiveness of digital media for campaigning.

2017-0039,2017,Paper Session,Polarization and Technological Selective Exposure: A New Exploration of De Facto Selective Exposure,2,"As information dissemination becomes more affordable, media consumers and organizations create strategies to attend to and process unmanageable amounts of content. Social media uses algorithms and social networks to replicate individual choice-based selective exposure, organizing content based on likelihood of preference for users. We distinguish between deliberate, individual selective exposure, and de facto selective exposure that shapes media environments for users to create an ecologically valid interventionalist experimental manipulation of filter bubbles on Twitter. We address this by exposing participants to different levels of attitude-challenging content on Twitter for one month to examine the effect long-term dissonance introduction on a primarily friendly medium has on political polarization. We expect to find decreased levels of political polarization among participants in the experimental conditions.",CAT Interactive Paper Session 5,Communication and Technology

Results suggest more gender variability in favorite media personae among LGB youth. LGB teens were more likely to have PSRs with LGB media personae than heterosexual youth, particularly if they lacked LGB peers in real-life. Exposure was positively correlated with PSR strength for all teens, but loneliness was only positively correlated to PSR strength for LGB youth. LGB youth were also more likely to report their favorite media personae as important sources of information for a wide range of issues related to adolescent socialization. Though most research on PSRs suggests they complement real-life social relationships, PSRs may be supplementary for LGB youth filling a relational void left by the lack of real-life LGB peers.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0041,2017,Paper Session,An Examination on Digital Literacy Differences between Urban and Rural Undergraduates in China,2,"This paper explores the digital literacy differences between undergraduates from the urban areas and the rural areas by an empirical study on undergraduates from five “211 Project” universities in Beijing, China. Based on the theory of digital divide and knowledge gap theory, the research probes the digital literacy of undergraduates from the perspective of education equity. The methods of questionnaire survey and in-depth interview are adopted. The research found that there is a difference between the digital literacy of the two groups of undergraduates. The digital literacy level of undergraduates from the urban areas is relatively higher than that of rural students. The differences may impair the healthy development of rural students, and consequently, may lead to new inequity in higher education. Detailed differences between the two groups are analyzed with an effort to probe deep into the factors attribute to these differences.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0042,2017,Paper Session,"Analyzing Youth Digital Participation: Aims, Actors, Contexts and Intensities",4,"Participation is often used as a blanket term that is uncritically celebrated; this is particularly true in the case of youth digital participation. In this article, we propose a youth-focused analytical framework, applicable to a wide variety of youth digital participation projects, which can help facilitate a more nuanced understanding of these participatory practices. This framework analyzes the aims imagined for youth participation, the actors and contexts of these activities, and the variable levels of participatory intensity, in order to more accurately assess the forms and outcomes of youth digital participation. We demonstrate the value of this framework by applying its dimensions to two contemporary cases of digital youth participation: an informal online community (Nerdfighters) and a formalized educational initiative (CyberPatriot). Such analyses help us move towards normative assessments of youth digital participation, which enable us to better assess what participation is good for, and for whom.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Movement as a youthquake, a student movement, a social media revolution and a
movement characterized by generational divide. In-depth interviews were conducted
with 14 students, teachers and principals from four schools. It was found that student activists were unable to mobilize their schoolmates to support their cause and join the school strikes. Contrary to popular belief, social media played little role in mobilizing the Umbrella Movement at the secondary school level. Traditional forms of communication such as face-to-face discussion and negotiation were far more instrumental. Although a generational divide was observed in the use of media, members of the younger and older generations did not differ significantly in their understanding of the movement.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Using a college student sample (N = 402) this study examined the role of technologically assisted communication (TAC) on college students’ family communication outcomes and personal well-being. Findings showed that there were direct negative effects of multimodal communications on feelings of depression and loneliness. However, the relationships were no longer significant when family communication outcomes were introduced as mediators. Mediation analyses showed that the relationships were indirect: mind reading, discipline and routine interactions mediated the relationship for depression while structural stability, emotional support, mindreading and routine interaction mediated the relationship for loneliness. The findings highlight the importance of considering different aspects of family communications when examining the relationship between TAC among family members and personal well-being.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

The bias is particularly present in children aiming to seek social approval from their caretakers. Yet, little attention has been given to social desirability in media use studies among this age group. Based on a survey conducted in spring 2015 with elementary school children in Italian-speaking Switzerland, this study demonstrates the need to account for social desirability when assessing the use of television, Internet, and video games. Children’s reported time spent with these media was significantly negatively related to their propensity to social desirability responding, even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Likewise, social desirability was significantly negatively related to entertainment media use but no relationship was evident for educational media use. Social desirability was measured with an Italian version of the short Children’s Social Desirability scale (CSD-S-I), whose psychometric properties were evaluated using Item Response Theory.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

A structural equation model indicated that exposure to messages on fashion and hair styling messages in magazines, YouTube and Blogs related to increased control and reward beliefs of hair styling. In turn, the reward value predicted adolescents’ involvement in regularly monitoring their daily hair styling. The monitoring of hair styling was related to increases in dissatisfaction about hair styling.","Children, Adolescents, & the Media Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Yet, the present study takes the multi-dimensional nature of European political system into account and theorizes that language use correlates with pro- vs. anti-European ideology. Using a computerized content analysis, we measured the complexity and noun use of politicians from seven German parties between 2006 and 2015. The results show that a higher use of nouns is correlated with anti-European ideology, while linguistic complexity is not. Contrary to the expectations, conservative politicians use more complex language. The use of nouns and complexity does not differ over time, challenging the hypothesis that language use changes during situations that cause insecurity.

Constituting the single most commented issue in the FFC’s history, the organization found itself unable to analyze the “big data” comprising the “Open Internet Docket,” the public file pertaining to net neutrality. As such, the FCC turned to data scientists at large on the internet, publicly soliciting help on their website blog and publishing the Open Internet Docket data corpus. In response to the FCC’s call, this work uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to create topic modeling of the entire corpus of comments in the Open Internet Docket (N ≈ 3.7 million). With LDA, 1000 topics were generated and manually coded by two researchers, revealing 47 salient topics containing the most unique and telling words pertaining to net neutrality. The Open Internet Docket comments contain geographic data by state, city, and zip code, so the 47 significant topics were used to run multiple linear regressions with US Census data from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results reveal that the majority of comments were concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois; linear regressions show a distinctive use of word choice in comments according to household income; and political affiliation and household income are the strongest predictors for rates of comments submitted to the FCC among the 100 most active zip codes.",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

In journalism studies for instance, there is considerable concern about journalists’ extensive reliance on subsidized content from sources and news agencies (‘churnalism’). Since journalists typically reformulate and rearrange source information rather than literally replicating it, computational approaches that focus on the literal copy-pasting of entire texts overlook an important dimension of source reliance. This study presents a semi-automated approach to trace this journalistic 'patch writing' by comparing source texts to news texts on a sentence level. In addition to offering a more refined view on churnalism, the approach can be used to study a variety of related research problems, including questions on news diversity (to what extent do news media re-purpose each other’s material?), sourcing bias (is the material of official sources systematically preferred over alternative sources?), and transparency (is the source attributed?).",Computational Methods Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

2017-0069,2017,Paper Session,Exploring Beliefs and Behaviors Regarding Sleep Health Among Users of a Popular Mobile Wearable Sleep Tracker Device,5,"Intro
Poor sleep is a pressing concern, but also a modifiable risk factor for a variety of negative social and health outcomes. Approximately one third of the population is severely sleep deprived (Liu et al., 2016) , and sleep deprivation increases risk for hypertension, stroke, and type II diabetes (Buxton & Marcelli, 2010; Gupta & Knapp, 2014; Jackson, Redline, & Emmons, 2015). Intervention research shows that sleep behavior is largely modifiable (Brown, Berry, & Schmidt, 2013; Carter, Dyer, & Mikan, 2013), and thus a suitable area for research on evidence-based behavior change approaches. Mobile technologies, like wearable activity trackers, have been touted as promising behavioral methods for increasing population health, including sleep. This study describes the formative steps in a unique collaboration between academic and industry partners (makers of a highly popular sleep and activity tracker) to design an evidence-based sleep health education intervention.

Method
We chose a survey-based methodology for the formative stage of this research project to identify belief and behavior targets for the next phase, in which we will test the impact of specific message. We recruited active users of the tracker for the survey (N = 652). The industry partner identified, recruited, and contacted potential participants for the study. Surveys included validated scales to assess Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep (DBAS), sleep hygiene index (SHI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), as well as general health and demographic components. We computed descriptive statistics and assessed bivariate relationships between beliefs, behaviors and the primary outcome, sleep quality, to identify promising message targets for the next phase of this research.

Results
One third of respondents (32.5%) were female. Most participants (67.0%) were between 25 and 54 years of age. The average respondent had a body mass index (BMI) of 27.7 and recorded (based on data from the sleep tracker function of the mobile application) 6.38 hours of sleep per night in the last 14 days. Using a scale from1 (never) to 5 (almost always), respondents most commonly reported sleeping on an uncomfortable bed (m = 4.1, s.d. = 1.1) and sleeping in an uncomfortable bedroom (m = 4.1, s.d. = 1.1, see Table 1) as negative factors affecting sleep hygiene (Table 1). These responses were also significantly, inversely related to sleep quality (having an uncomfortable bed: r = -.09, p < .05; uncomfortable bedroom: r = 0.16, p < .01). Using a scale of agreement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), many participants also reported a belief that that medication was the only solution to sleeplessness (m = 5.7, s.d. = 1.4) and that they cancel obligations after a night of poor sleep (m = 5.4, s.d. = 1.6; see Table 2). Both beliefs were inversely correlated with sleep quality (medication: r = -.25, p < .01; cancel obligations: r = -.19, p < .01). We used these results to identify the five most prevalent behaviors and beliefs that were significantly associated with sleep quality for inclusion as message targets in the next phase of this research – an evidence-based campaign to promote sleep health in users of the sleep and activity tracker.

Conclusions
Mobile wearable trackers are increasing in popularity and hold promise for improving modifiable risk factors like poor sleep. We (academic researchers) are engaged in a unique partnership with the makers of a widely popular, wrist-based sleep tracker to design an evidence-based program tailored to improve sleep health among current users of these sleep and activity trackers. This study describes survey-based methods to identify the knowledge gaps and poor sleep behaviors to identify relevant message targets for a behavior change program that will be designed based on evidence, then delivered to individuals using these sleep trackers to assess behavioral and attitude change toward healthier sleep habits.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

2017-0074,2017,Paper Session,Interpreting the Truth: Online Comments About Video Alleging to Show Planned Parenthood Selling Body Parts,2,"This study in progress examines beliefs about abortion by analyzing how people in Internet user comments interpreted a video released in July 2015 that purported to show Planned Parenthood selling the body parts of aborted babies. Planned Parenthood, in response, insisted that they do not sell fetal tissue, but rather accept cost reimbursement for aborted material that is donated to medical research.

To ensure broad diversity of articulated viewpoints, we collected user comments on news articles about the video from five distinct classes of website, stratified along axes of articulated partisanship and extent of focus on abortion. From each of these five sources, we selected the first news article published on the site about the Planned Parenthood video that garnered at least 50 user comments. Although the makers of the video ultimately released a series of videos, we focus on the response to the first video as it represented the first broad public engagement with what to most people was new information about these practices. The sampled articles yielded 3,053 comments (see Table 1).

Table 1: Websites and Comments

To analyze the comments, we identified recurring themes relating to how commenters interpreted the video and the articles about the video. We used open coding based on a grounded theory approach.

Our analysis demonstrates stark divergences in 1) how commenters interpreted the same “facts” and 2) which “facts” they considered relevant and important. Different people offered fundamentally opposing interpretations of the same information.

Disagreement about what the video depicted, i.e. what the “facts” were, was embodied in discussions about whether the video depicted sale or donation and whether the aborted material was properly called “tissue” or “parts.” Some cited evidence in the video that convinced them the transaction was a sale; others discussed the transaction as a donation. Similarly, many comments referred to the aborted material as “tissue” while others referred to it as “baby parts” or “body parts.”

In addition to such differing interpretations of what the video depicted, we also identified disagreements about which facts mattered to commenters. While one group of comments described the emotional tenor of the people in the video as callous and inappropriate, others argued that the same behavior was necessary professional detachment. Similarly, many commenters argued that the editing of the video was misleading and misrepresented what actually takes place at Planned Parenthood. Others argued that the editing did not meaningfully alter the content of the video. In other words, there was disagreement as to whether callousness and editing were even relevant criteria for interpreting the video.

Importantly, these are more than just factual interpretations; they are the foundation for moral evaluations, and often extend beyond evaluations of the video content to include evaluations of Planned Parenthood and even of abortion itself. Intertwined with opposing factual interpretations are opposing moral interpretations, which line up in evident ideological patterns, such that certain positions (donation, tissue, professional detachment, editing matters) correspond to pro-Planned Parenthood stances, while other positions (sale, parts, callousness, editing doesn’t matter) correspond to anti-Planned Parenthood positions. In addition, positions toward Planned Parenthood often expand to exhibit positions toward abortion.
While we are still situating these findings within existing literature, and full consideration of the contributions of this research is still underway, there are likely implications for the notion that misunderstandings about abortion can be corrected with better facts. Ideological frameworks seem to complicate both how “facts” are interpreted and what information is considered a relevant fact.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

An Investigation of Future Expectations,1,"Cyberbullying can have a negative impact on victims’ mental health and well-being. Until now, no research has investigated whether cyberbullying can empower adolescents to achieve certain successes. The present study is part of a project that focuses on positive impacts of victimization on mental health and well-being. The preliminary results that are presented here are based on data (658 adolescents aged 15 to 19) of the last wave of a longitudinal panel study with five waves. Preliminary results provide first evidence that victims of bullying might draw strength from their experience and have positive expectations for the future, however this can take a while. It is important to point out that no causal conclusions can be made at this point.

A 2 (humor) × 2 (control factor spot) between-subjects online experiment was conducted (N = 229), in which participants randomly saw one of four PSAs about STDs. The results illustrate the complexity of using humor in health messages. People who are low on Coping Humor are motivated by humorous spots to use condoms. While humorous spots encourage people high on Coping Humor to talk about STDs with their partner, there is a risk that their intentions to use condoms are decreased. Besides providing insights into the effects of humorous health messages, our study also points to the relevance of interpersonal communication for health behavior.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

The present study examined the motivational factor that prompts the use of particular communication channels based on the uses and gratification approach. Using nationally representative data (N = 1,036), during the 2015 South Korea’s MERS outbreak, we found that less satisfaction with information from public health officials (PHOs) led to more frequent use of online news, interpersonal networks, and social media for MERS-related information acquisition.

Much of this difficulty arises from a constrained understanding of this concept based on a socio-cognitive framework, which emphasizes human cognition as a source of stigma, rather than a structural framework that accounts for the interplay of different social, economic, political and historical processes that intersect to produce stigma and discrimination in society. Drawing on critical theoretical framework and ethnographic research related to HIV/AIDS in Delhi, India, this paper argues for a structure-centred approach to health interventions and communication that are based on the lived experiences and narratives of affected and marginalized communities (including those living with HIV) in a bid to eliminate the burden of HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination.",Health Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

These alarming facts suggest that current alcohol interventions fail to elicit changes in adolescent binge-drinking behavior. Therefore, there is a need for effective interventions targeting adolescent binge drinking. To inform existing and future interventions that target adolescent binge drinking, the main objective of this study is to identify three kinds of beliefs which are part of theoretical frameworks such as the theory of planned behavior: behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs. To do so, we distinguish between beliefs of popular and unpopular adolescents and we apply deductive qualitative content analysis of beliefs that adolescents’ have expressed in peer-to-peer conversations about alcohol.

Moreover, interactivity was found to increase negative affect as well mediated by an enhanced feeling of autonomy. This was only true for participants, who chose a television content of average or over-average duration, and is therefore interpreted as a decline of mood based on a bad conscience caused by time-wasting when using media in combination with increased feelings of autonomy.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0089,2017,Paper Session,The Influence of Visuals on Selective Exposure to Information,3,"Visual appeal plays an important role in eliciting positive consumer responses. The visual appearance of a product is even more important in an online shopping environment in which consumers can only view a product without touching, hearing, smelling, or tasting it. Product visuals can elicit initial impressions and inferences about other aspects of a product which may bias subsequent information search. This is because people tend to systematically process information in favor of their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (confirmation/congenial bias). In this study, we manipulated the levels of product visual appeals in a 2 (bad vs. good package design) x 2 (low vs. high image quality) factorial design randomized experiment. We examined the impact of visual conditions on information exposure via brand attitudes, and how perceived product quality and seller credibility can mediate these effects. A contrast analysis confirmed an increasing linear trend in positive selective exposure as the product visuals become richer; and a structural equation model showed that the relationship between visual conditions and selective exposure was mediated by brand attitudes, perceived product quality, and seller credibility.",Information Systems Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Regarding its consequences, it was found that heightened processing fluency biases metacognitive judgments. Specifically, considering perceived knowledge in relation to actual knowledge, recipients experiencing fluency have been found to overestimate their knowledge about the issue depicted in the experimental stimuli.

These studies highlighted watching television together as a valuable family routine, structuring the rhythm of daily life and familial sociality. Still, ever since, we have witnessed changes in both family structures and the ways television is consumed within the household. This begs the question whether earlier findings considering family closeness still hold up.

Variously used in the scholarly literature as synonyms and as conceptually distinct concepts with multiple meanings, disputes about how to define and operationalize the terms contribute to the global contestedness of the concepts, affecting how they are used in mass communication literature. Gallie’s (1955-1956) core criteria for identifying essentially contested concepts provide the framework for this review of the literature, which includes recommendations for scholars working with contested concepts and suggestions for further research.

Online Gambling Advertising and the Linkage Between the Components of TPE,1,"Problem gambling (PG) is considered to have a dramatic impact on people’s physical and psychological health, social relations or economy. The Internet has brought gaming to people’s homes, and online gambling ads (OGA) have spread throughout all type of media. This study explores people’s perceived influence of gambling advertising, what Davison (1983) called the Third-Person Effect (TPE), and its consequences on people’s willingness to support censorship or public service advertising. Our findings show that despite the difference on the perception of the effects of OGA, it scarcely accounts for the behavioral outcomes analyzed. On the contrary, awareness of PG and, above all, paternalistic attitudes seem to explain this support. This article questions the linkage between TPE’s perceptual and behavioral component.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0110,2017,Paper Session,Shutdown the Online Games? Contextualizing News Discourse With Framing Theory,1,"This study examines how the conflicting positions/arguments of each actor converge into a policymaking, based on media framing, and news sources for two periods. From game regulations in conflicting sociopolitical contexts to media framing, media practice of ideologically different newspapers on difference between and within conservative, liberal/moderate newspapers and webzine, and what role the media plays in two differing results of regulatory bills (N=1013) are analyzed. Moreover, the media’s views on games and attribution of game-related social problems (N= 154) are explored. This study found out that in the interplay among press interests and state’s and social actors’ importance setting, not only politicians’ policy preferences drive media ideology, but social actors’ policy preferences also drive media orientation. Yet, the mainstream media are ambivalent about game issues and such journalistic behavior makes game issues more complex and may have biased/dualistic views on games and game regulation to the public.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0111,2017,Paper Session,Television Viewing and Bedtime Procrastination: Ego Depletion Pushes Time to Bed Both Up and Down,2,"Sleep deficiency has been partly explained as a behavioral issue, resulting from not going to bed in time, characterized by self-control failure. It is often claimed that evening media use contributes to bedtime procrastination, but only rarely verified. How people’s state level of self-control relates to these associations, is also unknown. A sample of 234 first year students participated in a survey charting their activities during the preceding day and subsequent bedtime behavior. Results indicated that ego depletion was directly related to earlier bedtimes, explained by its similarity to fatigue. Ego depletion indirectly leads to later bedtimes, however, because it reinforces the propensity to procrastinate bedtime. Television viewing had a dual role in this model. Ego depletion was related to watching television longer than intended, and this fostered earlier bedtimes on the one hand. On the other hand, it fostered later bedtimes through a positive association with bedtime procrastination.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

A sample of urban residents in China was drawn to survey their attention to news about China in U.S. media, their perceptions of the influence of China news on themselves and on Americans. Results support the third-person effect. Chinese respondents believed that news about China in U.S. media had a greater effect on Americans than on themselves. However, the more they paid attention to such news, the more they perceived the news as credible, the greater was their perceived effect on themselves. Additionally, SEM analysis shows that credibility mitigated against negative emotions elicited by news about China. Finally, perceived effects of news about China in U.S. media on the self and negative emotions elicited by the news predicted support for the Chinese government’s global profile-raising campaigns.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I
2017-0114,2017,Paper Session,The Mediatization of the Law. A Qualitative Meta-Analysis for the Development of a Conceptual Model of Mediatization Processes in the Legal System,1,"Court cases that have proved sensational in the media regularly provoke discussions about the independence of the judiciary: The main concern is that the increased importance of the media would result in a mediatized judiciary that is rather oriented to the media logics than to its own mode of operation.
However, there is little systematic knowledge on the mediatization of the law within social sciences. A significantly larger body of research has been published from legal scholars, that provide arguments for the significance of the media for the justice, but have not been systematically recognized by communication scientists.
Aim of this paper is to develop a thesis-based model of the mediatization of the law by using a qualitative meta-analysis of judicial publications. This model contributes to the theoretical progressing of mediatization research and provides a conceptual basis for future research on the impact of the media on the judiciary.",Mass Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

In the first phase, we investigated the connections among authors, theories, and journals through semantic network analysis to examine the development and diffusion of the subfield of sport crisis communication over the last 25 years. In phase two, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the foundational scholars and publications on which sports crisis communication has been built. The resultant generational whole network view demonstrates how theory application links authors, how theory clustering depict the ways that theory application doubles as an applied assessment tool, deciphered the most central journals in the network, and shows that the subfield’s theoretical development is shaped by crisis communication theories and apologetic rhetoric. The subfield opportunities for future growth also is discussed.",Sports Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

By using an online experiment (N = 433) of different situations of student athletes’ inappropriate behavior comparing an affiliated school and a rival school, this study found that college students indicate higher levels of tolerance for penalty toward the inappropriate behavior of a sports player in the same affiliated school than a rival school’s player. Although college students’ sense of belonging does not affect their tolerance of punishment and moral disengagement in a sports-related context, this study revealed that gender is an important factor for evaluation toward behavior related to moral disengagement.

For collegiate student-athletes, the stress that accumulates across their dual roles as a student and an athlete is arguably unavoidable. The purpose of this study was to test the stress-buffering model and to examine how social support influences, if at all, the stress-coping process for collegiate student-athletes. This study included N = 459 Division I collegiate student-athletes nation-wide. It was predicted that stress would negatively predict self-efficacy (H1 supported), social support would moderate the relationship between stress and self-efficacy (H2 not supported), self-efficacy would positively predict performance (H3 supported), and self-efficacy will mediate the relationship between stress and performance (H4 partial mediation) in both an academic and athletic setting. Esteem support and informational support were the only significant predictors of self-efficacy and it is suggested that infrastructures consider targeting resources to emphasize all forms of social support to provide student-athletes with a broader feeling of supportiveness in their collegiate careers.",Sports Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

It focuses on the form of non-professional, live theater festival as a popular communication conjunction that operates across and through the “small places” of a regional community, but with ambitions and reach beyond this space, at the outer borderland of Europe. The theatre festival is examined as a platform that sustains and is sustained for almost two decades on the basis of a. motivation of political concern to intervene in the local cultural and social life; b. bring out and bring in the borderland articulations of transgression and contestation across various borders and c. function as a public service actor in an attempt to counterbalance the violence of deprivation, poverty and exclusion. We explore here the dynamics of its organization, its method and strategies of sustainability and its history within the context of specific pressures and fluidities experienced at the “edge” of Europe. We find that the event is both modest and ambitious, polysemic and polymorphic in its significance and role in sustaining a regular intervention in the rigidity of borders and in particular exclusions.",Theme Interactive Poster Session: Interventions,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

It situates this process in the context of broader debates about the ‘smart city’ and proposes a method and approach for developing and sharing knowledge within and between people living in cities. This approach intervenes in the technocentric, narrowly focused understanding of the smart city and provides ways to generate alternative forms of knowledge, engage with the production of new civic narratives about data, and demonstrate ways to engage with alterity, partial knowledge and new modes of ethics. Building on walking practices from several different traditions as well as on theories of ‘critical making’ and feminist epistemology, the walkshop process critically intervenes and transforms discussions of smart urbanism and big data.",Theme Interactive Poster Session: Interventions,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

Service users are encouraged to engage with public services, wherein the role of the user changes from passive to active. While many researchers have focused on the logistical barriers that inhibit cocreation among the economically disadvantaged presented by such factors as cost and transportation, limited research has examined the relationship between the service provider and economically disadvantaged service user. This study examines what service users actually do when they cocreate value with a public service by conducting 12 in-depth interviews with participants of SNAP-Ed, nutrition education for persons eligible for government assistance. The study’s findings suggest that cocreation exists through relational characteristics of collaboration, isolation, acceptance, connection, and guidance that help in the development and maintenance of relationships.",Theme Interactive Poster Session: Interventions,In Event: ICA Interactive paper/Poster Session I

We called the exercise #memehistoryofmedia. Students created their own Internet memes, shared them on their social networks (with the hashtag #memehistoryofmedia), and wrote a short reflection paper about what they hoped their meme would communicate to other social media users. Memes have clear limits; however, this assignment illustrates that memes are also a fun way for students to creatively share what they have learned, empathize with the emotions of social actors, pack a communicative punch, and foster meaningful reflection.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication
2017-0122,2017,Paper Session,GIFT: Teaching Research Skills Using Student Produced Youtube Tutorials,1,"GIFT. Teaching communication undergraduate students on the design, skills and methods of academic research faces at least four eminent, but serious challenges. (1) This generation, the so called Millennials (born between 1980 and 2000), like to be in control; ask for choice; are inclusive, group-oriented and excessively social; treasure their leisure time; are technological confident (IEAB 2008). In short, today’s communication teachers face a generation of students that demands much; knows and uses technological resources much better than they do, and; has an easy access to all kind of information. (2) Technology is an extraordinary tool, but it is also expensive and can be very distractive. (3) Plus, even when information and communication technologies (ICT’s) are present in almost every classroom, teaching adapts slowly to these technological changes. (4) Millennials’ particularities are combined with traditional trends about students’ resistance to learn research methods. Learning academic research design and methods (particularly statistics) is not usually perceived as relevant, at the time these courses have never been among the sexiest or most popular. This GIFT (student produced youtube tutorials on how to conduct academic research and writing a final paper) responds to the challenges imposed by the Millennial generation; by classroom changes induced by the ICT’s, and; by traditional struggles of teaching and learning research design and methods.

2017-0127,2017,Paper Session,GIFTS: Exercising Persuasive Speaking Through Mock TEDxPublic Speaking,1,"Persuasive Presentation Assignment
Mock TEDxPublic Speaking
** Student Submission

Assignment Objectives:
• To effectively adapt a presentation to the audience and the occasion.
• To prepare a well-organized and fully developed formal outline and reference page.
• To choose appropriate persuasive strategies.
• To develop persuasive arguments using various forms of proof.
• To develop persuasive arguments using supporting materials that are well documented and supported in the presentation.
• To clearly organize a persuasive presentation.
• To use interesting opening and closing materials/strategies.
• To demonstrate effective vocal and physical delivery.

1. General Purpose: TO PERSUADE
To change an audience’s opinions or behaviors by using logical, emotional, personal, and/or narrative appeals.

2. TIME LIMIT: 4 to 6 minutes. Your speech is expected not to exceed six minutes nor be under four minutes. A wider range is given due to the experimental nature of this assignment. Time yourself in rehearsal so that you don’t go over or under time. If you go over or under time in practice, reduce or add material; don’t assume you’ll adjust for time problems during the actual presentation.

3. TOPIC SELECTION: For this assignment you will think of an idea for change you want to share with your classmates and try to persuade the class to take action. Use Monroe’s Motivated Sequence to construct your speech. The main elements of this assignment are announcement of the topic – draw our attention; the description of the issue – show us the need; present ideas for a solution – the satisfaction; show us what life would be like if the idea was implemented – the visualization; and tell us how we can adopt or implement your idea – the call to action – make this very clear and simple.

4. SUPPORTING MATERIALS: You must include in your presentation a minimum of three (3) different valid sources from research you conduct. Use a variety of sources; no more than one quote. Please remember: it is very important that you cite your sources orally during the speech, as well as in-text citations and a reference list that you turn in with your outline.

5. AUDIENCE ANALYSIS: Speaking effectiveness is greatly dependent upon how well you analyze your audience and adapt your speech to them. You may survey your audience to determine their attitudes, existing knowledge, and beliefs about your topic (best approach); you may research demographic data about students at UNM. Your speech must reflect audience analysis.

6. ORGANIZATION & WRITTEN WORK:
The organizational pattern that you must use for this speech is Monroe’s Motivated Sequence. If you really feel this organization pattern doesn’t work for your speech, please ask me in class to give you guidance after you’ve selected one of the other structures from the textbook. Structure your ideas and draft an outline, using supporting material for substance. The presentation should be clearly organized. It should include an attention gaining strategy, a central idea or thesis statement, a preview of your main points, appropriate supporting materials, and a memorable conclusion. The typed outline you hand in the day you speak should conform to the format provided in class. Also include a References page of all sources used in your speech. For this format, refer to the APA style information provided in the back of your text or using the online links provided in your syllabus. You can also find information online at www.apastyle.org or other websites we have discussed in class.

7. DELIVERY: Dress the way TED speakers dress – usually professionally or tied in to your idea - on the day of your presentation. Remember, this is NOT a manuscript speech; thus, you should not read your speech! Most TED speeches are memorized, but you are not required to do this. Your notes should contain brief key words to cue your memory. Your best delivery is extemporaneous. It is especially important to engage your audience for a persuasive speech. You must use charisma – PATHOS.

8. VISUAL AIDS: Visual aids enhance any speech. Typical TED speeches have minimal or no visual aids. You can use them, but make sure they are necessary, simple, and specific. Objects used to demonstrate your idea are welcome. Additionally, consider the effectiveness of the words you use enabling the audience to create a visual image in their mind.

9. SPEAKER INTRODUCTION: You are required to write your own intro to be used the day of the speech. The intro should be 3-5 sentences and written on a notecard or half-sheet of paper to be turned in the morning of your speech. The intro should include your speech title and your name. Example:

Think about what makes you comfy and cozy. Is it a warm, fuzzy blanket? Is it when you’re in your sweet spot at work? How about when you’re relaxing by the beach? Our next speaker, a recovering comfort-seeker will challenge our thoughts about comfort and show how we can have a better life by Embracing the Uncomfortable. Please welcome Kimm Oostman.

10. EVALUATION: A 0 to 5 point scale rubric will be used to evaluate your persuasive speech. This speaking assignment is worth 45 points plus 15 points for your outline. (Note to reviewer: the rubric was included with the original assignment.)

**Overall, this assignment was a favorite with the students because they stood on a red circle rug and shared ideas they were passionate about. Another surprising success was the introductions students prepared. One designated student was the MC reading the intros. This approach helped with the flow and feeling of a realistic TED event.",GIFTS: Great Ideas for Teaching Students,Instructional & Developmental Communication

2017-0135,2017,Paper Session,Hot Politics: Physiological Responses to Political Communication,3,"The “hot cognition” hypothesis suggests that every political construct is emotionally charged in the brain. The initial positive and negative emotions towards politics affect the ability to make rational decisions. Negative emotions occur when a person is exposed to counter-attitudinal political communication, while positive emotions should occur when a person is exposed to pro-attitudinal political communication. The current state-of-the-art employs self-reported survey items to measure the experienced emotions which mix the emotion with a cognitive rationalization of these emotions. Accordingly, we do not know politics is hot as we would expect based upon the “hot cognition” hypothesis. In a lab-study we assessed physiological responses – arousal (Electrodermal activity; Electrocardiography) and valence (Electromyography) -- to pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal political communication. In a sample of 146 adults, we find that exposure to counter-attitudinal political communication increases the heart-rate with 1-2 beats per minute. Accordingly, we provide evidence that politics is indeed ‘hot’.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0136,2017,Paper Session,A Neural Propagation System: Neurocognitive and Preference Synchrony in Information Sharers and their Receivers,5,"What is the essence of successful information propagation between communicators? We propose that propagation between information sharers and receivers is driven by neural synchrony in brain systems associated with subjective valuation, self-reflection, and social cognition. To test this hypothesis, we measured neural activity as well as content-related preferences in information sharers while they were exposed to news articles and in receivers exposed to sharer-composed messages about the same content. We show that neurocognitive synchrony between sharers and receivers exists selectively within the hypothesized regions of interest, and only for communication partners, not randomly paired individuals who processed the same content without interacting. Further, the extent of neurocognitive synchrony covaried with the successful propagation of content-related preferences. Our results suggest that information propagation is supported by the transmission of sharer's content evaluations through sharer-receiver synchrony in a neural propagation system consisting of regions associated with valuation, self-reflection and social cognition.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0137,2017,Paper Session,Neural Correlates of Social Influence Across Socioeconomic Status,5,"People routinely change their preferences and behaviors in response to social influence. Early development, however, may change the way that the brain responds to social cues, and as such people from different cultural upbringings may be influenced through different neurocognitive pathways. Consistent with this logic, one potential moderator of brain-social influence relationships is socioeconomic status (SES). In our sample of young adults, those from high and low SES backgrounds conformed equally often; however, higher SES was associated with greater activity in one set of mentalizing (DMPFC) and positive valuation (VMPFC) regions, whereas lower SES was associated with activity in a different set of mentalizing (TPJ) and inhibitory control (inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus) regions when conforming to peer feedback. Thus, those from high and low SES backgrounds recruit different neural processes when conforming to peer feedback, despite the fact that their ultimate behaviors appear similar on the surface.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0138,2017,Paper Session,Neural Prediction of Population Sharing Behavior Relates to Domain Familiarity,5,"Sharing information is fundamental to human society, but our understanding of when and why information is shared is largely incomplete. We built predictive models that used brain responses to news articles to predict sharing of these articles in the broader population. We found 1) there were large individual differences in the predictive capacity of brain valuation responses and 2) these differences tracked with frequency of engagement with similar articles in daily life, such that frequent readers showed high ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) responses in general, whereas infrequent readers showed high vmPFC only to heavily shared articles. Follow-up analyses revealed that vmPFC predictivity tended to track with predictivity across a global brain network encompassing regions associated with valuation, social cognition, and controlled attention. These results provide a model of variability in brain predictive capacity for population sharing behavior, and identify individual differences in domain familiarity as a psychological source of this variability.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0139,2017,Paper Session,Reproductive Effort Interacts With Socioeconomic Status to Influence Support of Censoring Government Criticisms,2,"Drawing on life-history theory, we tested an evolutionary explanation of why individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more supportive than higher SES individuals of censoring government criticisms. According to this explanation, suppressing dissent helps enforce a secure environment, which will support one’s high reproductive effort (e.g., to reproduce early and in large quantities) better than an insecure environment. Lower SES individuals have stronger desires for collective security because they generally reproduce earlier and in large quantities. Indeed, our analyses of survey data (N = 34,986) showed that household fertility partially mediated the negative correlation between SES and support of censoring government criticisms. Household fertility also interacted with SES such that its effect was stronger for higher- than for lower SES respondents. This suggests that increases in reproductive effort render higher SES individuals more risk averse. These findings qualified a system-justification hypothesis and offered a novel explanation of “working-class authoritarianism.”",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Exploring Physiological Indicators of the Cyberbullying Bystander Effect,3,"Cyberbystanders have the potential to intervene on behalf of a victim when the victim is being targeted by a bully, but often choose not to. Researchers refer to this phenomenon as cyberbystander effect. It is frequently observed, yet little is known about factors that contribute to this effect. The goal of this specific experiment is to develop an initial understanding of how differing levels of message aggression induce certain physiological responses, and how those physiological responses impact subsequent intervention behavior. In this study bystanders were introduced to messages which gradually increased in the levels of aggressiveness their physiological and behavioral responses were measured. Participants felt more arousing and more negative as the level of attack severity increased. They felt less positive as aggressiveness severity of the messages increased. Physiological responses showed similar patterns. Participants avoided responding to messages with higher levels of aggressiveness severity.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Using a 2 (gender: male and female) x 2 (condition: control and violence) true experimental design, the individual difference variables of psychopathy and empathy are explored as traits that influence attitudinal outcomes.  This research begins with an exploration into the neurophysiological as well as the conceptual importance of empathy and psychopathy.  Finally, a mediated model of moral response is presented, which could explain why a small percentage of the population reacts with negative outcomes after playing video games. Results suggest that exposure to violence positively predicts post gameplay guilt. Furthermore, psychopathy emerged as an individual difference variable that is also able to positively predict attitudes towards violence.",Social Brains: Neuroscientific Investigations on Social Influence Processes (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Drawing on this research, we examined the signaling function of luxury smartphones in a mating context by exploring how owning a conspicuous smartphone affects male and female perceptions of potential mates. We used images of attractive/unattractive men and women and presented them as owners of a luxury/non-luxury smartphone. Using a sample of N = 294 (45% men), we found that men who owned a luxury smartphone were perceived as more interested in the pursuit of a short-term mating strategy than men who owned a non-luxury smartphone. Unexpectedly, the same was found for male participants rating female targets. Furthermore, women preferred a man depicted with a non-luxury smartphone as a long-term partner which fits with the finding that these men are perceived as being more interested in long-term relationship (relative to men owning a luxury smartphone).","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0143,2017,Paper Session,Can Evolved Sexual Strategies be Observed in Online Dating Profiles?,7,"Sexual strategies theory (SST) posits that men and women seek different traits in mates depending on their sexual strategy. In short term mating, both sexes are primarily focused on partners that provide high quality genes for their offspring, whereas long term strategists seek potential good parents as partners. Though much past research has examined how the sexes differ in how they evaluate short term and long term mates, few studies have examined how people advertise their sexual worth depending on their sexual strategy. In this study, we conduct a content analysis of photos from online dating profiles (N = 497) as well a survey of women who evaluated men’s profiles. Our survey results are largely consistent with the predictions of SST, but SST was not supported by the results of our content analysis, indicating further need to theorize and study how people communicate their sexual strategies.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology

In this paper, I use a behavior genetics theoretical framework and twin study data from the 2013 Midlife in the United States (MIDUS III) survey to examine factors that contribute to social network site (SNS) use. I demonstrate that approximately 67% of the variance in frequency of using social media for communicating with friends is attributable to additive genetic traits; 40% of the variance in using social media for communicating with family living outside the household is explained by genes; unique and shared environmental factors account for the remainder of variance. Implications for media use and effects are discussed.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology

2017-0146,2017,Paper Session,Causes and Effects of Indirect Interpersonal Aggression: A Review and Synthesis,2,"This contribution explores potential causes and effects of indirect interpersonal aggression, which consists of covert, socially manipulative tactics (e.g., malicious rumor spreading, social exclusion). In this review, indirect aggression is explored from an evolutionary perspective, considering aggression arising from mate competition, resource competition, and status competition. Victim and perpetrator characteristics considered include age, sex, relationship status, physical attractiveness, sexual strategy, ratio of males to females and resource scarcity in one’s social environment, social network size and strength, and personality characteristics such as risk aversion, social intelligence, and empathy. Extant literature suggests that perpetrators and victims of indirect aggression face similar adverse outcomes, including increased risk of loneliness, depression, and peer rejection. Perpetrators of indirect aggressors are often seen as popular and high-status among their peers, though they are not generally well liked. Building on existing knowledge of predictors and outcomes of indirect interpersonal aggression, directions for future research are suggested.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0147,2017,Paper Session,The Evolution of Sex Differences in Aggression: A Costliness Continuum Perspective,2,"This theoretical piece examines the nature and causes of interpersonal aggression from an evolutionary perspective, ultimately making a case for the consideration of evolutionary theory in the study of interpersonal aggression within the field of communication. First, human aggression is defined as an adaptation, and its myriad adaptive functions are outlined. An evolutionary explanation for empirically observed sex differences in aggression is provided, drawing from sexual selection and parental investment theories. Next, an economic cost-benefit analysis perspective is employed to explain sex differences in aggression—evolutionary theory and research suggests that males and females engage in mental cost-benefit aggression calculations to determine when aggression is deemed necessary and which form (e.g., direct or indirect) the aggression will take. To conclude, this evolutionary perspective is applied to the study of aggression within the field of communication and some preliminary future research directions are suggested.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology
2017-0148,2017,Paper Session,Reconceptualizing Physical Sex as Continuous: Are There Sex Differences in Video Game Preference? (Top 5 Paper),2,"With video games representing a rapidly growing media platform, current events have highlighted conflicts surrounding gender and games. Previous research has established sex-typed cognitive advantages and game genre preference. Potential explanations of how these align have been inconclusive. Concurrently, research on sex development has suggested that binary categorizations of sex (physical sex; male or female) don’t capture the full variation of individuals and are thus inferior measures of sex. This study uses two continuous markers of physical sex (hormonal 2D:4D finger ratio, and continuous skill-based performance) to predict game preference and playing. Using univariate effect and equivalence tests, we find that binary markers of sex predict game preference, while theoretically more valid continuous markers do not. Our results challenge the notion of binary sex differences and suggest a more complex relationship between physical sex and video game preferences. Implications for future research on video game playing and sex are discussed.","Dating, Mating, and Hating: Evolutionary Approaches to Communication Science (High-Density)",Communication Science and Biology

By performing a historiographic discourse analysis of nonfiction works on these two movements, I analyze their references to and about each other in order to determine the received view of the relations between the two groups. The historiographic discourse is approached here as an institutional contributor to the foundation of emergent public memory. Findings suggest that, while references between groups are common, they are brief and shallow. Analysis of the texts finds three major themes of commonality, opposition, and intellectual contributions. Examining their contours, I argue for the importance of memory studies that examine the processes of creating public memory, even those that may not yet have solidified. Such cases offer an opportunity for scholars to potentially intervene, as seen here in the complexities involved in coalition building across social movements.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It considers the workings of the photography studio in the U.S. and Britain between 1839 and 1900, concentrating on three connected varieties of photographic “material”: the body as object; furniture intended to guide and shape the pose; and accessories that served to support self-presentation, by offering supplementary visual information about the sitter or distracting the sitter from the experience of being photographed with the aim of creating a more “natural” expression. In each of these instances, techniques of posing connect with broader discourses surrounding photography’s capacity to represent individual identity, and help to illuminate the shifting nature of culturally appropriate and revealing self-presentation.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It has been known that this violence was perpetrated by the state of South Korea that with its rigid cold war ideology recklessly accused civilians of being either communists or communist sympathizers. After decades of silence, in 2008 the South Korean government built the Jeju April 3 Peace Park, a memorial site that commemorates the April 3rd killings.

Against a backdrop of rising immigration, global visual culture, and American intervention in foreign affairs, the burgeoning educational technology industry—including manufacturers of stereographs, slides, and magazines—made inroads into schools by endowing technology with the capacity to “bring the world into the classroom” and serve as an economical substitute for travel. Aligning themselves with the rhetoric of progressive reformers, media manufacturers highlighted their products as tools for teaching “world citizenship,” an ambiguous ideal that emphasized both the promotion of intercultural tolerance and the performance of American nationalism and exceptionalism. This paper thus provides a critical historical touchpoint for contemporary discussions about the importance of global and mediated learning in American education.",Communication History Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The FBI ultimately tried to understand the extent to which Quaker beliefs shaped the actions of the American Friends Service Committee.

And are there some players that we would rather not see engaged in profiling and targeting the news readers, such as political parties, religious groups or governments? The news media is one sector where experimentation with Big Data and algorithms is in full swing. And probably one of the most difficult and most pressing questions for scholars, policy makers and the media alike is: what kinds of algorithmic practices are useful for users and acceptable for society, and when does profiling and targeting lead to undesirable outcomes and unfair situations?

Even though the more illegal downloaders were aware of the illegality of movie copyright infringement, the more they perceived the law as deterrent; they continued downloading movies. The results also indicated that perceived deterrence has no direct correlation with attitude. Furthermore, attitude was found to be the strongest determinant of illegal downloading intention. Moreover, the current findings showed that movie downloaders perceived movie piracy as an easy act.

This paper explores the experiences of journalists at the local level. Identical public records requests were sent to 45 municipalities within a single county in New York. Responses were analyzed based on four variables: timeliness, completeness, format, and fees assessed. More than half of municipalities did not provide timely or complete information. However, most municipalities provided records in an electronic format, and charged no fees. This study finds that state public records laws can be as problematic as the federal FOIA, although the types of problems are different. Local records officers may resist releasing information if they fear upsetting residents, are wary of the requester’s intent, or encounter software problems. Interactions with records officers suggest that informal conversations, rather than formal FOI requests, may be more effective for accessing local information.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Those GWLs were adjudicated as unconstitutional on the ground that they unnecessarily infringed tobacco companies’ free speech without sufficiently advancing the government’s public health interests. This paper tests whether less extensive alternatives to the original full-color GWLs, including black-and-white GWLs and text-only options, have similar or divergent effects on visual attention, negative affect, and health risk beliefs. We used a mobile media research lab to conduct a randomized experiment with two populations residing in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities: biochemically confirmed adult smokers (N=313) and middle school youth (N=340). Results indicate that full-color GWLs capture attention for longer than black-and-white GWLs among both youth and adult smokers. Among adults, packages with GWLs (in either color or black-and-white) engendered more negative affect than those with text-only labels, while text-only produced greater negative affect than the packages with brand imagery only. Among youth, GWLs and text-only labels produced comparable levels of negative affect, albeit more so than brand imagery.",Communication Law and Policy Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The study analyzes two figurative types – the career girl and the working mother – in Chinese “inspirational women serials” as well as the media discourse about the serials. The analysis situates gender ideologies embodied in the two figurative types within the social context of Chinese feminism, which is the simultaneous embracement of liberal feminist notions and the championship of the neoliberal individuals. I argue that such historical coincidence, along with the inadequate social conditions for feminism, enables these “inspirational” women characters to possess progressive gender meanings while also delimiting gender politics to the individual terrain. The analysis of the two figurative constructions shows that (1) the figure of the career girl clearly denies traditional gender norms, but is also transformed into a personal striving story predicated on an individual woman’s quality; (2) the working mother is empowered to retain her career after childbirth, but is constructed to be an entrepreneurial, all-capable person, leaving the persisting gender inequality in work-family labor distribution unexamined.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Differentiating erotic film from pornography, Chinese women take erotic film as a feminine sphere where they belong to. While these females locate their viewing practice in their curiosity, desire to learn, and seeking of pleasure, the perceived personal significance of sexually explicit videos differs for sexually experienced and inexperienced women as it is based on the (in)comparability with real-life sexual experience and the phallocentric discourse on sex that the function of the videos are defined. The viewing practice also raises a dilemma for heterosexual female viewers as their tendency to paying more attention on women’s bodies is perceived as “natural” for their heterosexual femininity but “unnatural” for their feminine heterosexuality.

2017-0171,2017,Paper Session,A Feminist Analysis of Writings by Incarcerated Women and Their Advocates,1,"The primary purpose of this interdisciplinary dissertation study is to investigate incarcerated women’s resistance to silence and victimization in prisons through their media activism. The timing of this investigation is significant given the rapidly growing female prison population in the United States, particularly, women of color, the expansion of women’s prisons, and the various abuses that characterize incarcerated women’s prison experiences. Given that women’s prisons are particularly defined today by race, gender and class, even less is known about how African-American women experience institutional silence and oppression. Investigating the voice (i.e. social and political viewpoints) and activism of incarcerated women in California prisons through first-person accounts can expand what is known about the prison experience and specific problems that women “on the inside” struggle with during their periods of incarceration.

The research questions guiding the project are: “What are the constraints on incarcerated
women that are identified through their media activism? How do incarcerated women
demonstrate resistance to constraints they experience? What are the major issues and viewpoints contained the newsletter publication and published essays? How do the findings between the two data sets compare? In other words, do women who have the opportunity to write longer, better developed narratives differ in voice (i.e. the issues they raise or their perspectives) than those who write shorter pieces for the newsletters? How do advocacy and voice contribute to the
formation of an incarcerated women prisoners’ public sphere? The data and methodology is
based on three years of engaged document research on incarcerated women’s essays published in academic books and journals and in a quarterly newsletter (The Fire Inside) published by the California Coalition for Women Prisoners. The study is guided by the concept of voice in Feminist Communication Theory and the Model of Women’s Media Activism.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Describing social interactions of 15 preteens in after school care, this paper explores the functions of sexuality-related discourses in these girls’ and boys’ daily struggles for empowerment. Special attention is given to the social value of aggressive sexual behavior, and how this intersects with the gendered power struggles of the preteens. The observations reveal how co-existence of compulsory asexuality and sexualization makes sexuality a taboo yet attractive subject for preteen power play. However, the embedment of these children in a sexist primary school playground culture leaves girls as easy victims of sexualized bullying. It is recommended that sexualization research puts more effort into exploring the subtle ways sexism flows through our primary schools as it does through society at large, addressing the root of the problem rather than its sexualizing symptoms.",Feminist Scholarship Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

I find the AP coverage to be softer in theme than NK News, and also find more diversity of perspectives at the latter. Although the AP is one of only five international media outlets with Pyongyang bureaus, it was short-staffed, with most of the articles written by a single person in the capital. In contrast, NK News had 26 people writing from three continents, including people with expertise in diplomacy, the military, and technology.

The dramatic situation has gained comprehensive media coverage and heated public and political debate about how this situation best should be handled as well as the social, cultural, economic and political consequences. Public debates about issues like immigration and integration are difficult and complex and they are often accompanied by meta-debates concerning what should be understood as acceptable or unacceptable utterances and legitimate or illegitimate voices. Consequently they can be challenging both to take part in and to facilitate. From this perspective debates about immigration represent an interesting case for studying editorial ideals and practices, and questions relating to the boundaries of the public debate.

However, research has often neglected the journalists’ perspective on trust. The present paper looks into the political trust of journalists in representative institutions. It is asked for their trust-levels and evaluation of the political performance to further examine what determines the political trust of journalists on the individual level. The study uses data from 775 interviews with journalists, representative for Germany. First, findings indicate that journalists report healthy skepticism towards politics and second, that they are critical about the institutional performance. Furthermore, results reveal that the journalists’ evaluation of performance (regarding democracy, politics, corruption and scandals) as well as social trust are influencing their political trust-levels. Contrarily, political journalists’ trust is determined by the performance of politics and working experience only. Overall, findings show that politics indeed rule journalistic trust.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

U.S. broadcast and cable media outlets took similar approaches to covering breaking news of the sailors’ capture and release, while stronger differences emerged during follow-up reporting. This paper explores the discursive choices evident over three days of broadcast and cable coverage to elucidate taken-for-granted ideological stances common to several of the reports, with particular emphasis on two clips from CNN and Fox News that bear significant formal distinctions concealing close substantive similarities. Close examination using multiple discourse analytical tools yields provocative findings on how journalists and their sources positioned themselves, their audiences, and elements of the U.S. and Iranian governments during a crisis that some factions in both countries sought not to end.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Due to the nature of the concept as articulated by Barthes, Kristeva et al., who emphasized the fluid and untraceable discursive connections between texts, it has been challenging for journalism scholars to develop a systematic method of studying intertextual relations as they appear in journalistic production. This essay is part of a pilot project to develop a systematic methodology for studying of journalistic intertextuality through a case study on English print and web media discourses on the so-called “ghost cities” phenomenon in Chinese urban development policy.

Though researches into trust of journalists in their sources are not scares, one debate into where trust is located – in sources or information – remains unresolved, and an epistemologically vital aspect of it, reporters’ justifications for trust, remains understudied. Based on reconstructions of interactions between news reporters and 180 of their news sources, the paper presents qualitative categorization of reporters’ justifications for doubting their sources, as well as preliminary quantitative codification of the type of sources more likely to be doubted and the news practices reporters employ differently when dealing with information that arrives from them.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

To determine how journalists combine these different tropes, we conducted a large-scale content analysis of Dutch printed news discourse (54,851 words). We find that typical combinations of metaphor and hyperbole are found in nouns and adjectives, showing that such combinations differ from the use of either trope in isolation. For hyperbole and irony, we find a relation between the two tropes in that ironic utterances contain more hyperbole than non-ironic clauses. In contrast, for metaphor and irony, we find no empirical evidence that metaphor use differs between ironic and non-ironic clauses. Analysis of clauses containing the three tropes shows that these may not always reflect novel and creative word use. Instead, various of these cases contain conventional uses of metaphor and hyperbole.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Many focused on the Battle of Nasiriyah and its commencement with the ambush of the 507th Maintenance Company. This was one of the war’s first battles and produced household names of the soldiers involved (most notably, Jessica Lynch). It also highlighted emerging issues in modern warfare like the blurring of the front lines and the role of women and support troops. Informed by Halbwachs’ concept of collective memory and drawing on notions of contestation and resistance in collective memory, this paper examines online news platforms as sites of memory. The paper represents a textual analysis of comment sections attached to online news commemorations of the battle’s anniversary.

Yet, market-driven journalism seems to be increasingly prevalent during such situations of societal contestations since they imply a high newsworthiness. We argue that media coverage cannot be understood in terms of being either normatively or commercially driven, instead coverage about conflicts has a hybrid character. In order to identify the specific mixture of a normative and a commercial logic in the media coverage about conflicts, we holistically analyze distinct styles of media conflict coverage by clustering the content features ascribed to these two logics. Finally, we seek to investigate the impact of conflict phase and type as well as a media outlet’s genre as antecedents of the conflict coverage patterns. We demonstrate this theoretical idea and empirical procedure by analyzing media coverage about wage disputes in Germany as a prominent example of societal conflicts.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We develop a model of national indexing of EU news coverage and comments and discuss conditions which might provoke this specific news bias and obstacle of diversity in mass-mediated European debates. Finally, this reasoning is tested empirically using data from a comparative case study on the representation of the Greek and Euro crisis in 2009/10 in major German and Spanish daily newspapers. While the results support the notion of national indexing mechanisms in the German media, the Spanish findings call for further theorizing towards a model of transnational indexing of European conflictual debates.",Journalism Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Survey results show that many journalists are in contact with the advertising sales department often, and their interests are regularly in conflict. In contrast, the perceived advertising influences on journalistic work are rather low. It turns out that advertising influence mostly play out in terms of adding advertising-friendly content but rarely in terms of censorship.

Historically, in mature democracies of Western societies, there is an institutional system of checks and balances, on the basis that journalism’s core raison d’etre is to hold power accountable. However, in recent years, in the context of a resurgent terrorism threat, Western democratic states are intensifying efforts to pass more all-encompassing surveillance frameworks.

I do this in two ways: (1) a history of record pressing in Jamaica, which gives us a deeper understanding of the tenor of the island’s early music industry and (2) a broad theorization of the political economy of the record plant and its use within a wider historical and conceptual frame. I theorize the record plant and the production process as a paratextual media epiphenomenon, an apparatus whereby media power is negotiated along the same lines as the nation’s political decolonization.

Ultimately, Pinochet’s opposition was victorious in the October 5, 1988 plebiscite, and this victory has since been referred to as the end of Augusto Pinochet’s 17-year rule of Chile. By all accounts this electoral victory was an important moment in the contemporary political history of Chile, and consequently has been the subject of research for many scholars. Yet, this paper is not an historical narrative per se.

Inexpensive cameras, online distribution, and social networking have reduced barriers to producing, circulating and networking through community media. ITC's have provided small groups scaleability in distributing their media while ""communities"" are no longer principally constituted in physical space. Yet community media exists alongside other material forces of space and scale that have marginalized communities, including neoliberalism, globalization, and gentrification. This paper draws from critical geography and studies of infrastructure to think about the relationship of space and scale in understanding community media and politics. I use a case study of public access TV in SF to exemplify the material conditions that are at stake in community media practice, and to suggest how telecommunications policy, urban development, studio location and production studio spaces, all coordinate a broad community infrastructure that remains significant in today's online media ecology.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the public-facing websites of major SNS platforms—beginning with Friendster in 2002—were sampled at six-month intervals, with promotional language and visuals examined for authenticity claims. We found that nearly all SNSs invoked authenticity—directly or through language like “real life” and “genuine”—in their promotional materials. What stood out was the profoundly reactive nature of these claims, with new services defining themselves against legacy services’ inauthenticity. We analyze the cycle of one-upmanship in terms of authenticity's *reactive dynamism*. Born in reaction to modernity’s instrumentalism, the authenticity ideal is, for the same reason, susceptible to promotional uptake. As a result, the ideal is fundamentally unstable and nomadic. We conclude that social media scholars should take authenticity more seriously.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Recent years’ changes in Chinese social, political, economic and after all media environments have introduced a variety of values and ideas to journalistic role perceptions. New elements in journalistic perceptions bring tremendous uncertainties to not only media products but also this increasingly mediated society. Like most existing studies, this study recognizes the predominant role Chinese leadership plays over media structures. However, the reality of everyday news production is more complicated than political censorship and self-censorship. It involves organizations, institutions and agencies. Unlike those studies which overwhelmingly focused on the political dynamic of Chinese media, this study also recognizes the roles that individual journalists play in negotiation with these media structures. Lefebvre’s concept of alienation will be adopted in the paper to analyze everyday performance of journalists. However, given that the Chinese media context is different from capitalist society that Lefebvre critiqued in his theory, this paper also offers a malleable understanding of the concept of alienation. It argues that everyday performance of journalists involves constant negotiations of alienation and de-alienation from a variety of dimensions.","Philosophy, Theory, and Critique Interactive Poster Session",In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

By dissecting several contested debates on weibo over historical events and figures in the Mao era, this study argues that social media embraces a wide variety of diverse individuals as subjects who contribute to various mnemonic practices, facilitates the crowdsourcing and aggregation of alternative narratives of the past as counter-hegemonic discourse, and cultivates the production of historical knowledge as an easily retrievable and re-activatable process. It concludes that the integration of fragmented, individual memories into historical knowledge and the facilitation of diversified mnemonic practices on weibo re-construct the maintenance and production of historical knowledge while questioning the authenticity and accuracy of official history in the long run in society.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Such information deluges can not only hinder users’ enjoyment of online news, but they also constrain people’s ability to learn and comprehend information. To test whether interactivity is a solution to this problem, a 2 (interactivity level: low or high) x 2 (issue involvement: low or high) experiment was conducted, accounting for issue involvement because it is a factor that could alter the effects of interactivity. Results indicated that interactivity enhanced memory, which means it does hold the potential to help readers overcome the information overload often encountered online. Additionally, this study uncovered issue involvement as an important factor that can overshadow the impacts of interactivity, especially when it comes to attitudes.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It uses original data from national telephone surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015 to test hypotheses derived from theories of how citizens learn about issues and form opinions given low information. The results suggest that familiarity with and support for net neutrality reflect responses to politically polarized debate; different forms of media use, particularly of partisan cable news and satirical comedy programs; and use of streaming video services.

We distinguish four types of frame transitions in real-time frame contests: The follow-up speaker can engage in a discourse on the initial speaker’s frame and (a) elaborate on or (b) challenge that frame; or they can disrupt the framing and (c) shift to another frame or (d) clear the frame. As expected, speakers who favored austerity policy towards Greece preferred other frames than speakers who favored bailing out Greece. Disruptive frame transitions were much more frequent than discursive frame transitions. Challenging and shifting frames was associated with higher levels of conflict while elaborating on frames was associated with lower levels of conflict. Speakers argued most rationally when they shifted frames; when they cleared or challenged frames, rational reasoning was rare.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The present paper analyzes the strategies of government agencies faced with this type of personalized criticism. Departing from theories of personalization in politics and the media, the article brings attention to the institutional constraints that limits available government communication repertoires. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork, it argues that the complex and often contradicting communication tasks of governments has been neglected in the literature on the media strategies of government executives. It analyzes how and why government communication, in spite of extensive media management resources, personalization processes and media-oriented politicians, end up giving repetitive, empty, symbolic media statements (impersonal personalization).",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Evidence about how Iranians approach these important shifts, attitudes about their country, its future and its priorities remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, it is not clear what factors affect Iranian citizens’ attitudes on these issues, nor the role media plays in shaping political attitudes, values, and perceptions. Towards filling these gaps, we conducted a field study among a systematically recruited sample of Iranian citizens. Our analysis reveals that use of non-state regulated sources such as satellite TV and online news websites have a negative impact on citizen attitudes about Iran. In contrast, relying more on state media contributes to more satisfaction with the status quo in Iran. Finally, we used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to identify the relationships between sources of information, religiosity and attitudes about Iran. The results of our exploratory SEM-PLS analysis suggest that religiosity is the strongest predictor of attitudes about Iran and it also has a full mediating effect between what information sources Iranians use and optimism about Iran’s future.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 second screeners partook in online political activities. After thematically analyzing interview data, we identified motivating and inhibiting factors affecting second screening for political participation. The findings show that second screening facilitated young users’ cognitive presence in exploring, integrating, triggering and verifying political content. Second screening that created users’ perceived social presence (i.e., virtual presence and sense of community) encouraged their political participation and increase social capital. In contrast, concerns about internal and external risks of second screening curb the usage. Impression management, discussion disagreement, and privacy protection are key reasons that lower second screeners’ online political participation. Due to political threat and mass media distrust, young second screeners who perceived higher risks tended to feel wary of participating in online politics and disguised personal identities.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

The current article reports a systematic literature review (N = 109) that examines whether these approaches report converging or diverging effects. We compared CDA and REA on the metaphorical frames that were studied and their reported effects. Results show that the CDA frames are typically more negative, nonfictional, and extreme than REA frames. Reported effects in CDA and REA studies differ in terms of presence, directionality, and strength, with CDA typically reporting strong effects in line with the frame, compared to REA. These differences in effects can be (partly) explained by the different frame characteristics. However, differences in the methods applied by CDA and REA could be (partly) responsible for these differences as well. In all, we conclude that the research field is fragmented on the impact of metaphors in politics.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II
2017-0211,2017,Paper Session,The Search for Common Ground in Conflict News Research: Comparing International Conflict Coverage Over Time,2,"Media coverage on violent conflict has been shown to focus on violence and opposing elites, sidelining reconciliation and often disengaging rapidly. Especially during escalation, ethnocentrist coverage has been linked to escalation and radicalization. However, few studies have looked beyond salient conflict events, mostly focusing on few conflicts with major Western involvement. In this paper, we compare the coverage of six selected conflicts inside the conflict areas and abroad, over a time range of four to ten years. Capturing patterns in the use of 2000 relevant concepts in almost 900.000 news texts from 66 news outlets, we examine the respective media biases over both escalation and routine phases. Highlighting systematic contingencies in the occurrence of these patterns, we discuss the role of situational and contextual factors in shaping conflict coverage. We distinguish pervasive, enduring tendencies in conflict reporting from recurrent, but situation-dependent patterns, thus advancing a theoretical understanding of conflict news.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Drawing on theories of media effects, this paper investigates whether traditional media use has a negative (media-malaise-hypothesis) or a positive (virtuous-circle-hypothesis) impact on trust in the national government. For that reason, the study introduces a novel measurement for trust in government and suggests a serial-mediation model. To test the model empirically an online survey with 1115 German respondents was conducted. The results suggest that traditional media use has a positive direct impact on trust in government. The positive effect is further mediated by people’s evaluations of politicians and their evaluations of political processes. In addition, there is a positive serial-mediation effect of traditional media use on trust in government that runs first through evaluations of politicians and second through evaluations of political processes.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

Interviews for this this study were completed from March to May 2016, during the mid-to-late stages of the U.S. presidential primary, and were analyzed via the method of thematic analysis. Results of this study indicate that social media is a starting point for receiving political information, and that young adults are incredibly skeptical of media coverage from U.S. institutions and information shared by politicians and candidates online. Additional findings suggest that participants generally view the information they share online as credible, but are distrustful of the information shared by friends in their networks.

Exploring Mediating Role of Political Communication,1,"The extent to which non-political social media practices relate to political engagement has been debated in recent scholarship. Some posit a “contrast” model that sees personal interest as incompatible with civic virtue; others propose an “extension” model that perceives political life as an extended field of personal life. To shed light on this debate, this study focuses on Facebook, the most popular social media site in the United States, to investigate whether and how the seemingly non-political Facebook uses (i.e., personal and entertainment uses) relate to political participation among a diverse online sample of American adults. Results show that personal and entertainment Facebook uses are positively related to political participation only indirectly, through political communication in the form of political expression on the site and/or political discussion in offline settings. Moreover, personal and entertainment Facebook uses are differentially associated with political discussion offline and political participation. Overall, findings of the study help clarify the underlying processes by which these uses contribute to political participation and the distinctions between the two types of non-political Facebook uses.",Political Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

It is argued that Tibet fantasy has grown out of three sets of structural conditions: the Tsangyang Gyatso story, the authoritarian regime's nation-building mission, and the commercialized mass media.

2017-0222,2017,Paper Session,"The Neoliberal Subject, Reality TV Audiences and Free Association: A Freudian Audience Study of Embarrassing Bodies",1,"This paper presents results from an audience study with viewers of the British reality show Embarrassing Bodies (Channel 4). A methodology based on the Freudian technique of free association was used to research viewers’ narratives about the programme. Many spoke about the show in terms that make use of internalised neoliberal discourses about the limits to entitlement to public healthcare as well as self-responsibility for staying healthy. Many also reflected on the treatment of the patients and expressed they were not being exploited for economic purposes. The narratives that reflected such discourses were of an ambiguous nature and the respondents produced contradicting views in the course of each interview. The data discussed may account for associative-discursive shifting in the respondents that is located at the intersection of consciousness and the unconscious. I theorise such shifting with Sigmund Freud’s concept of ‘negation’ whereby an idea is rejected by the subject in order to avoid further engagement with it. Rather than accusing the viewers of lying or having false consciousness, psychoanalysis as a mode of attention opens up nuanced ways of interpreting the data. As both a theoretical and methodological framework, Freudian psychoanalysis helps us to understand how individuals are (un)consciously positioned in contemporary austerity and crises discourses around healthcare. Given their ambiguous narratives, I conclude that the current economic climate in the UK, and its media representation, has resulted in subjectivities who struggle to makes sense of it as they simultaneously resist and embrace it.

2017-0223,2017,Paper Session,We’re All on the Same Team: Whiteness and Gay Masculinities in American Crime,1,"Literature pertaining to representations of gay characters in television has increased over the last decade and recent literature demonstrates how gay identities are negotiated and appropriated into white heteronormative discourses that render “gayness” intelligible for presumably straight audiences (Draper & Lotz, 2012; Calvacante, 2015). Such works demonstrate the incorporation and disarmament of gay identities into popular media discourses, which are relatively static and eventually coalesce with heteronormative expectations (Avila-Saavedra, 2009). In contrast, the second season of American Crime is unique in its exploration of how whitening occurs within the neoliberal project of subjectivity formation among white bodies whose perceived sexual deviance threatens to destabilize or reorient racialization and sexualization processes within the formative years of youth. I argue that the implosion of gay masculinities within the show exposes the façade of the American Dream and indicates uncertainty stemming from whether in-between white bodies can be incorporated into contemporary US society.",Popular Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session II

This study found out in what areas the other group evaluates highly and in what areas one group wrongly presumes. Given that fact that communication between the two groups is not smooth enough, it is necessary to start from correcting the misunderstandings and make efforts to understand each other because amicable interchange can be conducted based on mutual understanding. Overestimation on one's own country and underestimation of the other country can deepen the prejudice between the two countries, having adverse effect on the communication.

2017-0237,2017,Paper Session,Development and Application of an Analytical Framework for Analyzing Social Behaviors With Social Relations Models in CMC Groups,3,"This paper introduces an analytical framework for theorizing the medium aspect of communication in the increasingly multimodal and immersive media environments. We argue that by incorporating a heterogeneity of communication medium into the social relations models developed by David Kenny, researchers can better understand the role of communication from a multi-theoretical and multi-level perspective. To demonstrate this potential, we draw from previous theorizations of communication technology in group decision-making, relationship development, and social identity process, and connect them with components of a social relations analysis. We also present an example of analyzing interpersonal perceptions in bi-national task groups using either face-to-face or computer-mediated communication. The paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications of deconstructing social processes with the proposed framework to theorize information communication technology and computer-mediated communication.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Our goal is to theorize creativity in the Internet age, suggesting a potential framework for understanding its complexities and examining how creative processes have evolved as a result of recent sociocultural and technological shifts. Without falling into the trap of technological determinism or overly romanticizing the role of technology, we ask: what is the role of the Internet in (re)defining creativity? What, if anything, is new or special about online creativity? In an attempt to answer these questions, we introduce a multidimensional analytical framework centered on five key questions: who (actors), where (places), when (times), how (processes), and why (motives). By analyzing online creative participation along these interrelated dimensions, a more nuanced and complex understanding of online creativity emerges - one that is sensitive to both sociocultural and technological influences, as well as to the way these factors intersect in online spaces.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Results of an online survey (N = 1,155) using stratified quota samples showed that use of GMO-related SNSs for information predicted respondents’ likelihood of participating in GMO activities offline and their likelihood of expressing opinion on the issue on SNSs. Moreover, these relationships were found to be strengthened by bridging social capital, and to be lesser extent, bonding social capital. Implications of the results concerning SNS as an emerging sphere for public deliberations in China were discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0241,2017,Paper Session,Explicating Textisms in Mediated Communication: A Codebook for Analyzing Nonverbal Cues in Text Messages,3,"Text messages facilitate interaction across interpersonal, organizational, intergroup, small-group, and mass media contextual levels of communication. Though some people compose formal text messages using proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation, others integrate non-standardized textual cues such as emoticons, intentional misspellings, exaggerated capitalizations, abbreviations, and acronyms. Several studies describe and organize these emergent cues within labels such as cyberlanguage (Christopherson, 2011), textual adaptations (Cingel & Sundar, 2012), textese (Drouin & Driver, 2012), textisms (Kemp, 2010; Kemp & Bushnell, 2011; Powell & Dixon, 2011), and computer-mediated communication cues (Vandergriff, 2013). Yet, with many different labels, it becomes difficult to accurately track and describe this phenomenon. This study posits that the label textism can be used to unite this grouping. The goal of this paper is to explicate textisms and outline a coding scheme that can be used to expand research on how they function in mediated communication.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

To be specific, the research question explores how bandwagon heuristics interact with different identity heuristics in credibility heuristics on an individual level. The MAIN model (Sundar, 2008) and warranting theory (Walther & Parks, 2002) served as the theoretical framework to examine the effects of bandwagon cues and identity cues embedded in retweets and users’ profile pages for health and risk online information processing. A post-test only experiment with self-report online surveys was conducted to investigate the research questions. Results indicate that different online heuristic cues impact the judgments of competence, goodwill, and trustworthiness at different levels. Authority strongly influenced source credibility perceptions. A reverse-bandwagon effect was observed in influencing source credibility judgments.

Vital to the success of using smartphone-based technology for volunteers is to determine whether privacy issues affect user participation. Thus, an online experiment (N=217) was conducted to investigate the influence of privacy-related data control options on user acceptance of a smartphone-based system to facilitate volunteer engagement in crisis situations. Building on agency models and control theories in the context of information privacy, the results show that higher control options led to a more positive evaluation of the app, which was mediated by perceived privacy concerns. Among people with a high career motivation, higher control also led to a higher willingness to actively participate as volunteer in the system.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A content analysis of Facebook profiles and an online survey were conducted with senior citizens aged 60 years and older who have used Facebook for at least one year (N = 202). A series of hierarchical regression analyses showed that while status updating and posting personal stories are associated with activity and community-building gratifications respectively, profile customization is key for obtaining agency-enhancement gratification, and participating in conversations on comment threads plays an important role in providing interaction gratification. These findings advance our understanding of social networking site use among senior citizens, and provide interface design recommendations that specifically address the needs of senior citizens.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Based on a survey of university student users of a SQA site in China (N = 426), this study finds four kinds of gratification sought that drive people to use SQA sites, including social/affective, cognitive, entertainment, and fashion needs. Individual user’s activity on SQA site can be categorized into two types—participation and lurking. Although most gratifications motivate SQA users to use more, fashion inhibits regular usage. Moreover, Social/affective gratification turns out to be the only predictor of participating in SQA content generation, while lurking is predicted by all four types of gratifications. Furthermore, answer quality evaluation has an indirect effect on SQA sites use through arousing users’ cognitive, entertainment, or social/affective needs. The implications of SQA sites as online public sphere and the contrast between research approaches of technological determinism and personal authority are also discussed.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Specifically, considering that masculinity-threatened men attempt to resolve negative psychological states caused by the threat by engaging in behaviors that exaggerate masculinity to compensate for the threatened identity, we investigated the effect of masculinity threat on muscular customization of self-avatar. We also examined how the compensatory avatar customization influenced physical endurance. Data from 238 male college students revealed that masculinity-threatened young men customized their avatar to have greater muscle definition than did their non-threatened counterparts, and greater muscle definition of the customized avatar predicted greater physical endurance on a handgrip task. Furthermore, muscle definition of the customized avatar significantly mediated the relationship between masculinity threat and physical endurance. None of these effects were moderated by masculine norm conformity.

Prior work suggests violation of responsiveness expectations can lead to negative evaluations, but this has not been studied within the modern communication ecosystem, where ubiquitous mobile devices and connectivity enable constant contact with friends and colleagues. We present results from a lab-based experiment examining how violation of such expectations can affect interpersonal attraction. In studying pairs of known acquaintances, we find that low-responsive partners are rated lower in social attraction than high-responsive partners. We also provide an exploratory analysis of chat logs from the experiment which indicates that responsiveness behavior is part of an interactive process where parties involved negotiate for each other’s attention over time.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

A theoretical framework using SIDE theory and common voice informs a content analysis of Imgur posts and comments in which the Imgur subculture is identified. Evidence of SIDE, which provides the basis for subcultural development, was found in communication regularities and social identity maintenance. Building on initial qualitative work, quantitative evidence is found for common voice, elucidating the Imgur subculture through identification of commenting strategies employed within Imgur. This research seeks to shift away from studying individual users to subcultural analysis. Findings may be extended to other similarly structured sites, particularly those that utilize a hierarchical bidirectionally-voted commenting system. Results provide evidence that cultural study of site-bound digital subgroups is possible, informing future digital media and cultural research by providing a theoretical and methodological framework for examining digital subcultures.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

The pro- and anti-social outcomes of communication via social media have been well-documented. However, as social media have become entrenched as some of our most common communication channels, the absence of communication via social media has been unexplored and may have negative outcomes for individuals, and for continued use of the platform.

2017-0254,2017,Paper Session,A Change of Heart: Exploring the Effects of Varied Heart Rate on Empathy and Social Presence,6,"Research shows that perceiving someone else’s heartbeat can be an intimate experience that evokes emotions in an observer. Previous heartbeat communication studies have used consistent heart rates. To our knowledge, the effects of a target’s varied heart rate on an observer’s emotions, level of empathy with the target, and perception of social presence have not been explored. In this paper, we present the results of an investigation using varied heart rates to increase empathy when the variation is paired with narrative changes within a target’s speech. Forty-four participants watched a recording of a virtual human telling an emotional story about being adopted. For two-thirds of the participants, the recording was accompanied by visual and audio representations of the heartbeat of the virtual human, which was either of a consistent rate (one third of participants) or varied rate (one third of participants). For the final third of participants the recording was not accompanied by any heartbeat representation. Results demonstrated that the most empathy occurred in the varied heart rate condition, and that this effect is a result of cognitive empathy as opposed to emotional empathy.

Twenty Tinder users each evaluated about 50 Tinder profiles, while explaining the reasoning behind their evaluations. The study shows that Tinder users evaluate profiles in a hierarchical order. Their first evaluation of a profile owner is based on physical appearance. If that does not lead to immediate dismissal of a profile, people then continue evaluating potential partners in terms of their subcultural identity, personality, cultural background and age. Moreover, Tinder users evaluate profiles in a hierarchical order: potential partners’ perceived physical attractiveness is assessed first, and evaluators subsequently make assumptions about other characteristics of the potential partner. Our study shows that in online dating, even on Tinder, impressions are not based on physical appearance alone, but that people use the available information to form complete impressions of others.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Some early visions of human-computer relationship such as persuasive computing (Fogg, 2002), ubiquitous computing (Weiser, 1991), and affective computing (Picard, 2003) have come to life in various forms. The present work seeks to understand how individuals may form group relations with computer agents by applying the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects to the Computers are Social Actors Paradigm. The findings suggest that sharing the same color cues with multiple computer agents could lead to users’ group identification with computer agents. Group identification with computer agents could further exert influence on group conformity, conformity intention, group attraction, and group trustworthiness.

TAM was conceived as a simplified version of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) aimed at making it more efficient to conduct technology adoption research. TAM’s continuing development and expansion has come at the cost of its greatest advantage: parsimony. In addition, the theoretical sprawl of TAM has left it incapable of adapting to new perspectives on technology itself. In this paper, we revisit the evolution of TAM and critique the latest iteration of the model (TAM3). We argue that TAM has devolved from parsimony to chaos, and argue for a return to the reasoned action framework. Additionally, we argue that by utilizing this more parsimonious theoretical framework, we can extend our understanding of technology adoption and use by deriving testable hypothesis about the role of technology affordances.",Communication and Technology Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Consequently, cultural differences between French-speaking and German-speaking people could be studied for trust in doctors and health empowerment and new lines of research could be established.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0272,2017,Paper Session,One Country – one Public Sphere? The Pillarization of Switzerland’s Language Regions in the Swiss Media,4,"This paper discusses a potential pillarization of the Swiss (media) public sphere on the basis of a secondary analysis of a content analysis of three Swiss quality newspapers. The Swiss public sphere is characterized by its particular feature of the four official languages (German, French, Italian, Rhaeto-Romanic), which result in at least three different public spheres defined by language and culture. As a basis for modern democracies, mass media communication and the sufficient representation of all cultural groups is crucial for social and cultural integration. As indicators for a pillarization of the public sphere, the empirical analysis examined the sufficient representation of other language regions in news agendas as well as the proportion of exclusively featured topics. The results support the hypothesis of a pillarization of the Swiss national public sphere and proof low attention on national topics as well as a strong thematic focus on the own language region.",Intercultural Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This project seeks to analyze how residential tenure and residents’ use of media and/or interpersonal communication impact their knowledge and use of health-enhancing resources (i.e., grocery stores, farmer’s markets and community gardens, and places to exercise) during a time of rapid neighborhood change. It uses data from surveys and focus groups in a gentrifying neighborhood in Los Angeles. Preliminary analyses of data suggest that communication network composition seems to play a greater, significant role in knowledge and use of health-enhancing resources among residents who are newer to a neighborhood, with media and interpersonal communication facilitating knowledge or use of different resources. Implications and further data analyses are detailed.",Intergroup Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

Consistent with predictions, participants who were successful on each task perceived the message as more accommodative and more clear, and inferred more positive motives and higher levels of perspective-taking by the speaker (compared to those who were unsuccessful). This study demonstrates the potential importance of instrumental outcomes to perceptions of accommodation and attributions about speakers, and in doing so contributes to our more general understanding of how people perceive communication adjustments, and make meaning, in context.",Intergroup Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

These attributions influence everyday routines and apply within the business context, which is nowadays characterized by worldwide networking and intercultural exchange. The aim of the present study is to ascertain a) which cues are most decisive for job suitability ratings, b) how cues interact, and c) whether there is intercultural consensus. For this purpose, we conducted an online experiment (N = 2231) with a European and an Asian subsample. In a 2 (applicants’ sex) x2 (facial attractiveness) x2 (body weight) between-subject design, participants were presented with a picture of a job applicant and evaluated job suitability for female-typed and male-typed jobs.

Interventions focused on how to support victims of cyberbullying are limited by a lack of focus on what types of messages are most valued. This study considers supportive messages that emphasize emotional comfort, attributions of responsibility, and beliefs that people can change as relevant to this context and examines how perceptions of these messages differ based on whether support providers have or lack experience with cyberbullying. We extend resaerch on the indirect effects model of supportive communication by randomly assigning participants (N = 304) to message and source conditions and assessing their perceptions of the messages, providers, and participants’ outcomes after reading the messages. Impressions of messages mediate their influence on outomes. Certain messages, most notably those that contend bullies can change, are less effective when delivered by a source who lacks experience with bullying.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

As part of the efforts of the Gates Foundation-funded Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI) to address supply-side factors, the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP) worked with the State Ministries of Health and local partners in Nigeria to conduct a five-day training for family planning service providers in Benin city and Zaria. Methods: This study used a pre- and post-training simulated client (SC) approach patterned after the GATHER framework to assess the effects of the training on quality of care from the client’s perspectives. Results: The data showed significant improvements in ratings on individual GATHER (Greet Ask, Tell Help. Explain, Return) dimensions and an increase in overall client satisfaction, including perceived competence and trustworthiness of the provider and likelihood of recommending their services. Nonetheless, the data revealed some significant residual weaknesses in provider skills, especially in relation to the Return Greet, Explain and Ask dimensions. Conclusion: These findings suggest that for ongoing family planning programs, a five-day training could be sufficient to improve the quality of client-provider interactions at a magnitude that could be perceivable to individual users and lead to higher satisfaction in the client pool. Nonetheless, there is need for facilitative supervision and periodic refresher training to continue to support trained providers.",Interpersonal Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study draws on the relational turbulence model (Solomon & Knobloch, 2004) to identify features of romantic relationships that are associated with a deficit in received support, which predicts increased illness uncertainty and decreased treatment compliance. Participants were 500 individuals who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and currently involved in a romantic relationship. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze our predicted model. Results indicated that relational uncertainty and interference from partners were negatively associated with received support. In addition, received support was negatively associated with illness uncertainty and positively associated with treatment adherence.

This study examines whether sharing affects future tobacco-related behavior. It further examines whether sharing consistently or inconsistently with one’s intentions will affect whether one implements those intentions as behavior. Using a nationally representative rolling cross-sectional (N=9115) and re-contact (n=2,413) survey of 13-25 year olds, this study found that compared to those who didn’t share, pro-tobacco sharers and pro-e-cigarette sharers at Time 1 were more likely to be smokers and vapers, respectively, at Time 2. Significant interactions suggested that sharing consistently with one’s pre-existing smoking or vaping intentions increased and sharing inconsistently reduced the likelihood of implementing those intentions six months later. These findings suggest that the way one shares about tobacco or e-cigarettes may affect one’s actual behavior, above and beyond pre-existing intentions.

Based on 26 qualitative interviews with employees working in SMEs in Denmark, Slovenia, and the United States, we explore distinct features of the embedded nature of employee volunteering in the broader context of CSR. Our findings reveal that different orientations to CSR (internal, external, and both) guide, inform, and shape the ways employees in these three countries construct employee volunteering as either active, reactive, or proactive CSR practice. As such, our study not only responds to interrelation and intertextuality of various discourses that pertain to CSR, but also addresses the gap in broader scholarship on CSR by focusing on employee constructions of CSR.",Language & Social Interaction Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

This study, therefore, examines attitudinal stance-taking in interactions about Biafra agitations within two Nigerian digital communities, namely, Nairaland and Nigeria Village Square. The study engages the appraisal framework (AF) together with the socio-cognitive approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in its methodology. AF guides a critical analysis of evaluative language in the data and CDA is used to uncover the ideological orientations and discursive practices that inform varied positions about the Biafra situation, as well as the implicit meanings that are generated while interactants take stances.

Yet certain fields are also positioned to act as agents of social change, notably the fashion industry and its associated publications and products. This paper will unpack the gender-bending campaigns of three well-known American fashion companies: Louis Vuitton, CoverGirl and Target. Each of these companies took a public stance in 2016 that focused on either a queer spokesperson or challenge that the queer community faced. These brands have positioned themselves to include the queer community and are defined, partly, by that relationship. We will focus on four aspects of how these companies, and by implication others, challenge traditional gender norms.

The design of the app represents a departure from “old school” dating sites as it leaves plenty of space for pictures, but only minimal room for self-description. This might change the way individuals decide to portray themselves. It might also affect their privacy perceptions as these services are location-based and often include personal conversations and data. Based on a survey collected via Mechanical Turk, we assess how Tinder users perceive privacy concerns. We find that the users are more concerned about institutional privacy than social privacy. Moreover, different motivations for using Tinder – hooking up, relationship, friendship, travel, self-validation and entertainment – affect social privacy concerns more strongly than institutional concerns. Finally, loneliness significantly increases users’ social and institutional privacy concerns, while narcissism decreases them.",Mobile Communication Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III

These memorials provided visual and rhetorical platforms through which each nation can strategically address and naturalize the past. The American memorial was used to create a historical continuum of extremist ideologies that have required American intervention at a time when the government was seeking support for the Iraq War. The Canadian memorial frames itself as memorializing immigrants who sought refuge within its borders at a time when immigration is again a contested issue. Three aspects of the commemorative process are analyzed, including the memorials’ origin stories, their design aesthetics, and the rhetoric used to discuss, debate, and critique the memorials.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0309,2017,Paper Session,An Exploratory Study of Visual Metaphors in Direct-to-Consumer Drug Commercials,1,"This study identified and analyzed the content and structure of visual metaphors (including personification) present in a sample of 212 unique DTC prescription drug commercials hosted on iSpot.tv. Seven visual metaphors are identified, including medicine as a person/character, medicine as an instrument, human organ/tissue as a person/character/animal, illness as an object/person/character, illness as a natural disaster, illness as a state of being, and symptom as an object/animal. Personification is favored by pharmaceutical advertisers. While personification of medicines helps build brand personality, personification of illness and human body separates the illness from the person, giving illness autonomy that is out of a person’s control. Visual metaphors also translate abstract concepts related to illness and subjective feelings of patients into tangible forms, which may help patients communicate their symptoms more efficiently. The danger portrayed and the fear generated from visual metaphors ultimately promote the consumption of the advertised drug.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0310,2017,Paper Session,Symbolic Convergence in Depictions of Syrian Migrants: A Fantasy Theme Analysis of the Humans of New York Series ‘The Syrian Americans’,2,"In this paper we analyze the visual portrayal of Syrian refugees in the Facebook group “Humans of New York,”—a citizen journalism site run by a New York-based photographer. Specifically, we use Symbolic Convergence Theory and its related method, fantasy theme analysis to examine the visual rhetoric of the European refugee crisis that emerges on this site, and the images that were most popular with the site’s viewers. Our findings indicate that while mainstream media images marginalize and dehumanize refugees by portraying them as pollutants and terrorists, alternate sites such as HONY do not function under traditional journalistic norms and routines, and are expected to provide alternate portrayals. The three fantasy themes that emerge are: refugees are skilled, normalized, and are ideologically American. The overall rhetorical vision is a social master analogue that indicates that refugees are capable of assimilating into American life.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0311,2017,Paper Session,Visual War: A Content Analysis of Clinton and Trump Subreddits During the 2016 Campaign,2,"This content analysis will investigate the role of news values and leadership qualities in genderizing visual portrayals of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Reddit posts and visuals shared through candidate subreddits will be examined. Because Clinton is running as the first female major-party presidential nominee, portrayals of the candidates are expected to reinforce traditional patterns in political party genderization, meaning that Republicans will be presented as masculine and Democrats as feminine. A content analysis of Reddit posts and visuals will offer insight into the electorate’s view of the candidates and the engagement of candidate supporters during this election. Most content analyses examine candidate portrayals constructed by professional news media or self-presentations by the candidates themselves, including speeches. This analysis instead investigates candidate portrayals advanced by supporters and opponents through a large social media platform.",Visual Communication Studies Interactive Poster Session,In Event: ICA Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2017-0312,2017,Paper Session,How Health Messages Reach our Brains: Coupled Neural Dynamics During Effective Antialcohol Videos,4,"Health communication via mass media is an important strategy to reduce risky drinking, but many questions remain about how health messages achieve their effects. Here we examine how the brains of young adults - a target group for alcohol prevention - ‘tune in’ to real-life health prevention messages about alcohol. A first study characterized a large sample of audiovisual public service announcements (PSAs) on established measures of message effectiveness. The second study used inter-subject correlation fMRI to examine shared brain responses to high and low effective PSAs. We find that more effective messages evoke more similar responses in the brains of their receivers. The effect is most pronounced in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the insulae, and the precuneus - regions previously implicated in narrative engagement, self-relevance, and attention towards salient stimuli. We suggest that more effective health prevention messages have a greater potential to ‘reach into the brains of audience members’.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0313,2017,Paper Session,Coherent neural activity in the brain’s value system during antismoking messages is linked to reductions in smoking,6,"Cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of preventable death in the United States. One common strategy for reducing the prevalence of smoking and other health risk behaviors is the use of graphic warning labels (GWLs). This has led to widespread interest in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of GWL effectiveness. Here we investigated differences in how the brain responds to negative, graphic warning label-inspired antismoking ads and to neutral, compositionally matched ads, and we probed how this response related to future behavior. A group of smokers viewed negative and neutral antismoking ads while undergoing fMRI, and their smoking behavior was assessed before and one month after the scan. We found that greater coherence in activity within the brain’s valuation network during negative, behaviorally relevant ads than during neutral ads preceded behavior change, suggesting that the integration of information about message value and importance may be key for message uptake.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0314,2017,Paper Session,Virtually “In the Heat of the Moment”: Insula Activation Distinguishes Men Who in Real Life Were Sexually Risky Versus Safe,9,"HIV is most prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and although most MSM use condoms consistently during casual sex, some take risks. To better understand the psychology of those risky decisions, we examined neural correlates of playing a virtual sexual “hook up” game in an fMRI scanner in MSM who had, in the past 90 days, previously been sexually risky (N=76) or safe (N=31). We found that during potentially risky sexual choices, previously risky MSM had more insula activity – typically associated with desire and urge – than previously safe MSM. Trait measures provided greater clarity. Real-life sexual risk was related with trait negative urgency; this relationship was mediated by neural activity in an insular-centered network. Trait negative urgency could drive sexual risk by increasing the likelihood of taking a risk during safe sex negotiation.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology

The present study used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to test media imagery and peer feedback combinations on neural activity related to thin body ideals. Twenty-four healthy female participants rated body sizes of bikini models (‘too thin’ or ‘normal-weight’), directly followed by ostensible peer feedback (‘too thin’ or ‘normal-weight’). Consistent with prior studies on social feedback processing, results showed increased brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral insula in incongruent situations: When participants rated media models as ‘normal-weight’, while peer feedback indicated the models as ‘too thin’ (or vice versa). This effect was stronger for young females with lower self-esteem.

We propose that self-transcendence, the process of redirecting attention from self-interests to the wellbeing of others, is a key component promoting receptivity. To test this, sedentary adults were randomly assigned to a self-affirmation, self-transcendence, or control task before listening to health messages promoting physical activity in an fMRI scanner. Both self-affirmation and self-transcendence exercises elicited greater activity in the brain’s subjective value network (ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC]); however, self-transcendence exercise also recruited greater right temporal parietal junction activity, implicated in social cognition. In the subsequent health messages task, the affirmation and transcendence conditions produced comparable increases in vmPFC activity (relative to controls), a plausible neural index of message receptivity, which predicted decreases in sedentary behavior. These findings support self-transcendence as an effective health intervention strategy, and contribute to previous debates on the mechanisms of self-affirmation.",Your Brain on Health Communication: Applications of Communication Science in Health and Education (HIGH DENSITY),Communication Science and Biology

Discussion of Femen activism around the 2015 shooting at the free speech event in Copenhagen unveils the layering and interlacing of often hidden elements. This paper charts salient topics and concepts relating to the audio account of the attack, live-tweeting of the aftermath, and international media and Twitter discussions swarming around Femen leader Inna Shevchenko’s involvement in the event. Analysis of media artifacts relating to Shevchenko in the 2015 Copenhagen shooting event shows the thickness of actor-networks. Particular attention is paid to how Femen activism perseveres and makes effective use of event, vulnerability, witnessing, and social media. Layering upon layers of (re)mediation through the close-textual, audio, and qualitative Twitter analysis reveals that activism is almost equally dependent upon the contingencies of chance-encounters, as well as the persistent trail-blazing through multiple digital screens towards its own ethic of truths.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication

I argue that Papi’s rising to fame is a production of self dependent upon a very elaborate and powerful new media environment. Such environment has several technological and cultural features. First, there are burgeoning mobile phone users and micro-video consumptions on the mobile devices. Second, the technological capacities of mobile apps have enabled people to easily produce and share micro-videos. However, those apps are inherently gendered, with an emphasis on attracting young female users. Third, Chinese internet, under the stringent political control, is increasingly characterized by consuming entertaining content. Consequently, the popularity of Papi Jiang as a micro-celebrity is a process of employing networked technologies to construct an individual identity that caters to the broader online culture dominating current China.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication
2017-0320,2017,Paper Session,Is an Intervention Needed? Reframing Mobile Media Use to Encourage Critical Reflection,2,"Devices, once viewed as viable threats to the public sphere and public decorum, are now a ‘taken for granted’ presence in our daily interactions (Ling, 2012). This shift in perception has happened over the last 15 years with it ever increasing over the last four years with the proliferation of smartphone growth. Our paper begins at this nexus, between user, device, physical surroundings and the growth of virtual platforms. We attempt to consciously mark the emergence of a modern mobile media lifestyle to examine the possibility that the immersion of users into their devices and the immersion of devices into our physical/embodied environments may inhibit our ability to critically reflect on this technology. Utilizing data from five studies, researchers in London and New York identify entry points for reframing what is known about mobile media use to cultivate critical reflection that is need to guide future research.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication

This paper unpacks the concept and offers evidence of how “the possibility of connecting in transition” helps foreground how mobile communication is, and will continue to be, a uniquely meaningful context of media use.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication
2017-0322,2017,Paper Session,The Influence of Time Perception on Mobile Media Use,4,"This papers deals with the relation between sense of time, acceleration and the use of mobile media. The focus is as well on theoretical approaches towards the subject (from communica-tion studies, sociology and media-sociology) as on the empirical data from our quantitative study.
To avoid a retrospective consideration on media consumption, the study is conducted, using the Experience Sampling Method. This will be discussed on previous experience with the ESM and the specific requirements in our case. The Panel has 104 subjects (N = 2808 meas-ure points) and data was collected over the course of one week. The respondents were asked about their usage of the smartphone each of the last two hours.
The study shows a correlation between sense of time and electronic media use. Those correlations are to be considered closer, to tease out which factors are the context of (accelerated) sense of time. Furthermore clustered chronotypes are to be presented, which base on the self-evaluation-scale of the perception of pace of time in a given period.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication

This exploratory study investigates gratifications from posting food on Instagram and its relationship to personal traits like narcissism and shyness. Moreover, how these gratifications and personal traits can motive users’ attitudes and behaviors of posting food photos on Instagram. The results show that Instagram users who post food have six primary gratifications: self-promotion, escapism, information sharing, archiving, creativity and self-disclosure. Narcissism was a significant positive predictor of all six gratifications, while shyness positively predicted escapism. The implications of this study are discussed.","The Bigger Picture of Mobile Communication: Space, Time, and Art",Mobile Communication
2017-0324,2017,Paper Session,Heartrate as an Implicit Measure of Event Segmentation,5,"A prominent status of psychophysiological measures’ application in communication research can be awarded to the observance of heartrate in the context of perceptual attention’s resource allocation. While research findings in the realm of the LC4MP (Lang, 2006) in particular support the measurement of heartrate as a reliable factor in order to address attention focused processes of mediated message processing, less research has focused proximately on working memory based mental representation processes that account for observations of memory formation, and retrieval as exemplarily observed in cognitive event perception research. Thus, our research draws on linking theories of event perception to heartrate as an implicit measure of audiovisual media processing. A common observation of research findings on heartrate’s orientating responses is that heartrate decelerates before people expect a change of an event or ensuing from unexpected occurences. Our preliminary findings suggest that these orientating responses likewise occur prior to event boundaries.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

A laboratory experiment including a pre- and post-survey was conducted. As an indicator of arousal (activation of the SNS) during stimulus exposure, participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA) was used. Data were analyzed by means of Structure Equation Modelling (SEM). Results indicate that physiological arousal indeed informs the cognitive processing of (persuasive) media messages in “opposing” directions. If physiological arousal is high, reactance is attenuated which is accompanied by a more positive message judgment. This counteractive pattern accordingly results in strengthened attitudes.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0326,2017,Paper Session,Intrinsic Reward Motivates Shifts Between Cognitive Control and Default Mode Networks During Task Performance,4,"Cognitive control explains the neuropsychological processes that underlie the successful completion of everyday tasks. A gap in our understanding is the way in which intrinsic rewards associated with a task motivate sustained control allocation. In three behavioral and one functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we use a naturalistic and open-sourced simulator to show that changes in the balance between task difficulty and an individual’s ability to perform the task result in different levels of intrinsic reward, which motivates dynamic shifts between networked brain states. High levels of intrinsic reward associated with a balance between task difficulty and individual ability are associated with increased connectivity between cognitive control and reward networks. By comparison, a mismatch between task difficulty and individual ability is associated with lower levels of intrinsic reward and corresponds to increased activity within the default mode network. These results implicate reward processing as a critical component of cognitive control.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology
2017-0327,2017,Paper Session,Neural Sensitivity to Implicit vs. Explicit Communication,3,"Categorization represents the over-simplification of a near-infinite amount of information, so rather than become overwhelmed, people can rationally make sense of their experiences. However, doing so can also result in poor decisions when the “sense-making” is over-generalized, based on stereotypes, or biased towards the potential of negative consequences. Surprisingly, recent research reveals whether the categorization is expressed explicitly or implicitly can influence the subsequent decision and has been examined the categorization-decision paradigm. Temporally precise event-related potential (ERP) waveforms from scalp electroencephography (EEG) are well-suited to map neural activity onto sequential social cognitions processes like the categorization-decision paradigm. In particular, studying both P3 and CNV components can provide important insights about the way multiple components differentially process explicit versus implicit categorization and their effects on subsequent decisions. In addition, the temporal precision of neural correlates can help distinguish between implicit automatic stereotyping versus potentially more resource intensive constructive processes.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

For a long period of time, communication scholars have employed self-report measures of memory to answer this question. However, self-report measures may not necessarily provide an accurate index of what people remember. In the research reported here, we use a novel eye movement measure of memory for political information. We report here that eye movements can accurately detect memory for political information even when self-report responses fail to do so. Our results suggest that self-report measures may underestimate the amount of political information citizens learn from the media environment and highlight the utility of eye movement measures in accurately assessing what people remember.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

Known as knowledge brokering, this process is commonly associated with unprecedented innovation. In utilizing brokered knowledge, researchers can fall victim to an “offramp problem” in which the underlying biological, psychological, or social mechanisms which were imported continue to advance in their specific subfields but remain static in media psychology. In this paper, the Limited Capacity Model for Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) is put forth as an example of brokered knowledge which has fallen victim to the “offramp problem”. To demonstrate, the LC4MP is reviewed with a focus on important findings and instances where results observed do not fit LC4MP predictions. We then introduce recent developments in related fields which help explain these anomalous findings, providing empirically testable paths forward. We conclude with practical suggestions for mitigating the “offramp problem”.",Innovations in Communication Science and Biology: Methodological and Theoretical Advancements (High-Density),Communication Science and Biology

It is hypothesized that hostile perceived gay-related public opinion (PGP), negative personal experience, and internalized homonegativity (IH) lead to reduced willingness to express one’s homosexuality in public. An empirical study among n =28.730 gay and bisexual men in Germany showed that positive PGP was associated with a higher, IH with a lower willingness to express homosexuality in public. However, personal experience did not predict whether individuals displayed or hid homosexual behavior.

2017-0332,2017,Paper Session,Transitions in Polyamorous Identity and Intercultural Communication: An Application of Identity Management Theory,3,"This thesis examines the intercultural communicative strategies and non-monogamous identity formation of polyamorous individuals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the identity management tactics that polyamorous individuals utilize to navigate a society in which monogamy is the norm. Interactions of polyamorous individuals within a monoganormative society are treated as a type of intercultural communication due to the contrasting cultural identities and communication rules. E-interviews with 38 polyamorous individuals provided basis for phone and Skype interviews. The Retrospective Interview Technique (Huston, Surra, Fitzgerald, & Cate, 1981) required interviewees to recall development of their polyamorous identity and interactions with monogamous others from the past to present day. Twenty-two interviews produced the phases of identity management, including Trial and Error, Enmeshment (Mixing Up), and Renegotiation. Analyzing interviewees' communication also produced the themes of managing stigma and impressions of the relationship identity. Implications of the study include a richer understanding of polyamorous identity management, polyamory as a relationship orientation, and a new perspective in applying identity management theory.",Interpersonally Communicating About Sexuality,Interpersonal Communication

More specifically, this study (1) explores the relationship between communication during and after sex and tests whether orgasm mediates this relationship, and (2) examines whether communication during and after sex is associated with relationship satisfaction. Three-hundred and nineteen adults (237 women, 82 men) ranging in age from 18-32 years old (M = 19) completed a survey within two hours of a recent sexual episode addressing their communication during and after sexual activity. Results revealed that disclosures during sexual activity predicted the likelihood of orgasm, controlling for participants’ biological sex. More specifically, individuals who disclosed more positive feelings during sexual activity were more likely to orgasm than those who disclosed fewer positive feelings. Additionally, the more individuals disclosed positive thoughts and feelings for their partners during sexual activity, the more likely they were to continue disclosing such feelings immediately following sexual activity. Lastly, results revealed that disclosures during sexual activity were related to relationship satisfaction, as mediated by post sex communication.

2017-0335,2017,Paper Session,Why Do Parents Mediate Children's Use of Smartphones? An Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior,2,"As smartphones have become an essential part of children’s lives, risks associated with smartphone use have raised concerns among parents. Parents implement a range of strategies to intervene in children’s media consumption. However, little is known about how parents deal with the new challenge, and why they make the choices they do regarding their children’s smartphone use. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study examines parents’ attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, and intentions regarding parental mediation of children’s smartphone use. A survey conducted with parents of young smartphone users aged 10-17 shows that parents tend to perceive discussion-based active mediation to be more desirable as compared to control-based restrictive mediation. Findings also indicate that the extent to which parents believe that they have control over their parental mediation practices plays the most important role in forming positive intentions to practice parental mediation, regardless of the mediation domain. We also discuss the implications of these findings and directions for future research.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication

Also, little research has explored child privacy behaviors on mobile platforms and communication. To assess the combined effects of parental mediation and family communication on children’s privacy protection and in-app promotion avoidance on mobile phones, this study adopted an inductive approach to uncovering prevalent parent communication styles using hierarchical cluster analysis. Data was collected from over 600 secondary and tertiary school students, aged 12 to 19 from Singapore. Six cluster groups surfaced and the framework is termed integrated parental mediation model. A MANCOVA statistical test was conducted to investigate the impact on children’s app privacy perceptions, app privacy protection behaviour and in-app promotion avoidance.

The aim of this study was to examine attitudes towards phubbing behavior, and to explore intergenerational differences between digital natives (i.e., people born between 1985 and 1995) and digital immigrants (i.e., people born between 1955 and 1965), as well as the mediating role of phubbing behavior. A survey amongst 500 respondents indicates that digital natives hold significantly less prohibitive attitudes towards phubbing than do digital immigrants. Results also suggest that this difference is mediated by phubbing behavior, as digital natives were found to engage in phubbing behavior more frequently which, in turn, impacts their attitudes for the better. This suggest that perspectives on the social propriety of mobile phones are not universal, but dependent on generation and personal behavior.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication

To that end, a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment was conducted. The findings of the experiment revealed a main effect of absorption: when the phone user displays greater absorption in the mobile conversation, participants consider the phone user as less attentive and polite, and perceive the conversation quality and social attraction as lower. There was no main effect of announcing the behavior, nor was there an interaction effect. These results indicate that the non-verbal behaviors expressed when using one’s phone during a co-present conversation play a central role in explaining any negative effect.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication

These included: the legacy of microcoordinating norms, population network complexity, and varying degrees of anonymity of hospital professionals. Together these themes explained why these care teams used a mobile app much like a dyadic interpersonal interaction. There was an additional thread that wove through these themes: disparity.

In light of theories of journalistic norms, this paper discusses three approaches journalists have taken when sourcing on chat apps: trust, master, or abandon the network. By studying journalistic practices using these three prisms, this paper provides an understanding of how journalists have constructed journalistic trust with sources using chat apps. This paper offers an exploratory study of how foreign correspondents socially constructed mobile chat apps as tools of reportage and as essential links in journalists’ networks of information.","Rules, Norms, and Expectations for Mobile Communication Practices",Mobile Communication
2017-0342,2017,Paper Session,Work-Related Smartphone Dependency Among Young Workers in China: An Examination of Dependency Relations and Antecedents,2,"This study extends the application of the Media System Dependency (MSD) theory to investigate work-related smartphone dependency and its antecedents (i.e., task interdependence, task mobility, time criticality, and organizational norm) among working adults. Analyzing survey data from 527 young Chinese workers, the results show that Chinese young working adults primarily rely on using smartphone for work-related communication, followed by for achieving understanding and orientation goals. Organizational norm is the most influential factor which is associated with three dependency relations. Time criticality is found to be positively associated with understanding dependency and communication dependency, while task interdependence is positively associated with communication dependency. Task mobility has no association with work-related smartphone dependency relations. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0343,2017,Paper Session,Five Days Without a Smartphone: The Paradox Association Between Smartphone Use and Subjective Well-Being: Results From a Deprivation Study,3,"The study examined the association between smartphone use and subjective well-being (SWB). SWB is defined by cognitive (satisfaction with the current day and with social relations) and affective components (negative and positive emotions). Data were collected with a prolonged quasiexperimental deprivation study using qualitative interviews (n = 11) and quantitative diaries (n = 210). Generally, smartphone use seemed to have positive influences on SWB. However, results point to a paradoxical association concerning satisfaction with social relations. On one hand, the participants were significantly more satisfied with their social relations when they used their smartphones. On the other, social interactions via smartphone caused strong negative emotions. This paradox is interpreted by the concepts fear of missing out and the availability dilemma.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0344,2017,Paper Session,Mobile Communication in Interpersonal Relationships: The Effects of Relational and Interstitial Communication Patterns,3,"Mobile communication makes it easy to stay permanently in touch with friends and acquaintances. The classic relational communication pattern (less frequent, but long and intimate conversation) has been complemented by the interstitial communication pattern (frequent, but short and rather superficial messages). However, it is not clear whether and how these changed communication patterns influence relationship satisfaction. The present paper extends these studies by focusing on a broader range of relationships (friend vs. acquaintance; same vs. different city). In the first step, we examined how emotional closeness and geographical distance affect communication patterns via various channels. In the second step, we examined how frequency and content of messages affect relationship satisfaction. We found evidence for both, relational and interstitial communication, depending on the channel. In case of long text messages, intimacy was still an important predictor of relationship satisfaction; for short text messages and voice calls, frequency was more important.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0345,2017,Paper Session,Collective Appropriation and Cooperative Uses of Mobile Telephony Among Myanmarian Fishers,2,"Early research on mobile phone adoption among fishers followed an economistic perspective, focusing mainly on access to market price information. Researchers called for investigations into collective and cooperative uses of the technology. Responding to these calls, we explored Myanmarian fishers’ use of mobile phone to fulfil a range of information needs in the individual, social and business realms. Interviews with 23 fishers in three regions in Myanmar suggested that both social and commercial as well as individual- and community-oriented uses were prevalent. A nuanced picture of use and non-use of mobiles emerged alongside fishers’ socio-economic status and patterns of fishing.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0346,2017,Paper Session,Rationalization of Small-Scale Entrepreneurship via Mobile Communication in Myanmar,4,"This paper examines the adoption and use of mobile communication among several dozen micro-entrepreneurs in Myanmar during the country’s transition into mobile communication. The paper examines those who were not yet adopters as well as those who had embraced the technology. In addition, the paper examines the situation of those who were exploiting the “spillover efficiencies” of mobile telephony by borrowing (sometimes for pay) the phones of others. The findings of the paper suggest that the early adopters reap efficiency benefits while those who lag behind have a weaker position. The paper also examines examples of some small-scale “sideline” activities enabled by the mobile phone, e.g. phone owners selling airtime to non-owners. At the same time, the affordances of the device threatened the core of other small-scale entrepreneurs.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0347,2017,Paper Session,Mobile Phones in the Transformation of the Informal Economy Stories From Market Women in Kampala,2,"This research project is situated within the area M4D (mobile technologies for development), i.e. that mobile technologies play a vital role in the livelihood of people in developing regions. This paper focuses on the transformation of the so-called informal economy, here in the form of street markets. Departing from stories of the women themselves we argue that the mobile phone, not the least through mobile money, changes the street market to also include non-street transactions in interesting and hybridized ways. Furthermore the women included in the study also bear witness on attempts – from city officials as well as local loan sharks – to formalize and control these women and their businesses, processes in which mobile telephony play an important role. On basis of these stories we argue that the celebration of the informality of these economies with its promise of empowering women financially needs to be reconsidered.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
2017-0348,2017,Paper Session,A Longitudinal Study on Relationships Between Motivational uses of Mobile and Online Expressive Civic Engagement,3,"Using three-wave panel data, this study explored the relationship between different motivational uses of mobile applications and online expressive civic engagement. Results showed that all three motivational uses of mobile application – informational, relational, and recreational—had positive relationships with online expressive civic engagement. The results of the study further indicated that all three motivational mobile application uses led to continuous growth of online expressive civic engagements over the three-year period examined (2013-2015). The study advances the literature on mobile communication by introducing results of a longitudinal study that provides evidence for support of positive relationships between different motivational mobile uses and online expressive civic engagement that have in the past been speculated about but rarely put to an empirical test.","Effects of Mobile Communication on Business, Life, and Society",Mobile Communication
