2003-0001,Access to the Media Versus Access to Audiences: The Distinction and its Implications for Media Regulation and Policy,Paper,Access to the Media Versus Access to Audiences: The Distinction and its Implications for Media Regulation and Policy,"When the issue of speakers' rights of access arises in media regulation and policy contexts, the focus typically is on the concept of speakers' rights of access ""to the media,"" or ""to the press."" This right typically is premised on the audience's need for access to diverse sources and content. In contrast, in many non-mediated contexts, the concept of speakers' rights of access frequently is defined in terms of the speaker's own First Amendment right of access to audiences. This paper explores the distinctions between these differing interpretations of a speaker's access rights and argues that the concept of a speaker's right of access to audiences merits a more prominent position in media regulation and policy. This paper then explores the implications of such a shift in perspective for media regulation and policy-making."
2003-0002,Accounting Episodes as Communicative Practice Affecting Cultural Knowledge,Paper,Accounting Episodes as Communicative Practice Affecting Cultural Knowledge,"In this paper I describe accounting episodes as communicative practice that can affect participants' cultural knowledge in boundaries of speech communities. On the basis of in-depth interviews with Japanese-speaking informants in the United States, I analyze: (1) the episodes in which informants' cultural knowledge about appropriate conduct was affected or broadened by their engaging in accounting practices with American English speakers; and (2) the cases in which informants did not pursue the problematic events that they had faced with English speakers because, in reality, they saw difficulty in doing so. In the latter cases, informants' cultural knowledge and their perception of the boundaries tended to remain as they had been before the problematic events. The study supports the idea that boundaries of speech communities are dynamic but also suggests that they would not change so easily because participants often choose not to engage in accounting episodes."
2003-0003,Accounts of Single-fatherhood: A case study,Paper,Accounts of Single-fatherhood: A case study,"Abstract
Relying on single-fathers accounts in a case-study approach, this study examined the experience of single-fatherhood and the communication practices between single-fathers and their child. Single-fathers also answered closed-ended questions. Results offer insight into the challenges and joys that single-fathers experience. Single-fathers clearly disclosed love for their child and a valuation of their relationship with their child, and expressed exasperation and dissatisfaction with the court system and negative perceptions of single-fathers by society. More detailed information and discussion follow."
2003-0004,A Challenge to the Duel: Socializing Dedicated Virtual Reality Fans to the Ideology of Textualism,Paper,A Challenge to the Duel: Socializing Dedicated Virtual Reality Fans to the Ideology of Textualism,"This paper explores the structural controls available in entertainment centers and that mediate the relationship between producer and audience. Virtual World Entertainment -- an early producer of virtual reality games --set up an elaborate system of controls. Virtual World adopted structural controls to train its fans in its own ideology of textualism. This ideology promoted the belief in the unity of the BattleTech world, encouraged players to accept the fit between the entertainment center and the fictional representation of the BattleTech universe and to take the text at face value as an expression of competition. Structural controls already informed the reception of the text by customers in their performance, but this preparation happens to different degrees based upon a person's exposure and socialization. This example is used to explore the nexus of language and technology as a factor in technological diversity, which includes both technological variety and multimedia coordination."
2003-0005,"A chatroom ethnography: Evolution of community, norms, nonverbal communication",Paper,"A chatroom ethnography: Evolution of community, norms, nonverbal communication","In creating an ethnography about the City, Texas AOL chat room community, this paper: engages many of the assumptions made about Computer Mediated Communication; takes the ethnographic turn in studying online synchronous communication; and incorporates participant observation, auto-ethnography, and grounded theory. Findings suggest that in the City chatroom that the process of participants relating to one another is mediated by the collective knowledge of individual identities demonstrated in the chat room. This knowledge of others as individuals affects the use of nonverbal communication, conversation flow, and therefore negotiated community within a particular chatroom interaction."
2003-0006,A Communicative Approach to Road Rage: Accounts of Driving and Retaliation,Paper,A Communicative Approach to Road Rage: Accounts of Driving and Retaliation,"Road rage is a type of interpersonal conflict episode. The ways in which drivers use their vehicles to rectify other people's offensive driving implicates the symbolic nature of road rage. Participants offered detailed accounts of recent road rage experiences. These were coded to portray the precipitating actions, behavioral responses, emotional reactions, and attributions that people might have for their own and other people's driving behavior. Results indicate that people largely rely on Vehicular Communication (e.g., tailgating, honking the horn), Aggressive Communication (e.g., obscene gestures, threats), and Avoidance (e.g., ignore the other person) to manage road rage episodes. Emotional reactions included anger, fear, surprise, and relief. Not surprisingly, participants largely reported that the road rage episode was the responsibility of the other driver and reflected features of the other person that are stable, internal, global, intentional, and blameworthy."
2003-0007,A Content Analysis of Direct Marketing Emails,Paper,A Content Analysis of Direct Marketing Emails,"Based on a strategic communication model and direct marketing literature, a content analysis of 246 direct marketing emails explored email marketing techniques and characteristics. Findings show patterns of practice as well as problems that make email marketing an ¡°unwelcome guest¡± or spam in the minds of many recipients. Lack of permission marketing and personalization tactics threatens to make direct marketing email messages irrelevant and intrusive, perhaps resulting in curtailment."
2003-0008,"A content analysis of news coverage of skin cancer prevention and detection, 1979-2002",Paper,"A content analysis of news coverage of skin cancer prevention and detection, 1979-2002","This study is a content analysis of news coverage about skin cancer, focusing on aspects of primary and secondary prevention. Media coverage was measured using The Associated Press (AP), which is a valid representation of the national news environment. Using a process of successive filtration, every article primarily about skin cancer between September 1979 and September 2002 was identified and coded (N=880). Results revealed that media attention to skin cancer coverage has remained relatively constant since 1990. Reports about skin cancer research received the most media attention of the possible topics, with 35.81f stories about new research; celebrity experiences with cancer received almost as much media coverage (31.8%), followed by other topics (19.3%) and policy (13.1%). Primary and secondary prevention received much less attention than treatment and causes. Specific sun protection practices were mentioned with different frequencies. Self-detection of skin cancer was rarely discussed (5.4%). Strategies for generating increased media attention to skin cancer are discussed."
2003-0009,"A cross-cultural comparison of the relationship between ICA, ICMS and assertiveness/cooperativeness tendencies",Paper,"A cross-cultural comparison of the relationship between ICA, ICMS and assertiveness/cooperativeness tendencies","This study compared the differences and similarities in the relationship of intercultural communication apprehension (ICA) with intercultural conflict management styles (ICMS) and assertiveness/cooperativeness tendencies between U.S. and Korean college students. With Neuliep and McCroskey¡¯s PRICA scale, Wilmot and Hocker¡¯s ICMS scale and Volkema and Bergmann¡¯s assertiveness/cooperativeness dimensions, this study attempted to expand McCroskey and his colleagues¡¯ studies by employing three levels of ICA: Low, medium and high. This study found that there were significant differences across the levels of ICA, ICMS and assertiveness/cooperativeness tendencies between U.S. and Korean college students. The findings of this study suggest that across culture high ICA is a public enemy that we must eliminate; ICA is an important factor in determining how an individual manages intercultural conflicts across culture; reducing ICA may contribute to building more productive intercultural conflict management across culture. However, the findings of this study further implies that besides ICA, there may be some other important factors, influencing ICMS and assertiveness/cooperativeness tendencies, such as shyness, silence, and face."
2003-0010,"""Activism in Paradise"": A Critical Discourse Analysis of a Public Relations Campaign against Genetic Engineering",Paper,"""Activism in Paradise"": A Critical Discourse Analysis of a Public Relations Campaign against Genetic Engineering","This paper explores how a coalition of environmental interest groups implemented an issues-management campaign in New Zealand to influence public policy on genetic engineering, following the report of a Royal Commission on Genetic Modification. In New Zealand, ways of thinking about genetic engineering are strongly contested, and public policy decisions related to genetic engineering will have outcomes of significant economic importance to the country.

A critical discourse analysis of the coalition websites and an interview with one of the organisers highlight the ways in which this campaign depended on the construction of an identity for New Zealanders which motivated significant public activism.

The campaign successfully extended public debate about genetic modification and influenced the Government to extend a moratorium on commercial field trials of genetically modified crops and products. Some interesting paradoxes suggest that one challenge for New Zealand policy on genetic modification may lie in the management of multiple identities."
2003-0011,Adapting and Extending the Technology Acceptance Model in Globally Linked PR Classes,Paper,Adapting and Extending the Technology Acceptance Model in Globally Linked PR Classes,"PR students from Hawaii and Kansas were assigned to use online technologies to communicate with each other as well as cultural consultants in Korea. These geographically dispersed teams were asked to write an issue statement and promotional plan for either organic or genetically modified papaya in Korea. The instructional design was informed by prior research and theory.

The technology acceptance model (TAM) was applied as a diagnostic tool. TAM posits relationships among the following variables: perceptions of the ease of using technology, perceptions of usefulness of technology, intentions to use technology, and actual usage behavior. The model was found to fit particularly well with student attitudes and behaviors related to online Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) used in the class project.

Aside from testing the proposed model, the major purpose of this research was to see how student intentions to use online technologies in their future careers were affected by the main TAM variables. After completing the project, students' perceptions of the usefulness of BBSs became a significant antecedent of their intentions to use BBSs in their future careers, and perceived ease-of-use became less important in terms of future career intents, apparently as a result of the project."
2003-0012,A Dialectic With the Everyday: Communication & Cultural Politics on Oprah Winfrey's Book Club,Paper,A Dialectic With the Everyday: Communication & Cultural Politics on Oprah Winfrey's Book Club,"This essay explores the cultural politics of television talk show host Oprah Winfreys Book Club, which was a mainstay of The Oprah Winfrey Show from 1996-2002. Because women constitute both the primary Oprah television audience and the largest U.S. book buying public, it focuses specifically upon womens involvement in the Club and their modes of engagement with Club selections. The Book Clubs astonishing success, I argue, was attributable in part to the carefully considered communication strategies through which participants, Winfrey, and Oprah producers collectively articulated the value of books and reading specifically for women. Their deemphasizing purely aesthetic considerations, I contend, enabled women to strategize how to use Book Club selections simultaneously to distance themselves from and to engage more intensively with the demands of living in a patriarchal and otherwise socioeconomically stratified U.S. society  a relationship I call a dialectic with the everyday. This essay thus traces the communicative processes/practices through which those involved in Oprahs Book Club articulated a highly sophisticated economy of cultural value around books and reading. It also considers the politics of their negotiations, given that many critics impugned the Club on the basis of its disinterest in judging books via received aesthetic categories."
2003-0013,Adolescent girls and media culture: Unpacking the politics of pleasure,Paper,Adolescent girls and media culture: Unpacking the politics of pleasure,"Teenage girls are a multi-million dollar market niche for media products, and the circulation of ""teen media"" texts are geared to specific constructions of femininity. The idea of pleasure is a contested concept in studies of girls? reading of so-called teen media. In this paper, ethnographic field observations of teenaged girls? peer group conversations about teen media are used to problematize and socially situate their pleasure in the texts. Pleasure is shown to be a complex term that addresses not only girls? attraction to the ideologies of femininity encoded in the texts, but their resistance to dominant ideologies. The pleasure of resistance is a politically potent force that may open up the possibility of a critical feminist praxis among adolescent girls, if it is recognized as a beginning and not an endpoint."
2003-0014,Ad Repetition and Variation in a Competitive Ad Context,Paper,Ad Repetition and Variation in a Competitive Ad Context,"This study explores ad repetition and variation effects for a new brand in a competitive ad context in which ads for the leading brand in the same category are present. In the presence of competitive interference, ad repetition significantly increases ad recognition. Ad repetition also encourages subjects to take product beliefs into account in making product judgments. In addition, brand attitudes, brand interest ratings and purchase intent are improved with two ad exposures over one ad exposure. The number of product attributes has also been shown to moderate ad repetition effects. Moreover, two ad variation strategies are distinguished, i.e., substantive/cosmetic variation and cosmetic variation. The relative effectiveness of the two variation strategies on ad recognition and ad campaign perception is examined."
2003-0015,Advantage ISP: Terms of Service as Media Law,Paper,Advantage ISP: Terms of Service as Media Law,"This study analyzes rules enforced by ISPs with regulatory-like effect in the areas of ISP-user relations, content, and behavior. ISP Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies include dozens of rules that forbid constitutionally protected communicative content and behaviors and in many cases force users to grant ISPs licenses to all content uploaded or posted. Users often have no knowledge of enforcement criteria, tools, and practices. While users have liability for all effects of their use -- whether or not intended -- ISPs have almost none. The number of rules put in place by ISPs is multiplying over time. Greater protections for freedom of speech and respect for user intellectual property rights can be found in non-commercial ISPs, while there is less of both in non-US-based ISPs. Possible responses to this trend include economic approaches such as forming large user groups (eg, coalitions of libraries and/or universities) to negotiate agreements with greater protections for constitutional rights and formation of new ISPs that identify such protections as a market niche. Legal approaches include distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary speech environments in the courts, application of public forum analysis to ISPs in the courts and in Congress, and addressing ISP agreements as de facto changes in copyright law that require congressional and judicial attention. Responding to the development of a regulatory-like function for ISPs is important at this point in time because history of use is critical in public forum analyses and other areas of legal precedent."
2003-0016,Advice to Practitioners: A Review of the Popular Press Literature on Planned Change Communication,Paper,Advice to Practitioners: A Review of the Popular Press Literature on Planned Change Communication,"This study offers a thematic analysis of a sample of bestselling popular press books about planned organizational change implementation. Our purpose was to examine the common themes in advice existing within these books and determine the degree of agreement about communication and other necessary implementer strategies. In our analyses, we examined the advice given by these authors regarding the nature of change, the role of the change agents in implementation, the nature of resistance to change, general strategies for implementation, and specific actions steps that implementers should take in communicating during implementation of change. Themes within each of these general categories are presented and discussed in terms of their prevalence and general character."
2003-0017,"Affective-News Theory: Effects of Narrative Structure on Suspense, Curiosity, and Enjoyment While Reading News and Novels",Paper,"Affective-News Theory: Effects of Narrative Structure on Suspense, Curiosity, and Enjoyment While Reading News and Novels","Three studies (n = 311) were conducted to investigate effects of narrative structure and authenticity on suspense, curiosity, and reading enjoyment. A questionnaire developed to measure suspense and curiosity substantiated the discriminant validity of these dimensions. In a web-based study and two paper-pencil studies, respondents read texts that were manipulated for narrative structure (linear, with omission, or 'inverted pyramid'). To manipulate authenticity, texts were presented either as news articles or as novel excerpts, a treatment that proved to be effective. All seven hypotheses gained empirical support. Linear structures evoked more suspense than either structures with omission or the 'inverted pyramid.' Curiosity was higher in reaction to omission structures than it was for either linear structures or the 'inverted pyramid.' The linear structure and the omission structure both produced greater reading enjoyment than the 'inverted pyramid.' Interestingly, these effects were independent of authenticity of media content, being either journalistic or literary."
2003-0018,A field test of equivocation theory: Apologies by Canadian churches to indigenous people,Paper,A field test of equivocation theory: Apologies by Canadian churches to indigenous people,"To extend the avoidance theory of equivocation from quantitative lab experiments to naturally occurring instances, we analyzed the texts of six apologies that were originally offered in person by four Canadian church organizations. The decision of a church to apologize to indigenous people for past actions created a conflict in which the church would wish to avoid the negative consequences of refusing to apologize but also those of a full apology. Using the standard that a true apology includes the agent and the acts of the offense, the analysis focused on whether the church or its representatives were the grammatical subject of acts described in simple active voice (vs. passive, a noun, etc.). Four of the six never used this construction for the offences and were thus equivocal apologies. The internal evidence suggests that potential legal liability is the primary barrier to taking full responsibility."
2003-0019,A Frog in a Well: People's Daily and its Geographic Landscape,Paper,A Frog in a Well: People's Daily and its Geographic Landscape,"This study examines the Chinese medias portrayal of the outside world as it experiences a vital transitional phase from a closed-society. Content analyzing 21 issues of Peoples Daily, the nations most influential newspaper with the largest circulation, the study finds the Chinese media to report international news with limited geographic scope and without diversity of news themes. The landscape constructed by Peoples Daily is Sino-centric as it only maps out Chinas rivals, partners and followers to serve Chinas own political agenda and justify its foreign policy."
2003-0020,A Functional Approach to Political Advertising,Paper,A Functional Approach to Political Advertising,"This study applies the functional theory of political campaign discourse to the 1997 Korean presidential advertisements. Findings challenge the notion that the political campaign was mostly negative. In fact, the candidates used almost the same amount of positive and negative utterances. The incumbent party candidate, Lee, devoted more discourse to acclaim than attack, whereas Kim, the challenger, used more attacks than acclaims. Policy and character were also equally discussed. Both candidates used more acclaims than attacks when they discussed policy. However, they employed more attacks than acclaims when they discussed character."
2003-0021,Age Moderates the Relationship between Social Support and Psychosocial Problems,Paper,Age Moderates the Relationship between Social Support and Psychosocial Problems,"Social support is commonly assumed to protect people from the experience of psychological distress and to enhance well-being. However, past research shows that the effectiveness of social support from family members and friends varies over the life span. Both the theory of evolutionary psychology and socioemotional selectivity theory provide compelling accounts for why this may be the case. In accord with each theory, age was predicted to moderate the association between social support and the experience of depressive symptoms and loneliness. This moderational model was tested in a community-based sample of 325 adults ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Results indicated that social support from family members and sheer contact with them, as well as social support from a spouse/partner, was most strongly and negatively related to the psychosocial problems in the younger participants. Age also moderated the association between relationship standards and loneliness. Consistent with the assumptions of socioemotional selectivity theory, older people do not appear to be as dependent as younger people are on receiving social support from diverse sources in order to maintain a sense of well-being."
2003-0022,Agenda setting and political partisanship in an election campaign: Reinforcing and undermining partisan voting intentions,Paper,Agenda setting and political partisanship in an election campaign: Reinforcing and undermining partisan voting intentions,"Although the media are perceived to be influential in putting issues on the agenda of other voters, there is less evidence that media agendas influence individual behavior. In this two-wave study conducted before and after the 2001 Australian Federal Election we investigated how the media agenda reinforced and/or undermined partisan voting intentions. Voters from the two political sides and neutral voters uniformly perceived the issues of immigration and defense as focal to others and to the election outcome, although only conservative partisans embraced both issues as important personally. Moreover, regardless of partisanship, personal importance of these issues pre-election was linked with self-reported political behavior post-election in ways that indicated that agenda issues had undermined the partisan intentions of left-wing voters and reinforced the partisan intentions of conservative voters. Results are interpreted as strong evidence for the interplay between political partisanship and the agenda context in election campaigns."
2003-0023,Agenda Setting Effects on Online Users: The analysis of the World Cup coverage and online discussions,Paper,Agenda Setting Effects on Online Users: The analysis of the World Cup coverage and online discussions,"This study examined possible agenda setting and reverse agenda setting effects on online users with the issues of the 2002 World Cup soccer games. There have been only few attempts to apply agenda setting theory to online discussions and sports coverage. For this purpose, this study content analyzed articles of the New York Times and the Washington Post and online discussions of the Google newsgroup about the World Cup.
Correlation tests were used to compare media coverage and online discussions in two ways: media to online users and online users to media. Researchers examined if there was a significant correlation between teams heavily covered by media and teams extensively discussed by online users.
The finding revealed that there were agenda setting effects on online users in general, but reverse agenda setting was not found. The result also suggests that agenda setting effects were associated with the significance of matches."
2003-0024,A general process model of the gender-linked language effect: Antecedents for and consequences of language used by men and women,Paper,A general process model of the gender-linked language effect: Antecedents for and consequences of language used by men and women,"The Gender-Linked Language Effect has been found with great consistency over the past two decades across a wide variety of contexts. Observers reading transcripts of natural communication rate women (whom they can not identify as such) higher on Socio-Intellectual Status (SIS) and Aesthetic Quality (AQ), and men higher on Dynamism (D). But what is the causal chain that leads to this remarkably constant result? The present paper presents a general process model to explain the effect. Constructs of the model include: the speakers situational inputs, perception of context, gender-linked language schemata and stereotypes, and gender-linked language behaviors, as well as the hearers perception of context, gender-linked language schemata and stereotypes, judgments of SIS, AQ, and D, and behaviors toward the speaker. A total of 48 theorems are derived from the model."
2003-0025,A Hunting Season for Pirates: Anti-Piracy Measures and Their Effectiveness in Bulgaria,Paper,A Hunting Season for Pirates: Anti-Piracy Measures and Their Effectiveness in Bulgaria,"According to official estimates, Bulgarias pirate activities have incurred $105 million in trade loses for 1995 alone. Despite some major improvements, the 2002 International Intellectual Property Alliance report, places Bulgaria on the Watch List for countries with excessive levels of piracy.
The recurrent nature of the piracy problem in Bulgaria raises several questions: What is the current state of piracy in Bulgaria? What have been the measures undertaken by the Bulgarian government and international community to combat this problem? Why are Bulgarian CD pirates proving to be so resistant to international and domestic pressure?
In an attempt to address these questions adequately, the present study will be organized into five parts. Part I will provide a brief overview of major international treaties and conventions that govern current anti-piracy efforts. Part II will present an overview of Bulgarian Copyright Law as adopted in September, 1993. Part III will discuss in detail the scope and types of piracy in Bulgaria. Some estimates will be provided as to the losses incurred as a result of pirate trade. Part IV will present a detailed discussion of the measures undertaken in the past 7-8 years to combat piracy in Bulgaria. The last part, Part V, will explore the appropriateness of the measures and their effectiveness in a Bulgarian context. Specifically, it will address such factors as economic development, political history and ideology, culture of the people engaged in piracy and the adequacy of the legal system to enforce the laws."
2003-0026,"A Longitudinal Study Examining The Priming Effects of Music on Driving Anger, State Anger, and Negative-Valence Thoughts",Paper,"A Longitudinal Study Examining The Priming Effects of Music on Driving Anger, State Anger, and Negative-Valence Thoughts","Aggressive driving is a serious problem throughout the United States (e.g., Mizell, 1997; Tasca, 2001). Much of the literature addressing this phenomenon examines factors such as demographics (e.g., Arnett, 1994), personality characteristics (e.g., Deffenbacher, Huff, Lynch, Oetting, & Salvatore, 2000), and environmental circumstances (e.g., Turner, Layton, & Simons, 1975) as aggressive driving predictors. Using Berkowitzs (1993) priming effects theory, the present study examines the effects of music (non-violent music with non-violent lyrics, violent music with no lyrics, and violent music with violent lyrics) on college students negative-valence thoughts, driving anger, and state anger, using a longitudinal experimental design study. Within-subjects effects analyses for each of the four music conditions indicated a significant quadratic contrast for driving anger, negative-valence thoughts, and state anger. Additionally, results identify predictors of driving anger along with a discussion of implications for communication researchers and the radio broadcast industry."
2003-0027,"A Longitudinal Time Series Analysis of the Foreign Affairs Issue: Agendas of the President, the Media, the Public",Paper,"A Longitudinal Time Series Analysis of the Foreign Affairs Issue: Agendas of the President, the Media, the Public","This study examines the relationship among the agendas of the president, the mass media, and the public regarding the foreign policy issue in the United States from January 1989 to December 1996. ARIMA time-series analysis is used in an attempt to assess which factors drive measured public opinion regarding foreign policy. Most important problem survey results from various polling organizations are aggregated into a series of 96 monthly time points to measure the public agenda. The media agenda is developed from a content analysis of the foreign policy issue in the evening news broadcasts of the three major television networks and The New York Times. The presidential agenda is developed from a similar analysis of the Public Papers of the Presidents. Results indicate support for a bidirectional, or two-way relationship between the President and public opinion. Little support was found for a one-way relationship between the media agenda and the President."
2003-0028,A Mediational-Hierarchical Model of Sexual Aggression,Paper,A Mediational-Hierarchical Model of Sexual Aggression,"The study of pornography's potential influence on sexual aggression requires embedding this focus within a broader model that encompasses other relevant factors as well. This study tests a model of sexual aggression that incorporates general antisocial personality characteristics and factors specific to sexual aggression, such as sexual promiscuity, attitudes condoning violence against women and pornography consumption. Results generally indicate strong support for the hypothesized model. Regression analyses demonstrated that, as expected, hostility towards women and an impersonal orientation to sex interact to predict sexual aggression, and that pornography consumption augments this interaction. Structural equation analyses supported the hypothesis that general 'hostile' personality factors indirectly influence sexual aggression, and that this indirect relationship is mediated by hostility specifically directed at women. This research therefore successfully integrates factors common to sexual aggression research conducted in both the criminal and non-criminal populations, and models the role of pornography consumption within this broader integration."
2003-0029,America in Jerusalem: Reflections of the American Image in Israeli Advertising During the 90s,Paper,America in Jerusalem: Reflections of the American Image in Israeli Advertising During the 90s,"American values, symbols, landscapes and lifestyles have been widely used in Israeli advertisements to market a vast array of consumer goods. Analysis of advertisements in Israeli newspapers during the 90s reveals that American symbols were invoked to promote products produced in America, Israel and even third countries. Through examining the relationship between advertising and culture along with the changes that have occurred in Israeli society during this period, our analysis focused on two interlocking spheres: capitalist-economic (labor and production, consumption and technology) and cultural (cultural heroes, language and lifestyle). Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, it is our goal to show how social values change over time, losing their Israeliness and taking on an American flavor. This article seeks to present the manifestation of the American image in Israeli advertisements and thereby fuel discussion of the Americanization of this society"
2003-0030,A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of Family Planning Campaigns in Less Developed Countries,Paper,A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of Family Planning Campaigns in Less Developed Countries,"The present study is a research synthesis on the effectiveness of family planning campaigns in developing countries. Using meta-analysis, the study examined 33 campaigns done by a prominent organization that has received substantial federal funding since 1987. On average, there were small, positive effects of the campaigns on knowledge of modern family planning methods (r = .20), spousal communication about family planning (r = .10), behavioral intentions (r = .08), and use of modern methods of family planning (r = .06). Exposure to the campaigns (averaging 71%) was higher than exposure to domestic campaigns (Snyder & Hamilton, 2002), and the average effect of self-reported campaign exposure on use was r = .14. The results should be interpreted tentatively, but can still be helpful to campaign planners and evaluators."
2003-0031,A Meta-Analytical Review of the Relationship between Teacher Immediacy and Student Learning,Paper,A Meta-Analytical Review of the Relationship between Teacher Immediacy and Student Learning,"This meta-analysis reviews the findings of 81 studies (N = 24,474) examining the relationship between teachers' verbal and/or nonverbal immediacy and students' learning outcomes. The cumulative evidence indicates a meaningful correlation (r = .50) between overall teacher immediacy and overall student learning. Average correlations were obtained for teachers' verbal immediacy (r = .47), nonverbal immediacy (r = .48), and combined-only immediacy (r = .55) in relation to overall student learning. Teachers' verbal immediacy was found to correlate with students' perceived learning (r = .49), affective learning (r = .49), and cognitive learning (r = .06). Teachers' nonverbal immediacy was found to correlate with students' perceived learning (r = .51), affective learning (r = .49), and cognitive learning (r = .17). Average effect sizes were generally smaller in experimental research designs than in survey-type research. The cumulative results of this meta-analysis confirm that teacher immediacy has a substantial relationship with certain attitudes and perceptions of students in relation to their learning, but an almost negligible relationship with cognitive learning performance."
2003-0032,A Model for Assessing Web Sites as Tools in Building Organizational-Public Relationships,Paper,A Model for Assessing Web Sites as Tools in Building Organizational-Public Relationships,": This essay draws upon previous theorizing in public relations (Broom, Casey & Ritchey, 1997; J. Grunig & Huang, 2000) to outline a model of antecedents, processes and consequences of using web sites to build and maintain organizational-public relationships. A variety of organizational, systems and user factors influence the process. Users become aware of and access a site, learn about content and the source, interact with the system and possibly other people, and form attitudes about the content and system. The effects or consequences of online communications can be measured terms of a user's knowledge of content or the source, attitudes toward the organization, subsequent communications activities, and engagement in behaviors that benefit the organization."
2003-0033,"A Model of Consumer Behaviors in Electronic Commerce: Trust, Information Search, and Internet Shopping",Paper,"A Model of Consumer Behaviors in Electronic Commerce: Trust, Information Search, and Internet Shopping","Both trust in e-commerce and online product information search have been discussed as key concepts in e-commerce literature. This paper examines the influence of these two factors on online shopping in association with other consumer characteristics such as impulsiveness, innovativeness, and trust in overall business system. We also include Internet skill and time spent online as being antecedent to e-commerce trust and product information seeking over the Internet. By specifying relationships among these concepts, we attempted to propose a model of consumer behaviors on the Internet. Results indicate that, as expected, trust in e-commerce and online information search played central role in explaining online shopping. The two carry much of other factors¡¯ influence on online shopping, showing how consumer personality characteristics, predispositions, Internet skill and amount of Internet use are related to online shopping."
2003-0034,A Moderating Role of Channel Responsiveness in the Effects of Online Information Source,Paper,A Moderating Role of Channel Responsiveness in the Effects of Online Information Source,"A lack of regulation on the content and content providers of online information, particularly online health information, allows anyone including non-professionals to provide health information on the Internet. Potentially inaccurate and biased information provided by non-professionals and those with commercial intent may result in adverse effects on individuals health. In this study, we investigate if indication of a source of online health information can have positive effects on key health outcomes and if responsiveness of the information channel, the Web site, moderates the effects of source. Findings of the study show that effects of source and responsiveness of the Web site are contradictory to common expectations. Implications for government and commercial sources of online health information are discussed."
2003-0035,A Multidimensional Approach to the Study of Media Effects,Paper,A Multidimensional Approach to the Study of Media Effects,"One major development in mass communication scholarship has been the identification of dimensions of media effects. A dimension is a measurable quality that implies magnitude and (usually) direction, such as the time it takes for an effect to occur. Any media effect can be characterized in terms of its dimensions. A review of the literature has uncovered eight important mass media dimensions. It is proposed that these can be used to develop richer conceptualizations of media effects, to organize and evaluate the literature, and to build theory. In addition, these dimensions can be combined to form higher-level conceptualizations, as well as matrices of effects that also can be used for pedagogy, analysis and theory construction."

Academic networks are used to test this association, employing a multilevel model that includes communication network data and psychometric measurements of influence from one hundred fifteen faculty who represent thirteen academic departments. Although the centrality-influence link is partially supported, centrality did not predict behavioral intentions. Implications for the centrality-influence link and related multilevel theories of social influence are addressed."
2003-0037,An Academic Accomplishment Index For Assessing Faculty Performance,Paper,An Academic Accomplishment Index For Assessing Faculty Performance,"A quantitative procedure was developed for assessing the scholarly, teaching and service accomplishments of faculty members who are being reviewed for promotion and tenure. A national survey was conducted with 109 university and colleges soliciting administrators judgments for their assessments of their colleagues performance and productivity. The administrators were asked to respond to a paired-comparison questionnaire consisting of eleven faculty performance criteria, indicating in each of the 55 possible pairs which was more important as an indicator of achievement. The Academic Assessment Index (AAI) was then developed from a statistical analysis of these results. It is suggested that this AAI may provide an important perspective on the difficult issue of assessing faculty performance. That perspective can be of value not only to administrators who must make those judgments, but also to those pursuing advanced degrees in preparation for a career in higher education and for newly hired faculty members who need to understand how their teaching, scholarly performance and service activities will be judged by senior colleagues and administrators as they seek career advancement."

With a special focus on news content, this paper examines which areas of news of the older media have been displaced by the Internet. The data used in this study were obtained from a survey at Pew Research Center conducted in June 2000 (n= 1,107). The results, of the relations of demographic variables, news attention, and news interest to the phenomenon of media functional displacement, shows that people who experienced displacement since Internet use are different from those who did not. Based on the results, we suggest that observation at the content level explains some more than observation at the medium level."
2003-0039,Analysis of Discourses Encompassing the 'Migrant Mother' Picture,Paper,Analysis of Discourses Encompassing the 'Migrant Mother' Picture,"This paper investigated how a photographic image embodied different meanings in different discourses by analyzing its internal and external contexts. For the paper, I chose Dorothea Lange's 'Migrant Mother' picture which is one of the documentary photographs reproduced widely in the 1930s in America. The paper examined how each discourse directs the meaning of 'Migrant Mother' picture by analyzing how the photographic image had different meanings, along with different written texts and visual structures, depending on its presenting agency.
The result shows that the Migrant Mother picture was differently represented according to its accompanying texts and other photographs -- as plight of migrant workers suffering from poverty, as a symbol of the strong will of migrant workers, as a symbol of people who need public aid, or as a symbol of people who worry about the future of America. It shows that the specific meaning of a photographic image is strongly influenced by its accompanying verbal text. The presenting agency of a photograph, however, influenced how the photograph is accepted by viewers, rather than altering the specific meaning of the photographic image. Putting these results together, internal and external contexts of a photograph work together to form a discourse, and the discourse directs a specific and implicit meaning of a photographic image."

Rogan and Hammer examined the discourses in crisis negotiations, including two non-hostage and one hostage-taking incidents, by coding them into their facework categories. This study tests the applicability of their findings to typical hostage-taking events. Results are inconsistent in a large part with Rogan and Hammer's. This study discovered that participants typically engaged in Neutral Face and Positive Backchannels, while the dominant behaviors in Rogan and Hammer's study were Face-restoration. Attack Other's Face, which Rogan and Hammer did not find, was employed by the participants with significant frequencies. Face-defense behaviors were conducted rather than Face-restoration. Investigation of selection of facework behaviors over time revealed that Attack Other's Face occurred more frequently towards the end of the incidents. Frequencies of facework behaviors are shown in tables."
2003-0041,Analyzing Exposure and Attention Variables in Media Effects Research,Paper,Analyzing Exposure and Attention Variables in Media Effects Research,"The present study examines adolescents self-reports of exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines, self-reported attention to cigarette ads, and memory for cigarette ads. The central question of interest was whether a multiplicative model or an additive model of the effects of exposure and attention would better predict memory for cigarette ads. Surveys were administered to 242 adolescents. To assess exposure, the survey included questions regarding how often and how thoroughly participants read 46 magazines with varying levels of cigarette advertising (assessed using content analyses). The results indicated that an additive model of the effects of exposure and attention was superior to a multiplicative model for these data. Moreover, analyses indicated that there are psychometric problems associated with some approaches to using multiplicative measures that may cause them to provide unreliable or easily misinterpreted results. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed, including problems associated with inferring media effects from association with measures of attention, and preferred analytic strategies for examining weighted products of exposure and attention are recommended."

Our analysis begins to explain why code developed in different institutions differ in various social and technical attributes, such as their support for standards or the attention to privacy considerations. The institutions we consider include universities, firms, consortia, and the open source movement. We specifically analyze how institutions differ in structure, their motivations, and how they are differentially affected by social, political, economic, and legal influences. This analysis provides a crucial first step in understanding the production of the law of cyberspace. Eventually, this analysis will allow scholars and policymakers to assess and to begin proactively shaping the development of code to meet societal concerns."

Analyses indicate that engaging in problem-solving behaviors, versus making simple role requests, is related to giving and seeking more information on ideas/plans as well as success and satisfaction in role negotiation. Employees are also more apt to problem-solve when seeking pivotal role changes and make simple requests when seeking relevant role changes. Findings related to work-related outcomes are also reviewed and implications for future research are discussed."

Previous scholars argue that a symbol conveys a meaning within a particular context. To find what was signfied by that flag symbol, we examined the flag images in American newspapers' front pages: September 11, 2001, the next day, the rest of the week, and on the anniversary, 2002. We observed the flag image context: with objects and people, and the camera shot types, image size and media placement by editorial choice. Day One had no flag images; those newspapers that did have a flag image on Day Two relied on the Pulitzer Prize winning photo of three firemen raising the flag in the WTC rubble; what we call a contrasting goodness with evil. The flag image went from a distance shot to more and more a central political and cultural focus with people by 2002.The meanings of the flag symbol include a protective shroud, a religious icon, a rallying point, as well as an identity mechanism, representing a change from being a mother, father, etc. to being a unifying collective, an American."

I start by outlining a model of audience psychology that draws on theories from ecological psychology. By focusing on encounters between individuals and their environment, and the interaction frames that provide the rules for those encounters, I argue that ecological psychology provides a useful framework for understanding the audience-media relationship. Then I discuss the contribution that narrative psychology might make to this framework. Finally I apply this model to a number of topics in mass communication which have proved difficult for traditional theories of the audience to account for."

Extended Abstract

As new technologies inundate the market the understanding of key variable factors that can predict their diffusion has become paramount. The diffusion of innovations paradigm (Rogers, 1983, 1995; Rogers and Singhal, 1996) provides demand side explanations of how new innovations are communicated, evaluated, adopted, and reevaluated by consumers (Williams, Strover, and Grant, 1994). According to the theory, adoption decisions are subject to four major factors namely, adopters personality traits, socioeconomic influences, interpersonal and mass media influences, and the perceived attributes of the innovation. These perceived attributes are key determinants of adoption decisions and thereby the rate of diffusion. The current study focuses on a relatively new innovation  the PDA or the Personal Digital Assistant, and explores key attributes that predict behavioral intention by potential adopters by applying a research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989).
TAM is an adaptation of the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and is tailored for modeling user acceptance of information technology. TAM is a robust model that provides explanation of user behavior across a broad range of end user computing technologies and user populations (Davis et al., 1989). According to TRA, a persons performance of a specified behavior is determined by his behavioral intention (BI), and BI is jointly determined by the persons attitude (A) and subjective norms (SN) concerning the behavior in question. Similar to TRA, TAM postulates that usage is determined by BI, but differs in that BI is viewed as being jointly determined by a persons attitude toward the system (A) and perceived usefulness. According to TAM, attitude toward a system is jointly determined by usefulness and ease of use.
The research model for this study is based on the TAM model while introducing several modifications, which are not in TAM. According to Davis (1989) complexity or the degree to which diffusion is perceived as being relatively difficult to use parallels perceived ease of use. However, other factors from diffusion theory such as compatibility and relative advantage have been dealt with too broadly and inconsistently as to be difficult of interpret (Tornatzky and Klein, 1982; Davis, 1989). Hence, based on the diffusion of innovations theory, three new constructs were introduced in place of perceived usefulness, namely perceived convenience, perceived costs/risks of adoption, and perceived observable benefits. The belief variables are the four user perceptions of PDAs: relative ease of use, perceived convenience, costs/risks, and observable benefits. These belief variables affect attitude towards technology in general, and these attitudes in turn affect behavioral intent (BI). BI is then considered a key determinant of actual usage. Based on this adaptation of TAM, key hypothesis are generated to predict the potential relationships between these determinants of PDA adoption. Since the study focuses only on these key factors, the external stimulus variables such as demographics, ownership of technology, and media use are controlled for.
Data for the study has been collected using a CATI system with a representative sample of potential PDA consumers. The data was collected over 2 weeks of September 2002. Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that controlling for other factors, the attitude towards technology is determined by the perceived ease of use, and the potential costs or risks involved in adopting the innovation. BI is significantly predicted by attitude (A). The findings of the study would further the understanding of innovation decisions by helping marketers focus on key variables when promoting a new technology product.

2003-0049,An Empirical Examination of Secondary Task Reaction Times: Testing What They Really Measure,Paper,An Empirical Examination of Secondary Task Reaction Times: Testing What They Really Measure,"This study tests a model of what secondary task reaction times (STRTs) actually measure as outlined in the STRT model proposed by Lang and Basil (1998). Lang and Basils (1998) review of the STRT literature found that past literature referred to four theoretical definitions of what STRTs measure: resources required by a message; resources allocated to the message; resources available for processing; and resources remaining in the system. Indeed, they found that individual studies would often fluctuate between conceptualizations. The authors then integrated the limited capacity model of mediated message processing (for a complete discussion of the model, see Lang, 2000) with the four definitions, concluding that a conceptualization of STRTs as an index of available resources at encoding best fit the published STRT results.
STRT methodology requires a subject in an experiment to perform a primary and secondary task at the same time, and it is assumed that the subject cannot concurrently use the same resources for the primary and secondary tasks. As primary tasks require more resources, there are fewer resources left over to conduct the secondary tasks, and STRTs slow down (Lang and Basil, 1998).
Lang and Basil (1998) focused in particular on the counterintuitive results found for STRTs elicited during messages with high and low global video complexity and local video complexity. Theory seemed to predict that global video complex messages would elicit slower STRTs because more resources would be required to process them. But in fact, global video complex messages elicit faster STRTs than do simple video complex messages. Lang and Basil (1998) suggested the reason for this is that more resources are made available during complex messages. This means increasing global complexity leads to more resources being allocated to the message, thus increasing available resources. According to this view, global complexity determines the number of resources allocated to the attention task, and the content/structure of the message determines the number of resources required to process the message (Lang and Basil, 1998). Thus their model suggests that STRT is an indicator of available resources, specifically it indexes those resources made available to the cognitive subprocesses of encoding a message not needed to process the message. In other words, the structural features in globally complex messages elicit a large allocation of resources and the demands for resources made by the ongoing processing and storage of messages to encoding, but because many of those structural features do not require many resources to be processed, an over allocation of resources results (Lang and Basil, 1998, p. 458).
Lang and Basil (1998) define available resources as the resources allocated to the message (which is increasing) minus the resources required by the message (p. 460). If the resources required are less than the resources allocated, the available resources in global complex video messages may very well increase. Thus, there would be more resources available during complex messages compared to simple messages, and if this occurs as the reaction times will be faster during global video complex messages.
Studies investigating the effects of global and local video complexity suggest a way to directly test this model. Lang et al. (1999) found that cuts (i.e., change from one scene to an unrelated scene) in television programming automatically allocated resources to encoding. As the number of unrelated cuts increases, more attentional capacity is called to encoding. This resulted in a curvilinear effect on recognition (here an index of encoding) such that recognition improves from slow to medium-paced messages but decreases from medium to fast-paced messages, suggesting an overload.
Conversely, Lang et al. (2000) predicted and found that increasing the number of edits defined as a change from one camera shot to another within the same visual scene in a message would show an increase in recognition with no overload (p. 99). This is because the edit adds little new information to be processed, hence resources are allocated but are not needed to process the change.
Thus it is logical to use the number of structural features to manipulate how many resources are allocated to encoding, and the type of structural feature (cut or edit) to manipulate how many resources are needed to process the structural feature. Therefore, fast-paced messages with many edits should leave more resources available than a fast-paced message with many cuts.
Examining the four conceptualizations of what STRTs measure outlined by Lang and Basil (1998), we see that a different pattern of STRT results is predicted for this design by each of the conceptualizations. If STRTs measure resources allocated to the message, then STRTs should slow down as the number of cuts and edits increases and there should be no difference between cuts and edits. If STRTs measure resources remaining in the system, there should again be fewer resources remaining for fast paced messages compared to slow, and if cuts require more resources there should be fewer resources remaining for cuts compared to edits. If STRTs measure resources required by the message, then STRTs should decrease as the number of cuts and edits increases with no difference for the type of structural feature. If STRTs measure resources available, then STRTs should speed up as both edits and cuts increase at a fast pace, and there should be a difference between cuts and edits.
The current study was designed to empirically test this prediction. The design is a 3 (slow, medium, fast pacing) X 2 (edits, cuts) completely within design. STRT, recognition, cued recall, arousal, and attention will be dependent variables.
SAM (Self Assessment Mannequin) and skin conductance (SC) will be used to measure arousal. Heart rate will be gathered to measure attention. To measure recognition we will use four alternated multiple-choice tests, and storage will be measured using cued recall.
Resources will be measured using STRTs. Subjects will watch the tapes (primary task) containing related edits and unrelated cuts. When they hear an audio tone they should push a button (secondary task).

The Guerilla Girls, anonymous feminist art activists, have worked to change the perception held by detractors that feminists do not have a sense of humor. Through the use of parody, the Guerilla Girls have created a movie poster that directs attention to how the institution of Hollywood patronizes and demeans women by exploiting their physical looks and diminishing their accomplishments.
In the paper, I analyze the Guerilla Girls satirical Hollywood movie poster using ideological criticism (Foss, 1996). This method of rhetorical criticism focuses on beliefs and values that are manifest in the artifact. Parody is effectively used in this artifact to make fun of the stereotypes that the movie industry perpetuates. The machinery of perspective by incongruity and the comic frame engenders a form of social criticism that seeks to correct the inadequacies of the present social order through demystification rather than revolution (Burke, 1964). bell hooks writes that ""the work of the Guerilla Girls represents a most powerful political union between theory and practice. They set an example for feminists everywhere"" (Guerilla Girls, 1999)."

However, theories mapping the underlying psychological processes and effects of entertainment-education programs are borrowed and adapted from traditional persuasion theories and models of health belief changes. While a general trans-theory of E-E effects may be useful in practice, no new theory of communication has been advanced, and questions about the uses of suspense, drama and humor, and receivers reactions of sympathy, empathy and modeling, go unanswered. We propose integrating persuasion and behavior change theories with theories on mass media effects, specifically suspense, to propose a new model of E-E processes and outcomes. The advantages of the proposed model, over current practices in E-E theorizing, include more emphasis on heuristic processing and cultivation effects, a more active role of receivers in accepting or rejecting emotional portrayals, and a separation of outcomes that are limited to mere attitude change effects, versus changes in both attitudes and behaviors. How E-E programs bridge cultural borderlands, or are written to adapt to different cultural values, is also addressed"

A study model derived from the conceptual model was tested with a sample of 192 OSSCs and curvilinear regression. Two community level factors were found leveraging the adoption of OSSC: network size and the participation of the major contributor. Two network size measures out of three showed curvilinear relationships with two adoption measures out of six each. Both measures of the participation of the major contributor showed curvilinear relationships with three or four adoption measures out of six.

Technological capability has also become a criterion in evaluating the capability of nonprofit organizations. By addressing the dearth in studying small nonprofits or nonprofits in rural areas, this study examines whether or not smaller nonprofit organizations in rural Ohio can effectively use the Web under disadvantageous circumstances.
By examining 430 small and medium-sized nonprofit organizations in Appalachian Ohio, this study found that there was a huge gap in the adoption of the Web among these nonprofit organizations. The results of the content analysis of the Web found that most nonprofit organizations did not use the Web strategically. In-depth interviews with these nonprofits also revealed that intertwined multiple gaps made this organizational digital divide more complicated and unresolved."

A study was undertaken to investigate the effects of cultural values (collectivism), perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE), environmental attitudes on four types of proenvironmental behaviors: green-buying, energy-saving, recycling, and political behaviors. Structural equation modeling systematically tested and refined models representing interrelationships among the relevant variables. The results suggest that collectivistic value orientations have a direct effect on beliefs about self-efficacy in solving problems (PCE), which in turn influence environmental attitudes. However, the effects of PCE and attitudes on behaviors appeared to vary with the type of proenvironmental behaviors. That is, PCE exerts a direct effect on energy-saving and recycling behaviors and environmental attitudes have a direct effect on all behavioral measures except for recycling behaviors. Overall, the results indicate the importance of the relevant variables in predicting consumer proenvironmental behaviors. Although the value orientation was not found to have a direct effect on behaviors, it exerted indirect influences through PCE that subsequently influences environmental attitudes and behaviors. Implications for public policy and marketing communication efforts and directions for future research are provided."

The results suggest that the situated importance of goals to not offend the hearer and maintain a positive relationship are often positively related to the perceived likelihood that messages would conflict with the same goals. The chronic importance of secondary goals increased the perceived likelihood that messages would conflict with the goals only in some situations. Priming the goals had minimal effects.

A content analysis methodology was used to observe and analyze feature films produced in the U.S and/or U.K from 1930-2000 where India and/or Indians feature in the storyline. The study identified, described and analyzed portrayals at three levels  movie, scene and character. The findings suggest that there are significant differences in the portrayals of India and the West with respect to climate, scene locale, poverty, calamities, pollution, religious practices, death rituals, modes of transportation, attire, arts and leisure, and, treasures. Indian and non-Indian characters differed significantly with respect to occupation, place of residence, economic class, language, role, health, and religion. Overall, four stereotypical formulae emerge  India as a land of the wild, of misery, of mystery and of luxury. The role of media in dispelling misconceptions and breaking uni-dimensional stereotypes about other cultures are discussed."
2003-0060,Applying CMC Theoreis to Assess Virtual Community,Paper,Applying CMC Theoreis to Assess Virtual Community,"For the past years, there have been a growing number of online communities and more and more people are getting involved in one or more online communities. Among many research and studies on online community, however, there is few examining online community with theoretical frameworks and many are descriptive. As online community is ubiquitous and becoming reality rather than remaining as hype, new concepts and understanding of this new social formation is imperative. The purpose of this paper is to provide such concepts and understanding by exploring central concepts of community and social aspects of CMC. Fundamental elements of online community are assessed to see whether it contains the elements of community and how CMC affect those elements."
2003-0061,Are borders only georgaphic? A case study of whether framing of womens rights as human rights is successful at the domestic level,Paper,Are borders only georgaphic? A case study of whether framing of womens rights as human rights is successful at the domestic level,"This paper examines framing as an essential strategy used by womens rights NGOs at international and domestic levels. After exploring the strategies to facilitate the implementation of the Platform for Action, which were presented in detail at the Beijing+5 session of the United Nations, the author demonstrates why the frame of womens rights as human rights, which is actively used on the international arena, can be problematic at the domestic level.
Using a theoretical analysis of transnational advocacy networks by Keck and Sikkink (1998), this paper examines why frames, which are essential political strategies of womens rights NGOs, should have alternatives to the existent womens rights as human rights frame. The author argues that at the domestic level the issue of womens rights need to be presented in greater detail rather than the existing human rights frame allows it to be and thus should be reframed."
2003-0062,Argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness: Type of argument as a situational constraint,Paper,Argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness: Type of argument as a situational constraint,"Arguments in interpersonal relationships can be divided into two types: public issue arguments and personal issue arguments. Arguing over topics such as politics, a public issue argument, can be very different than arguing over topics such as cleaning the house, a personal issue argument. This study examines argument type as a situational constraint on argumentative and verbally aggressive behavior. Both men and women reported higher amounts of argumentative behavior in the public issue argument. Women reported higher amounts of verbally aggressive behavior in the personal issue argument, but men did not report significantly different levels of verbally aggressive behavior in either type of argument. Implications for the study of argumentativeness and verbal aggressiveness in personal relationships are discussed."
2003-0063,A Roller Coaster Ride in Panic City: One Group of Women's Experience of the Chronic Threat of Job Loss.,Paper,A Roller Coaster Ride in Panic City: One Group of Women's Experience of the Chronic Threat of Job Loss.,"Utilizing feminist standpoint theory this study explores how one group of women experienced the chronic threat of job loss. An interpretive case study method along with a thematic content analysis was utilized to explore the research question ""how do one group of women experience the chronic threat of job loss?"" Twelve women who worked for the same organization for over twenty-five years were interviewed about their experiences with the chronic threat of job loss. The women in this group were under constant threat of office closings and layoffs due to mergers, contract negotiations and strikes. Consequences the women suffered were emotional strain, isolation, fear and anger along with the chronic threat that material goods (a company pension) would be lost. The unique aspect of this study is that both the threat of job loss and its consequences were chronic in nature and the consequences are prevalent in the discursive practices shared by the women in this study."
2003-0064,A Social Cognitive Explanation of Internet Uses and Gratifications: Toward a New Theory of Media Attendance,Paper,A Social Cognitive Explanation of Internet Uses and Gratifications: Toward a New Theory of Media Attendance,"While most of the prior research explaining Internet usage has followed the conventional uses and gratifications paradigm, some extensions and challenges to that prevailing theory of media attendance have emerged. These include the discovery of new gratifications overlooked in the annals of mass communication research and the introduction of powerful new explanatory variables. However, much of the extant research has focused on college students populations, while the Internet has penetrated deeply into the general population. The present study extends previous research to more diverse populations and evaluates new explanatory variables within the framework of Banduras (1986) Social Cognitive Theory. Respondents from two Midwestern states were contacted by mail to complete an on-line questionnaire. Among conventional Uses and Gratifications variables, expectations about participating in enjoyable activities online and expected social outcomes explained 23 percent of the variance in Internet usage. Habit strength, deficient self-regulation and Internet self efficacy combined in a stepwise multiple regression model that explained 40 percent of the variance in usage, in a model in which conventional Uses and Gratifications variables were not significant predictors. A new model of media attendance was proposed in which active consideration of uses and gratifications give way to habitual behavior and deficient self-regulation."
2003-0065,Assessing Media Exemplars and Shifting Journalistic Paradigms: A Survey Study of Chinas Journalists,Paper,Assessing Media Exemplars and Shifting Journalistic Paradigms: A Survey Study of Chinas Journalists,"By analyzing data from surveys of journalists and journalism students in China, this paper shows that Chinas media reforms coupled with media globalization have made possible for the paradigm of professional journalism to emerge as a direct competitor to the Party-journalism paradigm. While the former gets manifested in journalists positive appraisal of the elite western media outlets, the latter is related to praising the official Party organs. Further, the paradigm of professional journalism is related to an emphasis on the disseminator role of the media and the desire for more liberal arts training in journalism, the Party-journalism paradigm is related to an emphasis on the interpretive and popular advocacy roles as well as the desire for more training in Party propaganda and the official journalistic theories. The distinction between the two paradigms has significant implications to how Chinas journalists evaluate different innovative media outlets that have emerged during the reforms. In addition, more positive appraisals of exemplars of the professional journalism are related to higher levels of education, more frequent exposure to foreign media, fewer years working under the Party-media system, and holding no administrative positions in media organizations. Theoretical significance of these findings in relation to the concepts such as journalistic paradigm, journalist professionalism, and globalization is discussed."

In addition to completing the GENE, participants completed several instruments chosen to test the GENEs predictive, concurrent, and construct validity. The results indicate that the GENE is a reliable and valid index of generalized ethnocentrism and is recommended for use in future intercultural communication research."
2003-0067,A Structural Equation Model of Support for English-only Policies and Social Limitation of Immigrants and Minorities,Paper,A Structural Equation Model of Support for English-only Policies and Social Limitation of Immigrants and Minorities,"The growth in language minorities in the U.S. is matched by an increase in language policies encapsulated by the English-only movement and support for policies controlling immigration and health/welfare services to immigrants. A reanalysis of data obtained from a telephone survey in Santa Barbara, California (n = 389), investigated if support for English-only policies among Anglo-Americans is related to perceptions about a decreasing gap between Anglo-American group vitality and that of Latino group vitality (i.e., relative vitality). The influence of Spanish mass media and level of language group identity is also assessed. A structural equation model summarizing the relationships between these factors is proposed. The final SEM indicates that English-only policies are one form of social limitation. Support for English-only policies is positively related to level of language group identity and negatively related to Spanish mass media. Support for social limitation among Anglo-Americans is negatively related to relative vitality."
2003-0068,A Study of Agenda-Setting Theory in Presidential Debates in Mexicos 2000 Presidential Campaign,Paper,A Study of Agenda-Setting Theory in Presidential Debates in Mexicos 2000 Presidential Campaign,"The 2000 Presidential election in Mexico, won by opposition candidate Vicente Fox, ended 71 years of rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Content analysis of television coverage of presidential debates during the Mexican election in 2000 showed that first-level and second-level agenda setting theory explains the role that the media played during that contest. Coverage of the two presidential debates was illustrative of how effective the media were in setting the agenda for discussion on issues and candidate attributes during the campaign. Videotapes of television newscats were content analyzed, as were the television debates themselves. The study replicated findings of prior studies of the agenda-setting function: the media (television news) agenda prior to the debates was highly correlated with the content of the debates themselves.Data from a panel study conducted at the time of the campaign showed a high correspondence between media content and public perceptions of issues and candidate traits. This correspondence was more evident when analyzing candidate image. Overall media coverage was centered on candidate image rather than issues; consequently, the public perceptions of candidates were also centered on image attributes rather than campaign issues."
2003-0069,A Study of New Communication Technologies and Civic Engagement : A Time to Reconceptualize the Research Constructs?,Paper,A Study of New Communication Technologies and Civic Engagement : A Time to Reconceptualize the Research Constructs?,"The paper reviews current literature on the impact of communication media on civic engagement. Studies examining the impact of television, telephone and the Internet are examined and critiqued. Special emphasis is placed on inadequacies of the Internet (or the Web) as a research construct in social sciences, and new five-factor model of communication media is proposed. According to the model, there are five basic dimensions to any communication technology: interactivity, directionality, mode, latency and capacity. The paper also proposes a reconceptualization of the social capital construct and introduces a network model of social capital for the information era. The models are then discussed in relation to a new communication policy initiative by the Aspen Institute that uses technical layers of a communication system as bases for regulatory action in the age of media convergence and transition to an IP environment."
2003-0070,"Asylum Politics, the Internet and the Public Sphere: UK Refugee Support Groups Online",Paper,"Asylum Politics, the Internet and the Public Sphere: UK Refugee Support Groups Online","This paper aspires to provide an empirically informed exploration of the Nets use for political purposes. The substantive focus is on the political debate on immigration and asylum in the United Kingdom, and the empirical analysis is concerned with activist organisations supporting immigrants and asylum seekers. By way of looking at the websites of 45 NGOs concerned with asylum and immigration in the UK, the paper asks the following questions: Whom do these websites address? What type of information do they provide? Through focusing on the issues of addressees, and communicative forms, the paper attempts to draw some tentative conclusions regarding some of the political uses to which the Internet is put. The findings indicate that, digital divide arguments notwithstanding, the internet is proving to be an important resource for activist organisations in enabling them to accomplish several things at the same time: they provide practical and legal information to potential immigrants and asylum seekers, they attempt to influence the political and legal framework through addressing both government and citizenry, and they invite citizens to understand the issues involved in asylum and to actively engage in helping refugees. The instrumentality involved in this usage, however, is problematic from the point of view of normative models of the public sphere, which focus on dialogue and deliberation. In conclusion, it is argued that incorporating the Internet as part of the public sphere may entail an expansion of the latter to include instrumental communication"
2003-0071,Attributions and Outcomes: Hurtful Communication in Families,Paper,Attributions and Outcomes: Hurtful Communication in Families,"If people are typically hurt by the ones they love, then families provide a unique and relatively unexamined context for hurtful communication. From a communication perspective, a critical concern is how people respond when they are hurt. One factor that may impact how people react is their level of relational satisfaction. Additionally, the perceived intent underlying hurt-evoking comments can shape recipients communicative responses. This study investigated whether senders and receivers perceive hurtful communication differently with regard to intentionality and relational satisfaction, and how attributions of intentionality and perceptions of relational satisfaction affect recipients communicative responses to those messages. Although no differences between senders and receivers were revealed for perceived intentionality or relational satisfaction, these factors did impact how people responded to hurtful communication in their families. When comments were perceived as intentionally hurtful, people had a tendency to respond to negative communication with more negative communication. In contrast, hurt-evoking comments that were viewed as unintentional were met with productive/integrative communication. Likewise, relational satisfaction influenced communicative responses, such that dissatisfied individuals responded with negative communication; whereas satisfied individuals were more likely to calmly discuss their feelings. The findings of the current project shed light on how families interpret and grapple with hurtful communication."
2003-0072,A Typology of Framing Research: It needs to be tangible,Paper,A Typology of Framing Research: It needs to be tangible,"Ambiguousness and out of mesh in terminology and conceptualization of framing have been pointed out for research on framing. This is due, in part, to the failure to distinguish several specific domains from the framing research, with scattered image being cultivated. In this paper, I suggest a typology of framing research in political communication, elicited on the basis of theoretical implications differing across each category to give a consistent and systematic impression on the research falling into each cell. Two dimensions were deductively devised: focal method by which framing occur (selection vs. variation) and the goal of framing (exploiting a preexisting knowledge structure vs. establishing a frame-relevant knowledge structure). I classified previous research into each category and suggested several points on the basis of this typology."
2003-0073,Audience Perception of Framed Music during Times of War,Paper,Audience Perception of Framed Music during Times of War,"This study investigates the way in which the American audience perceives music during times of war. Specifically, the American popular music preference from the time periods surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack on the World Trade Center were compared. Following the attacks, there was not a clear preference of framed Patriotic-themed music, but there was an increase in the number of songs framed with Security and Comfort themes."
2003-0074,Audience Perceptions of Background Nonverbal Behaviors Displayed by Candidates in Televised Political Debates,Paper,Audience Perceptions of Background Nonverbal Behaviors Displayed by Candidates in Televised Political Debates,"Compared to televised debates using a single-screen format, those using a split screen presenting both debaters simultaneously show viewers the nonverbal reactions of a debaters opponent. This study examined how appropriate and respectful such nonverbal behaviors are perceived to be. Students watched one of four versions of a televised debate. One version used a single-screen format, showing only the speaker, while the other three versions used a split-screen format in which the speakers opponent displayed constant, occasional, or no nonverbal disagreement with the speaker. Students then rated the debaters respectfulness and appropriateness. Analysis indicated that the opponent was perceived to be less respectful and less appropriate when he displayed any background disagreement compared to when he did not. The speaker was perceived as most respectful and appropriate when his opponent displayed constant nonverbal disagreement. These results and their implications are discussed."

This paper compares the three types of auditory interfaces in personal computing environments: verbal messages (speech sounds), earcons (musical sounds) and auditory icons (natural sounds). Relying on Peirce¡¯s theory of signs, especially the trichotomies of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, we conceptualized verbal messages as a ¡°dicent symbol legisign,¡± earcons as a ¡°dicent indexical legisign,¡± and auditory icons as a ¡°remantic iconic sinsign.¡± As signs, auditory interfaces require certain amounts of mental efforts to be produced and consumed. Relying on the theories of sign production, I argue that the three auditory interfaces would require different levels of mental efforts for interpretation: verbal messages are easiest to interpret, followed by earcons and auditory icons. The implication is that verbal messages would offer the highest usability among the three auditory interfaces."
2003-0076,Augustines Cup: Boundary Conditions and Relocating Science in a Post-postmodern World,Paper,Augustines Cup: Boundary Conditions and Relocating Science in a Post-postmodern World,"Postmodernists and critical scholars, in critiquing empirical and quantitative social scientists, often confuse the empirical scientific enterprise with positivism. Positivism is a philosophic system that excludes metaphysical and other non-empirical concerns. Use of empirical or quantitative methods is not the same as the embrace of such a system. Alternative perspectives, notably pragmatism, are discussed, and a perspective that emphasizes recognition of the boundary conditions of any epistemology is urged."
2003-0077,Authoritative Parenting and Drug-Prevention Practices: Implications for Anti-Drug Ads for Parents,Paper,Authoritative Parenting and Drug-Prevention Practices: Implications for Anti-Drug Ads for Parents,"This research employed the theory of reasoned action to investigate the role of authoritative parenting in three drug-prevention behaviors: (a) parental monitoring, (b) parent-child discussions, and (c) awareness of the childs environment. A phone survey of 158 parents of adolescents in 7th, 9th, and 11th grade revealed that high authoritative parents were significantly more likely than low authoritative parents to discuss family rules, discuss strategies to help their children avoid drugs, and engage in parental monitoring. Additionally, authoritative parenting moderated the attitude-behavioral intention relationship for parental monitoring and awareness of the childs environment, with the weakest relationship detected for low authoritative parents. These findings were discussed in terms of their utility in helping design and target anti-drug messages for parents more effectively."
2003-0078,Avow or Avoid?: The Public Communication Strategies of Enron and WorldCom,Paper,Avow or Avoid?: The Public Communication Strategies of Enron and WorldCom,"Sixteen press releases from Enron and 16 releases from WorldCom representing the first three months of each organizations financial crises were gathered from the organizations web sites. The goal of this study was to determine whether the dominant public communication tactic of these companies was to avow or promote frankness, a traditional public relations stance, or to avoid or be evasive, a traditional legal stance. The releases were compared to 47 published accounts of the unfolding financial crises to determine whether the organizational messages remained intact. The findings show no dominant communication strategy in either company. Both professed openness but engaged in blame shifting. The combined message strategy suggests cooperation between legal and public relations counsel. The messages of both organizations were successfully transmitted via the mass media but were tempered by solid reporting. These findings suggest additional evidence that legal and public relations crisis communication strategies are starting to blur."
2003-0079,A Web of Alliances in the Global Telecommunication Industry,Paper,A Web of Alliances in the Global Telecommunication Industry,"This paper describes the contour of the global networks in terms of interorganizational alliances in the telecommunication industry. It focuses on how an individual telecommunication firm is linked with others. The results of the centrality analysis revealed that most of the US and UK telecommunication companies were the most central actors, controlling the volume of networking in the interorganizational network. A cluster analysis also showed that the interorganizational alliance was partly clustered based on both geographical region and types of industries.geographical factors. With regard to the formation of blocks in the network, the results of blockmodelling showed that interorganizational structure of the global telecommunication network was divided into several linkage blocks based on relational similarity among telecommunication firms."
2003-0080,A Working Theory of Cross-National Conflict Shifting as an International Public Relations Dynamic,Paper,A Working Theory of Cross-National Conflict Shifting as an International Public Relations Dynamic,"This paper expands and further illustrates the working theory of cross-national conflict shifting as it relates to international public relations management. The concept was first introduced in the U.S. academic community by Molleda and Connolly-Ahern at the 2002 AEJMC convention. The authors drew this theoretical concept from German scholars Welge and Holtbrügge (1998, 2001) and Berg and Holtbrügge (2001). The development of this international public relations working theory is achieved by summarizing six cases involving issues that have affected more than one country and several parties, such as transnational businesses, NGOs, host governments, and global and national media outlets. Cross-national conflict shifting includes host, home and transnational publics, which indicates the complexity and magnitude of the interactions among the players. Ten propositions are introduced to build the theoretical foundation for future qualitative and quantitative studies. The working theory shows the complexity of managing issues conflicts as they acquire transnational status."
2003-0081,"Backwards Up Niagara Falls: Space/Time, Image/Text and the Biases of Information",Paper,"Backwards Up Niagara Falls: Space/Time, Image/Text and the Biases of Information","In recent years McLuhans writings have enjoyed a renaissance in connection with the digital age. Yet the work of his mentor, Innis, has largely been ignored, despite the striking relevance of Innis central conceptual tool  the spatial and temporal biases of communications media  to many of the most hotly debated topics in media and cultural studies: the impact of new technologies, globalization and localization, the mediation of historical memory, the distribution of power and knowledge, the social construction of space and time. This paper reassesses Innis significance for theorizing contemporary communications and culture, first by attempting to delineate his space-time dialectic more thoroughly, second by situating it in relation to another central space-time dialectic - the image/text distinction, and finally by relating it to a broad hypothesis about contemporary cultural and social trends in the information society."
2003-0082,Bad Words and Good Samaritans: Defamatory Speech in Cyberspace,Paper,Bad Words and Good Samaritans: Defamatory Speech in Cyberspace,"This paper considers whether Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are legally responsible for defamatory speech posted by third parties. Toward that end, the paper begins by identifying two competing modelsISPs as distributors and ISPs as publishersdeveloped by the courts in Cubby v. CompuServe (1991) and Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy (1995). The second section of the paper revisits this controversy in light of the United States Court of Appeals decision in Zeran v. America Online (1997), a case involving Section 230the so-called ""Good Samaritan"" clauseof the ill-fated Communications Decency Act. The final section of this paper briefly summarizes the growing scholarly criticism of Section 230 and the Zeran decision. In the final pages, the paper directly responds to this criticism, arguing that Section 230 was intended to immunize ISPs, and that Zeran was correctly decided."
2003-0083,Balance in Campaign Coverage,Paper,Balance in Campaign Coverage,"To examine the underlying contexts of the 2000 Bush-Gore campaign coverage, 113 political reporters were surveyed and six reporters were interviewed. Survey respondents perceived campaign coverage as more favorable for Bush, which was predicted by their perception of the coverage of candidates personalities. In-depth interviews revealed that reporters perception of what candidates deserved affected coverage of personality. However, their perception was sometimes inconsistent, based on inadequate or questionable information, or not grounded in solid reasoning. Although it does not always mean a lack of balance when a certain candidate received more favorable coverage, the media did not practice the norm of balanced coverage soundly in the Bush-Gore campaign."
2003-0084,"Balancing tradition and modernity in narratives surrounding contraception use among poorer women in West Bengal, India.",Paper,"Balancing tradition and modernity in narratives surrounding contraception use among poorer women in West Bengal, India.","This paper investigates how poorer women in West Bengal, India balance the ideas of modernization and tradition in their choices to use birth control. Ideologically, Indian women have traditionally been placed within the context of the home and valued principally as wives and mothers. Children, therefore, are tremendously important for women within this framework.
In contrast, the ideology of the relatively well structured and very large family planning program asks especially poorer women to have fewer children for the good of the family and the nation.
How do poorer, predominantly illiterate women balance these two oppositional ideas in an area that is of such importance in their lives? Qualitative feminist interviewing conducted in government family planning clinics is used to investigate how these women negotiate fertility control decisions with themselves and others, and how they place these decisions in the chronological borderlands between tradition and modernity in a changing world."
2003-0085,Basic Human Motives for Gathering Information Online,Paper,Basic Human Motives for Gathering Information Online,"This paper discusses basic human motives for gathering information online. With a critical review of the uses and gratifications approach, this paper concludes that this approach does not adequately address the basic underlying motivations for information gathering on the Internet. The uses and gratifications approach appears to fail to address both the distinctive features of the Internet and the theoretical grounds. While this approach might be useful in explaining adoption of the Internet as a functional alternative, it is not useful in investigating underlying motives for gathering information within the medium. Based upon a thorough review of a wide range of literature on motivations for information seeking, this paper suggests two basic human motives for gathering information: accuracy and preservation. These goals should be understood as the driving force for the flow of information selection on the Web."
2003-0086,'Be a teacher after death': The message strategies of the body donation campaign in Taiwan,Paper,'Be a teacher after death': The message strategies of the body donation campaign in Taiwan,"This study examines the message strategies employed in the body donation campaign in Taiwan. Despite several possible resistant forces pervasive in the Taiwanese society, the campaign was effective in modifying existing/traditional value system, instilling confidence and motivation within individuals and presenting a humanistic picture of human body dissection. Through the use of various frames, the campaign message successfully reinterpreted or redefined the key concepts related to body donation, which made them more acceptable to the recipients. Implications of the persuasive approaches employed in the body donation campaign to health communication were also discussed."
2003-0087,Beautiful and Bad Women: Media Feminism and The Politics of Its Construction in Taiwan,Paper,Beautiful and Bad Women: Media Feminism and The Politics of Its Construction in Taiwan,"This paper uses the image of the new ¡§feminist¡¨¡Xthe beautiful-and-bad woman¡Xto explore how feminism gets defined in popular media in Taiwan and the power relationships involved in this construction of this particular version of feminism, hence, feminist identity. My argument is, the history of popular feminism in Taiwan adheres to two contradictory stories¡Xbeautiful-and-bad, difference and sameness. These two seemingly contradictory rhetorical strategies coexist in order to construct a global female subject for capital production and consumption. In constructing this new feminist subject, Western second¡Vwave feminism is assigned to the past, while American postfeminism is designated as ¡§our¡¨ feminism. This process of translation of Western feminism makes clear the ideology of heterosexuality and consumerism that structure the inclusion and exclusion of heterogeneous feminist events. This selective appropriation of Western feminism has to be explained within the context of media production, Taiwanese women¡¦s movements, and mostly, neocolonialism."
2003-0088,(Be)Longing Media: Minority Radio between Cultural Retention and Renewal,Paper,(Be)Longing Media: Minority Radio between Cultural Retention and Renewal,"Diasporic media (media produced for and by diasporic groups) have often been viewed as simply a means through which information of interest can be exchanged, or a means for preserving moribund cultures. By reducing these media to a communitarian logic of bonding, we are failing to understand their instrumental role in helping redefine and challenge the identity and boundaries of a diasporic community. Diasporas are by definition re-imagined communities, constructed around multiple narratives and discourses. Their survival depends to a large extent on their ability to provide a space for conflicting claims of belonging and their willingness to reconcile those differences.
In my research, I focus on radio MultiKulti, a public station targeting Germans and all ethnic minorities in Berlin, and Beur FM, a private station targeting only North Africans both in Paris and a few major French cities. Radio MultiKulti was first created as a public-service reaction following a mounting wave of xenophobia and violent attacks against foreigners in the Branderburg federal state, of which Berlin is the capital. One of its main concerns is to educate the German public and minorities on the benefits of a multicultural society while preserving the cultural identity of foreigners. In contrast with this top-down approach to minority broadcasting, Beur FM, founded and run by North Africans themselves, started as a grassroot reaction to years of marginalization, racism, and misrepresentation in French mainstream media. Its mission is rather particularistic, but one of its goals is to facilitate the integration of its listeners into French society and help them reconcile the cultural contradictions they experience in that society."
2003-0089,Benefits Communication: Does One-Size-Fit-All?,Paper,Benefits Communication: Does One-Size-Fit-All?,"Benefits are used by organizations to recruit the best candidates. As choices of benefits increase, the field of benefits communication has become more complex. Complicating this trend is the lack of professional communication specialists equipped to take advantage of emerging media channels and design communication-based benefits program suitable for employees. Most of the literature regarding benefits communication involves tips and descriptive anecdotes explaining how one organization or another is approaching the challenge. It was the aim of this project to broaden understanding of the benefits communication process. We conducted a comprehensive survey of organizations to describe benefits communication approaches. The survey addressed functional approaches, categories of benefits provided, materials and channel employed, and managerial perception of effectiveness of benefits communication. The results indicated that most organizations tend to use the most convenient but not the most effective benefits communication program."
2003-0090,Between Terror and Trust: Patterns of Parent-Infant Communication in Play,Paper,Between Terror and Trust: Patterns of Parent-Infant Communication in Play,"This talk aims to throw light on the patterns that regulate certain types of parent-infant communication. We focus on playful transactions that involve an element of pretend danger, such as peek-a-boo, cuddle-eating, finger-eating, stationary chase play, pretend attack, and crawling chase play. Using video analysis, we demonstrate the delicate timing involved, the ebb and flow of emotional arousal, and the enactment of mock monsters. Drawing on theoretical work by Piaget (1952, 1954), Bruner & Sherwood (1978), Vygotsky (1978), Fauconnier and Turner (1996), and Steen & Owens (2001) we use a multidimensional perspective to elucidate the psychological dynamics that drive these communicational patterns, suggesting that they constitute a complex form of pedagogy directed towards training emotional self-regulation and terrror management through simulation."
2003-0091,"Beyond Access: Digital divide, Internet Use and Gratifications Gained",Paper,"Beyond Access: Digital divide, Internet Use and Gratifications Gained","This research explores the relationship between Internet use and gratifications gained within the context of digital divide. Analyses within sub-samples defined by age and socio-economic status reveal that there are notable differences across the subcategories. For instance, those that are young and high in socioeconomic status are most likely to use the Internet to strategically satisfy their motivations and gain the desired gratifications. They are most likely to engage in specific Internet behaviors  computer-mediated interaction, surveillance, and consumption uses  to achieve particular gratifications  connection, learning, and acquisition, respectively. In contrast, respondents who were low in socio-economic status and young were particularly likely to employ consumptive use of the Internet to attain connection gratifications. Similarly, both low socioeconomic status subgroups, regardless of age, were likely to use computer-mediated interaction as a means to gain learning gratifications. We concluded that even if gaps in access are closing, gaps in usage and gratifications gained may persist. Further implications for digital divide will be discussed."
2003-0092,Beyond cultural boundary: An empirical study of the third culture theory,Paper,Beyond cultural boundary: An empirical study of the third culture theory,"This study explores the ¡°third culture theory¡± which has not been tested by quantified measures since it was introduced. This study develops the ten-item measurement of third culture based on equality, commonality and transcendence. Two hundred and fifteen international married individuals from 42 countries participated in a self-administered email survey. The hypothesis was tested on the relationships between intercultural stress (culture shock) and the degree of third culture building. The findings indicated that there is a negative relationship between the degree of third culture building and intercultural stress. Suggestions for future study as well as several implications on theory and methodology are discussed drawing on the experience of this study."
2003-0093,Beyond Ratings or Quality. Surpassing the Dilemma of Entertainment in Public Broadcasting,Paper,Beyond Ratings or Quality. Surpassing the Dilemma of Entertainment in Public Broadcasting,"Entertainment is a sensitive issue for European public broadcasting organizations. After all, why does public television concern itself with entertainment to begin with? Should it not be left to the commercial networks? Contrary to common opinion, the author argues that public broadcasters can better fulfill their mission  making quality programs, supplying good information and involving people in a democratic culture  if entertainment is a significant and visible part of public programming.
This article specifically addresses the factors that complicate the full and ready acceptance of entertainment in public television: the rise of commercial television, the meaning of quality, the position of the viewer, the interpretation of public service and the virtual absence of a quality discourse for TV-entertainment. Through a careful repertoire analysis of in-depth interviews with over fifty broadcasting professionals, the article also maps the various available options for turning entertainment into an inspiring and indispensable element of public programming."
2003-0094,Biomedical Literacy in the United States: Exploring the borderland between science and citizenship,Paper,Biomedical Literacy in the United States: Exploring the borderland between science and citizenship,"Using the border metaphor, this paper examines the inherent border tension between the need for specialized levels of understanding about scientific and technical policy issues  such as the continuing biomedical policy debate over stem cell research  and the demands for broad political participation in a democratic political system. Measures of biomedical literacy, attentiveness to biomedical policy, and political contacting about biomedical and health issues are defined, measured, and used to construct two structural equation models. One model examines the factors that produce biomedical literacy and biomedical issue attentiveness among adults, including current communication patterns. A second model identifies the factors that are associated with political contacting on a biomedical policy issue, exploring the border relationships between biomedical literacy and issue attentiveness in producing measurable political behaviors. The ramifications of these findings for future communication research are discussed."

Of the 140 television shows listed on the questionnaire, only 4 were watched regularly by at least 301f all four demographically different adolescent audience segments (Black females, Black males, White females, White males). Black males and females had more shows in common with each other than Whites, with Black males and females sharing more than half (55%) of their regularly watched shows, while White males and females watched only about one fourth (27%) of the same shows. As expected, females watched shows wiht girls as stars, while males focused on sports and adult animated shows (such as King of the Hill). Implications of these results in terms of a segregated or common media culture are discussed."
2003-0096,Bonjour à leuro! An agenda-setting study of attitudes towards the new currency in France,Paper,Bonjour à leuro! An agenda-setting study of attitudes towards the new currency in France,"Euro, the single currency in twelve countries of the European Union, started circulating as notes and coins among some 302 millions people on January 1st, 2002. The introduction of the new currency has diverse implications for the people in each of the 12 countries, both at national and Eurozone levels. Therefore, this change provides an exciting opportunity to test the agenda-setting hypothesis. Data for the study come from the major newspaper in France, the country that initiated the switch to euro, and public opinion polls conducted by Gallup Europe. A total of 298 paragraphs from 72 articles are analyzed to examine second-level agenda-setting effects on substantive and affective attributes of the euro. Findings suggest that affective attributes relating to national implications of the euro are subject to agenda-setting effects, while the ones relating to the entire Eurozone are not. Also, the French media agenda appears to be correlated with the Eurozone public agenda."
2003-0097,Borderland Selves: Rethinking Identity in Contemporary Global/Local Articulations,Paper,Borderland Selves: Rethinking Identity in Contemporary Global/Local Articulations,"This paper explores some theoretical openings that can contribute to a rethinking of identity and the global/local nexus beyond the binary restrictions imposed by pervasive modernist presuppositions in contemporary globalization theory. It attempts to offer alternative paths to the binary logic underpinning much of the present theorizing of global/local relations and identity formation. In this context, I suggest three interrelated logics: relationality and singularity, mutual implication and incommensurability, contingency and embodiment. I argue that it is within the continuous oscillation and mutual specification between the global (the universal) and the local (the particular) where the process of identity formation (individual or collective) becomes intelligible and possible to be reimagined. Identity emerges more as a field of relationality than as an essence; no longer a metaphysical or fixed reality (autonomously created or imposed from the outside) but a dynamic process defined simultaneously by the possibilities and constraints present in the field of relations that constitute, contingently, our sense and practice of being, which, as I argue, is always (and should be more properly understood as) a becoming. From this perspective, I am interested in looking at the interface between the global and the local, the relational space where identity is articulated and mobilized, and also in exploring some implications of this process for thinking in new possibilities of theoretical and political practice."

Basically, this research presumes that not only community has existed and will persist in the future, but also offline community cannot be separated from online community. Assuming this position, this exploratory work seeks to propose a foundation for describing the typology of community, and analyzing the community empirically through a networked community communication model."
2003-0099,Bridging the Border between Communities of Color and Mainstream Newspapers: Journalists Discuss Diversity Programs,Paper,Bridging the Border between Communities of Color and Mainstream Newspapers: Journalists Discuss Diversity Programs,"This paper analyzes newspaper diversity programs from the viewpoint of journalists identified with communities of color. In interviews at four large-circulation newspapers serving communities of color, the authors found a pattern of recurring critical issues facing the journalists in their efforts to diversify the news. These issues included connecting with previously neglected communities, changing newsroom practices (including hiring, promotion, and training), and getting journalists of color in gatekeeper positions. These interviews also revealed that journalists of color (and some female journalists) often described a borderland existence and consciousness. Because they identified with communities of color and with the newspaper, they often had to reconcile differences and mediate the two distinct cultures. One source of frustration for these ""borderland journalists"" was the realization that their newspapers generally still operate under diversity paradigms that measure success in diversity in terms of employment statistics marketing imperatives, rather than redefining news and changing newsroom routines."

We focus our analysis on how the twelve studies the FCC used in its review focus predominantly on economic aspects of the issue. This is troubling because it appears that the notion of the public interest may be relegated to questions regarding market efficiencies in this debate, as well as future policymaking decisions."
2003-0101,Buddhist Public Relations Model for Thai Community Development: Theoretical and Practical Implications,Paper,Buddhist Public Relations Model for Thai Community Development: Theoretical and Practical Implications,"This research study challenges the conventional public relations by examining alternative public relations for Thai community-based organizations. The researcher views the conventional public relations practices in Thailand as simply following Western paradigms, often found unfit in the Thai contexts. The alternative model is reconceptualized within the Buddhism-based buranagarn framework, which embraces the understanding of complexity, plurality, interrelatedness, and interdependence of social reality. In an attempt to examine the interplay of the Buddhism-based buranagarn framework and the Western qualitative perspective, the term relational integration is introduced. Within the relational integration framework, this study integrates the Buddhist way of thinking into the critical public relations theory and research, and coins this new concept as Buddhist public relations.
Through the integrated research method of critical-qualitative ethnography and collaborative action research, the researcher develops the experiential knowledge of public relations as community-building and co-operative learning process for community-based organizations from the particular locales in Bangkok metropolitan and the North-East region of Thailand. It is found that to facilitate the Buddhist public relations for community-based organizations, three major approaches needs to be taken into consideration: 1) Building Buddhist values as moral and spiritual groundwork; 2) Developing dialectic dialogue through community culture and social relationships; and 3) Facilitating community interaction."
2003-0102,Building and Sustaining Intercultural Relationships: Public Perceptions and Practical Benefits of Friendships and Romantic Relationships in Intercultural Contexts,Paper,Building and Sustaining Intercultural Relationships: Public Perceptions and Practical Benefits of Friendships and Romantic Relationships in Intercultural Contexts,"Much of our population views intercultural relationships as negative, however many practical reasons exist for building and sustaining intercultural relations. Intercultural relationships of nearly every type have been recognized as unacceptable, abnormal, and ""mixed up"" throughout long stretches of history in the United States and around the world. It was not until 1967 in the United States that the Supreme Court nullified laws against interracial marriage (Loving v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 1967). Our past conceptions, ideals, and laws have created strong attitudes towards how the majority of people perceive intercultural relationships. Research shows that both men and women hold negative attitudes toward interracial relationships (Mills & Daly, 1995).
Through building and sustaining relationships with others from different cultures and races, we can acquire knowledge about the world, break stereotypes, and acquire new skills (Martin & Nakayama 1999). The diversity that is created by an intercultural relationship allows for increased creativity and improved problem solving (Cox & Blake 1991). Although many advantages of having intercultural relationships have been demonstrated through years of research, many attitudes of anti-interracial relationships continue to exist. This analysis will (1) synthesize research of peoples? perceptions of intercultural relationships, (2) discuss reasons why people perceive intercultural relationships as either negative or positive, (3) and discuss reasons why building and sustaining intercultural relationships have practical and positive benefits. Two main contexts among intercultural relationships are discussed: friendships and romantic relationships. Research in the areas of friendship selection, interracial/intercultural friendship, interracial/intercultural acceptance, interracial/intercultural contact, interracial dating, interracial marriage, and intercultural communication was reviewed. Suggestions for further research are made as well as commentary on the future of intercultural relationships."

In our examination of the most-frequently cited source of political news, television, we find that the worldviews of station owners or state TV directors  the businessmen, partisans and oligarchs who make up todays television elite in the developing world  determine how biased the news will remain as a new democracy consolidates. Their news decisions are based in part on instrumental calculations of how to profit economically or politically in a new macro-environment. But they are also influenced by authoritarian inertia and distinctive philosophies of news production. Thus, we argue, policy debates about state or private sector ownership miss the heart of the matter. For partisan bias to end, newsrooms must be controlled by people dedicated to political pluralism in the news, but those newsrooms can be constructed within either the state or the private sector just as they can both be captured by partisan interests. Although our quantitative analysis and case studies are drawn from Mexico, our conclusions should be relevant for a range of new democracies"

We identified occupational narratives and themes by using Browns (1990) and Owens (1984) criteria. Through the root theme of sisu (Finnish for inner determination), miners constructed meaning in their work, markers for career success, and value in relationships. Their discourse provided alternatives to white-collar conceptualizations and practices of careers and success."
2003-0105,Can You Answer the Question?,Paper,Can You Answer the Question?,"This paper is an ethnographic study of the questioning discourse in Chinese criminal trials. Questioning in Chinese criminal courts takes on culture-specific forms and plays culture-specific functions. Situated in the Chinese cultural context, questioning is used to perform double culture-specific functions: to persuade defendants to confess in court and to educate the public and prevent crimes through its punitive force. The following patterns of questioning were rhetorically used to help the court achieve its persuasive goals: a) repeating key questions b) invalidating excuses or accounts c) asking unanswerable questions d) supplying answers and e) paraphrasing or restating defendants~{!/~} responses. Through evoking and enacting Chinese cultural values and norms, these patterns of questioning gain persuasive power and render questioning in Chinese criminal trials an interlocking process of accusing, invalidating, and shaming defendants with the goal of persuasion. After a brief literature review and a discussion of data collection and analysis methods, the paper describes in detail patterns of questioning in Chinese criminal trials that are used to obtain confession and remorse from defendants. Finally the deterrent function of the questioning discourse in Chinese cultural context is discussed."

Captive audiences are listeners unable to control and shield themselves from abusive communication either because of their location, their social identity, or the aggressive nature of the message. Our analysis discloses that, in defining captivity, judges employ assumptions about the nature of space, the nature of advertising mediums, the availability of market-created opt-out mechanisms, and the ability of the listeners to make claims based on legally acceptable definitions of social identity. Our analysis suggests that the courts of law may have actually contributed to the disproportionate increase in corporate power over individual privacy rights."
2003-0107,"Caribbean Negritos: Ramón Rivero, Blackface, and Black Voice in Puerto Rico",Paper,"Caribbean Negritos: Ramón Rivero, Blackface, and Black Voice in Puerto Rico","This paper focuses on Ramón Rivero (Diplo), the most famous blackface and black voice actor in Puerto Rico. From the 1930s until his death in 1956 Riveros characters embodied Caribbean mediated blackness and became ambivalent symbols of the oppressed sectors of the population. The author argues that Riveros popularity as a blackface and black voice performer operated within three intertwined discursive spaces: the translation of Cubas Bufo theatre negrito catedrático type as a symbol of anti-colonialism and political satire, the actors left-wing nationalist persona and social activism, the re-articulation of la gran familia puertorriqueña as a hegemonic discourse. The author suggests that after Riveros death in 1956 subsequent televisual representations of Caribbean negritos during the 1950s and 1960s became racialized figures which reaffirmed the hegemonic whiteness not only of the Puerto Rican nation, but also of the emerging post 1959 Cuban migrant community in Puerto Rico."

However, few studies have examined how and to what extent CEOs are portrayed in media coverage. This study builds on recent newspaper research on the topic. Content analysis of 577 articles in three leading magazines during the period 1990-2001 is used to analyze trends in salience and valence of CEO coverage and to assess five dimensions of CEO images in coverage.
Findings are similar to those in the newspaper study. Magazine coverage of CEOs rose dramatically during the period, and overall valence of the articles was favorable. Competency, personal, and integrity dimensions of CEO images made important contributions to valence formation. The findings highlight an important strategic role for public relations professionals since CEO images presented in the coverage focus on what CEOs may do or accomplish and how they do ittheir behaviors, ethics, integrity."

The coding scheme was derived from the components of Wittes extended parallel processing model, which posits that a balance of fear-inducing messages and efficacy messages is crucial in positively affecting health attitudes and behaviors. The study revealed that womens magazines tend to include more threatening messages than efficacious messages. The article sample was then split in order to compare coverage in magazines whose target readership is younger women and magazines whose target readership is older women. Findings indicate that magazines targeted toward younger women tend to cover issues related to susceptibility well, but fail to address issues related to self and response-efficacy."

The article examines the role of communication strategies in the change management process, which underpin the organization's attempt to alter its identity. An interlinked conception of communication theory and organizational identity theory is developed to reflect these findings. The aim of the study is twofold: to conceptualize the integrated role of communication strategies in change processes; and to explore the lacuna between the success and failure of the corporate communication strategies in redefining organizational identity. Semi-structured and on-line interviews with senior managers and internal consultants were conducted. The research findings highlight the key components of the change process and the wide gulf between the intention of the change and its realization."

This work in progress focuses on women's use of spirituality to help negotiate these personal borderlands. We wish to explore women's changing spiritual identities during such times of transition. Based on previous research, we contend that the communicative negotiation and management of transitions as reflected in changing understandings of spiritual identity can be seen in a woman's negotiation of social identities in flux as well as the resilience provided by more enduring intrapersonal identities. We believe that we can gain understanding into this phenomenon by observing communicative behaviors associated with it. We plan to conduct group and individual interviews using Sense-Making Methodology protocols, and then use Feminist Standpoint Theory and Sense-Making Methodology to analyze the interview material."
2003-0112,Channel Expansion Theory: An organizational application,Paper,Channel Expansion Theory: An organizational application,"Channels of communication have been treated as having different inherent characteristics. For example, Media Richness Theory attempts to postulate these differences in terms of richness or leanness; a channels richness or leanness is determined by the amount of deliverable cues, feedback, language variety, personal focus and shared understanding that a channel is able to deliver. Channel Expansion theory, however, accounts for experiential factors that directly influence the perceived richness of a particular channel of communication. In the current study, the researchers solicited participation from 159 undergraduates at a small, liberal arts university on the east coast. Participants were asked to complete a survey concerning the primary medium of communication of an organization of which they were currently a member. These data indicate direct evidence to support the claim that the more the experience a group has with a channel the more they perceive it to be rich. Therefore, experiential knowledge can have a positive influence on perceived media richness, causing a necessary revaluation of the media richness theory, and its assumed hierarchy of media."

But the question is not yet answered adequately of whether new media are used as if they are indeed a new medium, or just a new form of information packaging. This study uses a statewide survey data of Ohio residents to look at the web sites people visit mostly frequently for news and information and to explore the relationship of Internet use and traditional media use. Results show that traditional print and broadcasting media web sites are as popular as the general and specialized information web sites. In terms of content, most of the news and information in those web sites duplicates what's already in the traditional newspapers and TV programs. In terms of structure, the web does have its advantages over traditional media. Newspaper users use general information web sites quite a lot to get supplementary information. The study suggests that what's new about new media really depends on how new media are defined."

This essay describes topographical features of the colonist-colonized polarity, foregrounding those that have become pathological, and appear in the bloody conflicts riddling the world today. Transcending dualism, I suggest we will remain caught within the bondage of old premises until their metaphysics are revealeddiscussed are linear, hierarchical, feudal, bureaucratic, modularized thinking. A partial solution lies within those ways of sense-making that appear apart from purposive thinkingdreams, painting, music, dance, writing, etc. These irruptions of communication and communion are playful rather than purposeful.

Although perceptions of both distributive and procedural justice were negatively correlated with student aggression and hostility, hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that only perceptions of procedural justice predicted these two criterion variables at a statistically significant level. The relationships between perceptions of justice and students use of resistance strategies were less consistent. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that perceptions of procedural justice negatively predicted student revenge and deception, while perceptions of distributive justice positively predicted revenge. Perceptions of procedural and distributive justice also interacted to affect student aggression and deception."

A verbal (audio) and visual framing analysis of the first 12 hours of breaking live news broadcast by CNN was conducted. This analysis qualitatively deconstructs and analyzes CNNs verbal and visual breaking news coverage and suggests that CNN created a powerful frame with its coverage that argued to viewers that the events of September 11 comprised an act of war so horrific that immediate military retaliation was not only justified but necessary.

This paradigm accounts for the environment, the organization and ICTs as they evolve and affect each other. Institutional pressures as well as changing access to information, people and technology shape the coevolutionary process. This case study focuses on BrokerHouse (BH), a large financial company, as it evolves with changing access to the Internet and e-mail. The interaction of different institutional pressures affects selection and retention choices for new technologies. The changing access landscape in the environment also pushes BH to adopt its own business by changing revenue models, offering new services, and reconceptualizing the role of its brokers."
2003-0120,Coexistence is in the eye of the beholder: Evaluating intergroup encounters between Jews and Arabs in Israel,Paper,Coexistence is in the eye of the beholder: Evaluating intergroup encounters between Jews and Arabs in Israel,"This article presents a paradigm of process evaluation of intergroup contact interventions and applies it to investigate encounters between Jews and Arabs in Israel. This is done in two steps: (1) classifying intergroup encounters in terms of their goals and underlying ideology. (2) Defining and applying criteria that would enable to evaluate the quality of intergroup interaction in such interventions, focusing on the criterion of symmetry between the Jews and Arabs in active participation in the encounter. The research population includes some 47 programs of encounters between Jews and Arabs conducted in Israel in the years 1999/?2000.The analyzed data includes interviews with program staff and participants, documents related to the encounters and of observations of encounter meetings and ratings of the interactions within them. The classification of encounter programs in terms of their ideology identified two major approaches - those that emphasize coexistence and similarities between the sides and those that emphasize aspects of conflict, confrontation and asymmetry in power. Also a third category of 'mixed' models was identified that includes aspects of both the above approaches. The evaluation findings show that most programs studied here were symmetrical in terms of active participation of their participants in the encounter interaction, with no notable difference between the different ideological approaches. However, more than half of the encounters there was dominance of Jewish facilitators in leading the encounters. This dominance was less pronounced in encounters including confrontational elements then in non confrontational-coexistence ones."

Fifty-seven couples were asked in an experiment to handle a conflict either FtF or via CMC, and were either told their partner had no choice, or their partner explicitly chose this communication medium. Participants thoughts and attributions were analyzed for several aspects: target of the thought, valence of the thought, and types of attributions made. Overall, these data suggest that males prefer of CMC versus FtF conflict resolution. In particular, men will make more positive relational attributions, more positive partner attributions when their partners use CMC, and more negative internal attributions when FtF was utilized. Females do not prefer handling conflict FtF as well, given the extent of their internal negative partner related attributions. Females also had more positive thoughts when they perceived their partner chose to use CMC."
2003-0122,Cognitive and Emotional Correlates of Social Comparison and Cognitive Dissonance During Exposure to TV Ads,Paper,Cognitive and Emotional Correlates of Social Comparison and Cognitive Dissonance During Exposure to TV Ads,"One often quoted criticism of advertising concerns the perceived effects of portrayals of super thin women on body satisfaction among young women (Posavac, Posavac & Weigel, 2001). The impact of advertising models on women's body satisfaction leads to greater concern due to the link between body satisfaction, self-esteem and eating disorders (Cash, 1990; Irving, 1990). Indeed, researchers have linked viewing super thin models in appearance related advertisements to increased dissatisfaction with one's own body (Harrison & Cantor, 1997; Heinberg & Thompson, 1995; Myers & Biocca, 1992). Researchers believe that processes of social comparison and cognitive dissonance are behind the effects of super thin advertising models on body satisfaction (Martin & Kennedy, 1993; Richins, 1991). The idea is that during exposure, women compare themselves to models in the advertisement and when they do not measure up, experience cognitive dissonance, which results in lower satisfaction with their own body. The purpose of this study is to probe deeper into the processes of social comparison and cognitive dissonance by exploring the cognitive and emotional processes engaged in young women during exposure to appearance related television advertisements. More specifically, this study seeks to isolate cognitive and emotional correlates of social comparison and cognitive dissonance.
Social comparison evoked by a television advertisement involves processing information presented in the message and activating information stored in long-term memory concerning self-appearance (Hargreaves & Tiggemann, 2002). During exposure to television advertisements attention or cognitive resources are allocated externally to the message to encode it into short-term memory (Lang, 2000). When the message encourages viewers to engage in social comparison an increase in cognitive resources allocated internally to activating information stored in long-term memory should be needed. Previous research has tried to document the occurrence of social comparison through thought listing techniques after exposure to advertisements (Hargreaves & Tiggemann, 2002). However, an increase in allocating cognitive resources internally retrieval of long-term memory could be a cognitive correlate of social comparison and can be measured during exposure to advertisements. According to Lang (1995), heart rate speeds up during an increase in cognitive resources to internal mental activities. Social comparison should occur during appearance related advertisements featuring super-thin models but not during non-appearance related advertisements. This leads to the following hypothesis:
H1: Heart rate will be faster during exposure to appearance related television advertisements compared to non-appearance related advertisements.
Cognitive dissonance has been defined as a negative emotional state resulting from not measuring up to an ideal standard (Richins, 1991). Researchers have yet to document the emotional state associated with cognitive dissonance experienced during exposure to television advertisements featuring super thin models. However, by definition, cognitive dissonance should be correlated with an increase in negative emotional valence and arousal. Previous research has demonstrated that skin conductance and facial EMG, specifically Corrugator muscle activity, can be used to index arousal and negative emotional valence (Dawson, Schell & Filion, 1990; Eckman, 1993). Women who have lower state body satisfaction should experience greater cognitive dissonance than women with higher body satisfaction. Thus,
H2: Skin conductance and Corrugator muscle activity will be greater during exposure to appearance related television advertisements for women with lower body satisfaction compared to women with higher body satisfaction.
Methodology
Independent Variables
Social comparison is conceptually defined as the act of comparing one's self to a desirable target. Social comparison will be manipulated by presenting participants with appearance and non-appearance related television advertisements. Appearance related advertisements feature appearance related products and have desirable female models in them that represent society's thin ideal. These ads will emphasize the appearance of the model as being desirable. Non-appearance related advertisements will be for products that are not related to physical appearance and will not feature super-thin female models.
Cognitive dissonance is conceptualized as a state that results from failing to measure up to an ideal standard. Cognitive dissonance will be manipulated by comparing women who have low state body satisfaction to women who have high state body satisfaction.
Dependent Variables
Attention is conceptually defined as cognitive resources that are invested in information processing. Attention will be measured by obtaining participants' heart rate. Heart rate will be measured for a five-second baseline prior to exposure to each advertisement and time-locked to exposure to the advertisements.
Arousal is conceptually defined as a dimension of emotion that reflects how calm or excited a person feels. Arousal will be measured based on levels of skin conductance. Skin conductance will be measured for a five-second baseline prior to exposure to each advertisement and time-locked to exposure to the advertisements.
Emotional valence is conceptually defined as a dimension of emotion related to how positive or negative a person feels. Emotional valence will be measured by facial EMG. Specifically, this study is interested in the experience of negative emotional valence so Corrugator muscle activity will be measured. Corrugator activity will also be measured for a five-second baseline prior to exposure to each advertisement and time-locked to exposure to the advertisements.
Design
The design of this experiment is a 2 (Social Comparison) X 2 (Cognitive Dissonance) X 3 (Order) mixed model. Social comparison is a within subjects variable. All participants will see the appearance-related (social comparison) and non-appearance related (no social comparison) advertisements. Cognitive dissonance is a between subjects variable having to do with whether participants have high or low state body satisfaction. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three stimulus tape orders.
Stimuli
Stimulus messages will be three appearance related and three non-appearance related 60-second television advertisements taped off-air. Taping will be done during programs for which college women are in the target demographic. Stimulus messages will be pre-tested to assure they result in equivalent levels of message involvement during exposure. Stimulus messages will be edited into three random orders.
Participants and Procedure
Prior to the experiment a survey measuring body satisfaction will be administered to 200 college women enrolled in communication courses. Forty women with very high and forty women with very low body satisfaction will be contacted to participate in the experiment. Participants will complete the experiment one at a time in a psychophysiology lab. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The researcher will prep participants for collection of physiological data and then will give instructions for completing self-report measures. Self-report measures will include message involvement, social comparison and cognitive dissonance. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and then will be shown the advertisements. Participants will complete self-report measures in between each advertisement. After completing self-report measures for the last advertisement, participants will be thanked and dismissed.
Time Table
Data collection for this experiment will be completed in March. Data analysis will be completed in April.

Both theoretical and practical reasons for reviewing this area are discussed. The paper reviewed the theoretical models and frameworks that are often used to guide research on this area. Both television visual and audio features are considered. The main visual techniques which received much interest in literature are the use of pictures/videos, emotional/negative pictures, editing pace, number of edits, redundancy, camera angles, graphics, color versus black and white images, and still versus motion pictures. In addition, studies have examined the emotional and cognitive effects of audio techniques such as narration style, music, silence, and sound effects. The literature included some contradictory results regarding the cognitive and emotional effects of these structural features. The paper presents some possible explanation for some of these contradicting results. Suggestions for future research are discussed."

Seven groups of college students: 3 all-female groups, 2 all-male groups, and two mixed groups, were used to generate descriptions of the context, setting, and actual content of the condom use discussions. In addition, college students perceptions of the appropriateness of these scripts and of the respective roles of males and females in these discussions were examined. Three different script types were identified: direct, relational, and indirect. Perceptions of social appropriateness and gender stereotypical behavior concerning male and female roles in requesting and providing condoms varied depending upon script type and gender of participants. Age of individuals engaging in these scripts was also considered to be a factor. Suggestions for designing entertainment media depictions of condom-use discussions targeted at college students are discussed."

It was expected that exposure to beer commercials would result in more positive expectancies about drinking and more tolerance of drunk driving, particularly in males and frequent risk takers.
The data indicate that subjects who were exposed to the beer ads were more likely to hold positive beliefs about the social benefits of drinking, and males who saw the beer ads were the most likely to hold such beliefs. However, beer commercials did not affect either genders beliefs about alcohols physical benefits, or make them more accepting of irresponsible drinking. People who identified themselves as risk takers were more accepting of risky drinking in another person. This study offers support for the idea that, in some cases, beer ads can influence the alcohol expectancies that predict drinking."

This study attempts to answer some basic questions regarding electronic and online gaming use by examining college students. Who among college students are playing electronic and Internet games? How do they play and in what setting? Who among them are not playing? How significant is gaming to the social lives of college students? What specific types of games do they prefer to play and in what format? What impact, if any at all, do people in this group perceive gaming to have had on them? Young people in academic settings have been found to be heavy users of the Internet, and early adopters of new technology and this makes them an ideal group for studying trends in Internet and technology use and therefore and ideal population on which to focus the research of gaming use."

We conducted interviews with college students (n = 503) as a specifically at-risk population. We asked about their health histories, experiences with information seeking, and impressions of source effectiveness and ineffectiveness. Participants' responses were quantified using multiple, independent coders producing eight major categories and 40 subcategories of information sources and 12 factors of source effectiveness or ineffectiveness. Participants most often reported perceiving information as available in the print, electronic, and professional major sources categories, and doctors/physicians, the Internet, and friends source subcategories. Of all the major categories, participants reported that they would most likely consult the health care worker and family major categories, and the doctor/physician, parents, and nurse subcategories. Similarly, participants reported actually using the health care worker, electronic and print media major categories, and the doctor/physician, the Internet, and friends subcategories, rating the health care worker and educational major source categories and the doctor/physician, nurse, and parent subcategories as relatively more effective. Credibility and relevance emerged as most frequently reported as important for evaluating a source as effective or ineffective. Analyses of the relationship between gender, class standing, and experience with a serious illness are also presented. Implications of the findings for professionals working with college student populations and scholars studying information seeking are discussed."
2003-0128,"Come Gather around Together: An Examination of Radio Listening Groups in Fulbari, Nepal.",Paper,"Come Gather around Together: An Examination of Radio Listening Groups in Fulbari, Nepal.","Context: Mass media based entertainment education messages improve family planning behavior. It is likely that audience participation in the form of listening groups may enhance the impact of these programs. In Fulbari (Nepal), a partnership between local government agencies, community leaders, audience members, and program staff led to the launch of listening groups complementing a mass media family planning initiative.
Methods: The impact of membership in these listening groups was assessed through a case-control study design using survey data, supplemented by anecdotal evidence and service statistics.
Results: Among 408 respondents to the survey, 50% were members of listening groups, 18% were exposed to the radio program only, while 32 0x1.e115d00000001p-895d no exposure to radio program or listeners groups. Multivariate logistic regression models show significant impact of listenership on knowledge and behavior variables. For instance, with exposure to radio programs only, respondents were 3.5 times more likely to recall 5 modern methods of contraception. However with membership in listening groups, they were over 8 times more likely to recall these methods. Compared to nonmembers, listening group members were more likely to use modern methods of contraception.
Conclusions: Exposure to radio programs alone is associated with improved family planning knowledge and behavior. Membership in listening groups has a positive impact on family planning outcomes above and beyond the effects of exposure to the same radio program. Results affirm the importance of a partnership between program organizers, community leaders, NGO-partners and the audience community in order to generate positive family planning outcomes."

Abstract
This study replicates one done by Block and Keller (1995) testing the effects of perceived efficacy and message framing on intentions to perform a health-related behavior. The purpose of the study it to determine whether negatively or positively framed messages regarding skin cancer detection and prevention will lead to more favorable attitudes and greater intentions to follow recommended behavior. College students were exposed to one of the following: a positively framed prevention message, a positively framed detection message, a negatively framed prevention message, or a negatively framed detection message. Inconsistent with predictions, negatively framed messages were not found to be more persuasive when dealing with a detection behavior and positively framed messages were not found to be more persuasive when dealing with a prevention behavior. Results of this study show a significant relationship between intent to perform a skin exam and message frame."

It tests the limits of what a society deems obscene. In this regard, pornographers must constantly face gatekeepers, which regulate the dissemination of their product. It has been said that when a new communication technology emerges, pornographers will be the first to utilize it. It will be shown that, because of societal gatekeepers, pornography perpetuates technological evolution. Pornographys uses of new technologies and media fall into the media ecological paradigm of unintended consequences. Pornographers take advantage of these new media as a response to the inadequacies of current communication technology. From this perspective, the following article will explore the conceptualization of the pornographic and its role in the evolution of technology. From the birth of the printed word to the digital age, pornographys presence has been hard to deny, but by looking at its progression via its media channel, the reason for its ubiquity will become apparent."

The present study sought to determine the degree to which identities presented on personal homepages on the Internet were associated with the authors' off-line identities. The concept of ""warranting"" was extended to provide a theoretic foundation for a study of 200 personal homepages. Links between online and off-line identities were coded using a 23-item scheme. Contrary to some popular images of Internet identities being disconnected from ""real life,"" we found that the majority of homepage authors identified their gender, what they looked like (including photographs), what their interests were, where they lived, and how they could be reached by e-mail. Males tended to disclose slightly more information, but the difference was small and limited to items that might shield females from unwanted contact."

EXPERIENCES OF RURAL INDIAN WOMEN IN USING CYBER CAFES

ABSTRACT

Rural Indian women have found the newly located cyber cafes (internet booths) in their villages a good medium for crossing the border of geographic isolation in the villages of India.
Providing 651f employment to the rural population, agriculture is the main occupation and women are mainly secondary workers. They are able to cross this economic border through information on weather seeds, pesticides and fertilizers obtained from the Internet booths.
Female foeticide, less access to food, education and other resources, early arranged marriage and child bearing, are cultural borders that restrict the village woman and yet she is becoming empowered through the Internet.
Highly patriarchal, the village power structure is a political border, which has to be crossed by the rural Indian women. Now many are standing for election in the local Panchayat.
Case studies of the Internet booth usage by women facilitate the crossing of all these borders."
2003-0135,Communication and women's participation in the policial process in Nigeria.,Paper,Communication and women's participation in the policial process in Nigeria.,"Findings from the impact evaluation of a Democracy and Governance intervention in Nigeria indicate that project activities are associated with more favorable ideation about political participation and improved democratic participation. There appears to be a dose-response relationship between the intervention and pertinent indicators of political participation. Specifically, higher levels of program exposure are associated with more favorable ideation about political participation, and higher likelihood of participating in the political process. The data also indicate that the ideation model is very relevant in explaining voting behavior but not so much so for party membership. For voting, the ideational variables that are most significant are perceptions about the views of others on women's political participation, and the readiness of women to vote for a candidate or join a political party different from their husbands' or partners' when there is a difference of opinion between the two. For predicting party membership, the only significant ideational variable is discussion of political views. One surprising finding from the analyses presented in this paper is that perceived response efficacy of voting is not associated with increased political participation. The results of the study indicate that D&G communication interventions would be more effective if they addressed community norms about the political participation of women and sought to empower women to be able to make personal political decisions."

Respondents completed a self-report measure of CA adapted from the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension  24 (McCroskey, 1982a), and also completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire  Revised E scale (Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985). In addition, participants evaluated how happy they would feel in 58 hypothetical situations. It was hypothesized that in situations involving oral communication, CA would be inversely correlated with anticipated happiness, and that this association would be significantly stronger than the correlation between E and anticipated happiness. A moderate, negative CA x E correlation was also hypothesized. All three hypotheses were supported. Results also suggested that familiarity with other people in the situation might mediate the effects of CA and E on anticipated happiness. Overall, the findings indicate that CA provides information about future behavior in social contexts that is distinct from and superior to E."

Communication schemas identified in the gay conversational content included homonegativity, gay stereotyping, and learning about homosexuality. Key findings revealed that heterosexual males were generally more negative (and more explicitly homonegative) with a gay target than were heterosexual females. Additionally, heterosexual male participants expressed less interest in learning about homosexuality, less desire for future interaction with the gay target, and engaged in more stereotyping than did their female counterparts."

Implications and recommendations for policy makers for each doctrine are discussed."
2003-0139,Communication-Related Organizational Structures and Work Group Members' Temporal Experience,Paper,Communication-Related Organizational Structures and Work Group Members' Temporal Experience,"We explore how differences in three communication-related structures central to organizational workcoordination methods, workplace technologies, and feedback cyclesinfluence organizational members experience of twelve dimensions of timeflexibility, linearity, pace, punctuality, delay, scheduling, dynamism, separation, scarcity, urgency, and present and future time perspectives. Informed by Bourdieus practice theory, we frame this work in terms of the mutually constitutive relationship between time and communication and the need to examine social structures that are linked to the practical demands of members day-to-day activities. Results reveal that differences in coordination method, technology type, and feedback cycle characteristics help to shape members experience of nine dimensions of timeflexibility, linearity, pace, punctuality, delay, scheduling, urgency, and future and present time perspectives. Consistent with previous research and our hypothesis, members of work groups whose feedback cycles were characterized by an extended task completion interval and high task variability exhibited a greater future-time perspective than group members whose feedback cycles were characterized by brief intervals and low task variability."
2003-0140,Communication Rules and Expectations in Consumer Use of Information and E-Commerce Web Sites,Paper,Communication Rules and Expectations in Consumer Use of Information and E-Commerce Web Sites,"This study uses a communication rules perspective to assess how compliance with communication rules affects consumer perceptions of corporate-consumer relationships, corporate credibility, corporate goodwill and identification with the organization. It also addresses whether salience of the communication rule and relational orientation toward the Web site (information vs. e-commerce) affects consumer perceptions.
Findings from a 2 x 2 x 3 (salience x relational orientation x rule compliance) mixed experimental design (N=90) revealed no significant differences for salience, but both rule compliance and relational orientations affected the evaluations of corporate-consumer relationships, credibility, goodwill and identification. For the practitioner, implications are that, generally, companies need to do more than meet communication rulesthey need to surpass expectations for compliance with rules to increase levels of positive evaluation.
Findings are limited to the sample demographic of young (M = 21 years), predominantly female, educated students. The non-significant results for salience may suggest that this variable may require stronger implementation or that obligatory rules are generally salient."
2003-0141,Communication Science and Organization Theory. Borders among newspaper management and staff.,Paper,Communication Science and Organization Theory. Borders among newspaper management and staff.,"That employees represent the capital for a companys success is now widely accepted in the business world. However, in many companies it appears that management prefers to block its eyes and ears to the consequences for both organization and staff. Newspaper editors belong to this species; or are at least widespread as such across Europe. This paper is presenting two borders: On the one hand, personal borderlands are identified as different wishes and requirements of newspaper management and newspaper staff within existing organizations. On the other hand, the paper assesses disciplinary borderlands; how these can be made accessible and usable for communication science.
As Manfred Rühl postulated as early as 1979, the theoretical tools of editorial department research are often provided by other social sciences, e.g. research on organization and decision-making, which attained a high level of abstraction and sophistication early on. In this paper, the interdisciplinary route is taken a step further with the selection of a theory of organization as its theoretical base. This relates in particular to a notable and representative approach taken from behavioral science: the incentive-contribution theory, the theory of a balance of incentives and contributions within an organization necessary for its survival which goes back to Chester I. Barnard and his The Functions of the Executive in 1938.
Theoretical deduction will have been complemented by first empirical results by the actual conference date."

The studies assess the relationship between sources and quality of social support (General Social Support, Perceive Support in AA, Relationship with an AA Sponsor, and Relationship with a Significant Other) and Emotional Quality of Life (EQL) in sobriety. The cross-sectional data were aggregated across the three studies and A measurement model was developed and tested. Results show expected differences between alcoholics and nonalcoholic controls on social support and EQL. A cross-lag panel analysis of forty-one repeated measures showed that only the sponsor relationship and support from AA predicted EQL in future years, but EQL predicted future perceived social support for everyone but the sponsor. Nonrecursive structural equation models suggest that other sources of social support have more immediate influences on EQL. Emotional expressiveness was a key variable in the feedback loop between social suppor and EQL."
2003-0143,Communication Technologies and Long-Distance Romantic Relationships,Paper,Communication Technologies and Long-Distance Romantic Relationships,"Long-distance romantic relationships are not a novelty to academic study. Relationships inevitably separated by military obligations, job relocations, prison marriages, and long-distance relationships among college students have been previously studied, although not thoroughly. Long-distance romantic relationships are often maintained by relying heavily upon the availability and popular use of communication technologies. By conducting focus groups, this paper sought to understand how college students in long-distance romantic relationships use communication technologies to regularly maintain their relationship and manage conflicts that inevitably ensue. It was hypothesized that telephone and instant messaging will be the most prevalent types of communication technology used on a daily basis among individuals in long-distance relationships, as opposed to other forms of communication. It is hoped that the results of this study increase understanding of how the emergence of new communication technologies, such as video-conferencing, might benefit (or perhaps not) the successful maintenance of long-distance romantic relationships."

Systems engineering approaches endeavor to outline requirements, resources, work and process flows, and feedback to streamline coordination in a rational manner. Systems engineering by itself, however, does not fully account for the complexity of implementing plans of action. Organizational systems theory does a fine job fulfilling this important role. By viewing the implementation of systems philosophy through the concepts of bona fide groups and emergent social networks reacting to punctuated equilibrium conditions, we see how organizations react and adapt to challenges and crisis. This paper highlights the case of Cornell Universitys Formula SAE team as a best practices example of an engineering group that navigates such challenges effectively."

2003-0146,Communicative Strategies for Managing Defensiveness in a Womens Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment Center,Paper,Communicative Strategies for Managing Defensiveness in a Womens Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment Center,"Substance abuse treatment programs frequently offer group therapy as a safe place for clients to reveal their most private problems and work through issues with a counselor and other clients. Although treatment programs attempt to normalize clients self-disclosures, many clients fear and avoid revealing their weaknesses. Thus, the group therapy setting is ripe for defensiveness. Although previous research has focused on the causes of defensiveness (Gibb, 1961; Stamp et al., 1992), research has overlooked the communicative strategies that people use to manage and mitigate defensiveness in social interaction. This study used ethnographic methods to illuminate the communicative strategies that female substance abuse clients at the Womens Program (WP), a program of the Community Services Center (CSC), used to deal with their experiences of defensiveness. The clients resourcefully used an array of strategies, which were identified and defined within the social context of the WP group therapy setting."
2003-0147,Community influences on newspaper coverage of social and political protests,Paper,Community influences on newspaper coverage of social and political protests,"Research on news coverage of social protest has yielded evidence of a ""protest paradigm,"" a framework of common news attributes that contribute to the marginalizing of protesters as as social deviants. Past research has shown that the application of the protest paradigm varies according to the nature of the group's goals. Adherence to the protest paradigm may also vary in response to the characteristics of the community in which media messages are produced. The structural pluralism research of Tichenor, Donohue and Olien suggests that community structure can affect news coverage of social conflict, which might be extended to include adherence to the protest paradigm, as smaller, homogenous communities exhibit less tolerance for social conflict than larger, heterogeneous communities. This research analyzes content of protest articles, comparing coverage in large, mid-sized and small daily newspapers, and weekly newspapers. Results show smaller daily newspapers avoided or minimized protest stories, while large newspapers depicted more radical protest goals, were less critical of protests targeting local governments and quoted protesters more often."

In the middle decades of the First Century C.E., Paul crafted eloquent mediated rhetoric to conceptualize local ritual practice in such a way that it formed the basis for widespread solidarity for an expanding religious sect. It hinged upon the Body of Christ, which in Pauline discourse became a space- and time-binding medium that might hold together a dispersed society of the faithful. Working within the framework of pragmatist cultural studies, I sketch Pauls vision of mass communication, the mediated rhetoric that helped bring it into existence, and the continuing significance of the broader social form it representslocally assembled bodies in ritual solidarity with distant others."

Consequently, the organization is frequently synonymous with the individual in scholarly literature. Empirical investigation for this assumption is lacking.
This case study analyzes 15-years worth of letters from two newspapers in a midwestern community. A heuristic of characteristics of the social actor, developed from the work of Weber and Giddens, is used to examine the extent to which people characterize a specific organization as a social actor.
In all, 123 texts were examined. Independent coding of nearly 251f the texts achieved over 85 0x1.bb8a0080e115dp-893greement for all codable instances in the 662 references. Only 271015057760f the 662 references evidenced characteristics from the heuristic. This suggests an over-reliance in the literature for conflating the organizational and individual author.

Hofstede¡¦s cultural model was employed to examine the companies. The results show that Hofstede cultural orientations do not fit into these Taiwanese internet companies; several contradictory results were generated in the same dimension among the variables, the result indicates that the poor fit of the model in the sample organizations may indicate that the high-tech companies have a different corporate culture compared with the traditional organizations. Hofstede¡¦s cultural orientations were reclassified as a new model so was the leadership model. Finally, there are 10 cultural characteristics and 8 leadership styles found within these companies.

The results of the research investigate that there are some important relationships between corporate cultures and leadership styles. The similarity in the corporate cultures and leadership styles between these two companies may imply the commonality among the Taiwanese companies in the domestic portal sectors. In other words, the models of corporate cultures or leadership styles for measuring traditional industries may not be appropriate for high-teach companies."

In this study, we considered the consistent use of condoms as an effective preventive measure against HIV infection. Research has shown that condom use is predicted by several cognitive and environmental variables such as AIDS knowledge, perception of vulnerability, perception of outcome expectancies, perception of social support, peer-group comparison, and condom use self-efficacy. Therefore, to examine the relative vulnerability to HIV infection we examined the variance in factors listed above among three categories of female CSWs in the city of Chennai in India.
The study found significant differences among the three groups of CSWs on the following factors: AIDS knowledge, perception of vulnerability, perception of social support, and peer-group comparison. The study will have wide implications for designing HIV/AIDS prevention interventions, public health campaigns and policies that are targeted at the vulnerable CSW population in Chennai and other places in India."

Undergraduate students from two universities (N = 425) were asked to (a) complete a survey and (b) keep a diary over the course of one day. Both instruments assessed how frequently they engaged in various media use activities, including television viewing, radio listening, Web surfing, email sending and receiving, music listening, and video game playing. Results indicate that survey estimates of media use are consistently higher than diary use, but both methods are consistently, moderately correlated with each other, per medium. Given a lack of certainty about which method is more accurate, a third method of data collection -- electronic use tracking -- is described"

Currently South Korea is ahead of the United States in the deployment of broadband Internet connection. What factors have contributed to South Koreas competitive broadband environment? An analytical framework was proposed to compare the development of broadband Internet in South Korea and the United States. We found that the two nations differences in their broadband Internet developments might be explained by a combination of policy, consumer demands, and supporting/related technologies factors."

It was hypothesized that CMC would inhibit the learning of complex social skills and predispose people to loneliness. A total of 64 male and female participants from four large corporations completed a modified version of Riggios (1989) Social Skills Inventory, a scale adapted by Steinfield (1986) on CMC usage, and the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell et al., 1980). The results indicated no significant main effect of CMC usage on participants degree of loneliness, however a significant interaction effect was found between CMC usage and respondents sex on participants perceived loneliness. Male heavy users of CMC had lower degrees of loneliness, and male infrequent users of CMC had higher degrees of loneliness. Females showed no significant difference. The results of this study imply that for males the use of CMC may not be related to perceived loneliness, but a tool to facilitate their communication and relationships with others. Finally, there was a weak negative correlation between CMC usage and perceived social skills, suggesting that the more an individual uses communication technologies, the less proficient the individual perceives his or her social skills to be."

Internet affinity is an important research topic in relation to populations and special groups who show a low level of Internet use despite the availability of a telecommunication infrastructure and satisfactory financial potential for the use of this medium. This paper presents a conceptual Internet affinity model and shows the results of empirical research of the predictors and factors of Internet affinity. A survey was performed on 435 college students and the data were analyzed by regression analyses and factor analysis. The revealed predictors of frequency of Internet use and of the desire to use the Internet are discussed, as well as the factors/dimensions of Internet affinity that were disclosed by factor analysis."

This paper conceptualizes the study of a web site based in Turkey that has become enormously popular in the three years of its existence. Despite a low Internet penetration rate in the country, the site daily attracts about 55,000 visitors and submission of between 80 and 100 confessions. This paper frames the research of this site in social and religious ways and discusses how uses and gratifications research, somewhat reconceived to apply to research of Internet genres, could be used to determine why the site has sustained such popularity."

This process involves making both explicit and implicit assumptions about how actors will accept, reject, or modify the technology. Similarly, academic or scientific studies of ICTs vary according to the social identity ascribed to actors. Three conceptions that are commonly employed in studies to refer to actors in relationship to ICTs are user, consumer, and community member. In this article, an exploration of the consequences of the naming of actors is carried out for three representative studies of ICTs. It is argued that the choice of the term user, consumer, or community member is associated with the range and type of opportunities for action opened up for actors in relation to ICTs."

An analysis of Congressional Web sites (n= 100) and interviews with Congressional offices (n=32) shows that Congressional representatives recognize the value of the Internet and the WWW for communicating with constituents. However, our examination of Congressional Web sites suggests that they are not very dialogic, furthermore, interviews with legislative aides responsible for maintenance of legislative Web sites suggest that legislators see Web sites primarily as information dissemination tools. There appears to be an almost total absence of dialogic communication and relationship building on legislative sites."
2003-0160,Connections between the Alberta and Montana borders,Paper,Connections between the Alberta and Montana borders,"Martin Kuester claims that "" Canada is unthinkable without its border with the US."" For some, the border symbolizes connections rather than differences. The border section between the province of Alberta and the state of Montana is particularly susceptible to common links.

The varieties of people who live in southern Alberta and northern Montana have created a culture unlike that which exists anywhere else along the US-Canada border. An Indian nationthe Blackfeetstraddle the border with the Blood tribe living in Canada and the Blackfeet nation headquartered in Browning, Montana. Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park recognized separately as a national park in both Canada and the US, together forms a World Heritage site separated only by a 20-foot swath of cut trees. Those who would visit Goat Haunt, Montana the northern-most settlement in Montana, get there by boat from Waterton town site in Canada.



This is a report on the second year of a three-year study exploring the nature of this border culture. Stress is on the visual metaphors, both fixed symbols and fluid rituals of national identity, which are common on both sides of the border. From the Milk River in the north to Montana's Sweet Grass Hills, the land dictates a way of life unchanged since the early twentieth century


This photo-essay struggles to document visually the messages of connection that accompany the forty-ninth parallel as it cuts through Montana and Alberta. This border is an intersection rather than a barrier."
2003-0161,Considering Media Attributes and Psychological Motives to Understand Displacement,Paper,Considering Media Attributes and Psychological Motives to Understand Displacement,"With the growing popularization and increased use of the Internet, researchers have begun to examine the role this new medium is taking in the daily lives of media consumers (Ferguson & Perse, 2000; Lin, 1999). Researchers are now examining the extent to which Internet use is displacing other media use such as television. This study builds on previous displacement findings by examining psychological motives from an attribute specific viewpoint. That is, rather than assume that motives such as social and entertainment are conceptually equivalent for both television and the Internet, this study assessed the type of social and entrainment opportunities that are available by medium. In doing so, we have found that psychological motives driving television and Internet use do differ."

This study seeks to examine the coverage of the NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia by major US, China and Taiwan newspapers and news agencies. It aims to demonstrate how newspapers in different countries framed the bombing event in different ways. The study finds that different political ideology and press ideology interact to frame news discourse. Embracing liberal democracy ideology and justifying the Kosovo War, the US press framed the bombing as an accident due to technical mistakes. Upholding official socialist ideology and considering the Kosovo War as a wanton invasion toward a sovereign country, the Chinese press framed the bombing as an extension of such invasion and a deliberate attack on China. Taiwan press shared similar stance with the US in terms of political ideology and the interpretation of the bombing, but showed more neutral attitude in terms of the tone of coverage. The study concludes that framing is an important mechanism by which ideology is transmitted through the news."
2003-0163,Constitutive discourse in transnational contexts; strategic formation of flexible subjects between Poland and its Diaspora,Paper,Constitutive discourse in transnational contexts; strategic formation of flexible subjects between Poland and its Diaspora,"This paper examines how dispersed individuals are constituted as a diasporic subject of the nation-state and, in turn, how the identity of the nation-state is reinvented in national discourses. To this end, the paper presents a discursive analysis of publications of the Association for the Polish Commonwealth established in 1990 to cultivate relations between Poland and its diaspora. The paper extends the framework of constitutive rhetoric by exploring transnational discourse flowing across borders. The analysis identifies a flexible subject as an ideological effect of constitutive discourse that aims to legitimate a diasporic form of collective engagement with the homeland across borders and from a position of national membership in another nation-state. This form of discourse enables the nation-state to reinforce its position and extend its influence beyond its political borders. The concept of flexibility directs attention to how identities and cultural meanings are negotiated and produced across borders."

Specifically, the study explores the participation of Generation Xers on an Internet site dedicated to political discussion and the ways in which they position themselves in relation to the identity marker ""Generation X."" An emergent typology from participation suggests that participants reflexive moves are motivated by the need to appropriate or repair the stigmatized generational label and fluctuate between individualistic and collectivist positions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance of a secure sense of place from which civic participation can occur."

Ads featuring extremely thin models, however, have been attracting criticism from consumers as well as researchers investigating the relationship between the ads and eating disorders. In spite of the potential public relations hazards, marketers has been ignorant of the necessity to reconsider the use of the thin ideal in their promotional activities. This research investigates public response to the thin ideal in an experiment that demonstrates that knowledge of the digital manipulation of ads to render models thinner prompts readers to prefer healthier depictions of women and motivates them to boycott the brand. Findings are discussed with regard to the implications for public relations and overall marketing communication strategy."

Recently in South Korea, the rise of avatar culture and the tremendous success of avatar-related marketing in online-community websites have attracted a great deal of society-wide attention. Few attempts, however, have been made to explain this brand-new phenomenon from theoretical perspectives. The present study aims at exploring the social implications of people¡¯s active participation in avatar marketing, asking what would be the motivational bases of such behaviors. The findings based on online survey data suggest that participation in online avatar marketing may strongly be motivated by their relative dissatisfaction with their offline identity as well as their need for uniqueness."
2003-0167,"Consuming Pink Triangles: Privacy, Surveillance, Identity, and 'Gay Marketing'",Paper,"Consuming Pink Triangles: Privacy, Surveillance, Identity, and 'Gay Marketing'","In this paper, I argue that the newfound courting of the gay community by mainstream marketers represents not so much some form of gay liberation, as a mere repositioning in commercial panoptic formations. Drawing upon political economy thought, I examine the relational dynamics of privacy, (sexual) identity, and target marketing within the emerging consumer Panopticon. I explore the deeper social implications of gay niche marketing for the cultural construction of (sexual) identity. As I will endeavor to demonstrate, at least for sexual minorities, identity, privacy, surveillance, and trust are inherently interrelated, forming a complex social matrix. Informed by the thought of Foucault and Althusser, I suggest hailing is a tool employed by target marketers to inveigle individuals into perceiving these commercial actors as trusted agents. Ultimately, I employ these theoretical insights in a critical examination of the marketing practices of the largest online sites serving gays and lesbians: PlanetOut.com and Gay.com."

An ethnographic research was conducted to identify the ways in which 1.5 generation Korean immigrants in Greater Vancouver talk about whites, ethnic Chinese and Korean themselves. 1.5 generation immigrants refer to a half and half generation who immigrated to the host country when they were relatively young. The key argument is that non-white cultural identities are always constructed and negotiated within white racist representations. Non-whites are constantly given their identities by the dominant western discourse of race while they actively appropriate and negotiate the meanings of imposed identities. I discuss young Korean immigrants¡¯ struggles with contending identities in relation to the presence of four types of subjectivities constructed in white-privileged society of Canada: 1) an internalized white superiority, 2) a racial stigma, 3) a pan-Asian identity and 4) ethnocentrism."

The review provides an overview of the principal research lines and theoretical approaches used in this field, and concludes with an evaluation of the strengths, deficiencies, and challenges for current and future research.
Thirty-five Mexican content analysis reports are reviewed, and a general overview of the conceptual and thematic emphases dominant in the field is presented. The paper points out that the most abundant type of studies in the 13-year period reviewed were the ones about the flow and supply of television programming, in other words, studies not properly about the characteristics of the content but about the number of particular messages in Mexican TV according to their origin, genre, and time of transmission. Next are studies about international news inspired by the NWICO, and then content analysis of media coverage of presidential elections, and studies about media routines and professional values."
2003-0170,"Contested Communicative Spaces: rethinking identities, boundaries and the role of the media among Turks in Greece.",Paper,"Contested Communicative Spaces: rethinking identities, boundaries and the role of the media among Turks in Greece.","Diasporic communication has always occurred across and despite borders. The case of the Turkish minority in Greece, a beached diaspora and vestige of the Ottoman past, is a peculiar case where the tensions of transnationalism and nationalism intersect and where boundaries are continuously created and negotiated. In order to understand communication in this politicised environment and the relationship between media and identity I draw on an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that understands identities as performed and as experienced. The paper, based on interviews with, and participant observation among Turkish speakers living in Athens, examines people's media resources, national and transnational. The uses of media and their integration in people's daily lives is a complex process involving a number of parameters, material, social and individual often extending beyond ethnicity. However, it is argued that although media do not determine identities, they do contribute in creating symbolic communicative spaces that either include or exclude, thereby affecting audiences' discourses about their identities. In interpreting such processes I draw on Barth's theory of Ethnic Groups and Boundaries (1969) to argue that the media, through a number of practices, often create boundaries for inclusion and exclusion, and eventually participation in a 'common culture'. The first part of the paper highlights two themes: the first is that gender and generational differences contest the idea of a homogenous Turkish minority suggesting the importance of social change; the second is that media consumption in Turkish households is banal, shaped by social rather than ethnic parameters. In the second part of the paper, however, the banal consumption of media is disrupted by instances when tension prevails. Three such cases are discussed as examples of media raising the boundaries for exclusion from a common communicative space."

Understanding such a phenomenon, however, requires efforts in contextualizing the talk shows into the larger political communication process and the social and political conditions of the city. The present paper represents such an attempt to contextualize talk radio in Hong Kong. While recognizing the rise of the politics of public opinion, the existence of social and economic crises, and the problematic performance of mainstream media as potentially important factors contributing to the prominence of talk radio, the study analyzes a comparative survey on citizens' and journalists' view on media and politics in Hong Kong in order to examine how the two groups of people conceive of the phenomenon. The results show that journalists and citizens focus on different aspects of talk radio. Journalists emphasize upon talk radio as a site for citizens to express their discontent and anguish, a site for official-citizen conflicts, and thus a site on which government officials can be monitored, citizens tend to see talk radio as an alternative channel for political communication and they emphasize on monitoring government officials as well as on other more constructive aspects of public discussion. The implications of the findings on understanding talk radio in Hong Kong, as well as on understanding the relationship between new and old media of political communication in general, are discussed."

It also supported the two postulates of the Contingency Theory: Symmetry through a dialogue may not be inherently ethical; in a morally intractable conflict, accommodation may be impossible. The research is the first test of the Contingency Model of conflict management in public relations in an international, political context."

Building on Matusik and Hills management model for contingent work, Birds view of boundaryless careers as knowledge creators, and the knowledge-creating theory of the firm, I explore the knowledge-creating and knowledge-acquiring processes for contingent workers, and argue for potential knowledge benefits for contingent workers as an integral part of the knowledge dynamics constituting the contingent worker-firm relationship. I further propose a new conceptualization of the contingent worker-firm relationship as a potential knowledge-creation partnership that acknowledges the possibility of intrinsically motivated contingent workers. Drawing on the organization trust literature, the knowledge transfer literature, and the contingent work literature, I also examine the understudied trust and distrust dynamics constituting the contingent worker-firm relationship. The analysis sheds some light into the complex trust relationships between contingent workers and the firm, and that between contingent workers and traditional workers, and explicates the critical role of trust in facilitating the achievement of the goal of knowledge creation and transfer."

Using an extreme example of talk-in-interaction in a European Assembly, this paper introduces the possibility that we may look differently at conversation. Proceeding within the theoretical framework of Interlocutionary Logic, this work proposes an analytic framework which makes it possible to explore chaos-in-conversation and to uncover some of its constitutive features. The conversations appear as a heap of units with a particularly complex configuration that does not conform to the classical structures of linguistic exchanges and communicative dynamics. The communicative interaction in this setting constitutes a process which is not directly translatable into ordered sequences of relevant elements. To the contrary, it achieves its goal in a chaotic way that can be articulated around multiple structures developing in parallel."

With this agreement, two television newsrooms, once competitors, are now forced to cooperate. Using an interpretive framework created by Bantz (1993)called the organizational communication culture (OCC) method, the current study explores this novel, 21st century change and its influence on newsroom cultures.

The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of corporate credibility on attitude website (Ast), attitude toward the brand (Ab) and purchase intention (PI) on the Internet, the relationships among Ast, Ab, and PI, and the moderating effects of credibility on the relationships among Ast, Ab, and PI. This study manipulated a source's expertise and trustworthiness to assess the impact each of these components on the consumer's attitude formation.
This conceptual model was tested with a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The path analysis confirmed that corporate credibility had a positive impact of PI. Even when Aad was replaced with Ast, Ast influenced Ab, Ab influence: influenced PI in the same way as in the previous research on Aad, Ab and PI. Corporate credibility obviously affect to consumer behavior and Aad, Ab, and PI previous to consumer decision as well as corporate credibility is likely to affect a company's success even on the Internet."

For two of the four, Nike and Wendys, both corporate identity dimensions, expertise and social values, were significant predictors of purchase intention. For Microsoft, only the expertise dimension was significant, whereas for Philip Morris, only the social values dimension was predictive of purchase intention. When the relationships between CSR practices and corporate identity were examined, the discretionary CSR practices and the moral/ethical CSR practices were significant predictors of the social values dimension of corporate identity. Relational CSR practices, however, were significant predictors of the expertise dimension. While brand familiarity had a direct path to purchase intention, familiarity with CSR practices operated only via indirect paths via corporate identity. The relevance of these findings to public relations is discussed."

New peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing sites are facilitating the widespread downloading of unlicensed music. In response, the established music industry is simultaneously attempting to undermine the impact of these exchanges (describing them as theft) and to take advantage of the possibilities of the Internet in reducing distribution costs and offering the possibility of a more direct relationship between labels and consumers. This paper examines the argument that digital downloads are necessarily hurting legal record sales and then problematises dominant definitions of piracy. The paper evaluates the evolving strategies of the major record companies and finally considers the extent to which the incumbents will be able to use their existing market power to dominate the future of recorded music."

The use of heuristics is inherently conflicting with the elaborated processes of generating estimates of issue positions from the aggregation of exemplars. The psychological literature in the base-rate fallacy is reviewed to provide new insight into the clarification of the theoretical contradiction. Such a clarification has both theoretical and practical significance to the literature of news exemplification effects, particularly in generating more constructive defense mechanisms against the dominant, biasing effects of unrepresentative news exemplification. Comparability of the psychological and communication paradigms is established and suggestions for future empirical study are made."

In contested child custody cases, in the state of California, judges often rely on the testimony of court appointed mediators to determine how child custody is settled. This leaves an enormous amount of power in the hands of mediators. Child custody mediation, as a coercive state practice, can be problematic and its consequences significant. In my sample of 30 semi-structured interviews with coparents, I found that court appointed mediation, and mediators, can be coercive for some coparents and a welcome resource for others. Often, gender is an important variable."

The unit of analysis was the individual story. Content was coded for type of story, type of reference to homosexuality, location of reference to homosexuality within the story, origin of story, and location of story. Five hundred and eight stories with some type of reference to gays, lesbians, bisexuals, or transsexuals were identified. Relatively few of these stories dealt with lifestyle issues of concern to gays, whereas most of them were reviews of or stories about popular entertainmentTV shows, movies, books, or playswith gay, lesbian, or transsexual characters. Lesbians were the focus of very few stories.
The author finds little evidence to contradict claims that coverage of gays and gay-themed issues is primarily conflict-driven with little focus on the day-to-day life of the gay community."

Women visit it to seek support from others, to give advice, to voice opinions or describe an experience, and to come together as a community with Oprah fan hood as a common thread. In this work, we study the formation of relationships and community in this particular area of cyberspace through analysis of written contributions of web site users. We also assess the characteristics and qualities of the space itself, the opportunities it affords in providing a forum for women as well as the constraints it imposes by virtue of its commercial and structured form. What results is somewhat unique to the Oprah experience but also points to common themes as well as tensions around the notions of communities as they exist both on and off line for women.
Thus, three important questions drive this study: (1) How do women participate, how do they form relationships on Oprah.com? (2) What are the cultural and social bases for their participation? (3) Are spaces such as Oprah.com important sites for women? The theoretical underpinnings of this investigation come from social constructionist approaches to communication that put communicative practices at the center of meaning making. While the medium for the practices we analyze is the Oprah.com web site, the focus for our study is how participation in this particular community is enacted in cyberspace and what consequences attributed to their on-line participation."

This study argues that anime¡¯s cultural manifestations of ¡°integrative spirituality¡± of Japanese culture well correspond with the young spiritual seekers who are characterized by the subjective, autonomous, reflexive construction of religious identity from a variety of sources instead of a religious tradition. Their cultural consumption of anime, which is based on their dismissive attitude toward both organized religions and American popular culture, contributes to the construction of their alternative religious identity."
2003-0184,Creating the Internet as Alternative Media,Paper,Creating the Internet as Alternative Media,"Alternative media open up different types of communicating ways by more active and positive access to announce opinions and feelings of minorities. As the World Wide Web has been developed, the technology makes the cyberspace as real community for people to share their common experiences, languages, cultures and semiotics in groups. Obviously, many alternative media activists adopt this access to develop their contents of alternative media in the new media age. In Taiwan, we find that gay/lesbian communities use CMC to construct their identities and communities on and even off the net. The result is also found that gay virtual community can function well as the role of alternative media. Compared to other media forms, the evidence we suggest here is that CMC may offer the best opportunity for shared interactive communication among gay and lesbian people. Nowadays it is flexible for alternative media activists to manage the relationship with mainstream media, regardless of ideology and principle."

This study introduces the Creativity Enhancement Scale (CES), which attempts to organize these factors to form a research measurement instrument. To be included in the scale, a factor should be strongly supported by previous research and related directly to the perception of the employee.
This 14-item, 7-point Likert scale was answered by 161 participants in the state of Oklahoma.

The first of three studies laid the groundwork by investigating common situations in which people report having said the right or the wrong thing. Study 2 tested a new technique for gathering data in which film clips depicting critical junctures were stopped at crucial points and participants were asked to respond as if they were characters in the films. Participants recorded individually what they would say and then discussed the best option in small groups either face-to-face or by computer. Study 3 expanded the range of video clips, and participants addressed how competent they thought the film characters responses were and why. As a set, the three studies demonstrate that the critical junctures method works as a uniquely communication method for gathering data about message options and for training social skills."

Despite a prolonged downturn in the global economy for media and software, the technical and legal design of the Celestial Jukebox nears completion. We examine the development and implications of the Jukebox as it is manifested in several online music subscription services (which we term Music Service Providers, or MSPs), in which the ?Big Five? record companies (Universal, Sony, Warner, BMG, and EMI) provide content and/or hold equity stakes. First, we identify and describe the Celestial Jukebox?s key technical components -- Customer Relationship Management (?eCRM? or ?CRM?) and Digital Rights Management (?DRM?) software. These applications are server-side, ?enterprise-scale? packages deployed by firms distributing intellectual property via Internet commerce. We then discuss the intermeshing characteristics of CRM/DRM, their implementation in MSPs, and the primary stakeholders in these subscription systems. We conclude with a discussion of the MSPs? role in advancing what Mosco (1990) terms ?pay-per? society. While the CRM/DRM technologies integral to the MSP model may lead to long-term commercial viability for the Celestial Jukebox, they may also create substantial opportunities for infringement on consumer rights. Although the MSP model continues to evolve and may depart from present configurations, the Celestial Jukebox enabled by CRM/DRM will be an increasingly important component of American culture, representing as it does the long-standing desire of copyright owners to reduce risk while reaping continuous revenue streams."

This paper proposes that the potentially most productive approach to discovering those links is research grounded in a framing perspective that is in turn thoroughly grounded in theory  that is, in its fundamental attachment to the operations of hegemony. Newswork, it is argued, is constitutive of, not separable from frames. A review of a variety of studies conducted with more traditional methodologies, when viewed from a framing perspective, point to the potential of this new theoretical direction."
2003-0189,Crossing the Borderlands of Visual Communication: On Synesthestic Communication,Paper,Crossing the Borderlands of Visual Communication: On Synesthestic Communication,"Synesthesia is commonly defined as cross-sensual experience--seeing colors when hearing sounds. Current studies reveal a misleading distinction between real and symbolic synesthesia. Reconsidered as a phenomenon of communication, synesthesia would exist neither as transcendent nor immanent but in-between--emerging in communication. Resolving this dualism implies, for the study of visual communication, that: 1) The interpretation of visual communication will be a co-relation between a person-world, expression-perception intertwining and the historical, cultural, linguistic, metaphoric environment. 2) All of the senses, physical and the psychical, are aspects of a complex sense constellation--embodied intentionanlity. 3) While the ""meaning"" of a communication would be linguistic (metaphorical), this does not mean there is a necessary dualism between language and physics--symbolic and real. 4) Sensual communication is intersensual--visual communication is always already synesthetic."

However, depending on the type of study and targeted population, response rates can vary greatly. Research examining methods of increasing response to surveys has generally found that techniques which manipulate design variables can increase rates, however extensive testing has resulted in decreased gains over time. In addition, response rates have been declining for a variety of reasons, including increased constraints placed on researchers, competition with marketing organizations, and survey fatigue in the population. Therefore, it is important to consider additional strategies and techniques that can maximize response from potential participants. This study uses the foot-in-the-door technique, originating in the field of social psychology, to increase recruitment of subjects asked to complete a health related questionnaire, and to examine its impact on surveys of varying lengths. Results show the technique can successfully be applied in this context."
2003-0191,Cross-Situational Component of the Situational Theory,Paper,Cross-Situational Component of the Situational Theory,"This study explored the cross-situational component of the situational theory, by identifying the influence of personality differences on the communication behavior of publics. It linked the concept of need for cognition (NFC) from psychology with one independent variable in the situational theory ¨C problem recognition. I used qualitative method for this exploratory study. Results showed that qualitative interview also identified individuals with different levels of NFC and their respective characteristics. Individuals with high NFC tended to show much higher internal problem recognition across situations than those with low NFC, but the external problem recognition was not evident cross-situationally. They also tended to engage in passive communication behaviors for more situations, but the active communication behavior was still rare across situations. Acknowledging that people¡¯s communication behaviors are still mostly situational, the findings did identify the special type of ¡°intellectual public¡±, who responded to more situations involving more intellectual interest than actual relevance."

Adopting a case study approach, the paper describes and evaluates two new media education projects designed to train young people¡¦s critical thinking skills. It also outlines the challenges to such programs in a post-colonial society, highlighting issues such as the legacy of the colonial system. Findings of the case studies indicate that the legacy of the colonial education system, which tended to ¡§spoon-feed¡¨ students, was to constrain the effectiveness of media education in Hong Kong. However, in general the young participants did benefit from the media education curricula and workshops. It is found that piecemeal media education programs enhance young people¡¦s ¡§specific¡¨ critical analytical skills rather than their ¡§general¡¨ critical media awareness."
2003-0193,Cultural and Formal Convergence in _Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within_,Paper,Cultural and Formal Convergence in _Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within_,"My paper provides a case study of the film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (Hironobu Sakaguchi and Moto Sakakibara), which premiered in the US in June 2001. The biggest selling point of Final Fantasy was its revolutionary role as the first feature film with a human cast created entirely by digital technology. My paper considers how and why the film might have failed to perform as well as predicted at the box office by examining its convergent elements at the industrial, formal and cultural levels. More specifically I look at the transition of the film from videogame to film, its narrative and stylistic similarities to and differences from mainstream American films, and its representations of racial and sexual difference, particularly as embodied in its Amerasian white-coded female protagonist. How might the mistranslation or non-translation of these elements into the Hollywood model signify for the future of film and videogame convergence?"

These strategies are discussed as optimal forms of communication. Listenership within Finnish civic scenes is treated as an optimal communication form. Key optimal strategies for a favorable listening performance are identified with a concentrated, exacting listenership with the outward appearance of the face kept in its neutral state. Inattentiveness and ""ill-prepared thoughts"" accompanied by good guess strategies are identified as defective listening behaviors; whereas interruptions and ""speaking as one thinks"" accompanied by ""expressions in the face"" are identified as excessive listening behaviors. The optimal form is discussed as an interpretive tool for formulating claims about cultural communication in the contexts of social interaction."

Although a considerable number of empirical studies have dealt with cross-cultural issues using traditional cultural perspectives, there have been few research efforts to observe cultural differences in non-commercial and technology-based communication contexts. A content analysis with a sample of 147 Korean and US personal Web pages was conducted to examine the ongoing validity of two dominant cultural dimensions: Hall¡¯s low-context vs. high-context communication and Hofstede¡¯s individualism vs. collectivism. The results partially supported the explanatory power of both dimensions in new communication environments: there were significant differences between Korean and US personal Web pages in terms of low- and high-context communications and individualism. However, no difference in collectivism between both countries¡¯ personal Web pages was found, nor were there any significant links between low-context communication and individualism and between high-context communication and collectivism. Based upon the findings, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, as are study limitations and directions for future research."
2003-0196,Culture and the Structure of International Communication,Paper,Culture and the Structure of International Communication,"This paper explores the relationship between national culture and the structure of international information flows. World System Theory suggests that economic relations between nations are the primary organizing principle of international communication. However, recent research indicates that cultural factors such as language and religion play a significant organizing role. The current research examines the role of culture as an organizing mechanism of the Internet and international telecommunications. National culture is operationalized using Hofstedes four dimensions of collectivism vs. individualism (IDV), femininity vs. masculinity (MAS), uncertainty avoidance (UAI) and power distance (PDI). The structures of the Internet and international telecommunications are operationalized as communication networks.
The results indicated that national culture is significantly related to the centrality and the structure of the both networks. Centrality in the international telecommunication network is significantly related to IDV and MAS, and centrality on the Internet is significantly related to IDV. Controlling for economics, the relation between individualism and centrality remains significant in both networks. Using the results of the multidimensional scaling to represent network structure, one finds that the first dimension of the telecommunication network is significantly related to MAS and UAI, and the second to IDV. For the Internet, the first dimension is significantly related to IDV, the second to MAS, and the third to PDI.
The paper discusses the limitations of this research and the implications of the findings for globalization, a structural theory of international communication and cultural convergence theory."
2003-0197,"culture, gender and self-other connectedness in Canadian and Chinese samples",Paper,"culture, gender and self-other connectedness in Canadian and Chinese samples","Founded upon the theories of Independent-Interdependent Self-Construal and I-C, the main goal of this study was to test, via an adapted IOS Scale, whether Anglo-Canadians were more independent than Mainland Chinese in construing their relationship with family members and friends. Strong cultural differences were found in self-family connectedness, but not in self-friends connectedness. Chinese were closer to their family members than Canadians, but Canadians were as close to their friends as Chinese. In both samples, gender difference was found in self-friends connectedness, but not in self-family connectedness. In the Canadian sample, females were closer to their friends than males, while in the Chinese sample, males were closer to their friends than females. In conclusion, this study contributes to the field in three ways. First, the finding that Canadians are as connected as Chinese to their close friends unprecedentedly contests one fundamental assumption of the theories of independent-interdependent self-construal (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) and I-C (Hofstede,1980; Triandis et al., 1988) that individualists (e.g., Anglo-Canadians) are more independent than collectivists (e.g., Chinese) on all dimensions of human relations. Second, the proposition (Cross & Madson, 1997) that western males and females differ in the same way individualists and collectivists differ in their self-construal is not supported. Finally, the adaptation of the IOS Scale proposes a refreshing direction in cross-cultural research. Graphic representations may be less susceptible to cross-cultural mis-construal than verbal statements since the former involves little or no translation from one language to another."

This HSN is a complex non-profit IOR consisting of widely diverse organizations brought together for a common mission: to serve the homeless. Communication is essential for the network to serve clients and in order to survive. I draw on three bodies of literature to address this issue: IORs, organizational cultures, and social networks. Statistics indicate approximately half of all IORs fail. A connection is proposed between IOR failure and culture incompatibility. A future research agenda is also proposed: studying culture and IORs from a communication perspective and researching cultural impact on IORs. A list of research questions that corresponds with each proposed area is presented."
2003-0199,Culture in Transition: A Cultural Study of a University's Parking Organization,Paper,Culture in Transition: A Cultural Study of a University's Parking Organization,"Change is necessary as organizations respond to their environment, and organizational members must learn to adapt to the ambiguity inherent in such change. From organizational culture literature, several themes emerge as important to a study of organizational culture change. First, changing culture in a lasting way requires attention to a change process, taking time into account. Second, an organization must recognize permeable boundaries and multiple stakeholder groups. Finally, a study of cultural change must consider values that change and those that stay the same. This study addresses these issues by investigating a culture that is in the change process, the Parking, Traffic, and Transportation Service (PTTS) at one of the largest universities in the country. Research questions leading this study include: What is the culture of PTTS? How is the interim director attempting to change that culture? What is changing and what is staying the same in the organizations culture? What are the reactions of employees to that change? It would seem that PTTS is still in the early stages of what may become a long process. As the new director is hired and the interim director moves out, the organization will be challenged in shaping its image to meet the needs of its expanded stakeholder base, the students, staff, and faculty. And so PTTS members make sense of the change that is taking place to them and around them in different ways. PTTS has more change to come, but as the interim director stated, they seem to be dawning."

The researcher interviewed 40 participants from 36 multinational companies in China. The findings revealed that the characteristics of Chinese culture, such as family orientation, relational orientation (role formalization, relational interdependence, face, favor, relational harmony, relational fatalism, and relational determination) influenced significantly on multinational companies¡¦ relationship cultivation strategies. Multinational companies from the Western countries, however, to be more persistent in their own cultural values than multinational companies from Asian countries in relationship building. In addition, the research also found that the cultivation strategies of positivity and sharing of tasks were used in achieving all the relationship qualities (trust, control mutuality, commitment, and satisfaction) in the Chinese context. Qualitative evaluation criteria for this study are also discussed in this paper."

The results from a survey of 188 Internet café users in the countrys capital city, Kampala, suggest that while initiatives such as cyber cafés have brought the Internet and ICT closer to more people in developing countries, the bad news is that these initiatives, especially when they are commercially based, may serve to increase the digital divide within poor countries."
2003-0203,'Dangerous Fiction': Race and Reception of NBC's _King_,Paper,'Dangerous Fiction': Race and Reception of NBC's _King_,"Encouraged by the phenomenal success of Roots just one year earlier, critics and television executives expected _King_, NBCs 1978 miniseries on Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement, to be a hit. However, King immediately became known as a ratings disaster. The miniseries and its failure in the ratings got a lot of coverage in the press. Black and white critics considered the miniseries was to be problematic, but while mainstream press was generally positive about King, the black press pilloried it. This paper uses Foucault's concept of a ""regime of truth"" to evaluate how the accuracy of _King_ was debated in the mainstream and black presses: journalists in the mainstream press tended to articulate _King_s inaccuracy with the pitfalls of the docudrama genre, but journalists in the black press focused on the inaccuracy of the portrayal of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement. None of the journalists in the mainstream press questioned the validity of this representation of King, and likewise, there was no debate in the black press about the docudrama genre."

The model proposed focuses on the collaborative nature of close relationships and attempts to highlight two adaptive mechanisms important in creating non-zero sum outcomes among highly interdependent parties. First, our model emphasizes the importance of reciprocity in creating mutually beneficial outcomes through games of exchange (i.e., resource exchange). Additionally, we articulate how the preference for similarity would have been useful when creating non-zero sum rewards through games of coordination. In particular, we focus on the unique role that shared interests and mutual knowledge play when individuals attempt to pursue common goals through joint activity. The implications of our model are discussed with respect to a host of relational issues ranging from uncertainty reduction to satisfaction and commitment."

The power of computers is that they can analyze mountains of data very quickly. The time-saving characteristics of computers have become so popular Neuendorf said its rare to find a text content analysis today that does not use computer analysis. Computers are at their best in content analysis if the study is limited to textual messages. But when the project involves more than just a word count, the computer programs become trickier to use. Researchers have to make hard decisions on finding ways to help the computer code and analyze the content relative to the project at hand. In most cases, theres no way to know how the results would differ in a content analysis project between a computer-assisted program and more traditional human coding and analysis. The researchers usually only use either computers or human coders. This project is a unique opportunity to compare human versus computer coding and analysis using the same set of data and with the same research questions in mind. In this methodological case study, the focus is on the similarities and differences in both process and results in a content analysis project."

While some view Easter eggs, which have long been celebrated by programmers and fans, as amusing diversions which are ultimately frivolous and wasteful, this paper proposes that Easter eggs should be examined as a cultural phenomenon, relevant to todays debates on the concept of authorship in digital media, programming and its relationship to commercial culture, and questions of virtual community. While Easter eggs are not as provocative or influential as other technocratic guerrilla tactics, such as viruses or hacking, this paper positions Easter eggs as a way for both programmers and consumers of the Easter eggs to make do with the materials which surround them in their daily life, to carve out a space for themselves where there is seemingly no possibility for such a space to exist."

As breast cancer risks increase with age, older women constitute a particularly vulnerable group. As the primary source of health information for the public, mass media assume a vital role in fostering breast cancer awareness and knowledge.

Applying the knowledge gap hypothesis to the health domain, this study assessed the level of media publicity on breast cancer and evaluated older women¡¯s knowledge on this issue and its relationship with: education, perceived risk and mammography experience. The net influence of each of these competing variables on knowledge outcomes was also weighed and their interaction effects tested by the study.

Data from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to test the hypothesized knowledge gaps while a separate content analysis was conducted to measure the media environment of breast cancer during the period under study.

Secondary analysis found significant knowledge gaps among older women based on all education and motivational variables, but no interaction effects were supported. Interpretations, guidance to future studies and policy implications were discussed."

This study examined this issue by focusing on the demand/withdraw pattern of conflict, which involves one person nagging or criticizing while the other person avoids the topic. A sample of 57 parent-adolescent dyads completed a study that included both self-reports of demand/withdraw and outside ratings of the extent to which the dyad engaged in demand/withdraw during audiotaped conversations. The topics of the conversations included issues important to the parent, issues important to the adolescent, and alcohol and drug use among teenagers. As expected, frequent demand/withdraw was associated with low relational satisfaction, low self-esteem, and high alcohol and drug use for both adolescents and parents. These findings are consistent with the notion that demand/withdraw between parents and adolescents tends to be associated with particularly destructive conflicts that have both indirect health implications (e.g., because low self-esteem is associated with health risk behaviors) and direct health implications (e.g., due to the potential for substance abuse). The results also suggest that to prevent the more common pattern of parent-demand/adolescent-withdraw, it may be important for parents to be responsive (i.e., not withdraw) when adolescents want to discuss an issue, even if the issue is not particularly salient to the parents."

This paper considers the perspectives of callers to a political talk show  Election Call  in terms of why they call in, what they think about their interactions with politicians and how they regard the programmes potential to constitute a public sphere. It also looks at the gendered aspects of caller experiences and beliefs in order to tease out if gender has any influence on the publics practice of politics. The programme  Election Call  is a BBC production which has been broadcasting since 1974, going out simultaneously on radio and TV (and the web for 2001), in the days immediately preceding the British general election. I argue that whilst callers mostly felt very positive about the experience of appearing on the show and having the opportunity to put their point of view, and believed that Election Call fulfilled an important democratic function, they were much more negative in their assessment of their interactions with politicians, believing that it continues to be difficult to get a straight answer out of our elected members."

Using the example of adolescents regular marijuana use two types of demographic diversity effects are identified. First, diversity risk effects refer to relationships between demographic variables and determinants of regular marijuana use. Analyses of these effects showed that older adolescents are at higher risk than younger adolescents, suggesting stratification by age. Second, diversity message effects refer to the influence of demographic variables on both the perception of anti-drug messages and the potency of those messages in changing determinants of regular marijuana use. In this sample, female adolescents perceived a set of anti-drug ads as more effective than male adolescents. In general, the analyses illustrate a systematic and theory-based examination of the implications of demographic diversity for effective health message design."

Depression is now a household term, and a viable market of recovery products, particularly psychopharmaceutical drugs, has thus arisen that normalizes not only the diagnosis but new self-help practices. A depression ""script"" shared by scientists, psychiatrists, state policy discourse and advocacy groups has been launched, informing consumers that major depression is a tangible risk, that certain groups (women, children and seniors) are more at risk, and that early detection is necessary to fend off slippage from symptom to major mental disorder. This paper addresses how consumer mental health advocacy groups participate in the promotion of depression diagnoses and the impact of this promotion. The paper analyzes how the discourses of groups including the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and National Mental Health Consumers Self-help Clearing House (NMHCA), among others, promote depression and how these discourses intersect with and diverge from State, pharmaceutical and science discourses. The paper suggests that the consumer advocacy discourse encourages self-scrutiny and the scrutiny of others mundane behaviors. More, this increasing attention to our own behaviors causes individuals to self-govern, thereby encouraging a society that circumscribes and restrains potentially deviant moods or behaviors, and constrains free human behavior."

The paper is based on an ethnographic inquiry into an intervention program in India to change the socio-economic status of devadasis in Belgaum District of Karnataka State in South India. The paper focuses on how devadasis negotiate the power relations of which they are targeted subjects and what opportunities are available for resistance.

College students understood the abstract program messages about the duality of human existence (i.e., we have both good and evil qualities) better than high school students. Compassion and conscience were associated with the selection of a superhero as a role model. High school students and males were more likely to choose revenge as a viable response to intentional aggression. The results suggest that with maturity comes an understanding of the duality of human nature, and that the qualities of heroes that make them worthy of emulation involve prosocial, not antisocial, characteristics."

Findings of experiment one demonstrate that subjects who differ in their self-ratings on masculinity and femininity develop ad attitudes only on the basis of ad-self-congruency on the dimensions that well describe themselves. In addition, the more masculine subjects are, the more they rely on product beliefs in developing brand evaluations. Moreover, the relative effectiveness of ad-self-congruency concerning masculinity or femininity in determining ad attitudes has been shown to vary as a function of product types. Results of experiment one also indicate that quality-oriented ad appeals are more effective for a masculine product than for a feminine product. Experiment two explores the influence of context-induced affective states on the accessibility of the self-concepts regarding masculinity and femininity. Results provide evidence that ad-self-congruency pertinent to masculinity predicts ad attitudes when subjects are in positive affective states, whereas ad-self-congruency pertinent to femininity predicts ad attitudes when subjects are in negative affective states."

ABSTRACT

In this study we examined the dialectic between community and fragmentation in two settings that attempt to organize the poor for social change. In the Friday Night Community Suppers there were powerful examples of community. People who participate in this weekly event care deeply about one another and attempt to offer a helping hand whenever they can. There are also instances of fragmentation; however. For example, people experience both forces of the dialectic in a dynamic tension by feeling connected at the Supper but feeling disconnected upon realizing they will return home to an isolated environment. In the soup kitchens we investigated the forces of fragmentation were most compelling. Inhuman treatment by workers, violence among the homeless, and the promotion of degradation prevented most meaningful attempts at community building. Although these forces were dominant, opportunities for community existed alongside fragmentation sustaining the dialectic between the two forces. In some instances volunteers offered consolation and support to the homeless. In other instances the poor themselves provided confirmation and fellowship to others in need. Transcending the dialectic of community and fragmentation is a great challenge and not always possible. However, through the continued building of community even the most damaged people can be offered hope."

With reference to specific case studies, I investigate three areas where new communication technologies allow and/or obstruct diasporic participation and inclusion in transnational communities. I seek a broad and contextualised understanding of how media and ICTs become tools for empowerment, while allowing diasporic communities to negotiate their belonging in the nation-state of their settlement, the nation-state where they came from and Europe. Many of these diasporic groups use the Internet in an attempt to create a virtual space for empowerment, for self-representation, for recognition and for participation in communities surpassing geographical limits and boundaries. In their diasporic virtual presence, new dynamics of communication and belonging emerge. These challenge the conditions of diasporic communities exclusion from real spaces and allow them to actively negotiate their positioning within communities  virtual and real."
2003-0219,Differences in Perceptions of Organizational Mission: An Extension and Empirical Test of Unified Diversity,Paper,Differences in Perceptions of Organizational Mission: An Extension and Empirical Test of Unified Diversity,"Organizations have been characterized as interpretive systems (Putnam & Pacanowsky, 1983), where members of different groups of employees may have different interpretations of critical organizational artifacts; this study focuses on employees' interpretations of organizational mission. Organizations must negotiate the following paradox: too much clarity and consensus about interpretations of key organizational artifacts (e.g. mission) may alienate some group members and limit innovation, while too little may cause coordination problems. The principle of unified diversity (Eisenberg, 1984) has been argued as a means through which organizations negotiate this paradox. In its current conceptualization, unified diversity argues that employees think they have similar interpretations to others in the organization, even though they do not. Thus, it does not apply where employees are aware of differences. This paper begins by arguing that the principle of unified diversity may be fruitfully extended to such situations by introducing the concept of recognized unified diversity. This concept argues that employees' are often aware of differences in interpretations, but recognize the importance of these different missions. It is only is cases of scarce resources or controversy that systematic differences concerning the importance different missions emerge. The second part of this paper empirically tests hypotheses deduced from the recognized unified diversity argument. Results show that employees tend to perceive all missions as being important. Additionally, when employees are asked the most important mission or are dealing with controversial issues, systematic differences emerge."
2003-0220,Different Strokes for Different Folks: An Empirical Search for Different Modes of Viewer-Character Relationships,Paper,Different Strokes for Different Folks: An Empirical Search for Different Modes of Viewer-Character Relationships,"The importance of audience members' feelings toward characters and the relationships formed between viewers and characters has long been established. However, these relationships have only recently received the necessary conceptual attention. The present research is designed to test the claim that like social relationships, viewer-character relationships come in more than one form. Two studies examine possible differences between identification, parasocial interaction and imitation, three of the most commonly used terms to describe how viewers relate to television characters. Results show that the three relationships are related to different viewing motives, involvement and reactions to viewing. Furthermore, significant differences in the intensity of these three relationships were found when viewers were asked to choose a character with which they identified or with who they felt friends or whom they wanted to imitate. It is suggested that a more precise understanding of these various types of relationships should help understand the functions they perform for viewers and their role in reception and media effects."
2003-0221,Diffusion in the Borderland: A Study of the Implementation of Broadband Connectivity in an Ecological Reserve,Paper,Diffusion in the Borderland: A Study of the Implementation of Broadband Connectivity in an Ecological Reserve,"This study investigates the communication and diffusion of a broadband telecommunications infrastructure (the High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network - HPWREN). Recently deployed sensors and cameras allow researchers at wildlife reserves throughout the world to conduct studies and receive sensor and camera data via the Internet. Based on Rogers (1995) diffusion of innovations theoretical framework, field researchers perceptions of network connectivity, communication channels, and use of the network were assessed. Results supported eight of nine hypotheses related to network attributes (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity), communication channels, and network use. Regression analysis of diffusion communication supported the importance of relative advantage and complexity but not perceived compatibility. Regression analysis of all variables, with adoption as the dependent variable, showed perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, and diffusion communication all significantly predict HPWREN adoption. Results are discussed in terms of the vital role played by communication during the innovation development, implementation, and use stages."
2003-0222,Diffusion of Clean Indoor Air Ordinances in the Southwestern United States,Paper,Diffusion of Clean Indoor Air Ordinances in the Southwestern United States,"The present paper investigates the process through which Clean Indoor Air Ordinances were enacted in ten communities in the Southwestern United States, and the key factors that influence the ordinances diffusion and adoption. Clean Indoor Air Ordinances, which ban smoking in public places, have recently experienced a rapid rate of adoption in the United States. Case studies were conducted of 10 communities in New Mexico and Western Texas (Las Cruces, Doña Ana County, Deming, Silver City, Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Santa Fe, Mesilla, in New Mexico; Lubbock, and El Paso, Texas) utilizing face-to-face, email, and telephone interviews. The personal experiences of policy champions, framing of clean indoor air ordinance as a public health versus an economic or an individual rights issue, and strong interpersonal networks with other cities were all influential factors in the adoption or rejection of Clean Indoor Air Ordinances."
2003-0223,Digital divide in Brazil: Origins and social consequences,Paper,Digital divide in Brazil: Origins and social consequences,"This paper analyzes the roots of the divide that now exists in Brazil between those who have the resources and ability to use the Internet and its related technologies, and those who dont. This chasm, termed the digital divide, has been a matter of concern in developed countries such as the United States. Developing countries, such as Brazil, which have experienced tremendous growth during the last half of the twentieth century, have only recently begun to investigate this disparity.
The origins of the divide in Brazil are closely tied to the erratic development and deployment of communication technologies like basic telephone service, and policies favoring the southern regions of the country. These economic developments have lead to a clear technological divide along racial, economic and regional lines. Data demonstrating the divide along these lines are presented, along with information on governmental, civic and non-profit movements targeting the digital gap."

The research reported here examines differences in access levels and currency (e.g., having the latest version of the technology) for five communication technologies relevant to the workplace: email, voicemail, mobile phones, fax, and videoconferencing. In doing so, we have drawn on research examining the Digital Divide more generally and applied an organizational justice/fairness framework to help describe differences both within and between organizations. Survey questionnaires from 137 respondents from a diverse set of organizations reveals the existence of various communication technology divides especially within, but also between, organizations. Although these divides were largely unrelated to fairness outcomes, the differences in access and currency did vary depending on the communication technology being examined."
2003-0225,Digital Television Initiatives:Experiences from the United Kingdom and the United States of America,Paper,Digital Television Initiatives:Experiences from the United Kingdom and the United States of America,"Along with the digitization of communication, two major television industries in the world  the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA), have introduced policies to negotiate the digitization of their traditional analogue television systems. In the midst of their transformation, digital television (DTV) diffusion and reception has been dramatically different so far. Furthermore, DTV deployment has resulted in the arising of potentially problematic issues. Strategic initiatives have been implemented by the UK and the USA to counter these forces, for a long term viability of DTV in their domestic markets, and also to be the world leader in the digitization of television.
This is a comparative study on the deployment of DTV in the UK and the USA. The analysis shows that first, the television industry in the UK is more conducive in the digitization of television. Second, the strategies adopted by the UK are more focused on multi-level collaboration that is crucial to the long term viability of DTV in their domestic market."
2003-0226,Digital Unity and Digital Divide: Assessing the Impact of a Campus Laptop Initiative,Paper,Digital Unity and Digital Divide: Assessing the Impact of a Campus Laptop Initiative,"This research study assesses the impact of an information technology initiative on students at Grove City College. A random sample of alumni from the classes of 1997, 1998, and 2000 were surveyed to gauge their attitudes about a technology program instituted in 1994, which provided laptop computers to all incoming freshman. The authors adopt a strategy of framing their research questions in terms of the laptop program being an attempt to create digital unity on campus as an antidote to the threat of a digital divide. In addition to demonstrating a positive change in attitudes after the program was initiated, the study considers how this experience affected the alumnis computing in the workplace after graduation and reveals relationships between the frequency of use of various computer applications and the alumnis field of study at the college."

A Survey of Children's Fear Reactions to Violence in Fiction and News,"Rather than assessing childrens fear reactions to television violence in general, the present study differentiated between (a) childrens direct frights and worries and (b) reactions to violent fictional and news content. Results of a paper-and-pencil survey administered to 572 8- to 12-year-olds showed that violent news content induced more fear reactions than violent fiction and that these reactions predominantly consisted of worrisome thoughts. Furthermore, interactions between age and type of fear reaction and between gender and television genre were found and viewing frequency was found to be negatively related to immediate fright and worry. Results are discussed in light of the existing literature on childrens media-induced and real-life fears."

The author takes the Communication Infrastructure approach towards telecommunications, i.e. an ecological conceptualization of communication technologies as embedded in a storytelling system consisting of telecom providers, government entities, local residents, and mass media, all situated in a communication action context. A historical overview from 1978 to 2002 is provided. Then, drawn from intensive multi-method fieldwork, components of the regional telecommunications infrastructure are identified; and their interactions contextualized. Four generic types of disconnections (temporal-spatial breaks, stratificational gaps, institutional blockades, and social psychological dismissals) are proposed, leading to a more full-fledged discussion of (dis)connectedness dynamics, in which the system of telecom technologies is construed as a prism for the examination of the regional social ecology at large."

This study explores maternity leave discourses and practices as experienced by 21 pink-collar workers. Through standpoint and grounded theory approaches, three interrelated themes emerged: standardization of maternity leaves; strategic control; and maternity as disability. Combined with the real economic and material conditions of pink-collar workers lives, these themes served to silence workers abilities to negotiate maternity leaves."
2003-0230,Discursive Ideological Tactics of Serbs and Albanians in Conflict,Paper,Discursive Ideological Tactics of Serbs and Albanians in Conflict,"The conflict between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo has today become a complex problem wherein two neighboring Balkan peoples are weighted down with antagonisms, which have been accumulating over the past three hundred years. Their conflict has deep civilizational, historical, sociological, ethno-psychological and demographic roots and cannot simply be reduced to the political and legal constitutional status and boundaries of Kosovo. Instead, the conflict has to be examined in terms of the fundamental issues of culture, ethnic identity, and ideology, which are reflected in language, discourse and communication. This study examined inter-group and intra-group discourse, using discourse analysis as the method of uncovering the discursive mechanisms employed by the parties in perpetuating their respective ideologies of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation, with the ultimate goal of rationalizing and perpetuating the conflict."
2003-0231,Disovering and Interpreting Cultural Meanings in International English,Paper,Disovering and Interpreting Cultural Meanings in International English,"This article focuses on the importance of integrating Competence in the Discovery and Interpretation of Meaning (CDIM) into learning and using English as an international language. Non-native and native speakers of English are often unaware of the extent to which cultural assumptions are embedded in their use and interpretation of English, whether communicating with native or other non-native speakers. This article explores this dynamic in the language learning of Finnish students as they respond to the speech of native (Americans) and non-native (Austrian) speakers of English. The analyses show 1) how there are implicit meanings in culturally salient concepts such as the English terms ""shy"" and ""equality,"" 2) how the various meanings for these terms create multiple third spaces (MTS) within English, between different cultural spheres of coherence, and 3) how these MTS are
full of potential problems in interpretation since the English terms carry different meanings in Finnish English, in Austrian English, and in (US)American English. Integration of CDIM into language learning emphasizes the importance of moving back and forth between versions of English and the different cultural practices on which these are based. This approach helps students develop appropriate strategies for communicating and interpreting meanings in that language."
2003-0232,"Distance Education as a Discursive Practice: Voice, Discourse and Pedagogy",Paper,"Distance Education as a Discursive Practice: Voice, Discourse and Pedagogy","Distance education has taken on a new shape with the introduction of new digital technologies that have made the process of interaction between the teacher and student a far more vibrant process. This change, and the fact that distance education often takes place with the use of text-based systems, leads to the re-thinking of the distance education classroom as a discursive space where the voices of the teachers and students take on unique qualities. Using the construct of voice this paper argues that the role of the teacher and the student is constantly changing as multiple voices can be heard in the discursive pedagogic space of distance education."
2003-0233,Dividing Line,Paper,Dividing Line,"The following study sought to collate and analyze portrayals of the Texas-Mexico Border region told through newspaper stories, establishing benchmark descriptive data for further research in the process. Using a sample of nearly 700 newspaper articles from several geographic areas covering three years (1991, 1997 and 2001), the researchers looked at several aspects of coverage, including tone, length, sources, and use of stereotypical or emotional words.
The beginning hypothesis was that the farther the newspaper from the Texas border, the more cursory, stereotypical and conflict-heavy the stories would be. Taking the news value concept of proximitymost effectively rendered by the axiom, ""1,000 dead in Bangladesh equals 100 dead in London, 10 dead in New York and one dead in your American city""the study set out to illustrate it using a content analysis of news stories plus a qualitative discussion and discussion of the values behind news and behind building/maintaining/changing cultural identities as well.
The border region, in particular, has suffered greatly from surface, usually melodramatic portrayals (Martinez 1998). As an area traditionally behind the curve in terms of both state and national funding, and one which has been torn between identification with Mexico and the United States, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas can be said to have suffered from a double marginality, whereby it has been isolated from centers of both government power and mainstream news coverage. Neither fish nor fowl, the border region, especially the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, has been a consistent second-class citizen, according to many researchers (Martinez 1998, Weber 1988, Miller 1980)."
2003-0234,Does Discussing Politics Contribute to Political Tolerance?,Paper,Does Discussing Politics Contribute to Political Tolerance?,"Discussing politics for many people is a daily event. Personal interactions seem to influence individuals¡¦ attitudes and behavior. Does the role of interpersonal discussion on politics certainly have an impact on our attitudes toward political issues? This paper is to answer this question by looking into the relationship between discussing politics with weak tie discussants, e.g. friends and coworkers, and the expression of political tolerance, which is an important orientation of democracy and social pluralism.
Based on the survey data of 2000 American National Election Research in the presidential election season, the results of logistic regression analysis show that the impact of political discussion and the impact of weak-tie networks on both general moral tolerance and specific tolerance toward homosexual groups are not as significant as expected.
Nevertheless, missing values of survey data can decrease the significance of relationships between variables. In the second part of the paper, the author further compares the original results derived from ANES dataset from that derived from same dataset but with the problem of missing values fixed. Finding that missing values in this case did cause different results, the author concludes that the impact of interpersonal political discussion needs more examination."

A 3 (KOR: success, fail, and control conditions) X 3 (AL: disagreeing, agreeing, and neutral groups) experiment was conducted in the context of controversial websites that protest against mainstream conservative news media. Results revealed contingency effects of AL in the relationship between KOR, TP, and its behavioral intentions. For those who agreed with the claims in the controversial website, when they were told that the controversial websites successfully gained public support (i.e., perceived majority status), they were more likely to indicate intentions for online and offline actions and less likely to display reverse third-first perceptions about the controversial websites. However, this is not the case for those who disagreed with the websites. These implications were discussed."
2003-0236,Does Television Promote Materialism? Cultivating the Desire for the Good Life,Paper,Does Television Promote Materialism? Cultivating the Desire for the Good Life,"The relationship between television viewing and materialism was examined. The results of a national mail survey indicated that an individuals level of television viewing was positively related to their level of materialism. However, this relation was moderated by both need for cognition and attention while viewing. Television viewing was also negatively related to life satisfaction and this relation was partially mediated by materialism. The main effects are discussed in terms of their implications for cultivation theory and the mediating and moderating effects are discussed in terms of their implications for causality."

How mothers and adult children talk about menopause,"While the majority of menopausal research focuses on understanding a woman's transition (i.e., medical needs, negative experiences, and physician communication), little research exists for how these experiences are communicated to young adult children. This paper seeks to better articulate the willingness to talk about the topic, conversational competence, and attitudes that midlife mothers and their adult children use to discuss the menopausal period. In addition, important ties can be demonstrated between mother communication about teen sexual health and menopausal communication."

The Changing Role of the Media and Party Activity in U.S. Presidential Elections,"Changes in the nature of political campaigns are considered to be one of the primary factors contributing to the decline in turnout since the 1960s. Political parties are assumed to be less effective in mobilizing voters, candidates are assumed to be less appealing, and media coverage has been viewed as having a demobilizing effect on the electorate. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of campaigns in mobilizing voters in presidential elections over time. Using data from 1972 to 2000, we find that there has been a resurgence of party mobilization since 1992 and that the effectiveness of party contacting has increased somewhat over time. Other factors, such as media coverage and polarized opinions about the candidates appear to stimulate rather than deter voters."

The term dot.com refers to companies that use the Internet as their primary or only marketplace to sell goods and services. What was it about this new way of doing business that led to unprecedented behavior in the business community? Why were decades of experience and knowledge of successful business strategies so quickly tossed aside by people driven to become part of the dot.com action? Data analyzed were all articles in the Wall Street Journal from October 1, 1998 through September 30, 2001 that referenced dot.coms in the headline or lead. Ninety-two concepts emerged in open coding of 520 articles; ten thematic categories were identified in axial coding. Selective coding revealed three themes: Conflicted, Angst, and Making Sense of It."

Assumptions in and Extentions of Uses and Gratifications,"Theoretically and empirically, the uses and gratifications tradition assumes that we have access to our viewing motives. In a series of two studies, we sought to examine if we have access to our motivations for media use and whether confidence in accessing our media use motivations varies across three types of media: television, movies and the Internet. In study one, participants responded to the uses and gratifications scale for television use in general, for their gratifications sought and obtained from specific television programs, and for their favorite movie. In study 2, participants were randomly assigned to keep media use diaries for either television or movie viewing or use of the Internet. In general, we found that participants do feel confident about their ability to access their media use motives but that confidence varies by media use activity. Specifically, participants were more certain of their reasons for watching a favorite movie or a specific program than they were of their reasons for watching television in general. They were also significantly more aware of their motives for using the Internet than for watching television. Lastly, we found ritualized and instrumental viewers differed in how certain they felt about their viewing motives. Implications for uses and gratifications research and method are discussed."

The underlying questions driving this research were whether Central European countries take advantage of the Internet to compensate for the imbalance of information flow in international media, and how they do so. National presentation Web sites of the seven Central European countries were examined in order to understand what self-presentation strategies they use to introduce their countries to the world. One of the main findings of the study was that while contouring their own virtual borderlands, Central European countries attempted to erase the shadow of another invisible borderland, the Iron Curtain.

Unlike previous research, this study used the theme as a unit of analysis and looked at emphases and functions of Democratic and Republican issues in TV spots across the elections. The results provide evidence that overall, presidential candidates addressed more of their party¡¯s issues in their TV spots. But Democrats emphasized particularly welfare/health care issue, whereas Republicans especially stressed inflation/interest rates among their issues. This study also revealed that there are exceptions of issue ownership from election to election. Across the elections, Republicans have been more consistent in addressing their own issues than have Democrats. Democrats used their issues more than Republican issues both for acclaims and attacks. Republicans used more Democratic issues than their issues for acclaims but relied heavily more on their own issues for attacks."

The paper examined how East Asian media and cultural studies have approached the uneven and yet intricately connected historical formation of multiple modernities at cultural, socio-economic and political levels. The paper explored how East Asian media and cultural studies have framed their methodological and theoretical concerns in the context of rapid state-led socio-political transformation, de-traditionalization, and globalization. The first section looked back over the trajectories of the formative process of East Asian Media and Cultural Studies. In it the study inspected how East Asian MCS identify the formation of East Asian modernities in terms of the formation of cultural identities mediated by the media industries in the era of globalization."

When generating more evidence feels difficult to readers, a messages content may seem less credible; consequently, the message is less persuasive. Memory studies provide empirical support for the impact of subjective experience on memory evaluations. In our study, the relationship weakly generalized to message processing. Sometimes, generating more evidence was subjectively easier and therefore more persuasive. Completing a more difficult processing task was associated with participants intentions and actions to seek more information about a messages topic."

Hence, their resistance is never a ""rebel without a cause"". New queer adolescence films of the 1990s and early 2000 show a positive attitude in their representation of same-sex attraction, romance, intercourse, difficulties and confrontations with homophobia in the adolescent's family, school, neighborhood, and community. This article focuses on the controversial politics of the queer body, the eroticization of physical inequality, and the melodramatic coming-out of agonized protagonists in Beautiful Thing (Hettie MacDonald, UK 1995), Edge of Seventeen (David Moreton, USA 1998), Get Real (Simon Shore, UK / South Africa 1998), The Truth about Jane (Lee Rose, USA 2000), and Francois Ozon's Une Robe d'Ete (A Summer Dress, France 1996)."

An experimental study (a post-test only group), evaluating three variations of computer text formats, was conducted in which two hundred one college students participated. A new hybrid hypertext, expanding hypertext, was introduced and investigated in this study. The participants liked the paged hypertext best, the expanding hypertext second, and the scorlling text third. The participants adventurousness exhibited an interaction with the text formats on the participants disorientation."

Although e-mail ads are found to generate more interactions from consumers than banner ads, only few studies have examined the effectiveness of e-mail ads. Besides, current concerns on unsolicited e-mails (i.e., spam mails) pose a threat, as many of the messages are being avoided and deleted before even being opened. The current study focused on the subscription status of Korean consumers (i.e., opt-in mails vs. spam mails), different types of the title of the e-mails, and the consumers¡¯ need for cognition. The results have found significant impacts of message types and subscription status on the consumer¡¯s attitude toward the ad and intention to click, whereas need for cognition was not found to be related to the intention to click."

Perceptions of the ideal female body shape moved toward a heavier ideal after exposure to plus-size models in comparison to exposure to thin models. This effect was significant for both men and women. In a follow-up experiment, an elastic body image effect was found in the plus-models condition, but not the thin-models condition. Women who saw plus-size models rated their actual body shapes to be slightly heavier than their pre-exposure estimations. However, no significant shifts were observed among women who saw thin models. Various social judgment biases were identified. Most notably, women tend to overestimate mens preference for thinness. Men, on the other hand, present conflicting data. Compared to women, men preferred a heavier female ideal. On the other hand, men also found thin models to be more attractive than plus-size models. These findings are examined within the context of social comparisons and social judgment biases."

In this study, we investigated the effects of sex and neurological hemispheric dominance on the ability to decode facial expressions of emotion accurately. On the basis of a battery of measures assessing handedness, familial sinistrality, and immune disorders, we classified participants as having standard, anomalous, or mixed hemispheric dominance. Consistent with previous studies, we found that hemispheric dominance and sex interacted to influence participants abilities to decode facial affect displays from photographs. Specifically, mixed dominant females had the highest accuracy in the decoding of facial emotion, whereas mixed dominant males had the lowest accuracy. We discuss these findings within the context of communibiology and comment on their implications for the study of neurology and social behavior."

While it found no evidence to support the CNN effect, a hypothesis that claims global television now determines policy, it does present evidence and analysis of other significant effects on various phases and dimensions of policymaking. This study also suggests that global news coverage has created political, professional, and ethical dilemmas for the three major groups of participants in policymaking: politicians, officials, and journalists.

A total of 216 participants disclosed an emotionally upsetting event to a confederate trained to display different levels of nonverbal immediacy and verbal person centeredness. Men and women responded very similarly to comforting messages that exhibited different levels of verbal person centeredness and nonverbal immediacy, and this response similarity was not moderated by the sex of the helper. Both men and women were most comforted by messages that exhibited high levels of person centeredness and nonverbal immediacy, and they were least comforted by messages that exhibited low levels of these qualities. Moreover, both sexes viewed highly person-centered and immediate messages as exhibiting the highest comforting quality, and, with one minor exception, both sexes viewed helpers who used these messages as the most competent."

This paper expands this line of research by introducing the theoretical concepts of social comparison, by taking the study into a different culture, rather than in the US culture where body image has special personal and social significance, by focusing also on male¡¯s response to idealized models, and by initiating research on cross-sex comparison. Data suggested Chinese male participants experienced an assimilation effect rather than a contrast effect and that place of origin and the different mentality toward body image also played a role in participants¡¯ perception. Results indicated that the detrimental effects of ideal models in the media might not replicate in other cultures where body image is less important."

Subjects (N = 112; 53 parents; 59 adolescents) participated in a study that investigated adolescent-parent interactions. Investigation of parental attachment style, expectation of conflict during adolescence, and separation anxiety as related to family conflict did not reveal any significant association. Adolescent perceptions of parental attachment were also investigated and found to be significant predictors of family conflict. Self-report scales and questionnaires were used to measure and analyze these aspects of the family and individual. Several limitations, which may provide an explanation for the weak results of this study, are identified."

In Experiment 1, a 2 (inter-group vs. interpersonal) x 2 (same character vs. different character) between-subjects design experiment, each participant made a decision about social dilemmas after seeing two other (ostensible) participants unanimous opinions and then exchanged supporting arguments. Consistent with the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects, when the group level of self-identity was rendered salient in an inter-group encounter, uniform virtual appearance of CMC partners triggered deindividuation and subsequent conformity behavior. By contrast, when the personal self-identity was salient, standardized representation tended to reduce conformity. Experiment 2 replicated the effect of visual representation on deindividuation and conformity and furthermore, investigated the causal links between deindividuation, group identification, and conformity. The results suggest that deindividuation accentuated adherence to group norms, both directly and indirectly via group identification."
2003-0256,"Effects of Target, Topic, and Time on Disclosure in an Online Breast Cancer Support Group",Paper,"Effects of Target, Topic, and Time on Disclosure in an Online Breast Cancer Support Group","For participants in an asynchronous online breast cancer support group (n=82), two months of messages were sampled and coded for target, general disclosure, and four disclosure attributes: ego-relevance, positive and negative affect, and cancer topic. A subset of messages was coded for social support.
While general disclosure declined between months 1 and 2, emotional support increased. These changes were associated with a shift in primary message target from the group to individuals, suggesting that group participation addressed different needs over time.
Contrary to typical expectations during relationship development, disclosure attributes did not increase over time. In addition, attributes were higher in messages to the group rather than to individuals, suggesting a possible therapeutic role for group messages. Disclosure ego-relevance, positive affect, and negative affect were limited to messages about cancer, suggesting a high specific utility of the group to its users. Women who dropped out may have either had a lesser need to disclose or may have chosen an ineffective disclosure strategy."

In this study we investigate two ways users can acquire personally relevant health information, through (1) user control, where the user of a computer-based medium such as the Internet can link to information that appears to be personally relevant, and (2) perceived message tailoring, where the computer system seems to select and present relevant information on the basis of the user's previous responses. The study draws from theories of information processing and attitude change, human-computer interaction, and interpersonal communication. It finds that user control and perceived message tailoring--two features we consider to be components of the broader concept of interactivity--can increase the likelihood that users will consider web-delivered information to be desirable, high quality, and informative. Potential benefits and drawbacks of these approaches are discussed."

Separating their effects on how anonymous individuals perceive themselves to be is a relevant issue that has not been sufficiently explored. This paper explores whether, controlling for source anonymity, visual anonymity has significant effects on how anonymous individuals perceive themselves to be. Additionally, it is suggested that public self-awareness mediates the relationship between visual cues and perception of self-anonymity by individuals. Findings indicate that the relationship between visual cues and perception of self-anonymity is not significant once source anonymity is controlled. Further, findings also suggest that public self-awareness has a strong relationship with perceptions of self-anonymity. Further, other factors such as cognitive effort are found to be related to public self-awareness. The implications of such results are that future studies should focus on perceptions of anonymity as much as on the researchers manipulations of anonymity. Further, public self-awareness is strongly related to perceptions of self-anonymity. Public self-awareness is also related to other factors besides visual cues and manipulations of anonymity. For this reason, these other factors such as cognitive effort should be incorporated when studying perceptions of anonymity in groups."
2003-0259,El Dia de los Muertos American-style: Communicating with the Living,Paper,El Dia de los Muertos American-style: Communicating with the Living,"To remember the dead is to remember how and why they died. Drawing on the work of EP Thompson and others, this paper will analyze American-style public celebrations of Day of the Dead as a form of moral economy through which US Latinos use their cultural resources to protest social, economic and political oppression faced by the community. Politicized Day of the Dead rituals are grounded in moral claims about the proper social and economic functions of various parties as well as appeals to authorities to attend to the common weal.

While creating ancestor altars or decorating gravemarkers are usually private, family-oriented rituals in Latin America, they become performative in the US - designed to communicate messages to the living rather than the dead. The drama and spectacle of Day of the Dead rituals, which are advertised in US newspapers, radio and the Internet, attract sizeable audiences and media coverage in a way that ordinary political work does not. This is particularly important given the chronic under-representation of Latinos and Latino concerns in the mainstream media.

Focusing on a 2001 cemetary event in Holtville, California, where the cadavers of some 200 unidentified migrants found along the US/Mexican border are interred, and altars/vigils created in Southern California to honor victims of environmental hazards, drugs and gang violence, I examine how contemporary Day of the Dead rituals dramatize local problems to invoke discourses around national and global concerns."

Emotional effects of advertising on children of lower socio-economic status
Introduction
Traditional hierarchy-of-effects models of advertising state that advertising exposure leads to cognitions, such as memory about the ad, the product and/or the brand; which in turn leads to attitudes, such as product liking and attitude toward possible purchase; which in the end leads to behaviors, such as buying the advertised product (Albion & Farris, 1981). One issue that has not been raised in this area of research is what happens to a consumer who is not able to carry out the desired behavior because of lack of economic resources. Research has suggested that people of lesser economic means are particularly harmed by constant media messages of consumerism because they have no way to relieve the created consumerist wants and desires (West, 1994). It is possible that the inability to pursue wants and desires evoked by ads for luxury products could lead to differential patterns of emotional cognitive responding during processing of an advertisement. This study investigates differences in emotional and cognitive responses as revealed through physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance, and facial EMG) for young college students of different socio-economic levels.

Advertising , materialism, and SES
One of the established effects of advertising is that it increases peoples' desires for consumer goods and promotes materialism. Some researchers, e.g., Galbraith (1967), even see advertising as ""relentless propaganda on behalf of goods in general."" Advertising, it is argued, stirs, or creates, desires and needs in people for more material goods. These needs are never completely satisfied, however, because, once a product is bought, a new one appears in the market to replace it, creating yet a new need (Galbraith, 1958). Thus, as Crisp (1987) argues, advertising overrides a consumer's autonomy of decision making in the creation of these desires, by offering an unshakable link between products and the fulfillment of desires for them.
A number of studies have investigated the association between advertising and materialism levels, but none has focused specifically on the role of socio-economic status as a potential intervening variable in that process. Nevertheless, the findings of previous research on advertising, materialism levels, and demographics are instructive in the formulation of a proposition to be tested in this research.
In general, materialism is defined as the idea that people gain personal satisfaction from owning objects (Yoon, 1995). Further, materialism is a consumer value characterized by possessiveness, non-generosity and envy (Belk, 1984, 1985), and by acquisition centrality, which means that material acquisition is crucial to one's life and success (Richins & Dawson, 1992). Materialism is also associated with other negative consequences, such as self-hatred and greed.
Robertson, et al. (1989) examined the effects of advertising exposure on the level of demand displayed by children of their parents. As television viewing (the operationalization of advertising exposure) increased, the number of product requests increased. Unfortunately, that study did not look at the possible interaction with demographic variables.
Yoon (1995) investigated the relationship between attitudes toward advertising in general and materialism beliefs among Caucasians and African Americans. The sample consisted of college students and adults from the same community (found through mall-intercepts). The results showed African Americans held more materialistic values and were more positive about advertising than Caucasians. The study did not explore the differential effects of socio-economic status specifically. Consequently, it is not possible to tell whether the African American sample was of a different socio-economic status compared to the Caucasian sample.
What happens when a person is not able to satisfy the needs instilled in a materialistic culture, partly by advertising? Do these needs ferment in a person, accumulating over time, forming higher levels of anxiety, tension and frustration? Or do consumers become desensitized, as the literature on other media messages, specifically television and movie violence, has suggested?

Study general proposition and specific hypotheses
Consumption is constrained by disposable income. As a general rule, consumers cannot purchase products if they have no money. Indeed, Quarles and Jeffries (1983) show that overall consumption levels are predicted best by disposable income, not by the amount of advertising to which one is exposed. The most critical question, as these authors suggest, is how people react ""when material expectations exceed economic ability"" (p. 13).
There is no evidence so far that consumers desires, created by advertising, would simply disappear when they lack disposable income. In general, people feel comfortable in a state in which their attitudes and behaviors match. If attitudes and behaviors cannot reach a congruency, people experience a motivational state of arousal (first conceptualized and tested by Festinger, 1957). Specifically, as the phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance shows, people experience a drive or pressure to reduce this arousal by changing either their beliefs, or their behaviors or both.
It is reasonable to believe that cognitive dissonance would occur among college-age consumers who, through advertising, develop a desire for a product at the present time but can not afford it. One indication of the occurrence of cognitive dissonance could be emotional responses to the ads. This study investigates the emotional state of such consumers as a result of advertising for products that they may not be able to afford.
Advertising researchers have used physiological measures to assess cognitive and emotional responses to advertising. Heart rate has been used to measure attention paid to television advertisements (Bolls, Yoon, Lang, & Potter, 1997) and presence of mental imagery during exposure to radio advertisements (Bolls & Potter, 1998). Skin conductance has been used as a measure of arousal and response to sales appeal during television advertisements (Hopkins & Fletcher, 1994). Recently, facial EMG has been used to measure the valence of emotional response to radio advertisements (Bolls, Potter, Lang, Floyd-Snyder, 1999). The measurement of physiological responses during exposure to advertisements provides information that cannot be obtained through self-report measures alone. Taken together, physiological and self-report data have the potential to provide detailed insight into the nature of emotional and cognitive responses evoked by advertisements.
Based on Robertson, et al. (1989)s findings that advertising exposure was positively related to product requests, we expect that:
H1: People higher in pre-exposure materialism scores will report that they pay more attention to advertising, in general. In other words, there will be a positive relationship between inherent materialism levels and advertising exposure.

Building on the cognitive dissonance literature, we predict that there will be a relationship between advertising exposure, socio-economic status, and emotional responses to the ads.
H2: Consumers of lower family income will find the advertisements less pleasing.
H3: Consumers of lower family income will find the advertisements more exciting.


Method
The study will be a 2 (high/low family income level - between subjects) x 2 (high/low product cost - within subjects) x 8 (product item - within subjects) x 4 (order - between subjects) design. All participants will be exposed to the same set of commercials. The study controls for television use, attention to advertising, previous exposure to the ads used in the study, attitudes toward the advertised products and brands, and demographic variables, such as age, gender, and racial or ethnic background.

Procedure and stimulus materials
The study will be conducted with one participant at a time in a psychophysiological lab. Participants will be college freshman. The participants will each answer a short pre-test questionnaire, probing television watching, attention paid to advertisements, materialism beliefs, and semantic-differential-scale items measuring pre-existing attitudes to the about to be seen products (bad/good; unfavorable/favorable; dislike/like).
Following this questionnaire, each participant will view a series of eight commercials for different products, four low-cost items and four high-cost items. The commercials were selected from television shows aimed at young adults. All spots are 30 seconds in length. High cost items cost at least $200 and low cost items were under $100. Four orders of exposure have been created to control for order effects.
Physiological data will be collected for a five second baseline prior to each advertisement and during exposure to the advertisements. After each commercial, the participants will fill out a series of questions in reaction to the ad: Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scales, attitudes toward the ad and the brand, and control questions about whether they had seen this commercial before and whether they owned the product.
After the last commercial, the participants will answer a post-test set of questions including the materialism scale and demographic items. Participants will then be debriefed, thanked, and excused.
The findings will be discussed in terms of the consequences these emotional responses may have for consumers of lower socio-economic status. Is our society raising a large group of people who are constantly exposed to, but cannot hope to participate in, the system of values advertising espouses? How do they cope with such discrepancy between the media reality and their own economically-constrained reality?

By analyzing student-initiated e-mails sent via WebCT, the researchers found that TAs respond with emotion to e-mails whether or not emotion was expressed in the original e-mail. The authors argue that teaching is indeed an emotional profession and computer-mediated instruction may intensify the emotion labor involved by allowing the classroom to move into cyberspace, and, thus, be accessible anytime/anywhere. After a careful analysis of the presented results, the researchers concluded that attention should be given to the challenges TAs face when the boundaries between work and personal roles are blurred because of the e-mail capabilities."
2003-0263,Emotional non redundancy in television messages: The impact on audience memory,Paper,Emotional non redundancy in television messages: The impact on audience memory,"Significance of the study
Until recently much of the research on memory from television news focused on memory of the verbal information and all but ignored the effects of the visual stream. A growing number of studies show that viewers process information from both the audio and visual streams together and that one channel can affect memory for the other. This study looks at the synergistic relationship between verbal and visual information  the way audio and video interact to intensify one another and affect overall memory for the message.
Redundancy refers to the degree of congruence between the information in the audio and video channels of a message. Previous studies show that messages that have incongruent information between their audio and video streams receive less thorough processing than redundant messages.
According to the limited capacity theory of information processing for mediated messages, there is a limited amount of resources available for processing information. If a message requires a lot of resources beyond which the viewer has an overload occurs and the processing is not completed; that is important information in the message does not go through the stages of encoding, storage and retrieval.
This study is among a few that tests a specific kind of audio/visual redundancy, redundancy in valence. It often happens that the verbal content in the audio stream is negative of a subject and the video accompanying it is positive of the subject or vice versa where the audio is positive but the video is negative.
Research Question1 Is there a main effect of emotional audio/visual redundancy on overall recall for the message?
It also tests the visual superiority hypothesis that holds that visuals are easier to process that verbal information in the audio.
Research question 2: Overall do subjects recall more of the information coming from the video channel than the audio channel?
Valence is one dimension of emotion it measures the direction of emotion on a scale from positive to negative. Arousal is another dimension that measures intensity of emotion and ranges on a scale from calm to excited. Recent research is showing that, arousal controlled, positive messages are more thoroughly processed than negative messages.
Research question 3 : Is there a valence effect; is the channel carrying the positive information more thoroughly processed than the one carrying the negative information?
Cognitive studies on specialization of the brains hemispheres have shown that there can be some sort of hemispheric lateralization. The right brain which is the center for visual processing is also the center for processing negative emotions while the left brain which is the center for verbal processing is also the center for processing positive emotion. Such studies found some support to the hypothesis that negative messages are more thoroughly processed when carried in the video and positive messages are more thoroughly processed when carried in the audio. Hence the last research question,
Research question 4: Is there a channel by valence interaction; do positive messages get more through processing when carried in the audio than in the video and do negative messages get more thorough processing when carried in the video than when in the audio?
The study will help shed light on how viewers process information from television and the impact that emotions in the message have on overall recall. It is practical interest to messages with an informational content (like news and education) and those with persuasive content (like advertising and political campaigns).
Design:
This is a 2(redundancy) X 2(channel) X 2(valence) X 3(story) X 3(order) design. Order is between subjects while redundancy, channel, valence and story are within subjects.
Redundancy has two levels redundant and non redundant. Valence has two levels positive valence and negative valence. Arousal is controlled for in the stories by keeping it low. Channel also has two levels audio track and video track. Story is the number of stories for each of the four conditions of redundant positive, redundant negative, non redundant with audio track carrying the positive and video track carrying the negative, and non redundant with the audio track carrying the negative and the video track carrying the positive.
From a sample of 36 news stories, 12 will be chosen, three in each of the conditions. The stories are chosen based on two pretests. The first measures valence in the two streams of each news story and the second measures the overall relatedness (redundancy) between the two channels in each news story. A total of 40 subjects who are undergraduates will participate in the experiment.
Dependent variables:
Free recall: Subjects will list the news stories they watched.
Cued recall (audio/video): Only the topic of the news story will be presented to subjects. Their writing will then be analyzed for relevant important information recalled from the audio and the video. What is regarded as important information in each story is decided by a panel of professors with broadcast experience. The panel viewed the 12 stories and came up with a list of important pieces of information three in the audio and three in the video.
Recognition (audio/video): 48 multiple-choice questions (4 for each news story) will test subjects recall of important information in the story. Two of the four will be geared to information in the audio and two will be geared to information in the video. The questions are pre-tested avoid any ceiling or floor effects."
2003-0264,Enabling Women's Agency: Arab Women Speak Out,Paper,Enabling Women's Agency: Arab Women Speak Out,"Arab Women Speak Out (AWSO), an advocacy and training program, is centered around the life histories of thirty Arab women who have achieved their goals by overcoming social, economic or political obstacles. Arab women researchers and filmmakers produced the materials, which include a series of ten documentary video profiles, training and discussion materials, a tool for monitoring the image of women in the media and a case history publication profiling 30 women who have achieved personal and professional goals in diverse areas. With their discussions guided by a moderator and a training manual, nearly 80,000 women from six Arab countries have participated in the program. During the training workshops, facilitators convey critical thinking skills and encourage women to interrogate gender, refine their negotiating skills, strengthen social networks, and participate in public life, among other topics. The 2001 evaluation survey used a posttest-only control group design. Qualitative research complemented the survey findings. This study sought to answer this central question: ""Was participation in this particular communication program related to changes in the aforementioned variables and, ultimately, to human agency or the propensity to act?"" A partial answer was found using multiple logistic regression: the odds of starting a new business venture were 2.5 times greater for participants than for non-participants, while the odds of taking an active part in community meetings was 2.3 times greater for participants than for non-participants. The presentation will discuss other findings in light of the theoretical framework that informed program design and guided the analysis."

Subjects were shown a series of four news story-presidential reaction audio-visual sequences that varied by story topic, level of emotion, and degree of appropriateness. Cognitive, emotional, and physiological measures were used to assess subject responses to news story-presidential reaction message sequences, including heart rate, skin conductance, the Self-Assessment Manikin affect scale, recognition memory, and facial EMG (electromyography) indexing smile and frowning muscle activation. Results indicate that evaluations of the displays appropriateness seems to moderate how much attention is given to the display, the affective direction of viewers facial muscle activation, and the level of autonomic activation, or arousal. The EMG data showed that viewers frowned in response to positive expressive displays that followed intense or positive news. Smiling activation correspondingly decreased for positive displays that followed intense news. These counterempathic results shed new light on the capacity of leader displays to influence viewers of political news. While much EMG and physiological research has focused on emotional congruent processes, e.g. positive reactions in response to positive facial displays, this study demonstrates the effects of incongruency in political display behavior. A political leaders smile is no guarantee of a positive evaluation. If deemed inappropriate to the news context, negative consequences arise from what is viewed as a clear violation of nonverbal expectations. Recognition memory for verbal information in the news narrative also suffers such that encoding of factual knowledge is impaired. It is argued that leader displays that violate viewer expectations remain a likely source of voter doubt."

These twooften, conflictinggoals had created a great deal of controversies in policy discussions and choices in organizing American broadcasting. This study examines how technological rationality used the principle of the public interest in making policy decisions and formulating regulatory framework during the early years of institutionalizing broadcasting. For this purpose, three main questions will be discussed. First, how was the language of the public interest relocated in the changing technological discrimination over time? Second, how were the socioeconomic qualitative factors camouflaged with instrumental, technological rationality in broadcasting policy-making regarding the wavelength allocation and licensing? Third, how did the public respond to such dictation of listening interests and technological interpretation of the public interest in organizing broadcasting?"

Globalization both homogenizes and heterogenizes the world. The hegemony of the English language is tightly connected with the globalization process and creates tension, intensification, and modification in peoples national identity. In January 2000, an advisory commission to the late Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi published a report in which they suggested that English be adopted as the second official language of Japan. The proposal triggered heated debates among Japanese people. Using a critical discourse analysis approach, the present paper explores how Japanese people express their national identity through an examination of the opinions posted on a Japanese national newspapers website."
2003-0268,"Environmental Concern, Patterns of Television Viewing, and Pro-Environmental Behaviors",Paper,"Environmental Concern, Patterns of Television Viewing, and Pro-Environmental Behaviors","This study merges insights from extant cultivation research with a media uses and gratifications perspective to examine the relationship between environmental concern, five forms of television viewing, and pro-environmental behaviors. In doing so, we consider a host of variables, including environmental attitudes, that are exogenous to television use and environmental behaviors and may motivate certain viewing patterns and social actions. Thus, the perspective advanced by this research considers both the direct effects of various forms of television viewing and their potential mediating roles in the relationship between environmental attitudes and behaviors. Analysis of the 1999 and 2000 DDB Life Style Study data reveals that television public affairs and nature documentary use, the two genres of programming that give tangible and visible form to abstract environmental issues, are predicted by environmental concern and contribute to pro-environmental behaviors, whereas the three forms of entertainment television use are not consistently linked to these variables. Public affairs and nature documentary use were also found to be important mediators of the effects of other exogenous variables on pro-environmental behaviors. Implications for future research are discussed."
2003-0269,e-Privacy Research: a New Disciplinary Borderland.,Paper,e-Privacy Research: a New Disciplinary Borderland.,"Analizing existing European privacy legislation and constructing and using a quantitative online research instrument to evaluate dataprocessing and privacy statements in business-to-consumer websites.

The use of different forms of marketing communications on the internet is definitely on the rise. During those interactive communication processes, personal data are often collected not only in an explicit manner (f.e. using electronic forms), but in an implicit manner as well (f.e. using cookies and clickstream analysis for webmining). The collection and use of data of internet users for marketing purposes raises questions concerning the protection of the consumers online privacy. To protect the informational privacy (i.e. dataprotection) and the relational privacy (i.e. in this domain the right not to be contacted by companies for marketing purposes) legislative initiatives have been taken in the European Union. From an analysis of 250 Belgian websites it results that the majority, collecting personal data, score largely unsatisfactorily concerning the information towards the consumer, as imposed by the European dataprotection directive transposed in the Belgian privacy law. This first analysis of websites in march 2001 (before the new privacy law came into effect on september 1st) and a second analysis, one year later, in april 2002 forms part of series researches about e-privacy, the protection of internet users' privacy.
This research shows also the necessity to build bridges between the study of law and selfregulation (in the EU a.o. the European Dataprotection Directive transposed in the national privacylaws), ICT studies (to analyse privacy invasive and privacy enhancing technologies) and communication science, to develop an online research instrument to scan the websites concerning the use of software to analyse the clickstream of visitors, to check the ways in which data are processed and how website visitors are informed about their privacy rights. Finally, our methodology consisted also in sending a mystery e-mail to the webmasters of the selected websites to check their knowledge about their own online privacy pledge."

Findings indicated that these variables did not lead to changes in credibility perceptions. However, changes were observed when participants used multimedia content that was available in certain versions of the story. The influence was strongest in the case of perceived source vs. perceived message credibility, but both showed at least moderate effects. The implications of the findings are also discussed."
2003-0271,"Ethics of Target Marketing: Process, Product or Target?",Paper,"Ethics of Target Marketing: Process, Product or Target?","Target marketing is both common place and necessary for the success of any public relations or advertising campaign. Yet, these campaigns can raise ethical dilemmas, especially in regards to the marketing of harmful products and the targeting of vulnerable consumers. This paper identifies aspects of target marketing that can be ethically questionable, including the method of persuasion, the nature of the product and the target. Differences among marketing, advertising and public relations are discussed to determine whether one of these communication tools produces more potential for ethical dilemmas then the others. Also, the role of the product, paying special attention to sin products, is examined as well as the perceived vulnerability of the target audience. Finally, the present research provides a foundation for future studies on where ethical decision-making should begin and what guidelines should be followed for ethically evaluating target marketing."
2003-0272,Ethnographic Interviews on the Digital Divide,Paper,Ethnographic Interviews on the Digital Divide,"Employing narrative analysis of ethnographic interviews with persons from a variety of socioeconomic, educational, and racial/ethnic backgrounds, this paper examines the discursive structure of the digital divide debate as it is articulated among contemporary online users and non-users in the United States. The paper argues that the discourse of individualism serves as a filter that shapes and distorts all private and public conversations about the digital divide and thus limits public debate on the subject. We consider the ways in which secondary topics of technological determinism, educational benefit, and consumer choice are shaped through this filter of individualism. Finally, we explore the extent to which there exists what Jameson (1987) has proposed is a ?third language? that struggles for legitimacy against the first language of individualism: that of Marxist critique. We note that there are nascent hints of this ?third language? in the ways that the digital divide is discussed relative to the specific, lived situations of economic disadvantage among some respondents. Yet we conclude that the potential political power of this ?third language? is muted as it echoes rather than challenges the contradictions inherent to the promise of the digital era that are found at the heart of both corporate advertising and current social policies."
2003-0273,EVALUATION OF A BOLIVIAN RADIO BROADCASTING CAMPAIGN: 'FOR STRONGER AND HEALTHIER CHILDREN',Paper,EVALUATION OF A BOLIVIAN RADIO BROADCASTING CAMPAIGN: 'FOR STRONGER AND HEALTHIER CHILDREN',"A Bolivian national radio campaign for women with children less than 24 months of age and pregnant women was implemented from June 2000 through April 2002. This evaluation studied the effects of the third booster campaign (March through April 2002) on women in areas served by the PROCOSI/LINKAGES program interventions with effects on women in the control areas that were not served by the PROCOSI/LINKAGES program. In-person surveys were conducted with 351 respondents. Unaided recall of any campaign message was 65Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide charactereeting the programs criteria for success. Additional analyses showed that knowledge and practice levels for three of the campaigns four behavior messages (timely initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, timely complementary feeding) were generally higher in the program area. When ad recall was taken into account, the results reveal that the radio campaign was successful. Knowledge and behavior gaps diminished among women in the program and control areas who recalled the campaigns message spots. Findings suggest that radio is a powerful way to improve child feeding practices and improve child health in remote regions of Bolivia."

Communication scholars could also contribute to this field of study, highlighting the active spreading and manipulation of signs related to different types of foods in our consumer culture.
In this paper, I study the phenomenon of food from a semiotic perspective and point out processes of representation of Italy through Italian food in the United States. The paper uses the Barthes concept of Italianicity to study the food experience at Fazolis restaurants. Building on the classical conceptualization of sign as the unity of signifier and signified, I have identified the verbal and non-verbal symbolic processes (signifier) and values associated with Italian food (signified) in the U. S. I have also explored their relationship with the American perception of Italian culture."
2003-0275,"Evolution, Exchange and Coordination: Implications for Organizational Communication",Paper,"Evolution, Exchange and Coordination: Implications for Organizational Communication","In this essay, we suggest that evolutionary scholarship shows tremendous promise in guiding future theory-building efforts in organizational communication. To this end, we differentiate that perspectives assumptions about human nature and behavior from those held by the traditional social sciences and humanities. We argue that there is mounting evidence to suggest that all humans come equipped at birth with the same content-specific information processing mechanisms, and that these are a product of adaptive pressures our hominid ancestors faced during our evolutionary past. We posit also that those psychological adaptations of immediate relevance to organizational communication scholars are likely to be those that center upon our hard wiring for reciprocation and its coordination. We offer several bodies of evidence for our position. Besides the anecdotal evidence that we can all identify with, we offer an analysis of the employee-organization exchange contract, which draws on current socialization scholarship, and a few examples of the rigorous testing of adaptations that evolutionary psychologists themselves have conducted. In addition, we argue that the emotions we display in organizations are strongly tied to our perceptions of equitable resource exchange, and that using emotions as a starting point in our research can help us more readily identify the underlying causal mechanisms for our communication practices. Finally, we point to the universality of exchange and coordination."

It considers why the channel was shelved when first proposed in 1994, and what cultural, technological, and marketing developments make such a prospect viable in 2002. While gay cable offers many advantages over both mainstream media outlets and gay and lesbian media, channel executives nevertheless face remaining challenges, including finding distributors, advertisers, and subscribers, and developing content sufficiently diverse to appeal to a broad spectrum of the GLBT audience. And while many ideological battles have been fought in media, it is unwise to overinvest in a commercially-funded system for significant legal and cultural civil rights gains."

Results showed that female Caucasians who have better social connections and higher self-efficacy engage in more physical activity. African American men who have higher incomes are more self-efficacious, better connected, and exercise more regularly. With regard to Hispanics, females who have better social connections exercise more. However, neither social connections nor feelings of self-efficacy have any bearing on the connection between age and physical activity among Hispanics. Different interventions for different target ethnic groups were suggested."
2003-0278,Exemplars and the Application of the Desert Heuristic When Responding to Fundraising Attempts,Paper,Exemplars and the Application of the Desert Heuristic When Responding to Fundraising Attempts,"Proponents of dual-process models claim that heuristics play an important role in the persuasion process. In this paper, four experiments are reported on a heuristic applicable in fundraising contexts: the so-called desert heuristic. This heuristic implies that people do not support a person who is held responsible for the trouble he or she is in. Fundraising organizations do not raise funds for an individual person but for a group of patients. In that case, the stereotypical (responsibility) perception of those patients is at stake. In four experiments, it is shown that the use of exemplars in fundraising letters can influence the stereotypical responsibility perception of the category and that this perception can influence the intention to donate money especially when the type of problem is less serious. Cultural differences do not appear to play a decisive role."

We use Putnams (2000) findings on social capital to argue that organizations can serve two major functions in health campaigns: instrumental (e.g., providing material support) and affinity (social support). Through a secondary analysis of data from the Stanford Five-City Project, we find significant support for our predictions about who joins community organizations. We then demonstrate that membership in community organizations explains greater variance in health outcomes than that explained by media use, demographic indicators, and health information seeking. Implications for health campaigns are also discussed."
2003-0280,Explaining Information Effects in Collective Preferences,Paper,Explaining Information Effects in Collective Preferences,"This paper explores why individual differences in levels of political knowledge should affect the distribution of some kinds of collective opinions but not others. Answers to this question require a better understanding than has been offered to date of why ill-informed people often hold different opinions than the people who share their demographic characteristics but are better informed about politics. This paper concludes that consistent patterns of ideological bias in collective preferences revealed in previous studies of information effects are neither artifacts of the survey instrument nor of the particular topics posed to respondents. Instead, differences in opinion between ill- and well-informed citizens are shown to arise from both social and psychological factors that influence how ill- and well-informed citizens establish and update their political preferences."

The present research explored technologically-mediated instructional communication in relation to oral and writing communication apprehension. Two research questions were formulated: one regarding students attitudes toward the use of media as part of an in-class learning environment, and the other regarding students use of media as an extra-class communication. The survey results indicated that neither oral nor writing communication apprehension were related to a students preference for learning environment (face-to-face small class, face-to-face large class, Internet, TV), although high oral communication apprehension was related to the preference for learning via TV. The results also suggested that students with low oral communication apprehension were more likely to communicate with their instructor outside of the classroom by various means regardless of the medium. Implication of the results were discussed."
2003-0282,Exploring Global Public Relations in a Korean Multinational Organization in the Context of Confucian Culture,Paper,Exploring Global Public Relations in a Korean Multinational Organization in the Context of Confucian Culture,"This study explores how a Korean multinational organization manages its global public relations and how the culture variable influences its global public relations execution. This study focuses on the question of whether societal culture supersedes organizational culture in public relations practices. Qualitative data collected from long interviews revealed that the organization is practicing global public relations rather than international public relations. At the core of global public relations practice, the organization¡¯s corporate philosophy is playing a role of generic principles. The evidence from interviews showed that practitioners in the organization are using dual cultural measures. In a domestic setting, societal culture, especially Confucian tradition, is prominent because the organization has to be adjusted to the social norm to survive in Korean markets. However, societal culture cannot play as much influence as, in a global setting, it does in a domestic setting."

They note that many people now model their personal lives after celebrities rather than looking to traditional heroes as their role models. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, might have changed the boundary between celebrities and heroes. A sense of heroism was renewed in the public arena by the courageous acts of many people on that fateful day. In this paper, we assess these changes through a study of visitors to the temporary memorial at the United Airlines Flight 93 crash site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Results from our study indicate that the many common heroes who emerged in September 11th may now temper the strong influence of celebrities on public beliefs and practices. Implications of this research for the study of social influence are discussed."
2003-0284,Exploring the Interpersonal Communication Aspects of Suicide: A Research Agenda for Communi-Suicidology,Paper,Exploring the Interpersonal Communication Aspects of Suicide: A Research Agenda for Communi-Suicidology,"This paper develops the interpersonal communication aspects of suicide. Although suicidologists have identified communication as a critical part of the suicide/suicide prevention process, communication researchers have not given suicidal communication the attention it deserves. The communication between the suicidal individual and his/her friends, family, and professionals is one of the most important aspect of the suicidal process. An explication and definition of suicide are presented in terms of communication and an interpersonal communication model is proposed to synthesize extant literature. The model incorporates three major stages of interpersonal communication in the suicidal cycle. Each of these stages is discussed as an opportunity for potential research. The goal of this paper and model is to offer a better understanding of the interpersonal communication processes involved in suicide for the purpose of more effective suicide prevention."

A case study of an environmental activist organization was conducted for this purpose. This study found that, according to their various degree of experience with the case organization, participants¡¯ evaluation of relationships and perception of reputations is differently linked. This study suggests that, even if an organization has been struggling with negative reputations, negative reputations can be improved by building good relationships with key publics. This is why public relations practitioners should concentrate on quality relationship management with key publics so as to demonstrate and enhance the value of public relations (i.e., the effectiveness of public relations) to an organization."
2003-0286,Exploring the Relationship Between Hurtful Messages and Partner Attachment,Paper,Exploring the Relationship Between Hurtful Messages and Partner Attachment,"The present study explored the relationship between partner attachment styles and hurtful messages. Attachment styles in addition to frequency of hurtful messages and degree of hurt were examined in 37 romantically involved couples. Based on the tenets of attachment theory, it was argued that hurtful messages are a form of insensitivity or unresponsivity (i.e., the broad category of interactions that influence the attachment relationships formed). Consequently, frequency of hurtful messages as well as degree of hurt experienced were hypothesized to be related to attachment styles. As predicted, results showed that secure tendencies were negatively related to the frequency of hurtful messages reported in the general relationship, whereas preoccupied and dismissive-avoidant tendencies were positively related with the frequency of hurtful messages. Regarding the degree of hurt reported during a specific conflict episode, secure tendencies were positively related to degree of hurt, whereas dismissive-avoidant and preoccupied tendencies were negatively, but weakly, related to degree of hurt experienced. Results are discussed in terms of implications for attachment theory."
2003-0287,Exposure to Mediated Political Conflict: Effects of Civility of Interaction on Arousal and Memory,Paper,Exposure to Mediated Political Conflict: Effects of Civility of Interaction on Arousal and Memory,"This paper presents results from two experiments about viewer reactions to televised political disagreement. The purpose was to examine arousal responses to politicians engaged in face-to-face political debate, and to examine whether production characteristics of televised portrayals alter memory after viewing. Using videotapes of political talk shows created expressly for these experiments, results showed that the less civil versions of the same exchange of political views created greater arousal in viewers as measured by skin conductance levels. Likewise, those who watched the talk show from a close-up camera perspective experienced greater arousal than those who watched the same exchanges shot from a medium camera distance. A second experiment focused on the consequences of heightened arousal for memory. Consistent with the literature on arousal, memory for the main emphasis of the exchange  the candidates differing issue positions  was enhanced by the highly arousing, uncivil presentations. But memory for details  the arguments underlying those same positions -- was suppressed by the highly arousing presentations. Although recall of issue arguments consistent with respondents own opinions was not affected by the civility of the exchange, subjects were less likely to recall the oppositions arguments in the uncivil, as opposed to the civil, condition. We discuss the implications of these findings for the producers and consumers of political television."

Results indicated the magnitude of differences between Schizophrenia and Comparison participants were reflected in the following mean effect sizes: self-reported emotional experience .18; other-reported emotional expression .26; emotion communication accuracy .42. Corresponding mean effect sizes for males only were .16, .19, and .34. Relative to Comparison participants, emotional experience and expression were slightly or moderately less appropriate in Schizophrenia participants, but communication accuracy was strongly different and uniformly lower. These findings suggest that the greater part of inappropriate affect in schizophrenia involves spontaneous emotional communication. This is discussed in relation to research on Expressed Emotion (EE) and the classic Double-Bind hypothesis (DBH), suggesting that specific sorts of manipulations of the environment of emotional communication in schizophrenia patients may have therapeutically beneficial effects."

Both the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights use multi-step evaluations where a negative response to one of the questions results in a dismissal of the commercial speech restriction. Thus, the application method of how both judicial bodies evaluate commercial speech restrictions is remarkably similar. Both courts consider the legitimacy of the restriction as well as the necessity of the restriction as the most prudent manner to pursue the stated aim. Two crucial characteristics of the European Court's approach distinguish its decisions: commercial speech has always received full protection and the criteria for determining if commercial speech could be legally restricted are found in the written articles regarding expression."
2003-0290,Extending Media Capacity Theories Beyond the First Encounter:,Paper,Extending Media Capacity Theories Beyond the First Encounter:,"Media capacity theories generally posit that media have different abilities to carry communicative cues. In these theories, individuals select a particular medium for communication based on congruence of the message requirements and the capability of the medium to meet these requirements. Congruence will lead to more effective (satisfying, efficient) communication. Many critiques, and extensions to address these critiques, have been advanced. However, the extensions to date have not generally addressed ongoing communication streams or the concept of reciprocity in media usage. This paper briefly critiques two media capacity theories, media richness and social presence, focusing on this gap and presents a theoretical extension to media capacity theories to address this limitation. This paper moves beyond the first communicative encounter that often serves as a foundation for media capacity arguments by including the concepts of inattentive reciprocation by a sender and the influence of historical media choices on a senders reply."

Newspaper size and newspaper's region of coverage had significant impact on interactivity of Internet newspapers. Length of Web presence was partly associated with level of interactivity. While the number of technical staff might be critical in productivity of print newspapers in its new technology development, the level of interactivity did not come out of number of technical staff of the Internet newspapers. Whether a newspaper is an independent or chain paper was not found to be a predictor of interactivity of Internet newspapers."

Major findings include: under the present economic growth and minimum telecommunication reform in the near future, China¡¯s Internet population fall in the normal ¡°S¡± curve and will level off after reaching 63million. The determinant model suggests that at current stage, the increasing of Internet population correspond with the area's cosmopolitism level, growth of service industry and the wealth of urban residents.In the model for Interent penetration rate, higher educational level among population, rate of home PC availability, the rate of urban population and urban residents¡¯income level are significant predictors to explain the variance of the percentage of population adopting the Internet in China."
2003-0293,Factors of Culture Adaptation and Adaptation States in a Multicultural Organization,Paper,Factors of Culture Adaptation and Adaptation States in a Multicultural Organization,"Most adaptation research focuses on immigrants' experience adapting into the host culture. In light of the growing globalization of world economy and the fact that more companies are setting up branches around the world, we would like to address the issue of cultural adaptation for employees in a multicultural organization. Samsung-Tijuana Park is the site for a Korean electronic company and its manufacture site in the U.S.-Mexican border city of Tijuana. One the one hand, Koreans move to Mexico and face a real sense of cultural adaptation into the host culture. On the other, local Mexican employees also need to adapt to the Korean organization culture. Through a search in previous literature on culture adaptation, we determined four factors about the individual's conditions: preparation, expectation, communication skills, and time in contact with the second culture. Many adaptation models use stages to represent the process, therefore, we summarized four states: anticipation, peak, valley, and smooth. We treated these eight concepts as variables and focused our study on finding possible correlations among them. Results show a general tendency for positive factors such as preparation and communication abilities to be positively correlated to positive states of adaptation such as peak and smooth. Consequently, there is a negative correlation between these positive factors and the valley state, which is the most obvious negative state. The similar patterns of correlation for both the Korean and Mexican cultural groups suggest that adaptation takes place when both parties are involved in the effort. We use the term ""co-acculturation."" Limitations and future directions are discussed."

This study established that DMCA as currently written may impact fair use unfairly. Using the public choice theory as a framework, the study argues that DMCA may be a ripe candidate for judicial review rather than creating another exemption for socially beneficial uses as recommended by copyright scholars. Considering the protected status of the fair use doctrine in U.S. Copyright law, this will allow judges to consider fair use as a defense to a charge of circumvention. Judicial review will provide a more expansive interpretation of section 1201 which is needed to preserve the public domain and maintain the traditional balance in copyright law between the interest of users and economic interests of copyright owners."

The style used by columnists attempts to recreate the intimate interaction occuring when sharing gossip among friends. Though this gossip is printed in the media, a good columnist is able to challenge readers and engage them in deciphering enigmatic gossip items. This is achieved by a variety of discourse startegies, including style and code mixing, direct address to the audience and a unique persona of the column itself. The result is a fake intimacy that replicate oral exchange of information and compensate for the lack of immediacy. A new media discourse has been created, waiting for thorough analysis."

Seventy-two college student dating couples completed measures of family environmental factors, self-perceived social skill during a sexual communication task, and condom usage after completing a laboratory sexual communication task with their partner. Results of this investigation indicated some support for a family systems and social learning approach to the relationship between family environment and self-perceived social skill. This relationship appeared to be more important for women than men. A significant portion of the variation in social skill was explained by family communication in both women and men. Results of this study found no support for a relationship between family environment and condom usage for either women or men."

The analysis also controlled for several demographic variables. The goal was to determine how media use affects feelings of anomie. Anomie was measured with Srole's classic scale of anomie. Several modes of media were examined. The findings show that print media use tended to alleviate feelings of anomie. Broadcast media had mixed effects on anomie. Under some demographic conditions, broadcast media use reduced the feeling of anomie and under other conditions it engendered it. Newer forms of media such as e-mail, use of the world wide web, and webTV had no effect on anomie. Playing computer games and watching satellite television, however, were associated with increased feelings of anomie."
2003-0298,Fear on the Radio: Cognitive and emotional responses to high-fear high-imagery messages,Paper,Fear on the Radio: Cognitive and emotional responses to high-fear high-imagery messages,"How does the level of imagery in high fear radio public service announcements affect cognitive and emotional processing of the message? A significant body of research has explored information processing of high fear messages (i.e. LaTour & Pitts, 1989; Mewborn & Rogers, 1979; Rogers, 1983; Witte, 1992) but none of the research has addressed the role production features like imagery play in information processing of the message. Boster and Mongeau (1984) suggested, at the end of their meta-analysis of studies of fear-arousing messages, that ""it is not clear exactly what features of a persuasive message are fear arousing"" (p. 370). They also argue that ""the manipulation of fear and the manipulations of other relevant independent variables are often confounded"" (p. 366). The purpose of this study is to more clearly manipulate fear by separating a fearful topic from the imagery level used in messages on the topic. More specifically, this study will examine how imagery in high-fear radio public service announcements affects attention, arousal and negative emotional valence.
Previous research has found that imagery results in a greater focus of attention to internal mental processes as evidenced by faster heart rate during exposure to high-imagery radio messages compared to low-imagery messages (author cite). Radio messages with negative emotional valence have been found to result in greater attention paid externally to the message as evidenced by slower heart rate during negative compared to positive messages (author cite). Researchers have not investigated whether during high-imagery, high-fear messages listeners focus attention internally to the process of mental imagery or externally on the message. In an exploratory study this author found participants heart rate to be slower during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages suggesting that participants were primarily allocating attention externally to the message. This study will attempt to replicate the exploratory study. The following hypothesis will be tested:
H1: Heart rate will be slower during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages.
If fear appeal interferes with the ability to focus attention internally to generating mental images during exposure to high-imagery messages it is possible that after exposure, participants will be able to allocate attention to generating mental images when cognitive resources are no longer needed to process the incoming message. Thus, if people are instructed to think about the message, they should experience greater mental imagery while thinking about high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages. This leads to the following hypothesis:
H2: Heart rate will be faster for high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages after exposure when participants are instructed to think about a message.
Given that negative messages result in attention being allocated externally to the message it could be that the experience of negative emotion is what interferes with the ability to allocate attention internally to mental imagery. Previous research has shown that negative emotion can be measured with facial EMG by measuring activity over the Corrugator muscle (Eckman, 1993). This study will explore the possibility that negative emotion interferes mental imagery during exposure by testing the following hypothesis:
H3: Corrugator muscle activity will be greater during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages.
Previous research has also demonstrated that both negative emotion and imagery are production features that intensify arousal (Lang, Dhillon & Dong, 1995; author cite) as evidenced by increased skin conductance. This leads to a final hypothesis:
H4: Skin conductance will be greater during exposure to high-imagery, high-fear messages compared to low-imagery, high-fear messages.
Method
Independent Variable
Imagery
Imagery is conceptually defined as production features of radio that engage listeners in imagery processing. According to previous research sound effects and descriptive wording increase the imagery level of a radio announcement (Miller & Marks, 1997). Imagery will be manipulated through the presence of sound effects and descriptive wording in the copy.
Dependent Variables
Attention
Attention is mental effort put into processing the radio announcements. Heart rate will be obtained as a measure of attention. Participants' heart rate will be measured for a five second baseline prior to onset of each message, time-locked to exposure to each message and for a 30 second post-exposure period during which participants will be instructed to think about the message they just listened to. Heart rate will be collected as milliseconds between beats and converted to beats per minute.
Emotional Valence
Emotional valence is a dimension of emotion that has to do with how positive or negative a person feels. Negative emotional valence will be measured in this study through facial EMG. Corrugator muscle activity will be measured for a five second baseline prior to onset of each message, time-locked to exposure to each message and for a 30 second post-exposure period during which participants will be instructed to think about the message they just listened to. Self-reported emotional valence will also be obtained by having participants complete the SAM (self-assessment mannequin) scale (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley & Hamm, 1993).
Arousal
Arousal is a dimension of emotion that reflects how excited our calm a person feels. Arousal will be measured by obtaining participants' skin conductance. Skin conductance will be measured for a five second baseline prior to onset of each message, time-locked to exposure to each message and for a 30 second post-exposure period during which participants will be instructed to think about the message they just listened to. Self-reported arousal will also be obtained by having participants complete the SAM (self-assessment mannequin) scale (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley & Hamm, 1993).
Design
This experiment will use a 2 (Imagery) X 3 (Message Topic) X 3 (Order) repeated measures mixed model design. Imagery and Message Topic are within subjects variable. The messages will be recorded in three different orders and participants will be randomly assigned to listen to one of the orders.
Stimuli
A survey conducted in Fall 2001 of 95 undergraduates at a large northwestern university indicated that pregnancy, contracting a sexually transmitted disease and being the victim of a drunk driver are high fear issues. A 60 second high imagery and low imagery message was produced for each of the high fear message topics. The high imagery messages featured a storyline with descriptive wording and sound effects. The low imagery messages featured college students talking about why they fear each topic. Six low fear messages will also be included as stimuli in order to keep participants from becoming overly sensitized to fear appeal. These low fear messages were obtained from the Ad Council and have been pre-tested to ensure they are indeed low fear.
Procedure
Participants will be forty undergraduate students enrolled in Communication courses at a large northwestern university. Participants will complete the experiment one at a time in a psychophysiology lab. Informed consent will be obtained and then participants will be prepped for the collection of physiological data. All instructions for the experiment will be recorded onto audio tape and played for participants. Instructions for completing the self-report measures will be played followed by instructions for the post-exposure task. For this task participants will be told that after each message they will see a cue on the screen that instructs them to ""please sit still and think about the message you just heard"" and then will be prompted to complete the self-report measures. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and then will listen to each radio message. After completing self-report measures for the last message participants will be thanked and dismissed.
Time table
Data for this experiment will be collected by the end of February 2002. Data analysis will be completed by the end of March 2002. References

The current paper integrates insights from research on emotion at work and the social construction of technology to demonstrate the role of emotion in ICT-based organisational change through a case study of a Not-For-Profit organisations implementation of a web-based case management system. In particular, I argue that emotions and new ICT systems are experienced as ambiguous phenomena, which makes people susceptible to influence through interaction. Furthermore, such interaction to negotiate meanings for the emotional experience of ICT implementation is critical to its success."
2003-0300,Feminist Consciousness and the Production of a Contemporary Women's Section,Paper,Feminist Consciousness and the Production of a Contemporary Women's Section,"Once again in the history of U.S. newspapers a clear border was drawn around news content meant for women when, during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, several U.S. metropolitan daily newspaper editors reintroduced womens pages to their readers. This re-emergence of womens sections is especially interesting within a feminist context since it was during the late 1960s and early 1970s, during a particularly active period of feminism, that newspapers first eliminated these gendered sections and started producing lifestyle pages aimed at a general audience. While illuminating how a newspaper staff conceptualizes and constructs a contemporary womens section, this research demonstrates how a feminist consciousness at times influences an editors work on the section. Through interviews and observation at a Midwestern daily, the research, however, also illustrates how an individual standpoint often becomes overshadowed by organizational concerns and constraints."
2003-0301,Flock Theory: A New Model of Emergent Self-Organization in Human Interaction,Paper,Flock Theory: A New Model of Emergent Self-Organization in Human Interaction,"This paper introduces a new theory of emergent self-organization in human interaction. Flock Theory draws from a theoretical basis of emergence and self-organizing systems (Contractor, 1994; Hodgson, 2000; Monge & Contractor, 2001; Monge & Eisenberg, 1987). Likewise, two other important theoretical works are offered, Eric Eisenbergs work on the transcendent organization of jamming (Eisenberg, 1990), and R. Keith Sawyers work on the Emergence of Creativity (Sawyer, 1999). Catalyzed by a computer graphic simulation of a flock of birds by Craig Reynolds (Reynolds, 1987), and conceived to model jazz improvisation, Flock Theory is presented axiomatically. Focusing on the optimization of group members distance, the maintenance of leadership, and matching of direction of other individuals, this theory poses a model of human interaction that captures the potentially egalitarian effects of a cooperative evolution. Methods and applications of Flock Theory extend across disciplines, from task groups to online interaction."

Focus group-related literature has not provided in-depth discussions about these processes and how researchers can accomplish them. This paper tackles these issues by examining the experiences of the ""Targeting Mass Media Campaigns for HIV Prevention"" Project during the sampling and recruiting phases of the focus group portion of the study. The paper notes key principles behind building a theoretically based sampling plan that reflects the major goals of the research. This plan serves as a foundation for recruiting activities that must identify eligible respondents with a reasonable investment of labor time and funding. The paper examines several different recruiting methods employed by the Project and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each. In conclusion, it offers eleven ""lessons"" learned that can provide guidance for health communication researchers engaged in focus group research."

How does the visualizing cognitive style affect processing of news photos?,"A study was conducted to the relationship of visualizing and verbalizing cognitive styles and the processing of news photographs. First, a mediation model was tested that predicted that attention mediates the relationship between visualizing and photo memory. Second, the relationship between cognitive styles and perceptions was examined. Both visualizing and attention predict memory, but the former does not work through the latter. Further, high visualizers perceived the news photos as more interesting and more unified. As expected, a persons verbalizing level did not predict attention to or memory for the new photographs. The results are discussed in terms of visualizers efficiency in processing visual stimuli."
2003-0304,"Four Basic Communication Strategies, Beyond the Borders of Traditional Public Relations Practice",Paper,"Four Basic Communication Strategies, Beyond the Borders of Traditional Public Relations Practice","Increasing numbers of professionals in public relations consider themselves to be strategic managers and consultants. Surprisingly, they have difficulty in making clear what it really is that they manage and what their consultations truly represent, what aims they have and what strategies they use. In this paper I present a model consisting of basic communication strategies, derived from communication theory and rooted in described public relations approaches in the Netherlands.
The theoretical constructed and empirically clarified communication models-in-use revealed a typology of seven public relations approaches. From the point of view of communication theory, three of these models cannot be taken seriously. However, there is no empirical or logical evidence that any of the remaining four theory-based communication models alone could outclass the other three models. In the final section of this paper, I propose, therefore, to go beyond the limiting traditional practical public relations borders and view these four models as being a composite of complementary basic communication strategies in public relations practice."
2003-0305,Four Perspectives on the Role of Fear in Persuasion,Paper,Four Perspectives on the Role of Fear in Persuasion,"Previous research on threat appeals has correlated fear intensity with persuasion. However, fear might figure into the process of persuasion in at least four conceptually distinct ways: (a) the proclivity to experience fear, (b) the rise from baseline to peak, (c) peak intensity, and (d) the decline from peak to post-message fear. A study was conducted that exposed 361 participants to a message that described the dangers of influenza, then advocated obtaining a free vaccination. The data showed positive correlations between tonic activation of the behavioral inhibition system and various indices of fear arousal, but nonsignificant correlations between the behavioral activation system and the same indices. Both rise and peak measures of fear predicted persuasion, but the measure of the extent to which fear declined fared poorly."

We argue that marginalized members often label their organizational selves as fake and/or compartmentalize public and private selves, while more privileged employees are encouraged to align their seemingly real selves with the preferred or idealized organizational self. The dichotomy has several discursive and material implications for members and organizations. Specifically, it encourages strategized self-subordination, perpetually-deferred identities, auto-dressage, and the production of good little copers. We close by presenting the metaphor of the crystallized self as an alternative to the real self-fake self dichotomy and suggest that communication scholars are well-poised for developing alternative vocabularies and understandings of identity within the popular imagination."

This framing analysis examined the coverage of Musharraf in three newsmagazines - Newsweek, Time and U.S. News & World Report - between September 11, 2001, and February 28, 2002.
The newsmagazines emphasized Musharraf's biographical and personal characteristics that made him different from his nation of ""fundamentalists"" and closer to the West. Positive sides of Musharraf's dictatorship were emphasized, especially those that yielded to the American interests in the region. The negative effects of Musharraf's rule, especially in the domain of human rights, were either justified or completely omitted from the frame. Findings suggest that the Cold War frame that the U.S. media used in the international coverage in the 1980s recently merged with a ""West versus Islam"" frame."

This is done in order to ascertain whether media mergers, that are symptomatic of the growing concentration in the global media industries, are presented as purely commercial events or as events with civic repercussions. Content analysis of articles in the French press covering the Vivendi Universal merger in France and in the American press covering the AOL Time Warner merger in the U.S. was conducted. Results suggest that in both countries the respective mergers are mostly framed as economic events, thereby removing the event from the realm of political contention."
2003-0309,Framing Problems in Crisis Negotiation: Reframing in the Case of Waco,Paper,Framing Problems in Crisis Negotiation: Reframing in the Case of Waco,"Outside Waco, Texas, on April 19th, 1993, a 51-day standoff between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and David Koresh and the Branch Davidians concluded with a fire that killed more than 75 people inside the Davidian compound. Despite the fact that the FBI negotiators talked on the telephone with Koresh or his spokesperson almost every day, the negotiators were unable to bring the standoff to a peaceful end. A frustrating yet persistent aspect of the FBI negotiations was the Davidians talk about the Bible and their religious beliefs. In this study, I analyze several exchanges between Koresh and various negotiators. The analysis shows how different reframing practices reveal the interactional troubles the negotiators faced in dealing with the incompatibility of their frame for the situation with the Davidians religious one. These practices, I argue, shed new light on the generic advice currently provided for crisis negotiators."
2003-0310,Framing Public Discussion of Gay Civil Unions,Paper,Framing Public Discussion of Gay Civil Unions,"Although the framing of public opinion has often been conceptualized as a collective and social process, experimental studies of framing have typically examined only individual, psychological responses to alternative message-frames. In this research, we employ for the first time group conversations as the unit of analysis (following Gamson, 1992) in an experimental study of framing effects. Two hundred and forty-one American citizens in 54 groups (18 homogeneously conservative groups, 17 homogeneously liberal, and 19 heterogeneous groups) discussed whether or not gay and lesbian partnerships should be legally recognized. Groups were randomly assigned to one of two framing conditions (a homosexual marriage / special rights frame or a civil union / equal rights frame). Results indicated framing effects that were, in all cases, contingent on the ideological leanings of the group. The marriage frame tended to polarize group discussions along ideological lines. Both liberal and conservative groups appeared to find their opponents frame more provocative, responding to them with a larger number of statements and expressing greater ambivalence than when reacting to more hospitable frames."
2003-0311,Framing The Fight Against Terror: Order Versus Liberty in the Mainstream and Alternative Media,Paper,Framing The Fight Against Terror: Order Versus Liberty in the Mainstream and Alternative Media,"The threat of terror has strengthened the consensus around the need for order, even at the expense of civil liberties. What is the role of the press in promoting and policing this consensus? This paper examines the performance of news media in Malaysia, where militant cells have recently been uncovered, prompting the use of security laws that permit lengthy detention without trial. The coverage of one of the largest establishment newspapers, The New Straits Times, is compared with that of an independent website, Malaysiakini.com. Consistent with research elsewhere, the mainstream press is found to be generally unsympathetic towards perceived breaches of order. The New Straits Times framed the affair mainly in national security terms. Malaysiakini, in contrast, expressed a concern for civil liberties, and the possibility that the government was exploiting the war against terrorism to crack down on peaceful political dissent. The study highlights the importance of the alternative press in keeping key debates open at times when there is pressure on the news media to support the states agenda."

In the absence of privacy rights, corporations ability to segment citizens means that individuals will increasingly be exposed to information that is designed to manipulate, rather than inform them. Corporations ability to segment citizens also implies that certain segments of the population will be excluded from the democratic deliberation process because they are deemed as politically unviable."
2003-0313,From a Behavioral Toward an Interactional Theory of Charisma in Organizations,Paper,From a Behavioral Toward an Interactional Theory of Charisma in Organizations,"The popularization and psychologizing of charisma as a quality to be obtained by organizational leaders has moved the idea of charisma far afield from Webers original discussion of it. Also, behavioral theories of charismatic leadership are not adequately suited to explain how charisma becomes routinized in organizations. This paper addresses these concerns as it returns to Webers original discussion of the charisma of office, and proposes a model for an interactional theory of charisma in organizations aimed specifically at addressing this process."
2003-0314,From Midnight to Broad Daylight: The constructive capabilities of techno and,Paper,From Midnight to Broad Daylight: The constructive capabilities of techno and,"This paper traces the history of electronic dance music (hereafter EDM) in Detroit. I locate its place within the rave subculture and examine mass media perceptions of the scene to account for possible outcomes of a subculture once it leaves the margins and occupies a space central to popular culture. It also conveys the ways in which music genres such as Detroit Techno are influenced by social and/or political histories. I also argue that while rave culture was in a sense killed by commercialization and popular media coverage, branches of EDM that have developed independently of the rave scene, such as Detroit Techno, continue to thrive. Moreover, my analysis of popular media highlights the impact that popular press coverage can have on a culture, such as the negative drug related coverage of the rave scene or the Detroit Free Press's positive depictions of DEMF. I use Bakhtinian concepts pertaining to the connections between ourselves and others, along with Bakhtin's description of the purposes and offerings of carnival life, to develop a theoretical understanding of the underpinnings of EDM. Finally, I suggest that unlike the space of the rave or carnival, after which everything goes back to normal, the experience of festivals such as the Detroit Electronic Music Festival have the potential to revitalize and build community in Detroit."
2003-0315,From Naturalisation to Sacralisation: Changing Paradigms for Analysing Visual Advertising,Paper,From Naturalisation to Sacralisation: Changing Paradigms for Analysing Visual Advertising,"Abstarct
Advertsing has been understood in the structuralist tradition of cultural studies as naturalising social relations by making brands appear natural. This raticle traces a series of approaches to the analysis of advertising that have developed in Britain and the US within the context of media studies over the last 30 years.. It questions how this model has developed from a particularly English understanding of French structuralism which has become a type of orthodoxy in Britain Other theoretical analyses of advertising from of linguistics from pragmatics and speech act theory are considered.. Overall the article argues that the structuralist position that advertising naturalises products is no longer relevant but rather that we should consider how advertising sacralises brands, giving them a supernatural quality by allowing them to cross the border of the media world to the ordinary world"
2003-0316,From the 'Battle of Seattle' to the 'War on Terrorism' in The New York Times,Paper,From the 'Battle of Seattle' to the 'War on Terrorism' in The New York Times,"This content analysis of New York Times coverage explores the evolution of journalistic framing of the ""anti-globalization"" movement from 1999, when thousands of protestors in Seattle disrupted a trade meeting, until the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks in 2002. It finds that the 1999 demonstrations definitively put this movement on the newspaper's agenda and that over a three-year period movement visibility did not increase, use of official sources decreased slightly, and Seattle endured as a symbolic reference. While portrayals of the movement and its members shifted in complex ways, the traditional ""protest paradigm"" emphasizing violence and deviance persists; however, this analysis suggests that the movement was further mainstreamed-rather than newly marginalized-after September 11, 2001. The results suggest that coverage of dissent is driven more by news values such as novelty, violence, and local bias than by ideological, intellectual or professional learning curves among journalists."
2003-0317,Frontier Compliance: A Communication System Emerging in Cyberspace,Paper,Frontier Compliance: A Communication System Emerging in Cyberspace,"This article uses the metaphor of the new frontier to describe and understand cyberspace and the nature of control in cyberspace. By comparing the domain name dispute resolution system and the ways in which it was established and operated with the historical analysis of the Wild West, it attempts to describe the cyberspace governance as a particular kind of communication system that arises out of a particular kind of situation, which I characterize in this article as frontier conditions. The emergence and disappearance of the Wild West as the frontier and free land has great significance in American history. Cyberspace is yet another frontier, a new, unlimited space. As in the American West, people go into this new space and try to obtain domain space for their interests. And attempts for self-governance again contribute to the establishment of a new system that force people in cyberspace to comply. As a result of this new system of compliance, extreme commercialization of cyberspace is supported at the expense of interests of individuals, and the new frontier of cyberspace is ironically placed under the most centralized control. The myth of freedom and the romantic notion of self-regulation and self-governance do not seem to be so valid both in the West and in cyberspace. Evolving from the circumstances characterized by the frontier conditions defined in this article was rather a system of coercion and compliance."
2003-0318,Functionalism Revisited: A practice based Functionalism,Paper,Functionalism Revisited: A practice based Functionalism,"This paper reviews theoretical works in three approaches in organizational research: (1) rationalized individual model (Transaction Cost Economics and Principal Agent Theory), (2) structuralism/functionalism model (Resource Dependence Theory and Institutional Theory), and (3) structurational model (Granovetters Social Embeddedness Model and Giddens Structuration Theory). Reviewing the last approach in depth, this paper points out that it has been recognized as an important guideline for studying organizational phenomena even in two other approaches, which resulted in an emphasis on individual actions over structural forces. However, the concepts found in Giddens Theory of Structuration  regularity, ontological security, deep lying mode of tension management, etc.  suggest that the first two approaches are not incompatible with the structurational approach. This paper argues that (1) once sui-generis characteristics of functionalism and structuralism are discarded, and (2) the fact that regularities (structural forces and functional characteristics) found in organizational studies are based upon organizations actions in a specific organizational and economic institution is acknowledged, functionalism and structuralism might enhance the structurational approach."
2003-0319,Gaming at a LAN-event: the social context of playing digital interactive games (DIGs),Paper,Gaming at a LAN-event: the social context of playing digital interactive games (DIGs),"A study was undertaken about the appeal of playing digital interactive games (DIGs) at a LAN event. At a LAN event, gamers link their PCs in a high speed Local Area Network (LAN) in order to play against each other in competitive wars. Two principal questions guided the study. First we wanted to know who the visitors of a LAN event were, because there is no research we know of about this class of gamers. Second, we wanted to know what people motivated to participate in a LAN event. The survey among 176 LAN gamers showed that they were almost exclusively male, with a mean age of 19.5 years. The gamers devoted about 2.6 hours each day to their hobby, which is far more than found in other studies among gamers. They were particularly motivated by social motives, and to a lesser extent by a need to know more about games (interest motive). The competition motive obtained a low overall score, although it was more prominent among a subgroup of heavy gamers. The authors interpret their results as a nuance of the stereotype of the solitary, adolescent gamer. LAN gamers participate in game communities and are socially motivated to visit LAN events."

Because of the many different representations of anarchists in mainstream and alternative media I sought to examine the narrative of the gathering in order to find what representations mirrored that narrative. Were the anarchists peaceful and concerned for the environment as alternative media describes them, or were they violent and destructive as mainstream media describes them? A narrative analysis of three major pamphlets from the gathering show that there is a little truth in both representations of anarchists. The anarchist narrative is about respect for all life and nonviolence, but at the same time hitting capitalists where it hurts the mostprofits. The anarchist narrative is about nonviolence and egalitarianism while hindering capitalists ability to manipulate workers."
2003-0321,"Gender, Age and Personal Trait ...",Paper,"Gender, Age and Personal Trait ...","This study used experimental methodology to investigate childrens gender, age and personal trait as antecedents in their selection of entertainment programs featuring violent versus non-violent themes. Preschool boys and girls, aged four to six, were presented with videos and were asked to pick the ones they would most like to view. Analyses of variance performed on the video choice revealed strong gender difference in childrens partialities. This study contributes to the literature by addressing, in behavioral terms, childrens attractions to different themes in media entertainment, and by exploring individual differences in terms of gender, age and personality in predicting the appeal of those themes."
2003-0322,Gender and Politeness Rules in Japan and the United States,Paper,Gender and Politeness Rules in Japan and the United States,"The purpose of this study was to examine politeness rules based on gender in Japan and the United States. Seventy-three politeness rules in Japan and the United States were adapted from Ogawa and Gudykunsts (1999) study. The multivariate interaction effect between national culture and gender was significant. Given that the multivariate interaction effect was significant, gender differences in politeness rules were examined within national cultures. Five rules were significantly different by gender in Japan, and six rules were significantly different by gender in the United States. All means were higher for females than for males, and most of the rules appear to be associated with other-oriented attitudes. The results suggest that a rule-oriented approach seems to be a viable method for studying gender and politeness."
2003-0323,Gender differences in family communication about organ donation,Paper,Gender differences in family communication about organ donation,"The research on organ donation issues consistently notes that the need for organs is ever-increasing, but the numbers of donated organs do not keep pace with demand. The research also indicates a large number of people who report a willingness to donate their organs, but notes the crucial role of the family of a deceased individual in the actual donation process. Discussions with family members appear to be key to transforming the wishes of the individual into an actual organ donation. Gender differences have been noted in terms of both attitudes toward organ donation and responses to donation messages. The present study investigated gender differences in conversations with family members about organ donation, finding that males are less likely to have such conversations and, when such conversations do occur, are less likely to include within them topics of conversation that are associated with more positive responses from family members. Speculation is offered about the reasons for these gender differences and suggestions are made about communicative strategies to more effectively convince males to both donate their organs and to talk to family members about donation."
2003-0324,Gender Differences in the Communication Values of Mature Adults,Paper,Gender Differences in the Communication Values of Mature Adults,"Contrary to the different cultures view of mens and womens communication, prior research on communication values has found only small sex differences in the value placed on various affective and instrumental skills. However, this research has been criticized because college students values may not reflect those of older individuals, and because it has failed to examine the influence of psychological gender (femininity and masculinity). In the current study, 153 men and 151 women over the age of 40 completed the Communication Functions Questionnaire (a measure of value for eight communication skills), as well as the Bem Sex Role Inventory (a measure of femininity and masculinity). Consistent with past research, sex differences in communication values were few and small. Femininity and masculinity were positively associated with most communication values, and mediated most of the observed sex differences."
2003-0325,Gender Differences in the Style and Substance of Adolescents' Personal Home Pages,Paper,Gender Differences in the Style and Substance of Adolescents' Personal Home Pages,"This study examines gender differences in the stylistic and substantive composition of personal home pages authored by high-school age teens (14-18). Past research suggests that offline gendered communication styles are being transferred by adults to online communication arenas, but little research has explored adolescent online communication. To investigate this topic, a content analysis was conducted on a sample of adolescents' home pages (N=241). The results indicate that although boys' home pages are more abundant, girls provide more descriptive and expressive information on their home pages, and include more references to intimate topics and relationships with family and romantic partners. Girls were also more significantly more likely than boys to include guest books on their home pages. These findings are interpreted in the context of past research regarding gender, adolescence and communication."
2003-0326,Gendered Cybersupport: A Thematic Analysis of Two Online Cancer Support Groups,Paper,Gendered Cybersupport: A Thematic Analysis of Two Online Cancer Support Groups,"Within the last few years numerous support groups have emerged on the Internet, presenting new opportunities for patients to communicate with health care professionals and other patients. The present study examines discourse within online cancer support groups, increasing our understanding of sex differences in cybersupport. Two reproductive cancer groups were chosen for this investigation, the Ovarian Problems Mailing List (OPML) and the Prostate Problems Mailing List (PPML), making sex of the patient recognizable. Phenomenological thematic analysis was employed to describe and interpret messages sent and received. Analyses for the two groups were compared. Generally, it was found that the two online listservs provided opportunities for cancer patients to receive support, within Western society's accepted forms of gendered communication."
2003-0327,Gender Patterns and Smoking Susceptibility among Adolescents Who View Actors Smoking,Paper,Gender Patterns and Smoking Susceptibility among Adolescents Who View Actors Smoking,"This study reports the relationship between regularly viewing actors smoking on television or in movies and smoking susceptibility among 2,507 high school students, ages 14 to 18, who reported they had never smoked before. Logistical regression analysis indicated an increased level of susceptibility was associated with frequent viewing of actors smoking. This relationship was stronger among younger than older adolescents and among females compared to males. Additionally, tests indicated significant interactions between sex, age and viewing actors smoking when predicting adolescents susceptibility to smoking."
2003-0328,Gender Role Portrayals in Prime-Time Television Commercials in Thailand,Paper,Gender Role Portrayals in Prime-Time Television Commercials in Thailand,"One hundred prime-time commercials airing on television in Thailand were content analyzed for gender role portrayals. Of the eight variables considered, three variablesroles, location and product typeindicated traditional role portrayals. In contrast, five variablesmode of presentation, credibility, age, argument, and end commentdid not indicate stereotypical portrayals. While three of these variables showed no significant differences between male and female portrayals, two other variablesargument and agesuggested a possible reversal of traditional patterns. These unique and mixed findings are compared to results from role portrayal studies from other Eastern and Western countries."
2003-0329,"Gender schematicity, gender identity salience, and gender-linked language use",Paper,"Gender schematicity, gender identity salience, and gender-linked language use","The gender-linked language effect demonstrates that men and women differ in their language use which results in different evaluative outcomes for communicators. Individuals using prototypical male language are judged to be more dynamic than individuals using prototypical female language, whereas individuals using prototypical female language are judged to be more aesthetically pleasing and socio-intellectual than individuals using prototypical male language. Despite the consistent support for the construct, there is no clear theoretical account of the gender-linked language use differences that determine, in large part, the gender-linked language effect. As such, this research offers an initial step towards a theoretical account of gender-linked language use. Utilizing self-categorization theory, the current research examines the effects of sex, chronic gender identity accessibility (i.e., gender schematicity), and gender identity salience on gender-linked language use. Sex, gender schematicity, and gender identity salience were expected to have effects on gender-linked language use independently and interactively. However, results confirmed interactive effects only. Specifically, men and women use prototypical gender-linked language only when they are gender schematic and have a salient gender identity. When gender identity is not salient individuals use language prototypical of the opposite gender group. The results are discussed regarding previous research on gender-linked language use, the nature of gender identity salience with regards to the ostensibly conflictual gender-as-culture and dominance hypotheses, and the need to examine gender-linked language under a variety of contextual factors."
2003-0330,Gene-Talk: Family communication about genetic health.,Paper,Gene-Talk: Family communication about genetic health.,"The role of family communication on the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors is well-established. The influence of family communication on individual decision-making, related to human genetics research (HGR), however, is long overdue. Family communication about HGR is mixed with numerous media messages about human genetics and genetic testing, which can leave people in a genetic information quandary. A survey (N = 717) was conducted to explore AAs (n = 267) and EA (n = 450) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors associated with human genetics and the interplay of family communication on such issues. The Communication Privacy Management theory provides a conceptual framework to examine relationships between family communication and HGR. Responses indicated significant race differences on familial discussions of medical history and familial encouragement to behave in healthy ways. However, there were no race differences on family conversations about genetic or prenatal testing. In addition, results revealed that media exposure was related to families discussions about HGR."

Based upon survey data gathered in seven geo-ethnic communities, we demonstrate a unique effect of geo-ethnicity on individuals neighborhood engagement. To test the unique geo-ethnic effect on neighborhood engagement, we analyze two types of cross-sectional comparisons: a comparison of different ethnic groups in a selected Los Angeles area, and comparisons of the same ethnic groups (Whites and Latinos, respectively) across different locations in Los Angeles County. To highlight the unique effect of geo-ethnicity, the analyses are done after controlling for individuals socio-economic status, immigration history, residential tenure and home ownership. The implications of these results are discussed from a communication infrastructure approach (Ball-Rokeach, Kim, & Matei, 2001), an ecological way of conceptualizing communication networks in the everyday lives of individuals in communities."

He went on to declare Friday, September 14, 2001, a ""National Day of Prayer and Remembrance,"" and on that day, Bush spoke at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. In this essay, we examine Bush?s speech on the ""National Day of Prayer"" by conducting a cluster criticism. Our specific research question is ""How does Bush create the case for revenge through the images presented in his National Day of Prayer speech."" After analyzing clusters around the key terms United States of America, God, prayers, and names, the results demonstrate numerous findings. Common themes and rhetorical techniques become apparent through the importance of unity, America's responsibility to justice, and God's justification of specific actions."

The authors conclude that gender as well as age are critical determining factors in how older people evaluate the difficulties, benefits, and negative consequences of computer use. Significant gaps between the New Zealand Governments identification of the benefits of computing for older people and the benefits identified by older people themselves are highlighted. The authors consequently argue for the need to promote the people-centred benefits of computer use over and above the national economic benefits that are emphasised in the New Zealand Governments drive to encourage older peoples uptake of computer based ICTs."

It also examines the influence of task type, gender, and group composition. Using a mixed-model factorial design, zero-history participants (n = 48) were grouped into dyads and asked to cooperate on low- and high-equivocality tasks over a series of three meetings conducted on three consecutive days. Results indicate that relational intimacy increased over time, but a significant interaction with medium and subsequent analyses reveal that this was only true for the CMC condition. Task type also interacted with time, but it did not have a significant effect on relational intimacy, nor did it interact with medium. Similarly, there was no main effect for either participant gender or group composition, nor did these factors interact with medium. The findings provide some support for the hyperpersonal communication model (Walther, 1996), which predicts that, under certain circumstances, interpersonal relationships can develop in CMC to a greater extent than they can in FTF interactions."

The results showed that sexual and violent images increased anticipations that the film would contain sex and violence respectively, with these perceptions associated with greater anticipated suspense and greater anticipated enjoyment. In addition, for male participants, the presence of violence in the movie preview resulted in more unfavorable perceptions of a competing movie trailer shown in the same setting. These results are discussed in terms of viewers responses to media images of sexuality and violence per se, and the importance of these portrayals in the marketing of motion pictures."
2003-0336,Global Compulsions and Local Visions: Shifting Media Terms in Multicultural India,Paper,Global Compulsions and Local Visions: Shifting Media Terms in Multicultural India,"The transformation of community values and objectives through exposure to foreign programming remains a primary concern for several media observers. However, an analysis along unilinear lines cannot explain the ramifications of global medias entry into areas previously protected from such forces. Deeply institutionalized domestic values may manifest in the new competitive environment as global media strive to become a platform for local expression. I show this by examining the national cohesion, an objective considered essential goal for a modern-state. Historically, national media participated by providing a practical channel for diffusing this value. The current opening of this national communicative space to global players appears to present a significant threat to this objective. As several observers note the global integrative forces increase the possibility of linkages between national communities and extra-national networks that may undermine national unity. Foreign media may also impress upon national cohesion by introducing different concepts that influence sentiments of national belonging.
In multicultural India, early strategies of national development highlighted the importance of national cohesion. At the same time, several contending approaches for achieving this objective appeared on the scene. In the decades following independence in 1947, the institutionalization of this objective with its different manifestations influenced national televisions infrastructural expansion and programming. Surprisingly, one finds these differing notions of national cohesion also present in the productions of diverse transnational and subregional enterprises. Furthermore, few of the transnational productions get involved in presenting different nationalisms as part of their strategy for acceptance in the new region. The state, local institutions, and the audience perform a critical role in shaping transnational strategies."

The study was initiated with an intuition that, in a postmodern world characterized by global capitalism and electronic mediation, the Internet substitutes the modern nationstate as an arena for the maintenance of cultural distinctiveness. In the same context, it inquires about the possibilities of community formation on the Internet and the characteristics of online communities. The exemplar group used is the global community comprising People of Indian Origin (PIO). Thus, their Internet usage is observed through participant observation in two chat rooms and textual analysis of two Web portals. The study concludes that the Internet allows an offline population to create an online network and dwell in a virtual space; consequently, a representational, transnational community is created. Furthermore, a group such as the PIO can experience their cultural identity in the same sphere."

First, the globalization of local talents is found to be a precondition for this reversed cultural flow. Second, the formation of a global-local alliance, consisting of networks of both local and global firms and professionals, plays a critical role. The alliance serves to translate local cultural capital into economic capital and to enhance the transculturability of the cultural product. To be accountable to the Western agencies and to be faithful to local culture, the production team is under constant pressure to strike a balance between particularization and universalization. The implications of this unprecedented case are discussed."

The content analysis tracked the changing stances of four organizations (UPS, American Airlines, USDA, Massachusetts Military Reservation) moving on the continuum from pure advocacy to pure accommodation, in response to a number of contingent factors that can just as readily move an organization toward accommodation as toward advocacy. Employing conflict and conflict resolution models from the conflict studies literature to advance the contingency theory in public relations, results confirm that perspectives of an organization and its public change over time, but both parties in each conflict demonstrated overall advocacy and employed a contending strategy dominantly during the conflict management process. The changing aspects over time were influenced predominantly by two contingent factors, internal threats and external threats."

What makes groups work effectively? This study reviews factors that both promote as well as obstruct effective group performance, and it focuses on one of the many factors that hinder a group's ability to perform as best it can: social loafing. ""Social loafing"" is the phenomenon of individuals in group situations doing less work, putting in less effort or expending less energy on the group project than they would if they did the work alone. It is common in many different situations and research has shown that it transcends cultures. This study looked at the problem from the instructor's point of view and measured the level of instructor awareness of social loafing in university classroom groups in both Japan and the United States. It hypothesized that instructors are unaware of several ways of diminishing social loafing in student groups. It also asked what, if any, preventative steps instructors take to diminish social loafing in student groups? Results showed that the vast majority of instructors on both sides of the Pacific are aware of the concepts of social loafing and free-riding. Furthermore, results support the notion that instructors should be more aware of more techniques to curb loafing and that Japanese instructors tend to take a less active role in curbing social loafing than their American counterparts. Suggestions on how teachers can curb loafing and then suggestions for research are given."

The paper uses critical theoretical approaches to analyze the processes of mass communication and commodification, and to explain how the US based pharmaceutical industry has redefined the role it plays in the very conceptualization of disease and how these rationalized practices undermine the conventional doctor-patient dynamic. The recent commodification and popularity of psychoactive drugs is provided as an example of this process. Over the past twenty years the pharmaceutical industry has established itself as a $400 billion per-year business. It has done so largely through the creation of demand for its products. Similar to the American media conglomerate in perpetual search of the transnational ""Blockbuster"" cinematic or tele-visual sensation, Big Pharma's ability to exert control over research and development, marketing, and, increasingly, the definitions of dis-ease, is central to the industry's growth as a capitalist enterprise. Not coincidentally the industry has, by way of sophisticated means of mediated representation, made momentous gains in interceding in the doctor-patient relationship. It further acts to define popular meanings of illness while proffering commodified biotechnological remedies. By manipulating specific conceptualizations of popular discourse on health the industry may create and predict the demand for its products. This discussion also provides readers with specific examples of how the for-profit media and advertising industries function and the specific interests they serve."

Host Communication Competence and Psychological Health:
A Study of Cross-cultural Adaptation of Korean Expatriate Employees in the United States.
ABSTRACT
The present study examines the cross-cultural adaptation of 101 Korean employees working in branch offices in the U.S. Based on Y. Y. Kims (2001) Cross-cultural Adaptation Model, this survey study addresses the theoretically predicted relationships among host communication competence, host interpersonal communication, host mass communication, and psychological health. Host communication competence was measured in three dimensionscognitive, affective, and operational.
The findings support the theoretical prediction that three interrelated dimensions of expatriate host communication competence (i.e., cognitive, affective, and operational) are positively associated with their psychological health. The host interpersonal communication was found to be not significantly associated with the psychological health. Among the host mass media, the use of American newspapers and magazines, American radio, and American movies was found to be positively related to psychological health. The length of stay and spouse/family adjustment were positively related to psychological health. A multiple regression analysis indicates that, together, the independent variables explain 401f the variance of the dependent variable. The paper ends with a discussion of the limitations of the present study and its practical implications."

Crisis calls were the most challenging calls, for three reasons: working peers found it difficult to determine whether a caller was in crisis; working peers, trained to empower callers and make them responsible for their problems, needed to assume responsibility for the callers well-being; and, working peers felt powerless in providing sufficient help in such situations. Despite these reasons, working peers successfully address these challenges. They put forth advice in a delicate, not threatening, manner and continually revisit the callers problems throughout the call, as a way of assuring both parties that the callers will not harm themselves that evening."
2003-0355,"How Employees and Organizations Manage Uncertainty: Norms, Implications, and Future Research",Paper,"How Employees and Organizations Manage Uncertainty: Norms, Implications, and Future Research","Navigating the borderlands between certainty and uncertainty presents an enduring challenge to organizations and employees alike. The Uncertainty Management Matrix (UMM) juxtaposes the uncertainty management strategies of employees and organizations. The Working Climate Survey operationalizes the UMM concepts. This research project focused on analyzing the data gathered from over 1000 employees in a wide range of organizations who have completed the survey. The analyses revealed that organizations that embrace uncertainty tend to foster more employee commitment, greater job satisfaction, and less cynicism than those that avoid or suppress uncertainty. Employees in uncertainty-embracing organizations are better able to cope with change than their counterparts in uncertainty-suppressing organizations. This pattern emerged regardless of how employees rated their own uncertainty management skills. The analyses also indicated that communication practices and protocols play an important role in cultivating uncertainty-embracing organizational climates. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these and other findings."

Participants performed actions such as playing with a whirlygig toy, then described this to someone who had not done it. In doing so, the speaker often made a series of gestures that were not only different from the original action but from each other. The specific gestural (symbolic) form of the gesture can be explained by its immediate communicative function, in this case, by what was given and what was new information in it at that moment. Parts of the action that had just been depicted but were still needed (i.e., given) became smaller, or sloppier, while the new feature being depicted was larger, clearer, or otherwise emphasized. Some earlier actions disappeared but had to be presupposed in order to understand the new information. These differences are analogous to the differences in given vs. new verbal information."

The current study explores the effects of societal values of interpersonal trust on online interactions. Using data from the World Values Survey and Ingleharts (1997) scores of interpersonal trust, the study compares the effect of seller feedback ratings on online auction participation in three economically similar but culturally distinct countries, Canada, France and Germany. The results indicate a significant interaction between culture, interpersonal trust levels and seller ratings on bidder participant. Cultures exhibiting high levels of interpersonal trust tend to participate in online auctions irrespective of the sellers feedback ratings. However, in low trust cultures, seller ratings have a significant effect on bidders. The extent of the effect seems to depend on the degree of trust and the variation in seller ratings."

Main goal of the fist step of this survey was to reveal differences in political communication and participation between people with and without Internet access. After the analysis of the cross sectional data there are clear indications for an effect of Internet access: Internet users proved to be more active in some forms of political communication than non-users. Internet access accounted for up to 8 1f variance in political communication.
The analysis of the second waves data (2003) will clarify wether this findings fit in a causal model.

When children hit, bite, push, or take toys away from others, caregivers routinely seek to halt their activities. As part of a course of intervention that usually involves both verbal and physical moves, caregivers seek to bring their eye gaze in line with the childrens, particularly when children are slow to give up their line of misconduct. Indeed, childrens avoidance of the caregivers gaze is treated by the caregiver as specifically constituting a course of resistance, even defiance. As part of a strategy of securing compliance from misbehaving children, caregivers insist on the childrens return gaze as they address them, and treat the absence of return gaze itself as a sanctionable matter, one that is closely tied up with childrens refusal to comply. An important issue raised in this paper is that of very young childrens agency with respect to how such a basic and pervasive interactional resource as being able to regulate where one looks enables them to persist in their own interactional projects, in spite of others efforts to get them to stop."
2003-0362,"How Viewers' Process Live, Breaking, & Emotional TV News",Paper,"How Viewers' Process Live, Breaking, & Emotional TV News","How Viewers Process Live, Breaking, and Emotional TV News
Live and breaking television news coverage has grown exponentially since the 1990s. Available time and technology, along with the economic pressure to increase ratings, have created an ideal environment for live and breaking news. Journalists intuitively believe these presentational techniques draw massive audiences seeking important information (Tuggle, Huffman, & Rosengard, 2002).
News stories presented as live and breaking often contain emotional visuals. Researchers believe that negative visuals demand viewer attention in ways other visuals do not (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992). This study seeks to test the effects of both live and breaking television news on viewers attention and memory. In addition, stories that evoke fear, anger, and disgust will be tested with the belief that each separate emotion has a different effect on information processing (Newhagen, 1998).
Tuchman (1978) defined breaking news as non-routine or unplanned news events that are covered in the course of a news cycle. It could be a what-a-story (Tuchman, 1973) such as a major passenger jetliner crash, or it could be a less tragic story such as a police chase. Either way, television news organizations believe that, when a story surpasses a particular newsworthiness threshold, it is necessary to inform viewers immediately of the event either by cutting into regularly scheduled programming or by interrupting the flow of a regularly scheduled newscast (Miller, 2000).
Breaking news is defined in this study as story that is 1) an unexpected event, 2) important, 3) labeled breaking, and 4) unscheduled. Live news is defined in the same way, except that the news is planned and scheduled. Live news occurs within a newscast. Breaking news can occur at anytime and can interrupt planned newscasts and other scheduled programming. Conversely, traditional (routine) news are news events that are planned and likely to have already taken place.
Live news presents events that are often associated with breaking news, although local TV news is replete with live news that is not breaking. The greatest strength of live broadcasting is its immediacy (Brooks, Kennedy, Moen, & Ranly, 2001). There is a prevailing belief among newsworkers that live presentation of the news helps attract viewers (Tuggle & Huffman, 1999). There is also a common industry assumption that live coverage has a positive effect on memory for stories (Snoeijer, de Vreese, & Semetko, 2001).
From the viewers perspective, Shoemaker (1996) suggests why we might expect that viewers process breaking and live news differently than traditional news. She proposed that viewers are predisposed to pay attention to news (most often bad news) because we are hardwired to respond to unexpected events in the environment. This response comes from the biological and cultural need to survey the environment for safety and curiosity. Humans attend to the unexpected and the novel because of an innate drive to know if external threats exist in the environment.
The content of breaking news is overwhelmingly negative (Harrington, 1998). Thus, viewers should attend to and remember breaking news better because it is consistently bad and as the surveillance function suggests and it is in evolutionary interests to do so. The anticipation of what is going to happen next? should increase viewer attention and thus memory for stories presented live.
The interrujption of scheduled programming is a key feature of breakingnews and distinguishes it from live news. The interruption causes the story to stand out from its immediate context causing it to become the center of attention (Fiske & Taylor, 1991). Identifying a story as live or breaking may also contribute to the storys salience. After attention is oriented to a breaking news story, viewers prepare themselves to hear and see bad news.
Emotionally-laiden video, often found in breaking news and live stories, adds yet another dimension to this type of coverage. Damaging natural disasters, deadly traffic accidents, and exciting high-speed police chases are seen with regularity on TV news (Newhagen, 1998). A majority of studies show that negative messages tend to be remembered better than positive ones (Lang, Dhillon, & Dong, 1995). Studies have found negative compelling video, in general, enhances memory (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992; Lang, Newhagen, & Reeves, 1996). The subtleties of negative emotions that could possibly affect viewers attention and memory were examined by Newhagen (1998), who found that video could elicit three primary negative emotions: anger, fear, or disgust. Images that elicited anger were best recognized (indexed as quicker RTs), followed by fear, then disgust. Newhagen reasoned that anger, as an approach emotion, would increase memory in comparison to avoid emotions such as fear and disgust.
A key issue in measuring attention and memory in research is the extent to which the cognitive processes required by a study session (in this case, watching television) and the processes required by a subsequent test (in this case, memory) match (Leshner & Coyle, 1996; Roediger, Weldon, & Challis,1989; Tulving, 1983). The secondary task reaction time is best interpreted as an index of the mental resources available at the encoding stage of processing (Lang, 2000; Lang & Basil, 1998). Recognition memory best indexes the extent to which information is encoded. Thus, the measures of attention and memory in this study both address the encoding processes of watching television news.
We posit the following:
H1: A story labeled as breaking will increase attention and memory.
H2: A story labeled as live will increase attention and memory.
H3: Attention and memory will be highest for stories that contain visuals that evoke anger, followed in order by fear, then disgust.
RQ1: Is there an interaction between live,breaking,and emotion on attention and memory?
Method
Participants
Approximately 60 university students will be asked to watch a newscast in which the experimental manipulations will be presented.
Design and independent variables
The design of this within subjects experiment is a 3 (story type: traditional/live/breaking) X 3 (emotion: anger/fear/disgust) partial factorial within design. Both story type and emotion type will be within-subjects factors, but each participant will not see all nine possible combinations, but rather three. The set of combinations that a given participant will see represents a three-level between-subjects factor, which will be handled by counterbalancing. Presentation order will be handled by a Latin Square design so that each order of story-emotion combination will have an equal change of being represented.
Dependent Measures
Attention will be indexed by a secondary task reaction time task. Audio tones will be synchronized to the newscasts and will be presented at random intevals. Participants will be asked to watch the newscast (primary task) and press a button (secondary task) as quickly as they can when they hear an audio tone. Memory will be tested with a visual recognition task in which participants will be asked to discriminate between targets (were present in the newscast) and foils (were not present in the newscast). Accuracy and latency of responses will be recorded.
Stimulus Construction and Materials
Videotaped stories will be obtained by the researchers professional contacts at local TV stations throughout the country and from the RTNDA archive at the researchers home department. A videotape with approximately 30 stories depicting a wide range of live coverage will be prepared. Stories will selected for pretest that contain a video segment that includes images of destruction, injury, and suffering. The tape will be shown to approximately 30-40 undergraduate students (although two groups of students may be needed to rate stories depending on the total length of the story samples). Students will rate the stories using a pencil and paper questionnaire on three seven-point Likert-type response scales, one each for anger, fear, and disgust (Newhagen, 1998). Stories will be chosen according two categorization analytical techniques: factor analysis and comparative mean differences (e.g., stories that have mean ratings high on disgust, but low on both anger and fear would be candidates for the disgust condition).
Three examples of each of the three emotions will be selected for inclusion in the main study. One version of the each story will serve as the traditional story. Two additional versions of each will be created by superimposing a graphic to denote either live or breaking news. Stories will be edited so that they each run approximately two minutes. Each of these versions will contain video that the pretest showed to elicit either anger, fear, or disgust. Three stories that represent three combinations of story type and emotion will be edited into an already existing newscast and will appear among other, non target, stories. The entire stimulus tape will run approximately 20 minutes.
Procedure
Participants will be asked to come to the research laboratory to participate in a study on how people watch television news. They will be told that they will watch a newscast, but first, the secondary task will be explained. Participants will be instructed to watch a newscast while monitoring the audio for a tone. When they hear a tone, they should press a button on a box attached to a computer as quickly as they can. After the entire newscast (including the three target news stories) are viewed participants will undergo a practice and the main sessions of the recognition memory task. Participants will then be debriefed and thanked.
Equipment
Audio tones and the secondary task reaction times will be generated and compiled respectively by Psyscope (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993) a psychological software program that will run on a Macintosh (G3) computer. Psyscope can generate the tones and collect the RT to +/- 1 msec. The button box will be connected to the computer. When the audio tone is sounded, the internal clock in the computer will begin. When the button on the button box is pressed, the internal clock stops. The latency time is then stored in a data file in Psyscope.
Recognition memory will also be indexed by Psyscope. Participants will be presented pictures on a computer screen, half that were presented in the newscast half that were not. Participants accuracy and latency will be recorded and stored in a data file in Psyscope.

2003-0363,Human Smiles: Expression of Emotion or Communication Gesture?,Paper,Human Smiles: Expression of Emotion or Communication Gesture?,"This study examined whether the smile was an indicator of felt positive emotion, or simply a communicative gesture independent of emotional state. We replicated an experiment by Fridlund (1991) where we showed participants humor-inducing video clips in three conditions varying in social contact - while alone, or when they believed a friend was watching the same video in a different room, or while they were in the same room with another participant. We videotaped participants unobtrusively, and classified the smiles into nonenjoyment smiles, consisting of zygomatic major action, and enjoyment smiles, consisting of zygomatic major action plus orbicularis oculi action. We also measured their self-report of happiness. We found that unlike Fridlund (1991), the number of smiles did not vary as a function of social contact. Moreover, we found, consistent with previous work by Ekman, Davidson, & Friesen (1990), that only enjoyment smiles consistently, across all social contact conditions, correlated with self-report of happiness, whereas nonenjoyment smiles did not. These results support the finding that one type of smile is an indicator of emotional state, and suggest a more complicated relationship between smiling and communication."

Researchers studying the ways individuals use this medium have access to an incredible amount and diversity of data  the recorded Internet conversations of millions of individuals (netizens). Unfortunately, many netizens do not understand that conversations in chat rooms and on list servers are accessed easily by those outside the group, including researchers (Sharf, 1999). As more conversations of individuals are used to study the community of the Internet and the behaviors of its citizens, researchers are faced with ethical concerns in the gathering, analysis, and publishing of this information.
This paper explores a few of these concerns, focusing on the study of human communication that occurs naturally on the Internet."

Rather, people use intuitive notions of media dependency when they estimate the influence of media on different groups of others. Using data from a survey of two samples regarding perceptions of influence of media coverage of development towns in Israel, it is demonstrated that the distance of a group from development towns (rather than distance form the self) predicts the magnitude of the expected effects on that group."

This research assessed users by their degree of loneliness, and further investigated interpersonal relationship including the perceived interdependence, breadth, depth, code change, and commitment of those surveyed.
This research indicates three outcomes. First, the current study showed that hypothesized links between loneliness and interpersonal relationship including the perceived interdependence, depth, code change, predictability/understanding, and commitment in CMC situation were partially supported. Second, however, it presents that there is a significant association between loneliness and interpersonal relationship. Lastly, CMC users who have greater loneliness are likely to have more specialized ways of communicating in CMC situations."

The Dutch Experience,"After a brief review of the existing literature from Europe and North America on ethnicity as a possible predictor of the ownership and use of media, with the emphasis on new media, there follows a review of the most significant results from a limited survey on the subject in the Netherlands. With this, the main focus is on a school survey in which ethno-cultural position in comparison with the common socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, SES (Social Economic Status) and education are tested on the extent to which they predict access to primarily new media at home and ownership in the bedroom on the one hand and to media applications and functions on the other hand. In order to better understand a number of results from the school survey that cannot be further interpreted, the results of in-depth interviews on media use and the forming and perception of identity within young ethnic minority groups will be presented. It is the intention to create a so-called integration-promoting, or rather homeland-oriented profile of media use, while keeping in mind four types of identity (religious, ethnic, national and cultural) and various patterns of media consumption (time spent, genre preferences, etc.) for the tested minority groups. Finally, the most visible policy guidelines in current Dutch media and minority policy will be described."

An ethnographic reception study is undertaken among thirteen focus groups of multicultural women after viewing two South African situation comedies. Cultural and ideological information supplied by the viewers is analysed to explain their subjectivity. The groups included White, English and Afrikaans speaking, Hindu and Zulu women. The role of class, race, and gender as elements of democracy in the ""New"" South Africa connects to the subject and the social context indicating how consensus can be a variable and laughter can achieve a moment of cultural reconciliation."

This study extends their work by examining through structural equation modeling how students manage threats to face within compliance-gaining situations involving two different influence goals: giving advice versus asking favors. Results for perceived face threats are largely consistent with the revised analysis but suggest further investigation, especially of relationships between face threats and motivations for reason giving. Comparisons with Brown and Levinson's (1987) politeness theory, as well as implications for future research, are drawn."
2003-0371,Identity Types and Organizational Contexts: An Inquiry into Physicians in Organizations,Paper,Identity Types and Organizational Contexts: An Inquiry into Physicians in Organizations,"In this study, we examined how physicians in different organizational contexts view themselves and their world. We interviewed 43 physicians in three organizational contexts, solo/partnership, group and an HMO-type staff-model multi-specialty clinic. Data from these interviews were collected and analyzed according to the constant comparative method as described by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and later refined by Lincoln and Guba (1985) in search of themes derived from the data and enlightened by extant literature. These themes were first used to answer specific research questions, but in addressing these questions, we discovered a more global interpretive scheme that provides a context for understanding the research questions
We discovered that while these physicians viewed their world in distinct ways, patterns did emerge from a general set of identity constructs to form seven internally cohesive identity types divided primarily along lines of external, environmental issues, indicating the multifaceted and contextual nature of organizational identity."
2003-0372,"Ideology, Attitude Change, and Deliberation in Small Groups",Paper,"Ideology, Attitude Change, and Deliberation in Small Groups","Previous research has found that face-to-face deliberation can result in aggregate shifts in participants political views. What is less well known is how such attitude changes interrelate with one another and vary depending on individual attributes and the nature of a groups deliberation. The present study extends prior research on these subjects by exploring the relationship between participant ideology and attitude change in small, face-to-face groups. To test a set of hypotheses and research questions, 57 zero-history experimental groups discussed three different public problems for 30-60 minutes, and each participant completed pre- and post-discussion questionnaires. Results showed that participant ideology had a clear association with changes on specific discussion-related issues, but participants from every ideological group experienced increased differentiation of ideologically distinct attitudes. It was also found that group-level shifts in opinion were related to self-reported democratic deliberation, though not to observer ratings of deliberation. The conclusion discusses these and other findings in relation to future research and programs designed to promote public deliberation."

Frightening Movies and Enduring Emotional Memory,"To explore lingering effects of frightening media, 530 papers written by students were reviewed. Students could write about their own or another person's fright reaction. Almost all (93%) students wrote about their own experience, and 91 1escribed fiction or fantasy rather than real content. Of the 91 papers written about the four movies cited most frequently, 46% reported an effect on bedtime behavior (e.g., sleep disturbances) and 75% reported effects on waking life (e.g., anxiety in related situations). Among the prominent effects on waking life were difficulty swimming after ""Jaws"" (in lakes and pools as well as the ocean), uneasiness around clowns, televisions, and trees after ""Poltergeist,"" avoidance of camping and the woods following ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and anxiety when home alone after ""Scream."" More than 1/3 of the papers reported effects continuing to the present. These consequences are discussed in the context of research on emotional memory."

To explore this, this study adopts two predictors (economic significance and political significance) and tests their relationships with media coverage about foreign nations. International news coverage about 49 countries in 10 Korean newspapers was analyzed. The hypothesis was tested on the relationships between political and economic significance and visibility and valence toward the country. The findings indicated that there is a significant positive relationship between media visibility and political and economic significance of foreign countries, but not between media valence and political and economic significance. Suggestions for future study as well as several implications on theory and methodology are discussed drawing on the experience of this study."

In contrast to the warm, enlightened, and idyllic suburb of countless other American family dramas and sitcoms, The Simpsonss Springfield is a dark zone of xenophobia, provincialism, and dysfunction, a realm where American life is satirised and held up to ridicule. However, if the family sitcom has traditionally been a major tool for exporting the American Dream and all that is supposed to be comfortable about capitalism, this paper asks what we are to make of the success of The Simpsonss anti-suburb moving across the globe. The paper mixes textual analysis with audience research of non-Americans watching The Simpsons to connect with, contribute to, and further complicate debates on cultural imperialism and Americanisation."

However, not all students enter college with a sound preparation in CMC technologies. Those with little access to computers and the Internet can be left behind the technologically competent, the key concern of the ""digital divide."" This project examines a new means of addressing the digital divide that focuses on initial encounters between the technologically inexperienced and the instructional technologies themselves. Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory, which describes the anxiety and uncertainty felt when individuals experience a different culture (Gudykunst, 1988, 1995), is used to understand inexperienced users' contact with technology as that contact might generate similar stresses that can interfere with effective communication. If so, the technologically inexperienced may avoid opportunities to increase their technological competence or hold negative attitudes that can undermine persistence and achievement. Thus, mere exposure to technology may not be enough to narrow the digital divide. Mediated forms of immediacy are examined as a means of attracting and motivating the technologically inexperienced to engage the technologies as a first step toward building their skills. Results indicate that mediated forms of immediacy predict lower uncertainty, higher motivation, and greater affective learning involving a TI course. Overall, the results provide evidence that efforts to narrow the digital divide by providing technology access can be strengthened by incorporating mediated immediacy."

2003-0379,'IM Me': Instant Messaging as Relational Maintenance and Everyday Communication,Paper,'IM Me': Instant Messaging as Relational Maintenance and Everyday Communication,"Few studies to date have examined the use of Internet applications in enacting everyday routine relational maintenance and even fewer assess how such tools converge or replace other, more traditional forms of communication to sustain involvements. The present study is exploratory in nature and examines the role of one such tool, instant messaging (IM), in relational maintenance. Participants (N = 402) reported their general use of IM (stage 1) and subsequently conducted and reported on a specific interaction occurring either through IM or face-to-face (stage 2). Analyses indicated IM users were younger, had used the Internet for a longer period, and spent more time on-line per session than their counterparts. Among IM users, significant differences in every communication also emerged according to gender and the types of relationships maintained. Findings also indicate that IM is being utilized in conjunction with other richer communication channels. New research opportunities for examining the relational maintenance processes employing IM technologies are advanced."

Research on text comprehension indicates that people construct mental models of the story. This paper proposes a mental models approach to understanding the effects of brand placement on memory for, and attitude toward, the brand. This approach, along with research on the relationship between memory and judgments, indicates when brand placements will be successful."

It has been applied in communication area and more specifically media research. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to examine the application and implication of SEM in causal relationship testing in mass media research through the content analysis of published papers from journals of communication area. Eight communication-related journals, Communication Research, Communication Monographs, Human Communication Research, Journal of Advertising, Journal of Advertising Research, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Journal of Communication, Journalism and Mass communication Quarterly, were selected and all the issues from 1982 to 2001 were searched for use of SEM. Throughout all eight journals¡¯ issues from 20 years, 83 articles were identified as using SEM analysis and among them more than half of the articles (N=47, 56.6%) were concerned about media in their causal analysis."
2003-0383,Improving computer efficacy and perceptions of technology related careers in the classroom: A case study,Paper,Improving computer efficacy and perceptions of technology related careers in the classroom: A case study,"This study utilized social cognitive theory to make predictions regarding the relationship between computing self-efficacy and perceptions of computing careers and the relationship between general media use and confidence in utilizing computers. Furthermore, predictions were made about the effect of a computer technology class on students' computer self-efficacy and perceptions of computing careers. Utilizing a pretest/post test design with a non-technology class as the control group, we found that overall, computer self-efficacy was positively related to positive perceptions of a computing career. Furthermore, advanced computer users had greater efficacy but, interestingly, did not have more positive perceptions of computing careers. In terms of media use, we found that those who use media for instrumental purposes but not those who use media ritualistically are more likely to feel a greater sense of computer self efficacy. Lastly, participation in the computer technology class had a positive impact on computing self-efficacy but did not appear to effect perceptions of computing careers. Potential implications for computing technology courses and for the field are discussed."

Understanding intercultural differences helps managers to function more effectively on multicultural teams. Comparing U.S. and Russian managers, this study empirically determined a relationship between the level of intercultural communication competence and the performance of multicultural teams, determined how managers viewed cross-communication competence, and identified the perceived importance of the intercultural communication competence components. This study explores the dynamics of multicultural teams, delves into the cultural origins of intercultural communication, and employs the Integrated Intercultural Communication Competence Model to provide practical results."
2003-0385,"Income, Education, Location and the Internet--The Digital Divide in China",Paper,"Income, Education, Location and the Internet--The Digital Divide in China","This paper examines the inequality of Internet use in China. Based on the official survey of Internet use and demographical statistics, the author finds that the Internet is still a privilege of a small group of people. Among many demographical features, income, education and location are three influential factors of the digital divide. The paper gives the insight of the distorted relationship between these three demographical factors and Internet use. While the majority of Chinese suffers from low income and few opportunities of education and job, the majority of Internet users are people of high income and high education. The regional distribution of Internet users corresponds to resource disparity of different geographical areas. The paper further analyzes the social-economic structure and Internet policy that lead to the digital divide. The paper suggests that, to bridge the digital divide, the Chinese government has to work out a way balancing economic development and human development in terms of Internet policy."

Unfortunately, limited attention has been paid to the manner in which readers with different international travel experiences incorporate, reject or transform information provided in travel articles. Accordingly, this study approached The New York Times travel section from the prism of a locality -- Portugal.
The examination of the reception processes was conducted through the use of focus groups. The analysis of the focus groups transcripts revealed similarities as well as differences in the reading and understanding of the travel articles. Similarities were found in the extent to which focus group participants perceived and accepted notions of intimacy and trust between the writer and the reader, and the writer and the host, as well as in the rejection of conventional articles as too old and the contemporary articles as too modern. Furthermore, analysis of the focus groups revealed differences in terms of how participants articulated authenticity, as well as the role of the author as an outsider, the central point in the description of a particular destination and its cultural identity, and finally the extent to which the participants articulated the notion of a pleasurable vacation."
2003-0387,In Defense of Framing Theory: Bringing Hegemony Back In,Paper,In Defense of Framing Theory: Bringing Hegemony Back In,"One of the contested concepts in the repertoire of methodologies currently in vogue in mass communication research is framing. Its attractions for political communication scholars, as well as its problems, are grounded in its location at the borderlands between methods, commonly characterized as the qualitative/ quantitative divide. As the idea of framing has been pulled out of the critical/cultural studies tradition, some researchers have tried to fashion frame analysis based on traditional quantitative techniques. But to lift framing completely out of the qualitative context in which it evolved is to irreparably hollow out its usefulness as a concept for approaching an understanding of mass communication as a total environment. If the cultural connections to hegemony that are the core of the concept were consistently maintained as the foundation of research into frames at whatever level was of interest, many of the supposed problems of frame analysis would simply fade away."

This can be particularly difficult for an organization when one of the stakeholders is directly indicting an organization?s legitimacy. Thus the central purpose of the experiment is to explore the question: How does stakeholder valence and threat to legitimacy affect the evaluation of an organization? The present study involves a 2 (stakeholder valence) x 2 (type of legitimacy threat) web-based design. Results indicate: (1) organizational communication needs to consider stakeholder relationship management in multiple contexts; (2) the image of the indicted organization is affected to a greater extent by conflict in a stakeholder relationship than the image of the indicting organization; and (3) the presence of an adversarial relationship between two organizations is necessary to inspire public action."
2003-0390,Individual Differences in Internet Usage Motives,Paper,Individual Differences in Internet Usage Motives,"Abstract

The relationship between the psychobiological model of personality types (psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism) devised by Eysenck & Eysenck (1985) and Internet use and usage motives was examined. A sample of 210 undergraduate students were asked to report on their motives for using the Internet and how often they engaged in a variety of Internet and web-based activities. The findings demonstrate distinctive patterns of Internet use and usage motives for those of different personality types. Specifically, those scoring high in neuroticism reported using the Internet to feel a sense of belonging and to be informed. Extraverts rejected the communal aspects of the Internet, and made more instrumental and goal-oriented use of Internet services. Finally, those scoring high in psychoticism demonstrated an interest in more deviant, defiant, and sophisticated Internet applications. Implications of the findings as well as suggestions for future research are included."

Influences on Career Development:
A Critical Incident Analysis
Abstract
This study was conducted to increase current knowledge of career development and factors that influence such development. The literature reviewed includes research from the areas of organizational theory, communication networks, organizational identification, and organizational culture. The participants were managers in two different organizations, one a public agency and one from private industry. The data was collected using an interpretive approach, with the participants providing the data in open-ended interviews. According to the participants in this study, interpersonal interactions, particularly those with superiors and friends/family are significant in career changes. Organizational features also were referenced by a majority of participants. Individual aspects such as skills and education were also identified as influential in participants career development. The results are discussed in light of current research in communication networks and organizational identification. The paper concludes by exploring directions for future research based upon the results of this study.

2003-0392,"Informatics, Cyberpunk, and Nation-States: Behind Narratives of Globalization and Technology",Paper,"Informatics, Cyberpunk, and Nation-States: Behind Narratives of Globalization and Technology","What can cyberpunk literature begin to tell us about shifting conceptions of the self and the national that can help us understand nation-state transformations? Where does this lead us in re-conceptualizing the nation-state? To accomplish this task  this paper will address four fundamental areas. First, the paper will look at the relevance of cyberpunk to the discussion of the national, and the validity of representational studies for international phenomenon. Second, the paper will contrast assertions about what cyberpunk is fundamentally representing with more celebratory notions of the information technology and political participation. In addition, it will survey some of the more sophisticated post-sovereign (Scholte, 2000; Everard, 2000) visions of nation-state transformations, given their capacity as identity-forming structures. Finally, the paper will tie together cyberpunk representations with current articulations of the paradigm shift that is empirically visible in the actions of nation-states such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Two novels in particular: Neuromancer by William Gibson and Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson will be used repeatedly as references."
2003-0393,Information and Communication Traffic Patterns on Dutch Political Web Sites,Paper,Information and Communication Traffic Patterns on Dutch Political Web Sites,"This study examines the degree to which four types of communication patterns - allocution, consultation, registration, and conversation - are present on the Web sites of the ten major political parties during the political campaign prior to the Dutch national elections held on May 15, 2002. The four communication patterns, derived from Bordewijk and Van Kaam's (1984; 1986) typology of information traffic, may have application and value during a political campaign. Although Internet is very much a consultative medium, where people can find whatever they want, but have to search for it actively, more allocutive or transmissional and registrative elements will be found. Because of the political function these Web sites have, special attention is given to the degree of conversation, which can be oriented toward political deliberation and discourse. In a content analysis of Dutch party Web sites, conducted two weeks before the elections, and one week before the assassination of the frontman of one of the parties, the degree to which these types of communication are present is examined. Based on previous studies on the use of the Internet by political parties in the Netherlands, it is anticipated that the types of communication present on the Web sites differ considerably between the political parties. It is hypothesized that left/progressive parties are more inclined to use conversational types of communication on the Web, whereas right/conservative parties will use allocutive/transmissional types of communication. This hypothesis receives support from the data. Another hypothesis, that the amount of effort that has to be put in maintaining the Web site is positively correlated by the degree to which the party depends on a volatile or new electorate, is falsified."
2003-0394,Information overload? Health advertisement context instability and memory hindrance,Paper,Information overload? Health advertisement context instability and memory hindrance,"Health communication practitioners now have a sophisticated array of editing technologies available to develop strategic communication efforts. Our understanding of how humans engage the products of those efforts, however, is far from complete. One variable that highlights the potential contrast between the rapid development of media technology and the more gradual pace of human evolution is the notion of context instability. Context instability refers to the degree to which media content depicts different locations in time or space in succession, e.g., 21st century Harlem and 19th century Bolivia in adjacent frames. After explicating why this variable should be related to individual memory for content, this paper presents nationally representative data from a public health campaign intended for U.S. adolescents as evidence. Both the measurement of context instability in health advertisements and the demonstrated relationship between context instability and memory are noteworthy for health communication scholars."
2003-0395,Information Seeking of Health-Related Web Sites,Paper,Information Seeking of Health-Related Web Sites,"Two aspects of Web credibility were investigated: the relationship between perceived credibility, demographic characteristics, media variables, and information-seeking behavior; and factors that contribute to health-information seeking on the Web. Participants actively searched the Web for health-related information under two search conditions. Internet self-efficacy, utility, and perceived credibility were significant predictors of health information-seeking on the Web. Differences in perceived Web credibility were also found for previous experience in using the Web for gathering health information and disclosure of personal information. Participants who had previously searched the Web for health information and participants who had disclosed personal information online perceived the Web to be more credible than those who did not engage in these activities."

The purpose of this study is to investigate how multimedia features affect Web users¡¯ portal preference as a function of innovativeness, by analyzing Web users¡¯ cognitive processes during the use of a portal dominated with text and graphic features and a portal dominated with integrated multimedia features.
Findings show that Web users across personal innovativeness levels have more higher-level cognitive processing and more favorable thoughts at a portal dominated with text and graphic features, whereas they have more lower-level cognitive processing and less favorable thoughts at a portal dominated with integrated multimedia features. Web users have more favorable experience in evaluation and elaboration at a portal dominated with text and graphic features, and they have less favorable experience in each type of cognitive processes at a portal dominated with integrated multimedia features."

Results of multivariate and Structural Equation Modeling analyses confirmed that inoculation works through threat and counterarguing to confer resistance. In addition, results indicated that cognitive and affective-anger inoculation treatments immediately render attitudes more accessible and, in time, that inoculation treatments modify the manifest content of associative networks by planting new content nodes and/or by strengthening the perceived salience of existing nodes. Finally, the results revealed that counterarguing output increases up to 34 days following administration of an inoculation treatment and then levels off, suggesting that inoculations effects are quite robust."
2003-0398,"In Search for an Organizational Template: Double Interacts, Adjacency Pairs and Schemata",Paper,"In Search for an Organizational Template: Double Interacts, Adjacency Pairs and Schemata","Starting from a comparison between the concepts of ""double interact"" proposed by Weick (1979) and ""adjacency pair"" identified by conversation analysts (Sacks & Schegloff, 1979), this article examines how communication contributes to the achievement of spatio-temporal closures through the interactional enactment of sequences called ""schemata."" Through turn takings, members not only bring into being, but also contribute to the closing of organizational sequences, which constitute and circumscribe what gets done collectively. Timing and spacing thus consist of creating and re-producing what could be called organizational closures, that is, spatiotemporal limits that indicate when and where specific organizational episodes are initiated, fulfilled and sanctioned. Organizational spaces and times are thus achieved and delineated through interactions, a phenomenon that will be illustrated through the in-depth analysis of a radio-transmission that involved police officers trying to locate and rescue one of their colleagues."
2003-0399,In search of Europe: The European Union in national television news,Paper,In search of Europe: The European Union in national television news,"This study is a cross-nationally comparative investigation of the coverage of EU politics in national television news. The study identifies key characteristics of the coverage and initially investigates influences shaping the coverage. The study suggests that, in the majority of countries studied, EU politics is marginal in national television news and that EU officials are virtually absent from the news. However, when the EU is covered, EU politics is more prominent than other political news. Three influences were found to positively contribute to the amount and prominence of EU news: it was more prominent in public broadcasting news programs, in countries with higher levels of public satisfaction with democracy and in countries with polarized elite opinion about the EU. Similarly, the visibility of EU officials in television news was highest in public news programs, even when controlling for the potentially mediating factor of amount of news about the EU. The findings suggest that, with EU coverage being of invisible importance and without protagonists, the Europeanization of television news coverage is rather wishful thinking than reality."

In this text, I incorporate multiple voices, both from the researchers and participants perspectives. Excerpts from interviews, conversations, poems, and reflexive journals offer the voices in this text. These voices are woven throughout the text introducing the identity concepts of representation, invitation, and invasion in various forms. The purpose of this ethnography was to explore and describe aspects of Mexican identity as they related to cultural spaces within Mexico. In delving deep into the identity constructs of my participants, I delved equally deep, though accidentally, into my own identity as a White, English-speaking, female researcher. The outcome is a dual text addressing both Mexican identity and my own emergent identity as researcher. The ethnography unfolds making salient the difficult identity borders I encountered while trying to explore Mexican identity and cultural space."
2003-0401,"Instant Identity: Girls, Adolescence and Negotiation of Identity in the New Culture of Instant Messaging",Paper,"Instant Identity: Girls, Adolescence and Negotiation of Identity in the New Culture of Instant Messaging","Recent studies show that millions of adolescent girls in the past few years have turned to a relatively new real-time communication technology, Instant Messaging, as a primary means of communication with their peers. This raises intriguing questions about how adolescent girls  a group that historically was placed at the margins of study  may use Instant Messaging to negotiate and articulate identity at a particularly turbulent time in their lives. This preliminary study uses the qualitative methods of interview and narrative analysis to investigate this phenomenon with a framework grounded in poststructuralist feminist theory and cultural studies views of identity construction. Its findings suggest adolescent girls have come up with creative uses for the technology that are at once empowering to them but also suggest adherence to patriarchal cultural norms."
2003-0402,INTERACTIVE TELEVISION OR ENHANCED TELEVISION?,Paper,INTERACTIVE TELEVISION OR ENHANCED TELEVISION?,"This paper is both an analysis of the phenomenon of interactive television with background concepts of interactivity and television and a report of an empirical investigation among Dutch users of set-top-box ITV. In the analytic part a distinction is made between levels of interactivity in the applications of ITV. Activities labelled as selection, customisation, transaction and reaction reveal low levels of interactivity. They may be called enhanced television. They are extensions of existing television programmes that keep their linear character. Activities called production and conversation have the potential of higher interactivity. They may lead to real interactive television as the user input makes a difference to programmes. It is suggested that so-called hybrid ITV TV combined with telephone and email reply channels- and (broadband) Internet ITV offer better opportunities for high interactivity than set-top-box ITV.
The empirical investigation shows that the demand of subscribers to set-top-box ITV in the Netherlands matches supply. They favour the less interactive applications of selection and reaction. Other striking results are that young subscribers appreciate interactive applications more than the older ones and that those with a low level of education prefer these applications more than high educated subscribers. No significant gender differences were found."

We look at one type of interactivity, user-authorship of content appearing on news? web sites, and concentrate on two factors shaping this type of interactivity: the production context in which user-authoring features are built and their content hosted, and the user constituencies to which these features are aimed. We study the effect that variations in these two factors have had in two prominent manifestations of user-authorship in online news, New Jersey Online?s Community Connection and Slashdot.org. We find that while both sites enable user-driven information construction, the modes of user-authorship that materialized on each site differed considerably, partly as a result of variations in production contexts and user constituencies."

Though much progress has been made in this area of research since Hall (1959), a satisfactory model of ICC and a scale that translates well into different cultures is yet to be developed. This paper presents a review of past research in ICC and describes an exploratory study that is an initial attempt at identifying variables that contribute towards perceived ICC. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with participants representing fifteen different countries and responses were analyzed using semantic network analysis. A definition of intercultural communication was derived from the responses, and knowledge and motivation were identified as important components of ICC. Limitations of the study and implications for future research are discussed."

The underlying premise is that public relations is a culturally bound practice that will functionally differ depending on the originating country, but which also must take into account the cultural norms and expectations of target audiences.
The coding instrument measures dialogic function (i.e., how open and interactive); how easy the site is to navigate; what features are supplied to journalists to help build the media agenda; and how well issues of communicating across cultural boundaries and expectations are addressed. Many results were unexpected and suggest Middle Eastern practitioners are relying on a personal relations model that takes advantage of the lack of a media gatekeeper on the web but not of the web's media agenda-building capacities."

It is attempting to transition from a traditional, American-oriented student newspaper into one that reflects the wide diversity of the student body on campus, both in content and style. The transition has been accompanied by practical problems and intercultural/philosophical difficulties. Of most immediate concern is the problem of agreeing what news is and what newspapers ought to be for a multicultural audience. The objective of the present paper, which is written by the newspaper¡¦s advisor, is to provide insight into possibilities and problems involved with questioning traditional definitions of news in training future journalists. Specifically, this paper examines the gap and tension between increasing the multicultural emphasis of the newspaper and sustaining operations in the newsroom. This paper discusses the program curriculum, news value decisions, the information gathering process, the hiring process, and general challenges of diversity issues in a student newspaper."

Although a majority of sites collected personal identifying information, only 37.8 0x1rovided any form of disclosure of privacy practices. Internet media sites and magazine sites were more likely to include a privacy policy statement than other media types. The use of cookies was prevalent, with 68.41003410535f sites implementing this cryptic form of information collection. Less than half of these sites disclosed such practices, with the majority of cookies originating from third party tracking or for advertising purposes. Dailies and Internet sites were more likely to set cookies than other media types. Among sites that addressed fair information practices, choice and redress appeared most frequently, followed by access, security, and data integrity. Discrepancy between information practices and information disclosure are discussed with respect to Internet self-regulation and findings from the Federal Trade Commission."

This article presents eight models in use--public schools, public libraries, cybermobiles, public housing, community technology centers, community networks, kiosks, and cyber cafés--and analyzes them using a common set of criteria to illustrate better the strengths and limitations of each. The article concludes by suggesting that communities may wish to develop collaborative strategies with multiple organizations at local, state, and federal levels to increase Internet public access for disadvantaged groups. Additionally, it is concluded that further research, as identified in this paper, is needed to assess the effectiveness of these models in order to obtain a clearer picture of how well they work individually and in combination with one another."

Interpersonal attraction between strangers has been attributed to attitudinal similarity. Many Internet applications available today tacitly employ the attitudes similarity mechanism, allowing one to actively search for people on the basis of shared interests and opinions. Recreating an environment where subjects are made to think they are signing up for an instant messenger service, this experimental study examined the effects of attitude similarity, gender similarity and trust on the level interpersonal attraction between participants and virtual persons whom they expected to meet online. Among female respondents there was a main effect for gender similarity, and a fully crossed interaction between trust and attitude similarity, after controlling for the participants own online deceptiveness. Females who trusted the veracity of personal information revealed online were more attracted to persons with dissimilar attitudes than similar ones. Females with a low degree of trust for personal revelations online were more attracted to those with similar attitudes. There were no significant effects among male participants."
2003-0415,Interpersonal Interaction in Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) : Exploratory Qualitative Research based on Critical Review of the Existing Theories,Paper,Interpersonal Interaction in Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) : Exploratory Qualitative Research based on Critical Review of the Existing Theories,"The existing theories about the interpersonal interaction in computer-mediated communication (CMC) were categorized into three perspectives (impersonal, personal and hyperpersonal interaction), and evaluated. One of the main critiques about the previous studies based on those perspectives, however, was that they have only focused on quantitative elements such as the amount, time and rate of message exchanged in the interpersonal CMC. Based on such critique, this study performed qualitative research of the university students¡¯ diverse instant messaging (IM) usage behaviors and attitudes. As hyperpersonal interaction perspective predicted, students had high degree of interpersonal interaction through IM. However, the degree of the interpersonal interaction experienced by students varied depending on how they perceived and used IM, from considering IM as a casual communication channel to using it as a relationship management or filtering tool. This study found that the degree of the interpersonal interaction in CMC is determined by diverse factors such as users¡¯ motives, communication types, or the degree of users¡¯ participations in communication, rather than only by the characteristics of the communication medium."
2003-0416,Intersubjectivity in public radio feature production: Blurring the border between I and They,Paper,Intersubjectivity in public radio feature production: Blurring the border between I and They,"In light of the conference theme, the author presents findings on the mundane intersubjectivity that is assumed and employed by journalists producing features for public radio. A qualitative, interpretive study of their recollections of the production process revealed a repertoire of intrapersonal communicating by which they bridge the gap(s) engendered by news assignments. Despite the abundance of objectifying and instrumental frames (They-assuming) that were readily uttered by respondents when questioned about audiences, there recurred a strong theme of intersubjectivity in the journalists theorizing about their work. This prior assumption of equivalent understanding gets played out in I-assuming forms of imagining the audience and in sharing motivesespecially in the sense of experience-transfer. Intersubjectivity also could be inferred from the way they relate to sources, to the extent that the journalists believe they can voice those peoples perspectives."
2003-0417,Intertextual Translations: Organizational Change and Discourse in a High-Tech Corporation,Paper,Intertextual Translations: Organizational Change and Discourse in a High-Tech Corporation,"Scholarship in organizational change studies has offered many models of phases or stages through which organizational members progress as they arrive at a change. In this traditional perspective, change is the exception to the ordinarily stagnant state of organizational life. An alternative is to reverse the analytic point of interest between static organization and change--to assume change and the ubiquitous dynamic nature of organization and to examine how organization is an attempt at freezing meaning. Taking a discourse perspective, this essay argues that organizational change occurs, in part, in the performance of intertextuality, or the repeated voices of other organizational members. Three kinds of intertextuality are discussed: voices of past speech, voices of absent speech, and voices of future speech. Through the incorporation of other voices into their own, members make translations between organizational practices, identities, and utterances. It is this translation practice that allows organizational change to be conceptualized as a shift in the ways that people talk."
2003-0418,In the EU's Image: Transformation of Broadcasting in Five Central and Eastern European Countries,Paper,In the EU's Image: Transformation of Broadcasting in Five Central and Eastern European Countries,"The European Union (EU) has sought to free up its common internal broadcasting market, while guarding against media concentration, with the aim of promoting media pluralism and cultural diversity. Member States have harmonized their national broadcasting policies with transfrontier EU directives. Likewise, post-communist Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEECs) that desire EU membership have aligned their broadcasting policies with EU directives. The case study reported here looks at five candidate CEECs that have created the competitive markets for broadcasting envisioned by the EU: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. Until the end of the 1980s the broadcasting systems in these five countries were monopolies controlled by the states. Ten years later dual systems of public and commercial broadcasting were in place. This report examines the influence of the EU's cultural and audiovisual policies, particularly the ""Television Without Frontiers"" (TWF) Directive, on changes in the candidate countries' domestic broadcasting policies and institutions. The research employed quantitative and qualitative methodologies, triangulating historical documents, existing statistical data, and interviews with key players involved in the accession negotiation process. The results illustrate the typology of positive, negative, and framing integration described by Knill and Lehmkill (1999) and apply Börzel and Risse's (2000) ""logics"" of domestic change. The conclusion raises questions about the appropriateness of the economic measures used in the screening process to determine whether TWF promotes cultural diversity in the candidate countries. Alternative methods from communication research traditions, such as textual analysis and audience studies, are suggested to measure cultural diversity."
2003-0419,In the Public Interest: How the First Amendment Could Protect the Press from Newsgathering Torts,Paper,In the Public Interest: How the First Amendment Could Protect the Press from Newsgathering Torts,"The Supreme Court's finding in Cohen v. Cowles Media Co. in 1991 that tort actions under generally applicable laws raise no First Amendment issues when used to recover damages for the press's newsgathering tactics has created confusion in the lower courts and increased liability for aggressive newsgathering. Liability has been found to attach to the media even when stories served the public interest by uncovering corporate wrongdoing. This paper argues that the press should vigorously challenge the assumptions behind Cohen that the press has no more First Amendment rights than the general public. The press also should force the courts to confront the inconsistencies created by broad First Amendment protection for expression but little or no protection for information gathering. The paper also argues that another generally applicable law - the ""tester's privilege"" - may hold hope as an effective defense against tort actions over undercover newsgathering techniques."
2003-0420,Intimacy and Appraisals of Irritations in Dating Relationships,Paper,Intimacy and Appraisals of Irritations in Dating Relationships,"Mounting evidence suggests that the transition from casual to serious involvement coincides with increased conflict and emotional negativity within romantic relationships; we argue that this turbulence is also manifest in people's appraisals of irritating relationship circumstances. In addition, we identify relational uncertainty and interference from partners as mechanisms that may explain why people attribute heightened degrees of severity and relationship threat to irritations occurring at moderate levels of intimacy. We conducted a cross-sectional study in which individuals evaluated potential irritations that had recently occurred in their dating relationship. As predicted, appraisals were (a) curvilinearly associated with intimacy, and (b) positively associated with both relational uncertainty and interference from partners. Contrary to our expectations, neither relational uncertainty nor interference from partners mediated the curvilinear trajectory between appraisals and intimacy. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the functions and foundations of appraisals of irritating circumstances within dating relationships."

This tendency to self-objectify, in turn, predicts negative mental health outcomes, including sexual dysfunction. This paper tests the predictions that (a) exposure to sexually objectifying media predicts self-objectification, (b) self-objectification mediates the relationship between exposure to sexually objectifying media and sexual self-perceptions, and (c) these relationships are stronger for women than men. A cross-sectional survey of 356 undergraduates at a large, midwestern university was conducted. Exposure to sexually objectifying magazines, but not television, predicted self-objectification. Also, self-objectification mediated the relationship between exposure to sexually objectifying magazines and self-consciousness during physical intimacy and sexual interest. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that the results differed for men and women."

Additionally, the FTC has begun to examine the deceptive potential of metatags  an invisible piece of Internet code that aids search engines in finding and indexing Web pages. This paper examines the deceptive potential of metatags and the FTCs ongoing regulation, and suggests the areas of metatag regulation that the commission needs to clarify."
2003-0424,Involvement and Participation in Multicultural Small Group Discussions--Zooming into Asian Members,Paper,Involvement and Participation in Multicultural Small Group Discussions--Zooming into Asian Members,"The present study focuses on members who rarely speak up in a multicultural classroom in order to understand how some members in the community participate less than others in multicultural classroom discussions. The three target members that this study is aimed at have two things in common: they are Asian males respectively from South Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand; and they are apparently less aggressive and more passive when compared with the other nine members. The actions of being involved and participating in discussions are found in three forms: producing involvement tokens, waiting for legitimate speech-turn allocation, and ineffective speech-turn intents.

This study discusses why members from these three Asian countries use these three forms of classroom action in a group format. In addition, the results of this study assert the essence of intercultural competence when sensitivities and adaptabilities of cultural differences between oneself and the other interacting participants are involved. Instead of learning to be aggressive and active during multicultural exchanges and abandoning the learned ways of communication, competent communicators can still maintain their own styles and render their communication goals at the same time."
2003-0425,Is Happy Better than Sad even if They are Both Non-Adaptive? Effects of Emotional Expressions of Computer-Based Characters,Paper,Is Happy Better than Sad even if They are Both Non-Adaptive? Effects of Emotional Expressions of Computer-Based Characters,"Hedonic preference and contextual appropriateness are two general principles for humans¡¯ emotional expressions. People prefer perceiving and expressing positive emotions over negative ones, but also modulate their emotional expressions to be appropriate to social contexts. Although computer-based characters are now able to express basic human emotions, they cannot yet automatically and intelligently adapt their emotional expressions to the changing context. Thus, would hedonic preference hold without contextual appropriateness? A 2 x 2 mixed-design experiment (happy vs. sad expression of a character by happy vs. sad context) (N=24) was conducted with a computer-based character presenting happy and sad novels to participants. Supporting the hedonic preference principle, results showed that despite both happy and sad characters were non-adaptive to the varying emotional tone of the context, the happy one elicited greater intent of consuming the books and more positive attitudes towards the character and the books."
2003-0426,Is It Really A Woman's World?: Experience of Female Public Relations Practitioners in Asia,Paper,Is It Really A Woman's World?: Experience of Female Public Relations Practitioners in Asia,"As the field of public relations is growing rapidly in Asia, more females enter the field, believing this new field is less conservative and more open to women. Despite their expectations, female PR professionals in Asia often face a more difficult work environment compared with their male counterparts. This study examines how Asian female PR professionals in Japan, Korea and Singapore perceive their job responsibilities, roles and difficulties at work and their methods of coping. Online questionnaires were sent to female professionals in public relations agencies and in-house public relations departments in these three countries. Findings indicate they tend to deny such difficulties and gender inequalities while acknowledging them and trying to cope with the difficulties. The researchers conclude that their inner-conflict resolutions reflect Festingers theory of cognitive dissonance and Wrigleys theory of negotiated resignation and are strongly related to social norms of collectivism and masculinity reinforced in Asian culture."
2003-0427,"Israeli Elementary Jewish Education and the Convergence of Jewish Values, Technology , and Popular Culture",Paper,"Israeli Elementary Jewish Education and the Convergence of Jewish Values, Technology , and Popular Culture","There are many examples of the convergence of religion, education, technology, and popular culture created within Jewish elementary schools in Israel. Israelis treasure their rich history of Judaism; value education; respect those who are technologically ingenious and are fascinated by popular culture messages from the visual media of television, film and the Internet. But what happens in elementary school, during the students formative years, when Jewish values taught daily often conflict with popular culture messages communicated from the Internet? How do educators along with their students evaluate Internet messages? Do the various educational streams from secular to Modern Orthodox differ in their approach to teaching and using the Internet?
This paper examines the extent to which Israeli Jewish education at the elementary school level particularly the State-religious  the Modern-Orthodoxs Mamlachti-Dati schools - utilize computers and the Internet and encourage popular culture in their classrooms. Qualitative interviews were conducted with educators primarily from the Official-State education streams - Mamlachti-Dati schools, Mamlachti-secular and the Tali religiously enriched schools.
The findings of this pilot study indicate that the degree that Jewish values emanate from religious education influenced teachers and administrators approaches to Internet Technology. Educators from secular streams pursued the technology aggressively, while those from traditional streams were more cautious. Teachers and administrators approaches to the Internet reflect their concerns regarding its influence on values, trust and their students decision-making. This studys findings also clearly demonstrate the challenges Internet technology poses to their conventional teaching styles."
2003-0428,Israeli-Jewish Children Use Palestinian Israeli Sesame Street to Escape*,Paper,Israeli-Jewish Children Use Palestinian Israeli Sesame Street to Escape*,"*Top student paper in International Communication

The notion that borders separate Israelis and Palestinians is well known. Efforts to reconstruct these borders, dissolve or even eliminate them through peace building efforts have proven difficult. One such effort, Palestinian Israeli Sesame Street, has found those borders to be too deep to transcend. Recently, the series, which began its first season in 1998 has decided to chart a new course. Its' second season will treat those borders as something that cannot be penetrated, rather than as it treated them during its' first season, as something constructed. Adults have deemed the series to be too far removed from reality and hence not something to which children in the region should be exposed. My interviews with Israeli-Jewish children during the months of November and December of 2001, however, tell a different story. Children, in contrast to their adult decision makers, want the show to continue in its original format. They use the show as a means for taking time-out from the conflict raging around them."
2003-0429,Issues That Arise When Teaching English to a Multicultural Group with Non-Native English Speaking Teachers and Learners,Paper,Issues That Arise When Teaching English to a Multicultural Group with Non-Native English Speaking Teachers and Learners,"This paper will describe the issues that arise when teaching English to a multicultural group where both learners and teachers are non-native speakers of English. The study looks at two batches of fellows. First, it will discuss the issues that usually come up for teachers who are non-native speakers of English, some of which may or may not be applicable to the current situation. From these, the relevant ones will be discussed in more detail, punctuated with examples from the faculty's experiences. Then it will go into the areas of concern regarding teaching a multicultural group which is composed of at least three countries. Among the topics are: the burden on the teacher to adjust to a variety of cultures and English levels, the teaching methodology which may be quite different from the one that each nationality is used to, and the complexities of the socio-cultural relationships of the students within the classroom setting. Finally, it will focus on the particular points pertaining to the advantages and disadvantages of being a Non-Native English Speaking student in a multicultural setting.
The objective of this paper is to show that there are more advantages to learning English in a multicultural setting than in a setting where all the learners are from the same culture and share the same language."
2003-0430,Is the Audience Really Commodity? --- An Overdetermined Marxist Perspective of the Television Economy,Paper,Is the Audience Really Commodity? --- An Overdetermined Marxist Perspective of the Television Economy,"Is
The perspective that seeing the audience as commodity was first used to shed new light on the ¡§blindspot¡¨ of western Marxism. Trying to rescue Marxist communication studies from the ¡§jungle of idealism,¡¨ Dallas W. Smythe called for the analysis of demand management in monopoly capitalism with the focus upon the triangular relationship among the audience, the media, and the advertisers. However, this study engages in the ¡§blindspot¡¨ debate by asking the following questions: Do class processes really occur in mass media? If they do, who are the workers, how do they get paid, and what kind of commodity has been produced and sold? These questions, as Smythe expects, are still in dispute. Based upon Wolff and Resnick¡¦s overdeterminist logic of Marxist theory, this study reconceptualizes the audience commodity as fictitious, betting on the future exploitation of labor, and the commercial television economy as credit-sustained accumulation. The production and circulation of the audience as fictitious capital are constrained by changing labor-capital relationship, whereas its normalization and institutionalization are produced by particular regime of truth. In the final section, eight propositions are put forward to demonstrate the critical tendencies as well as the possible transformations of a credit-sustained communication system."

The Photo Analysis of the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics and the 2002 Pusan Asian Games Coverage,"The purpose of this study is to examine if gender bias exists in the U.S. and Korean online media. For this purpose, this study compared male photos and female photos presented by two countries¡¯ online media coverage of the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games and the 2002 Pusan Asian Games respectively. The collected male and female photos were analyzed in four ways: (1) how many photos were posted (2) how impressively the athletes were described in the photos (3) how importantly the photos were presented (4) which sports categories were more prominently covered according to gender.
The findings showed that there was an inequality between photos featuring male and female athletes in terms of frequency and sports categories. However, there was no significant discrimination between photos with male and female athletes in presenting importantly. Impressiveness of athletes in photos was not different between male and female in the U.S. online media, but difference was found in Korean online media.
The result of this study suggested that online media have a more potential of treating males and females equally compared with traditional media. However, this online media¡¯s potential should be interpreted according to different cultural contexts."
2003-0432,Its me. Im it.: Defining adolescent sexual identity through relational dialectics in Dawsons Creek.,Paper,Its me. Im it.: Defining adolescent sexual identity through relational dialectics in Dawsons Creek.,"Television criticism frequently focuses on the deconstruction of individual representations in texts, a practice that privileges specific characters rather than relationships among characters. This paper highlights the usefulness of fictional television relationships for adolescent sexual identity formation by examining Dawsons Creek for its construction of gay character Jack McPhee. Jacks sexual identity is constructed and modified through dialectical tensions in his relationship with Jen Lindley, ultimately allowing him to express sexual identity in terms of acceptance rather than in terms of political or legal rights. This difference in narrative form illuminates potential differences between the formation of adult and adolescent sexual identity. Based on ethnographic work on gay men and their use of fictional media combined with a close reading of Dawsons Creek for sexual identity construction, the paper ultimately argues that fictional representations could serve as a template from which gay adolescents enact personal relationships. It also calls for critical media scholars to examine positive aspects of representations, by examining the politics involved in this particular representation."

When people interact, especially during conflict episodes, they attempt to make sense of the others behavior. Perceptions of an emotional state may greatly influence the nature of these cognitions. Through an experimental design in which the emotion felt (anger, fear, guilt, or control) and behavior (avoidant, distributive, or integrative conflict strategies) were varied, we examined the moderating effect that emotion had on assessments of communication competence, conversational satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction and stability. For avoidant conflict strategies, findings support this hypothesis in that people who were believed to be guilty or fearful were judged to be less effective in terms of the outcome of the interaction that people who were believed to be angry, or those in the control condition."

Two semantic dimensions, of envy and modesty are proposed, with the latter showing particular symbolic importance for Danish personhood. The normative and codes rules made active by Janteloven are developed, suggesting a relationship between a Danish cultural model of personhood and Danish cultural identity, and the significance for studies of intercultural communication of exploring cultural variation at the level of personhood is underscored."
2003-0435,Japanese directness and indirectness across situations: Focusing on refining the ingroup-outgroup distinction,Paper,Japanese directness and indirectness across situations: Focusing on refining the ingroup-outgroup distinction,"This study was a methodological inquiry into the significance of redefining the ingroup and outgroup distinction. Specialists in the Japanese culture often note that a mere two category definition of relational intimacy does not suffice in describing Japanese interpersonal relationships. This study featured direct and indirect communication strategy preference across six situations, toward four targets based on intimacy level. A total of 279 students in Japanese universities participated in the questionnaire survey. A 6 x 4 mixed design MANOVA was conducted, with 6 direct/indirect strategies as dependent variables. Results indicated that direct strategies were preferred for the most intimate in-ingroup (miuchi) targets, while indirect strategies were preferred most for in-outgroup targets (seken). The relationship between strategy preference and intimacy was linear in nature with bluntly direct communication, but curvilinear with polite and indirect communication strategies. From this, it was apparent that a mere ingroup-outgroup distinction is inadequate, and that a four-level target intimacy classification is essential in observing communication styles of Japanese."

One key theme called for solidarity and strong support of Isreal and its hardline policies in the fight against terroris. An ethnographic content analysis reveals an agenda supporting complete Israeli control of occupied lands in order to fulfill Christian apocalyptic scriptures and enable the Second Coming of Christ."
2003-0437,Journalism as Social Practice in Crisis: Restoring Identity Through Mythical Newswork,Paper,Journalism as Social Practice in Crisis: Restoring Identity Through Mythical Newswork,"Journalists accomplish their work through a narrative duality. During everyday newswork, they apply a professional narrative that represents journalistic pressures as well as those from their work world: this results in a greater degree of chronicle news. During a crisis situation such as a terrorist act, in contrast, journalists switch to master narratives that help restore a cultures identity when its core tenets are under threat: news becomes more of a story form in this case, often relying on enduring mythologies.

These master narratives also vary by the cultural proximity of the occurrence being reported on. Culturally proximate events trigger more specific master narratives, while less proximate events deal with broader cultural understandings that require more complex story-telling.

This study is a comparative work examining two terrorist acts in Israel as covered by major newspapers in the U.S. and Israel. Textual analysis is applied to news items from these newspapers to detect master narratives and explore how master narratives depend on how an occurrence relates to the culture reporting on it.

We found that occurrences with greater cultural proximity were covered with a greater degree of chronicle form than less proximate occurrences, although the story form of news narrative was common to this news reporting in both cases. In each case, the master narratives applied represented central values of a society. This study demonstrates both the value and the difficulty of conducting research across borders as well as across time."
2003-0438,Journeying across Boundaries: an Image of Acculturation,Paper,Journeying across Boundaries: an Image of Acculturation,"This paper describes an innovative method of exploring the experiences of acculturation of international students at a UK university. The focus of the method is visual imagery and involves the subjects in an intensive introspection process in which they attempt to express their experiences by making drawings that symbolize the key aspects of their sojourn. This procedure is followed by discussion and analysis of the drawing with the subject interpreting the symbols and images as they feel appropriate. The method has proved effective in helping the subject to explore issues at a level beyond that which could be achieved in an interview setting. Its chief advantage lies in that it allows the subject to express their experiences without the need to work in a second language, at least in the initial stages. Overall, this method would appear to have an importance as a significant way of developing insights into the experience of acculturation."

Situating daytime televisions fastest-growing format within a neoliberal context, it argues that Judge Judys concern with real women and their seemingly mundane conflicts intersects with the privatization of public life, the dismantling of welfare programs, and the political discourse of ""individual choice"" and ""personal responsibility."""
2003-0440,Judging competence in the workplace: A comparison of information gathering methods,Paper,Judging competence in the workplace: A comparison of information gathering methods,"We examined the information gathering methods that people use when judging the competence of coworkers. We hypothesized that (1) people will use information gathering methods that involve direct communication more than those that involve indirect or no communication for judging the competence of coworkers, and that (2) people will use information gathering methods that involve direct communication more for judging task-specific competence than for judging general competence. To test our hypotheses, we asked 533 participants to describe a previous work experience involving a competent coworker and the information source they used in deciding that the coworker was competent. Surprisingly, counter to Hypothesis 1, participants reported relying more on reputation and on observation than on direct communication to judge the competence of coworkers. Hypothesis 2 was supported."
2003-0441,Knowledge Gaps in the Internet Age,Paper,Knowledge Gaps in the Internet Age,"The foundation of a democracy rests on public support and a reasonably broad distribution of knowledge. The mass media traditionally have been assigned with providing much of that knowledge through their surveillance and watchdog functions. However, media do not inform all citizens equally, and mass communication scholars have long studied the threat represented by the knowledge gap phenomenon first identified by Tichenor, Olien and Donohue (1970) and confirmed in more recent analyses (Gaziano, 1997; Viswanath & Finnegan, 1996). That gap is premised on differential print media use by low and high status groups, but the most recent arrival to the media environment--the Internet-leads us to re-examine the relationship between media use and acquisition of public affairs knowledge. Three types of knowledge-about international affairs, about the local community, and about the Internet-are examined in relation to media use, including the Internet, in a telephone survey conducted in a Midwest metropolitan area. Results confirm gaps in all three types of knowledge by high/medium/low education and income groups. Similarly, differences in international public affairs knowledge are found for levels of newspaper readership and ""tenure"" on the Internet. A community knowledge gap is found for newspaper readership but not time on the Internet, while an Internet knowledge gap is found for years on the Internet but not for newspaper readership. Examining the full range of information, we find positive relationships between several media use variables and the overall media use index and the individual and summary knowledge measures."
2003-0442,Koan as Ritual: The Role of Language in Zen Discourse,Paper,Koan as Ritual: The Role of Language in Zen Discourse,"Zen Buddhism is known to attach great importance to the traditional notion of ¡°No dependence on words and letters¡± and ¡°a special transmission outside the teachings.¡± Assuming this heritage, many ancient Zen masters in China and Japan are recorded to have adopted illogical use of language in their communication with disciples. Research has been done to interpret the nature and role of language in Zen discourse. Olson (2000) claims that in Zen Buddhism, language assumes an ancillary position to experience. A number of other studies define Zen experience as either transcending or denying language. Still others discuss Zen discourse in relation to mysticism. These interpretations and approaches, insightful and valuable as they are, are limited in that they fall short of specificity.
My central contention is that the nature and role of language in Zen discourse are best understood essentially within its religious context of mysticism, with particular attention to its communicative and ritual dimensions. My approach to this issue is to focus on koan, as it ¡°may be the most condensed and self-conscious linguistic practice ever devised in any culture,¡± (Wright, 1989, p. 81) thus epitomizing the essential characteristics of Zen discourse. So, a better strategy to understand the nature and role of language in koan consists of the notion of koan as a communication act and the ritualistic dimension of koan. With this approach as the starting point, a more appropriate understanding of language in koan and Zen discourse can be achieved."
2003-0443,Laboring Under the Digital Divide,Paper,Laboring Under the Digital Divide,"Digital divide activists argue that differences in access to technology and technical skills based on race, class, gender, and geographic location socially and economically disempower those (individuals or countries) on the wrong side of the tracks, or wires, as it were. But this argument may frustrate the elimination of such inequalities by overlooking disparities that constitute another digital dividethat within the digital workforce. This paper argues that policymakers and academics engaged in the ""digital divide debate"" have overlooked crucial problems within the high tech labor market. After all, access to and skill in computer technology are meaningless without secure, full-time, living wage jobs for the trained and wired. But we can unleash the democratizing potential of digital divide research and activism by focusing on wider socio-economic disparities that the digital divide  as currently constructedstands in for. The work of WashTech (the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers), the Seattle-based union for IT workers, provides our conversation with a revised outline of the concerns that must be addressed if we are truly to empower workers who toil in the borderlands of promised economic success and the reality of increasing insecurity."

Factors Affecting Story Selection in Local and Regional Television News in Sweden.,"One of the more powerful critiques of commercial television news is that a drive for increased advertising revenue leads to the dumbing down of the final news product. This simple cause (advertising) and effect (light news) model of the political economy of news, however, overlooks a number of factors impacting the selection of stories within commercial and public service news organizations. This research is an attempt to add a degree of nuance to both of these issues through an examination of regional/local commercial and public service television newsrooms in Sweden. Based upon data obtained from 27 days of observation at four newsrooms, 25 in-depth interviews, and analysis of over 330 potential stories presented at editorial meetings, this research shows how a number of factors other than deliberate attempts to create audience-friendly news impacted story selection and modes of coverage."

The authors research on this phenomenon intends to answer the following two questions: first, how does this youth cultural style come into being? And second, how does the BBS cultural participants make use of this language style? Data presented in this paper were collected from face-to-face in-depth interviews with fifteen student BBS users and downloaded posting and discussion thread from three Chinese university BBSs. Discourse analysis is used in analyzing the data. Key arguments are as follows: first, youth style constituted by the commercial cultural products is still meaningful because young people have agency which enables them to construct alternative standards of usefulness, pleasure, or aesthetics; and second, the language style strategically created by the university BBS users finally accumulates into subcultural capital used as distinctions between the insiders and outsiders of the BBS community; while on the other hand, it also served as a cohesive force within the community."

Drawing upon fieldwork conducted with a network of viajeros (couriers), who constitute the grassroots counterpart to the new global economys communications networks, the presentation focuses on the airborne courier, and the humble flow of things  Nikes, Nintendo games, videos and dollars etc.between Los Angeles and El Salvador. Through the act of consumption, the courier navigates these international borders for undocumented Salvadorans who cannot, and sutures distinct hemispheric sites together by bringing immigrants and their families at home into everyday communication. The trust borne of face-to-face communications with the courier is an important counter to the alienating abstraction of global communication systems, and demonstrates the salience of face-to-face communications both in building transnational community, and in mobilizing new consumer cultures for global capitalism across geographic and cultural borders."

As this form of television became more popular in the 1990s, programs evolved to serve a variety of additional audiences and created new genres of talk television. One of the programs emerging out of this time was ""Politically Correct,"" a discussion-based television talk show mixing humor with current political issues. This paper looks at a series of episodes of ""Politically Incorrect"" to gain a better understanding the ways in which discussion panel members discursively navigate between the immediate panel members and the larger audience. Analyzing talk television using discourse analysis adds to the understanding of mass communication at the level in which participants engage. This study explores multiple ways in which Goffmans (1967) concept of footing contributes to understanding of this show. The significance of this concept to mass communication studies of ""Politically Incorrect"" lies in the way in which panel members change footing to contribute to the television shows goal, to entertain, while allowing the pursuit of their own goal of image maintenance."

The study had two primary goals. The first was to test the effects of interactivity on learning. The second goal was to explore the role of motivation in learning from interactive media. I proposed that extrinsic motivation might explain differing results of media learning research in the fields of education and mass communication.
Results of hypothesis testing were heavily dependent on which measure of learning was employed. A traditional multiple-choice test of recognition verified an effect of motivation but not of interactive behavior. A comprehension measure of learning, supported by the cognitive constructivism theory of learning employed in this study, supported an effect of interactivity but not of motivation. An interaction between motivation and interactivity was also verified by the comprehension measure.
Explanations for the findings are proposed and implications for mass communicators discussed."

Data were gathered from student survey responses, instructor evaluation of performance, and statistics on messages posted.
Results from this study indicated significant correlations between student perceptions of the presence of other students in the class and scores on an attitudes scale and their satisfaction with their own learning. This finding highlights the salience of other students in the learning environment.
Perceptions of the instructors presence were significantly correlated with both attitudes, or affective learning, and with student learning satisfaction. This outcome in an online class is consistent with findings on teacher immediacy literature in traditional classes.
Student reports of their perception of their own presence in the class were significantly correlated with performance in the class, with the grade they would assign themselves, with their attitudes about the course, and with volubility, measured as number and length of class postings.
Volubility was related in this study to performance, although not to presence, in contrast to the argument that volubility might heighten perceptions of presence."

Many of the full-page advertisements in the New York Times during the six weeks following the attacks were framed as letters. This study draws upon the literatures of epistolary critique, visual meaning and metaphor, and rhetorical criticism to explore the rhetorical device of framing ads as letters. We utilize the triadic classification system of Charles Sanders Peirce to classify the letters-as-ads into either iconic, indexical or symbolic frames. Our initial assumption that more graphically iconic ads would rely less on textual metaphor, and vice versa, was confirmed. Finally, we encourage the consideration of epistolary rhetoric as a critical tool of analysis."

Drawing on the findings of my textual analysis of 660 readers letters over a five year period (1993-1998), this paper reveals how Ms.s writerly-readers (Barthes, 1976) use their letters to engage in the on-going dialogue that is feminism and in so doing, forge connections to other readers. Positing that it is through epistolarity, not the shared act of reading, that this particular textual community is constituted, I question what it means to be part of a self-selecting community brought together out of allegiance to a cause, and an often conflicted yearning for connected-ness (Probyn, 1996). In drawing attention to the centrality of the Letter to the Editor in Ms., this paper aims not only to raise an awareness of the non-participatory reality of most womens magazines, but to highlight how Ms.s unusual way of addressing readers and of soliciting and featuring their correspondence compels and enables readers to become active participants in the making and shaping of the text. In discussing the methodological dilemmas encountered in undertaking this analysis of letters, this paper also raises our awareness of the need for feminist scholars to bring to light that which has traditionally remained hidden below the surface as we conduct our probings into the Communication fields borderlands."

One way to use activist groups in the study of public relations is to consider how the organization uses public relations strategies and tactics.
DeLuca (1999) has suggested that often environmental activist groups such as Greenpeace use staged events for the sake of media coverage. This paper considers how a community activist organization used staged events as part of a media strategy, not just for media coverage. This group used the staged event, a common public relations tactic, to leverage the groups influence over its targeted publics, primarily elected officials and government agency administrators. The way in which the group leveraged media coverage of its events and interest in its activities provides insight into how activist groups can successfully achieve their goals."

2003-0456,Life on the Texas-Mexico Border: Myth and reality as represented in Mainstream and Independent Western Cinema,Paper,Life on the Texas-Mexico Border: Myth and reality as represented in Mainstream and Independent Western Cinema,"Film scholars generally agree that with few exceptions, representations of Latinos in mainstream films in the United States have been limited to narrow stereotypes since the earliest days of film. (Berumen, 1995; Keller, 1985; Pettit, 1980). Most often, Latino actors were typecast into roles in the formula Western and crime dramas so popular with United States audiences, depicting the foil for the ""American"" hero. The roles were clear: those on the United States side of the border were the ""good guys,"" those on the Mexico side of the border were generally not. Even rarer than a rich role for Latinos was a film that tried to address the topic of the Latino experience in the United States.
In mainstream films on the Latino experience, the topic was most often urban crime or the ""problem of illegal immigration."" (Keller, 1985). A few mainstream films attempted to examine illegal Mexican immigration into the United States-indocumentado pictures-but were little more than formula treatments of complex issues. Most notable of these films are ""Borderline"" (1980) with Charles Bronson and ""The Border"" (1981) with Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel. Based on standard narrative formulas, these films could be termed mediocre, at best. Of the few films that tried to go beyond surface treatments of border issues, those that enjoyed the most critical success (although little commercial success) were independently produced films such as ""Alambrista!"" (1976) and ""El Norte"" (1983).
Even fewer films have tackled the complex topic of how people living on both sides of the United States-Mexico border negotiate cultural, political and economic identities. But this neglect of border issues doesn't mean that the area was not portrayed in films - only that the portrayals followed ""form."" In U.S. films, the predominant images of border towns were (and are) negative and stereotypical-the dusty town plaza dotted with loitering Mexicans, glaring from under their sombreros, waiting to indiscriminately rob any Anglo naive enough to enter their primitive, lawless territory.
The tendency towards shallow characterizations and formula narratives is not limited to minority groups and border areas, but is standard practice in the Hollywood film industry, which takes few risks and employs a narrow range of narrative structures and the attendant roles that are easily identifiable by filmgoers. Portraying a character in a stereotypical manner, what Hall (1997) describes as reducing ""people to a few, simple essential characteristics,"" allows viewers to quickly grasp the character's motives, social and educational status, and familial background. But these stereotypes are not neutral - they have the power to set up a symbolic frontier ""between the 'normal' and the 'deviant'... between 'insiders' and 'outsiders'..."" Stereotypes are not dictated by the medium, however, and Williams (1985) argues that films with rich representations can be ""illuminating,"" especially for Anglo members of the audience. The power of these films lies in their refusal to revert to individualize the case, the refusal to create ""exceptions,"" but to instead represent members of all cultural groups in relation to each other, not just within the context of their own ""group.""
Although conventional wisdom dictates that typical audiences will not tolerate films deviating from ""tried and true"" formulas, in the 1990s two award-winning independent films about citizens living near the Mexico and U.S. borders broke through to mainstream distribution and were embraced by Western audiences. With vivid images and compelling narratives, these two films, ""El Mariachi"" (1993) and ""Lone Star"" (1996), urged viewers to consider the Texas/New Mexico border in new ways-as contested spaces where different ethnic groups with ties to the region try to resolve conflicts over cultural, technological, and geographical boundaries.
Although the two films offer starkly different narratives, each compelled viewers to reconsider the complex cultural conflicts that have their roots in past centuries but are being played out as the United States and Mexico struggle to redefine border areas in light of the new ""global order."" Nowhere is that struggle more evident than in the towns that dot the border between the United States and Mexico, and each of these films, ""El Mariachi"" and ""Lone Star,"" begged viewers to dig deep into their stored memories and amend them to fit this new reality.
In this new reality, the men in white hats are not always the heroes, history is gradually being cast in a different light, geographical borders do not delineate cultural and familial loyalties, and ""Third World"" residents struggle to take advantage of economic and technological opportunities without allowing their social order to be erased in the process.
A historical brief on film representations of Latino/as and U.S. Mexico border
Although this paper is not designed to address specifically the representation of Latinos in film, a discussion of the U.S./Mexico border in film cannot be addressed without explaining to some degree how Latino/as have been portrayed. As Crouteau and Haynes (2000) note, in the United States media, Whites have defined the ""norm"" and all other ethnic groups have been measured against this norm. A prime example is ""Bordertown,"" which appears on first glance to be an assimilation narrative, but the narrative ""maps"" Others in relation to the mainstream. ""Mexican-Americans are marginal, Mexican nationals more so, and Chinese Americans even more so"" (Berg, 1992). The images of the Border cannot be separated from the images of Latinos, and both are presented in Western film from the ""American"" point of view.
The earliest movie depictions of Latino/as and Border areas, according to Keller (1985) were ""an almost unrelieved exercise in degradation."" Early film titles reveal the stereotypical roles offered to Hispanics-many of the early ""Mexican"" film titles included the term ""greaser,"" beginning with the 1896 Nickelodeon short (Berumen, 1995) and continuing through 1918, when ""Guns and Greasers"" was released (Keller). Although filmmakers discontinued the use of this perjorative term, U. S. cinema maintained the static and stereotypical portrayals begun before the turn of the century - the dark lady, the bandito and the buffoon (Keller).
As early as the 1920s, the Latino community decried these narrowly drawn, negative images and actors sometimes refused roles that insulted their ""ethnic identity and intelligence."" But despite ongoing criticism, the Hollywood film industry's responses to cries for more expansive roles for Latinos and more reality-based depictions of Latino communities have been shortlived and often shortsighted. Instead, U. S. cinema alternated between periods of no representation and mis-representation of Latinos.
Most often, mainstream filmmakers responded to cries of mis-representation by creating Latino heroes in the ""American"" image-borrowing the myth of the caballero from fiction. Most enduring of the mythical caballeros is Zorro, who entered the U. S. lexicon as a cultural icon, and who ""like his Anglo counterparts, of similar western series, his modus operandi was to ride in, destroy evil, and ride out, leaving a broken heart or two behind"" (Keller, 1985). Often presented in films as a pure-bred Spaniard and/or as a member of the upper class, Zorro campaigned bravely and tirelessly (in true action-hero form) to save Mexican peasants from corrupt officials. Beginning with the 1920 film ""The Mask of Zorro."" The Zorro films have remained popular throughout the century. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) lists no less than 62 Zorro films, including the 1998 version of The Mask of Zorro which was a smashing commercial success, opening on 2,415 screens in the United States. The film earned $22 million in its first weekend and by December, 1998, had gross receipts worldwide of more than $194 million.
The caballero, though a mixed representation, was one of the few remotely positive stereotypes. On the surface, Zorro provided an alternative representation of Latinos, one of the few Latino heroes in U. S. cinema, but in the end, his similarity to the ""American"" hero situates him as an exception to the norm, ensuring that the stereotype of the Latino as inept and corrupt remained undisturbed.
Throughout the century, despite a few rich roles in Westerns and some attempts to present banditos as part good/part bad, most films provided no roles for Latinos. In Westerns and crime films, however, the villain stereotypes were expanded to include sub-types. In the 1970s, as censorship lost its grip on movie content, the bandito role was expanded, but not to a multi-faced rich personality. Instead, the new bandito ""practices mayhem, sadism, and sex aplenty...enjoys killing men and raping women..."" (Keller, 1985).
The 1980s offered promise that the roles of Latino/as and border areas would be expanded, especially with the burgeoning Chicano film movement in the United States and Mexico. Although a few films offered expanded representations of the Latino experience in the United States, (Zoot Suit,"" 1982; ""The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez,"" 1983; ""Stand and Deliver,"" 1987, and ""American Me,"" 1992) but few pointed the spotlight on border areas. Of the few films that addressed topics about the Mexican experience in American, the most expansive roles were in independent films such as ""Like Water for Chocolate"" (1993). Despite the promise of expanding representations in the 1980s, negative stereotypes dominated film images in the 1990s. Past stereotypes were perpetuated, with a twist to ""accomodate and reflect the changing political landscape... the stereotypes were narcotraficantes/drug dealers, criminals, bandits, gang members and undocumented workers. Latinas found themselves inevitably as prostitutes and cantineras..."" (Berumen, 1995).
Although the border and its towns have rarely been the topic of films, it has often been represented in U. S. cinema, particularly in Westerns and crime dramas, which generally did not present the area in a positive light. Most often, the Border was represented as a dividing line between civilization and lawlessness, a place of escape for unrepentant gunfighters. In later films, such as Orson Welles', ""A Touch of Evil"" (1958), the border town represents the most sinister of environments, a ""hellish"" town, ""a nightmare world behind everyday reality"" (Nericcio, 1992). If this were just one of many major representations of the border and its towns, there would be little danger of stereotyping, but it is one of few in mainstream Western film, and it exemplifies how border areas are used as settings for the interplay of good and evil.
Keller (1985) notes that the Mexican cinema hasn't fared much better in representing the border areas.
""while Mexican cinema was entirely capable of releasing from its exploitative, commercial crucible major works of artistic merit depicting popular, folkloric, historical, revolutionary, urban, social class, or other values, it was not capable of such achievement with respect to the depiction of the Chicano lifestyle or even the Mexican culture of the border in any of their significant dimensions or varieties. p. 15""
The Effects of Limited Representations of Latino/as and border areas
Filmmakers have approximately 90 minutes to introduce viewers to characters, establish each person's identity and the story's setting, and then work through the story plot and denouement. Given the time restrictions, portraying a character and setting in stereotypical manner allows viewers to quickly understand a character's motivations and to anticipate his/her interaction with other characters in this environment. For most viewers, Cortes (1992) suggests that movies help organize information about ""race, ethnicity, culture and foreignness"" and help ""organize information and ideas about racial ethnic and cultural groups.""
For the dominant group, stereotyping doesn't often result in serious consequences, because a range of ""types"" are represented. But Dyer (1993 suggests that limiting representations in the media to stereotypical, flat depictions allows members of minority groups to be cast into a role as ""other,"" sometimes with dire consequences. He argues these consequences result because ""how we are seen determines in part how we are treated; how we treat others is based on how we see them; such seeing comes from representation.""
So, although stereotypes spare viewers some cognitive energy, they often reinforce existing representations. For minority groups, this often means negative representations. Different minority groups have traditionally been assigned different roles to play, but analyses of movie roles and story lines over the past century show that minority ethnic groups have been relegated in all but a few films to portraying the ""deviant, less capable other."" Until the past few years, for example, African-Americans were limited to five highly racialized roles established in 1915 with the release of D. W. Griffith's controversial film, ""The Birth of a Nation.""
Hall (1982) argues that the few characteristics and images presented are actually used to ""reduce everything about the person to those traits, exaggerate and simplify them and fix them without change or development to eternity."" In the case of Latino/as, Keller (1985) argues that the formula movies favored by the early movie industry, with its emphasis on Americanism and the resultant heroes and villains, firmly established a negative role for Latinos as ""real"" gangsters and outlaws. ""The usual components of wish fulfillment such as romance and true love, destroying evil... rewarding good, happy endings and so on, ensured that Hispanic and other outgroup characters would perform for the assembly line the role of vamps, seductresses, greasers, gangsters and the like, ad nauseum.""
Many fear that limiting the representation of minority groups to a few negative stereotypes contributes to ""subliminal and conscious prejudice against Latinos and other ethnic, racial groups by Anglo Americans, Europeans, and also elitist Latin American and European Spaniards (Rios-Bustamante). This prejudice could occur because stereotypes help symbolically fix boundaries by setting up a symbolic frontier:
"" [between] what belongs and what does not or is 'Other', between 'insiders' and 'outsiders', 'Us' and 'Them'. It facilitates the 'binding' or 'bonding' together of all of 'Us' who are 'normal' into an 'imagined community'; and it sends into symbolic exile all of Them-The Others-who are in some way different-beyond the pale"" Hall,(1982), p. 258.
More importantly, Cores (1992) argues that presenting these stereotypical images reinforces existing audience perceptions and may actually ""hinder revisionist filmmakers, including Latinos, in their quest to gain critical acceptance of alternative presentations."" This occurs because films manipulate images of the ""Latin Menace iconographically generated by groups of gun-toting Mexican horsemen in the Old West or swaggering young Latinos-presumably gangs-in contemporary urban films."" These images reinforce perceptions and images of Latinos, and ""condition audiences for future movies.""
Movies That Make a Difference: ""El Mariachi"" and ""Lone Star""
Williams (1985) argues that despite this tendency for films to reinforce firmly held beliefs, films with rich representations can make help viewers adjust their images to more closely align with ""reality.""
""El Mariachi,"" directed by Robert Rodriquez, and ""Lone Star,"" directed by John Sayles, both benefited from the increasing audience interest in independent films that began in the 1980s. Independent films had expanded beyond their art house audiences and were attracting baby boomers, who had tired of formula movies and were looking for more complex story lines. With this broadening of audience demographics came an increased interest from distribution companies, and a search for movies that offered interesting narratives.
""Lone Star"" and ""El Mariachi"" could not be more different in style and narrative: Rodriguez was a first time director and producer who favored action scenes with quick cuts; Sayles favored a more leisurely approach that gently switched between scenes of the past and the present, and allowed the story to unfold through a wide range of characters. Rodiguez hoped to generate enough sales in the Spanish-speaking video market to fund a ""real"" film; Sayles was following his tradition of making movies that represented areas of conflict in all their complexities.
Yet despite these seeming differences, each movie challenged viewers to question their visions of the border and its inhabitants. Neither eschewed the realities of the area-like much of Northern Mexico and South Texas, the images presented a rocky, dry and often ""barren"" landscape. But despite these visual images, each presented a protagonist and story line that challenged the status quo and their beliefs about the nature of the place and its people.
Upon its release, Sayles' ""Lone Star"" was immediately hailed as groundbreaking movie, with a full range of likable characters that challenged stereotypes. As Sayles' narrator, Sam, searches for the ""truth"" about a decades-old murder and his father's role in it, he provides the audience more than just the ""mainstream"" point of view - he directs viewers to the complexity of the situation and let viewers see the border situation through other eyes-the recent Mexican immigrant, the assimilated Mexican immigrant who lost her husband to a prejudiced rogue sheriff, the Native American who doesn't recognize political boundaries, and the teacher who wants students to see past the narrowly drawn vision of the region's history, to name a few. The cast of characters is large, but Sayles handles them deftly, and slowly guides the viewer to see each ethnic group in the context of shared history and the influence of other groups.
Rodriguez' movie, on the other hand, has not been seriously studied because it contains negative images about the border and border images. As Noriega (1992) points out, ""Chicano film scholarship has tended to ground itself in the strategy of unmasking negative stereotypes while affirming positive images."" But List (1992) suggests that it is important to examine how ingroup stereotypes might combat negative images imposed from the outside."" She argues that Cheech Marin in ""Born in East L.A."" (1987) subtly critiques ethnocentrism with his method of ""slipping the message into your coffee so it goes down smooth, but later you feel the effect.""
Although Rodriquez makes no such claims about the intentions of his film-it was actually intended as a quick money-making venture-the sympathetic portrayal of the protagonist belies the usual stereotype-not the insatiable ""Latin lover or drug dealer,"" but a ""regular guy"" looking for the ""good life."" Rodriguez'protagonist wants to return to his ""roots,"" to search out the simple life enjoyed by his father, the mariachi. He is not the exception, he is the norm-again, a regular guy looking for the life being lost in the pursuit of the American dream ""across the other side."" He doesn't drive a car as a ""typical"" urban thug might, nor does he wear the stereotypical uniform. Instead, he wears what most clean-cut young men in the southwestern United States would wear-blue jeans, a button-down shirt and boots. When he crosses the border into Mexico, although the images are familiar, they hint of a different story a story of mistaken identify, where the mariachi is pursued by an ""evil"" drug lord, but with a twist. By Rodriguez' design, the greedy, cut-throat is not a Mexican national, but a ""gringo"" from the other side. And the gringo drives the drug trade, murdering anyone who threatens to disturb his power. The White man from across the other side has disturbed the ""natural"" order of life in this border strip of Mexico, and in the process, destroyed the mariachi's hopes and dreams.

It has been documented that adolescent females are the most difficult social group to penetrate. As they move from junior high school to high school, their friendship selection patterns become much more stringent, often excluding others who do not share their class and ethnic background. This paper examines the exception to this data, as I present dialogic interactions between two adolescent females¡ªone African American; the other Anglo-Latina¡ªwho have been friends for over eleven years. Using the Bakhtinian concepts of dialogism, social language, speech genre, voice, addressivity, and answerability, I analyze strategies the girls use to maintain their long-term friendship despite latent cultural insults. Under some of the tenets of Critical Discourse Analysis, I trace how this negotiation is done through the constant shifting of power relations between the girls by invoking Foucault¡¯s notion of power as an analytical tool."
2003-0458,Linking Empirical and Critical Media Study: Implications for Human Health,Paper,Linking Empirical and Critical Media Study: Implications for Human Health,"Mass communication research almost certainly has varied practical effects on human health. For example, applications of knowledge may boost the effectiveness of advertising for products that hinder and also for those that enhance human well-being. In addition, research may help legitimize university skills courses, which also might magnify the impact of messages. This paper argues that dialectically joining the empirical and critical traditions in media study can help clarify such issues. In this light, it presents a theoretical framework for the study of the health impact of media research. It relies in part upon philosopher John Deweys idea of a means-ends continuum, in which all ends represent means to other ends. Thus, research is seen not merely as an end but as an activity with sometimes-unrecognized consequences for human health, as well. Ultimately, the forms that media education takes represent a key to addressing health-related concerns."

Similarly, community radio has been seen as a possible means of promoting local cultural identities. Using the Breton language and identity as a case study, this paper explores the role radio can play in the negotiation of a linguistically based local identity. This study finds support for earlier work on the importance of listener support and effective policy as influencing the success of local radios. More specifically, lack of coherent government support was found to impede greater public use of the Breton language. The concept of a flow was adapted from global media studies to the local level to explain the type of immersion in Breton language information necessary to recreate public socio-cultural sphere vital to the continuation of the Breton identity."
2003-0463,Loving on the net:How People Understand Their Love Life Online,Paper,Loving on the net:How People Understand Their Love Life Online,"By using in-depth interview, this paper tries to describe how people understand their love life in cyberspace and what the relationship they think between their virtual life and the real life. It critically discusses intimate relation online from three perspectives. First, it concerns the great changes that the new electronic media takes to us and especially what new the Internet takes to us compared with television. Second, it introduces the social life in virtual community where the digital love takes place. Third, it discusses whether a strong intimate relationship can take place in virtual space.

This study finds Internet can sustain strong emotion among people. The relation between virtual couples is not ¡° pure relationship¡±. ¡°Fun¡± and feeling of ¡° happiness¡± during the process are two primary motivations for cyber-love. It is difficult for people to clearly separate virtual world and real world. Whether or not the people¡¯s love life is completely online, they don¡¯t look the virtual life as their whole life."
2003-0464,Lying To Tell The Truth: Journalists And The Social Context Of Deception,Paper,Lying To Tell The Truth: Journalists And The Social Context Of Deception,"This study, based on depth interviews with journalists, is an analysis of the social context of journalistic deception. Borrowing from Elliot and Culvers (1992) comprehensive definition of journalistic deception that covers not only newsgathering practices but also the potential for deception in journalists relationships with news audiences, as well as the omission-commission distinction, this research is an empirical attempt to locate the occupational and individual-grounded bases for deception. Why do journalists use deceptive methods such as impersonations, non-identifications, and fabrication in their work? Deception is located in a moral-pragmatic framework based on harm-benefit, the altruism of the act, and instrumental utilities such as convenience, personal safety and the bottom line. Woven into the journalists accounts are attempts to normalize deceptive behaviorconsistent with the notion of deception as a prima facie wrongand the salience of organizational pressures such as legal and business concerns. As an occupational construct, journalistic deception is shaped by professional demands. Tacit rules govern what is acceptable and unacceptable deception based on assessments of the target of deception (newsmakers vs. news audiences), the perceived character of the person deceived, and the nature of the act (omission vs. commission)."
2003-0465,Mad or Bad? Negotiating the Boundaries of Mental Illness on Law & Order,Paper,Mad or Bad? Negotiating the Boundaries of Mental Illness on Law & Order,"This paper examines how NBCs primetime drama, Law & Order, uses mental illness as a lens through which to view the individuals and issues which reside on the conceptual boundaries of society. Focusing on the episodes which included the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity the authors investigate the interplay between mental illness and discussions revolving around the themes of personal responsibility, the nature of good and evil, and flaws in the mental health and criminal justice systems. Critical to this discussion is the role that fiction plays in elaborating on controversial social issues in a manner not commonly found in non-fiction media."
2003-0466,Maintaining Inter-Organizational Relationships that Build Nations,Paper,Maintaining Inter-Organizational Relationships that Build Nations,"This paper describes the maintenance of relationships among civil society organizations two years following their participation in the Croatian transformation to a democratic nation. It presents the results of an inter-organizational network analysis among 18 Croatian civil society organizations and compares two points in time. The first point in time was an inter-organizational network analysis during the the democratic elections of 2000 (Author 1, forthcoming). This paper provides the inter-organizational network analysis two years following this election, during a time depicted by maintenance -- not creation -- of civil society and democracy. This paper describes the current status of the system and compares the network changes over time. Network relationships are based on the theories of cooperation-competition and structural holes and describe the roles of various organizations in the maintenance of democracy."
2003-0467,Make it fast but easy: production pacing and narrative structure in processing TV commercials,Paper,Make it fast but easy: production pacing and narrative structure in processing TV commercials,"This paper investigated the effects of production pacing, narrative structure and their interaction on resource allocation, the three sub processes of information processing (encoding, storage and retrieval) and also attitude (liking) and purchase intention. We predicted that production pacing as a structural feature would require more mental resources as it increases, but that story commercials would not require many resources. We did not find main effect of pacing on encoding. But we found that medium paced commercials were recalled better than fast- and slow-paced commercials. Further, as we predicted, fast paced commercials were rated as more likable and led to higher purchase intention. There was a main effect of narrative structure on storage and retrieval. For both cued recall and free recall, story commercials were significantly recalled better than non-story commercials (image commercials and informative commercials). Also story commercials were rated as more likable and led to higher purchase intention. Unlike our prediction, processing story commercials was not cost free. Fast pacing damaged free and cued recall memory for story commercials."
2003-0468,Make yourself at home: The social construction of research roles in family studies,Paper,Make yourself at home: The social construction of research roles in family studies,"As studies of the role of media in the life of the family increase in quantity and sophistication, researchers have an opportunity to reflect upon their methodological approaches to understanding the contexts of media consumption, socialization practices and mediation strategies. In particular, we are at a juncture where it is critical for researchers to explore the complex ways in which families respond to being studied in their home environment. This paper reflects upon the authors experiences in two separate research projects that involved working with families with school-age children to learn about media use in the home. It focuses on the points at which the researcher intersects with the family, and the ways in which meaning-making is negotiated between the observer and the observed. Using a social constructionist approach, the paper outlines how different families define the researchers role (student, person, guest, negative agent) and how the role may ultimately shape the research environment."
2003-0469,Making Collective Memory Visible in Public Space: Reflections on the Commemoration of 9/11 in New York City,Paper,Making Collective Memory Visible in Public Space: Reflections on the Commemoration of 9/11 in New York City,"Rebuilding the site now commonly known as Ground Zero has become a battle over ""images and lost opportunities"" as much as about ""material form"" (Boyer 120). This paper argues that the symbolic success or failure of a future memorial to 9/11 will be determined largely by how well its design embodies the qualities of a ""public space"" and by how adroitly it negotiates the utopian and critical aspects of public art. Because the design of a permanent memorial at Ground Zero is a culmination, rather than a beginning, of the work of collective memory that commenced on September 11, we insist on examining the different stages of commemoration leading to it--from makeshift tokens of grief and mourning to museum exhibits--to illustrate the quality of publicness and to assess the balance between utopia and critique in the commemorative public art."
2003-0470,Making Money and Making Friends: Corporate Ideology and Friendship in University Fund Raising,Paper,Making Money and Making Friends: Corporate Ideology and Friendship in University Fund Raising,"This study expands communicative understandings of fund raising by analyzing the discourses of university fund raisers. We found potentially problematic juxtapositions between the language of corporate ideology and friendship. Specifically, we argue that fund raisers frequently rely on friendships of utility (Aristotle, Trans. 1999), suggesting a colonization (Deetz, 1992) of fund raising in higher education. While we question this colonization, we also find evidence that fund raisers are moving away from the language of friendship. Therefore, new questions arise about what fund raising processes will look like communicatively without the language of friendship."
2003-0471,"Management, Drop Your Tools: Military Metaphors for Wildland Firefighting and Public Resistance to Safety Legacies of Tragedy Fires",Paper,"Management, Drop Your Tools: Military Metaphors for Wildland Firefighting and Public Resistance to Safety Legacies of Tragedy Fires","This paper explores recent public resistance to the Forest Services proffered safety legacies of tragedy fires. A rhetorical organizational communication analysis shows how a root military metaphor for firefighting has historically constrained the agencys public sensemaking about tragedy fires. Because safety is constructed as rule following, tragedies are framed as failure in discipline, solutions involve tightening the iron cage of control, and fallen firefighters are eulogized with promises for future organizational perfection. But repeated accidents only raise questions about past promises, and most recently seem to call into question the organizations rhetorical competence. The paper analyzes the discursive elements that help to sustain the organizations root military metaphor, and identifies alternate metaphors for wildland firefighting safety that might help the Forest Service to redeem its discursive competence. Implications for rhetorical tools like root metaphor analysis, lists and stories, and the enthymeme, are discussed."
2003-0472,Managing Global Public Relations from an Agency Perspective,Paper,Managing Global Public Relations from an Agency Perspective,"This study explores how public relations professionals at public relations firms, especially those who are specialized in international public relations, manage their job and work with global clients. It also examines how these professionals practices coincide with the global theory of public relations, generic principles and specific applications in public relations. While most theoretical principles are based on organizations perspectives, I attempt to focus more on the voices of public relations professionals working at firms, or agencies, and investigate issues surrounding the reality of public relations professionals in international settings. Through in-depth interviews with senior public relations professionals, I also examine the professionals perspectives on how to communicate with their international clients, how to manage differences, and what they recommend as the most effective practices of international public relations based on their experiences.
The findings show that public relations professionals try to balance general principles and specific applications in their practice. However, their unique identity as consultants makes it difficult to follow all the principles; the relationship with clients as individuals plays an important role. The best approach to the practice of public relations in an international setting is the mixture of both the global and the local approach, or local implementation under a global consistency, with providing local practitioners latitude under clear guidelines and goals of clients."
2003-0473,Mass Media Agenda Setting and its Electoral Consequences in the 2002 Primary Campaigns for Texas Governor,Paper,Mass Media Agenda Setting and its Electoral Consequences in the 2002 Primary Campaigns for Texas Governor,"This study examined mass medias attribute agenda setting and its electoral consequences in the nominating stage of a local gubernatorial election. The mass media, both the paid advertising media and the news media, did not appear to be particularly successful in shaping the publics perception of primary candidates when candidates overall attributes, including political, policy, personal, and campaign aspects, were considered. When the analysis focused primarily on personal attributes, however, the news media, especially local newspaper, showed substantial impacts on candidate images among the voters. The salience of some personal attributes further influenced the publics political preference and behavior. Specifically, the prominence of such elements as experience and competence affected candidate net favorability. The salience of experience, furthermore, functioned as a significant factor in swaying the direction of voting."
2003-0474,Measuring the Meaning of Grades: An Initial Investigation Into the Reliability and Validity of the Meaning of Grades Scale,Paper,Measuring the Meaning of Grades: An Initial Investigation Into the Reliability and Validity of the Meaning of Grades Scale,"This study investigates the Meaning of Grades scale (Goulden & Griffin, 1997) to determine its reliability and construct validity. The scale is found to be a one-dimensional scale. Once 11 non-correlating items are discarded, the resulting 14 item scale results in an alpha of 0.75. Further, the scale is correlated significantly with the Implicit Theories of Intelligence scale (Dweck, 2000), suggesting interesting implications for further research in understanding student and teacher communication about grades."
2003-0475,Media and Violence: The Historical Dimension,Paper,Media and Violence: The Historical Dimension,"The discussion of the effects of depicting violence has a long tradition, but over the centuries, indeed the millenia, the arguments repeated themselves, always related to the given new medium. In this one notices a tendency always to make the past look better than it was which, drawing on a novel by Daphne du Maurier, one can call the ""Rebecca myth"". The historical dimension is analysed with special reference to the developments in Europe. Especially the discussion in Germany after the introduction of the silent movies is used to make evident that so called modern arguments (learning theory, escapism, habituation, suggestion etc.) have been developed in the times before World War I. E.g.; learning theory is not an invention of the twentieth century, but can be found (relating to media violence) in publications of the 17th century. The author argues, that it is important to look at media history in order not to waste time by inventing the wheel again and again (concerning the effects of depictions of violence). One border has to be overcome: we have to look back and learn from history. Because (to quote Alvin Gouldner) a science ignorant of its founders does not know how far it has travelled nor in what direction."
2003-0476,Media Credibility in Bosnia: A Longitudinal Analysis of Public Opinion,Paper,Media Credibility in Bosnia: A Longitudinal Analysis of Public Opinion,"This article examines public opinion about the media sector in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accord in late 1995, the international community has donated millions of dollars to foster free and fair media. This research explores the media transition in Bosnia through a 4-year longitudinal study. The research design measured public opinion (n = 1689) about the media realism, source importance and source credibility in the two major media centers: Banja Luka and Sarajevo. The findings suggest that some independent media outlets are emerging as more important and credible sources of information than the politically motivated media. However, at the same time, politically motivated media outlets are still considered important and credible information sources."
2003-0477,"Media Effects on Voters¡¯ Political Attention, Preference, and Judgment: The Stair-Step Model",Paper,"Media Effects on Voters¡¯ Political Attention, Preference, and Judgment: The Stair-Step Model","This study explores the influence of news media on the voters¡¯ attribute agendas (cognitive attribute agenda-setting), preferences (affective attribute agenda-setting), and criteria of candidate evaluation (attribute priming) in the 2002 Texas primary elections for governor. In the cognitive regard of media effects, the news media successfully set the voters¡¯ attribute agenda for one of the three candidates. The tone of the media coverage of the campaigns also significantly influenced the voters¡¯ affective attitudes toward the candidate for whom cognitive agenda-setting effects occurred. As an attribute priming effect, the voters further employed the salient attributes about the candidate¡¯s qualifications and character in the news media as the standards for candidate choice. For the other two candidates, however, the media was not successful in influencing the voters¡¯ political perception and judgment. Political awareness appeared to be a precondition in which political attitudes are build up, and political attitudes again was a preliminary step for political behavior to occur. Strong attribute agenda-setting and priming effects of news media occurred in a particular circumstance of high need for orientation and agenda accessibility."
2003-0478,"Media Framing of the Ukrainian Political Crisis, 2000-2001",Paper,"Media Framing of the Ukrainian Political Crisis, 2000-2001","This study examined the ways different Ukrainian media -- three television channels, one newspaper, and one Internet site -- framed the Ukrainian political crisis of 2001. Dominant media frames and framing devices (Gamson & Lasch, 1983) were identified by content analysis of 829 news stories. Frames were compared across these news outlets as well as across different time periods to analyze the role of framing in public deliberation (Simon & Xenos, 2000). The study found that there was a strong influence of ideology on the way different Ukrainian media framed the news, and that this influence distorted the deliberation pattern. The study found that there were two main patterns of frames used by Ukrainian media: the overt propagandistic pattern and a pattern of hidden attempts at manipulation. The former consisted of the combination of two or more negative frames toward political opponents; the combination of one or more neutral frames and one negative frame toward the opponents comprised the latter. Metaphors and depictions were the dominant devices of framing the crisis among the Ukrainian media. Constructing the discourse, media tried to heavily exploit cultural values shared by Ukrainians: feelings associated with fascism, Civil War, Cold War, Stalin's repressions, etc."
2003-0479,"Media in the Arsenal of Nonviolence, Latvia 1986-1991",Paper,"Media in the Arsenal of Nonviolence, Latvia 1986-1991","This paper examines the role media played in the Latvian independence movement from 1986 to 1991. The Latviansalong with their neighbors the Estonians and Lithuaniansled what Mikhail Gorbachev called the parade of sovereignties and played an instrumental role in the collapse of the USSR while striving for their own freedom. The most striking characteristic of Latvias independence movement is its steady use of nonviolent action. Media were at the center of the strategy and tactics of the liberation effort. This paper explores the relationship between media, nonviolence and the successful conclusion of the movement to reclaim Latvian statehood."
2003-0480,Media Literacy and Smoking Prevention Among Adolescents: A Year 2 Evaluation,Paper,Media Literacy and Smoking Prevention Among Adolescents: A Year 2 Evaluation,"A pretest/posttest quasi-experiment (N=723) with control groups was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a media literacy curriculum implemented during 2002 in the state of Washington. The posttest-only analysis, employing a Solomon-Four-Group design, showed that nonsmokers who participated in the curriculum had higher intentions to take action against tobacco use, reflective thinking about the persuasive effects of advertising, perceived realism of ads, perceived similarity of tobacco portrayals, and perceived desirability of tobacco portrayals. This suggests that their awareness of the content in tobacco advertising had been increased, along with their motivations to resist it. Smokers who participated in the media literacy intervention demonstrated greater knowledge, efficacy, intentions to take action, reflective thinking, and perceived realism of tobacco ads. They demonstrated lower levels of identification with media portrayals of smokers, expectancies for tobacco use, and susceptibility to peer influence to use tobacco. This suggests that smokers changed a number of attitudes and beliefs predictive of tobacco use, in addition to a greater motivation to resist tobacco advertising.
The results suggest that media literacy has important and somewhat different effects on tobacco users and nonusers, indicating its potential for broad application in health communication campaigns."
2003-0481,Media Politics and Media Selfcoverage in the British Press,Paper,Media Politics and Media Selfcoverage in the British Press,"This study deals with the question of to what extent two concepts, media politics and metacoverage, which have been developed for the US American context, can be applied to the political communication system of Great Britain. The analysis draws on exclusive interviews with political journalists, PR professionals, and observers of the political process in Britain, and a systematic review of the present literature on the topic. It emerges that the theory of media politics substantial premises also apply to Great Britain and that these new conditions have led to altered story angles and narratives in the media coverage: there is a growing tendency towards news reports about the news media, news management and government publicity. This widely noticed increase in metacoverage could be explained by five factors derived from the theory of media politics and underpinned by the concept of media professionalism: It is the result of elite journalists pursuit of an independent voice, of news control, of career success, of role legitimisation, supplemented by a submission to market constraints."
2003-0482,"Media Use, Gender, and Attitudes Toward Guns and Violence",Paper,"Media Use, Gender, and Attitudes Toward Guns and Violence","A survey of 189 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory journalism class was conducted to explore the relationships among violent media use, attitudes toward guns and violence, and gender. Results indicated that video game use and television and movie use were positively related to attitudes toward guns and violence. Results also indicated that female participants were less positive toward guns, violence, and video games than were male participants. Results are interpreted in terms of cognitive schema and cognitive priming."
2003-0483,Media Violence: An Analysis of Changing and Contrasting Associations with Antisocial Aggression among Teenage Boys,Paper,Media Violence: An Analysis of Changing and Contrasting Associations with Antisocial Aggression among Teenage Boys,"The relationship between watching crime and action drama and aggressive behaviour among boys changed from positive to negative during early adolescence. This change was predicted by the theory that aggressive youngsters seek out the standard crime story to control their aggression by directing it  as the hero of this story does - towards those who break the law. Moreover, the negative relationship with antisocial aggression among boys in their late teens is also consistent with earlier US results.
This negative relationship contrasts with the positive relationship in the same age group between total exposure to screen violence and antisocial aggression, a relationship which remained positive even after it was controlled for watching all violent film and TV genres. This opens for the interpretation that watching with the main focus on violent scenes or repeated viewing of such scenes may be responsible for the positive relationship with antisocial aggression."
2003-0484,Melting the Distinction between Ethical and Legal Guidelines: A Case Examination of Enron Corporation,Paper,Melting the Distinction between Ethical and Legal Guidelines: A Case Examination of Enron Corporation,"Many corporations use legal rather than ethical standards for decision making in issues management. The Enron collapse provides a case in point summary of why legal standards should never be used as a substitute for ethical principles. Using legal standards to analyze an issue only indicates what is a legal course of action, not what is a morally desirable course of action. As we illustrate in this discussion of Enron, seeking loopholes in the law can lead to ethical violations that are more severe that legal ones. We argue that issues management is the proper location of ethical decision making in an organization. We also determine that the spirit of the law is derived from moral philosophy, and moral philosophy should be used as the ethical arbiter of organizational decision making.
An organization can manage ethical dilemmas through either a deontological approach or in a materialistic manner. We demonstrate the pitfalls of a materialist approach to ethics through use of the Enron case. This paper recommends a deontological approach based on Kantian ethics of moral autonomy and good intention as a basis for ethical issues management. We conclude by offering practical guidelines, based on deontology, to assist in ethical decision making."
2003-0485,Memorable Moments in Customer Service,Paper,Memorable Moments in Customer Service,"Customer service has become an important issue in the business world today. While most service encounters are quickly forgotten, others may leave a lasting impression. Memorable messages shared by customers may have a long-term impact on service providers. Research on memorable messages is growing, yet studies for reference are minimal, especially in the organizational realm. This study examined whether customer service representatives in a small bank in the Midwest could recall memorable messages from their customers. Forty-seven employees participated in 8 focus groups. While the employees identified few memorable messages, they identified many detailed communication interactions that had a lasting impact on them. The interactions were termed memorable moments. Four categories of memorable moments emerged: moments of procedural challenge, moments of personal confrontation, moments of personal connection, and moments of performance compliments. The paper concludes with propositions toward the development of a theory of memorable moments."
2003-0486,Mental Models of the Media,Paper,Mental Models of the Media,"When people watch television or movies, a basic goal that all viewers of the media have is to have a coherent understanding of what they are watching. To accomplish this, viewers construct mental representations of the movie as the movie unfolds. This representation includes information about the characters and situations within the movie, and prior expectations based on knowledge about the genre of movies or the actors and actresses starring in the movie. This combination of information provides the basis for understanding the movie as it unfolds and for predicting future events in the movie. Unfortunately, little research has focused on how people create a coherent understanding of what they are watching (but see Livingstone, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1996). This focus on the understanding  or coherence  of a movie, and on the cognitive representation that under girds it is central to the mental models approach.
Extensive research has been conducted focusing on mental models of text comprehension (Bower & Rinck, 1999; Garnham, 1996; Garnham & Oakhill, 1996; Gernsbacher, 1995; Graesser & Zwaan, 1995; Graesser & Wiemer-Hastings, 1999; Magliano, Zwaan, & Graesser, 1999; Oakhill, 1996; Rickheit & Habel, 1999; van Dijk, 1999; Zwaan, 1999). This research has demonstrated that mental models play an integral role in the comprehension and representation of written texts. In addition, mental models guide the nature of the inferences that people make while reading a text. In our opinion, understanding books, personal discourse, the media, or the world in general, requires constructing a coherent mental model to represent the event. To the extent that a person can construct such a model, the person is said to understand the event (Halford, 1993; Wyer & Radvansky, 1999). Unfortunately, we are aware of no research has that explored the role of mental models in the comprehension of media stories.
The mental models approach reflects the observation that thinking typically occurs within and about situations (Garnham, 1997). Mental models are the cognitive representations of (a) situations in real, hypothetical, or imaginary worlds, including space and time, (b) entities found in the situation and the states those entities are in, (c) interrelationships between the various entities and the situation, including causality and intentionality, and (d) events that occur in that situation (Garnham, 1997; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Radvansky & Zacks, 1997; Wyer & Radvansky, 1999; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998).
We have used the mental models approach to investigate how a movie is understood. When watching a movie, generating a coherent understanding of that movie can be difficult because of limitations in both attentional resources and short-term memory. Indeed, sometimes movies are designed to take advantage of these limitations to create ambiguity. Consider the movie Falling Down. In the movie, Michael Douglas plays a defense engineer (Defens) who has been fired from his job. The movie begins with him stuck in a traffic jam near downtown L.A. He abandons his car and proceeds to start walking home. Everyone he encounters, mostly stereotypic characters such as a threatening ghetto gang, a rude convenience store owner, and a white supremacist, all upset him. He reacts with increasing violence. As he walks across L.A., he calls his ex-wife, telling her that he is coming home to see his daughter for her birthday. She is clearly frightened by the phone call, indicating that there is more to the situation. By the end of the movie, viewers are convinced that Defens is insane.
There are three interpretations of the movie, based on the movie cover and comments about the movie on the web. One interpretation portrays Defens as an average man who is fighting back against an insane society (hero interpretation). A second interpretation is that the movie is a comedy about a man dealing with exaggerated everyday pressures (comedy interpretation). The third interpretation is that the movie is about a man on the edge of insanity who finally goes over the edge because of the pressures from society (insane interpretation).
Given the distinct interpretations of this movie, we decided to test whether the different interpretations resulted in different mental models of the movie. We used a multidimensional scaling (MDS) of viewers perceptions of the characters in the movie to identify the different mental models of the movie. We hypothesize that the different interpretations should manifest themselves in different configurations within a multidimensional space. In our investigation of peoples mental models of this movie, we had 89 participants watch the movie. At the end of the movie, we had them rate the similarities of the 9 main characters in the movie. That is, for every pair of characters, participants rated their similarity on a11-point scale (for a total of 36 similarity ratings). We converted the similarity ratings to dissimilarity ratings and then submitted the dissimilarity ratings to a multidimensional scaling analysis. The solution is a depiction in a multidimensional space of participants perceptions of the characters. We viewed this solution as a snapshot of the participants mental model of the movie. After the similarity ratings, participants rated on an 11-point scale their acceptance of each of the interpretations. Almost everyone thought that Defens was insane. However, about half the participants thought that he also was a hero, whereas the other half did not. We looked at the multidimensional scaling solution separately for those who thought of Defense as a hero and those who did not.
The MDS analysis indicated that a 3-dimensional representation was the best fit for both the here and the insane interpretations of the movie (insane interpretation: stress = .066, % variance = .96; here interpretation: stress = .070, % variance = .95; Kruskal & Wish, 1978). In order to interpret the multidimensional space, we had the same 89 participants rate each of the characters along a number of different dimensions. The locations of the people within the MDS were used as predictor variables and the ratings along the different variables were the criterion variable in a series of regression analysis that were used to test the fit of various dimensional interpretations (see Kruskal & Wish, 1978; Roskos-Ewoldsen, 1997). For both interpretations of the movie, the first dimension was an evaluative good/bad dimension (insane interpretation, R2 = .97; hero interpretation, good/bad R2 = .98). Defens was perceived as moderately bad in each interpretation of the movie. Likewise, the second dimension dealt with the obsessiveness of the characters (insane interpretation, R2 = .95; hero interpretation, R2 = .94). Again, Defens was interpreted as moderately obsessive in each interpretation of the movie. However, the third dimension for the insane interpretation dealt the aggressiveness of the characters (R2 = .89). Defens was judged as moderately aggressive. On the other hand, the third dimension for the hero interpretation dealt how sympathetic the characters were in the movie (R2 = .93). Defens was judged as sympathetic in this interpretation of the movie.
We interpret these findings as suggestion that people did construct different mental models for the different interpretations of the movie. Furthermore, we believe that this findings suggest that MDS provides a useful methodology for capturing snapshots of peoples mental models of a movie or television show.

2003-0487,Mental Models: Understanding the impact of fantasy violence on children's moral reasoning,Paper,Mental Models: Understanding the impact of fantasy violence on children's moral reasoning,"Abstract
This study utilized a reinterpretation of the priming hypothesis to understand the effect of fantasy violence on children's moral reasoning. A post-test only control group experimental design was utilized. A total of 121 children were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions. Children saw one of two nearly identical versions of a fantasy violence program with the ending manipulated. In the clip, the main character either used physical violence to solve a conflict or the violence was edited out and the main character appeared to walk away from the conflict. A third group of children was in the no treatment control condition. Subsequently, children were administered the Moral Interpretations of Interpersonal Violence (MIIV) scale that assesses children's judgments of violent dilemmas and assesses their reasoning about those judgments from a developmental perspective. It was found that children who saw the violent ending judged subsequent violent stories as more correct and utilized less advanced moral reasoning strategies when explaining their answers. Neither age nor empathy mediated the main effect. Therefore, it is concluded that the activation of mental models regarding violence is an automatic process that occurs somewhat independently of other potential mediators."

Meta-commentary is shown to provide participants with a way of informing, regulating and arguing. Applying a rules theory to meta-commentary (Carbaugh, 1988) demonstrates how the cultural values integrated throughout communicative actions are representative of a democratic scene. Moores and Myerhoffs (1977) categories for understanding collective ritual reveal how the ritual form and function of meta-commentary is linked to a cultural discourse for structuring participation in this speech community. This discourse emphasizes particular ways of communicating as a member of this group and emphasizes the cultural symbol community."
2003-0489,Methods of Doing Sensitivity in Public Discourse,Paper,Methods of Doing Sensitivity in Public Discourse,"The selection and use of reference terms in discourse can do much to indicate whom a speaker is addressing and with whom he or she is aligning. This can be particularly problematic in public address, in that the selection of one descriptor or proterm over another can effectively include one category or population of persons in the audience and exclude others. Indeed, some seemingly generic or ambiguous references, when situated within public discourse, can be used to infer that differences or asymmetries are being implied between categories or populations of persons. In a speech exchange system whose design demonstrates a concern with inclusiveness, drawing boundaries between participants and their positions on issues under deliberation can be a sensitive matter, particularly if the issues are controversial, or potentially divisive.

In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of managing alignment with others while maintaining one's differences with, or distance from, them, as evidenced in speakers' use of an ambiguously inclusive categorical reference term, ""we."" Our analytic site is in the speech of participants in a public meeting. The paper begins by reviewing what we know about ""doing sensitivity"" and gives background on the public meeting that is the paper's focus. Then we analyze the uses of ""we"" in the presentations of two participants at this meeting. We show that the indexicality and ambiguity of ""we"" and related terms are used by speakers to distance themselves from certain categories of persons and activities, while at the same time including members of the audience, and aligning themselves with categories of persons among them. These uses of ""we,"" we argue, provide participants with a means of indexing yet obscuring the moral judgment of persons and/or moral implications of their actions. That is, we demonstrate how uses of ""we"" call attention to the matters under discussion, and the very discussion of them, as ""sensitive,"" or potentially disruptive to the proceedings and divisive or offensive to parties involved in them."

2003-0491,Mezzanine Politics,Paper,Mezzanine Politics,"This paper examines the relationship between public opinion and public policy in a regional Australian city and provides evidence to support an argument that special interest groups have the capacity to escape scrutiny from within the public sphere.

It demonstrates why special interest groups fail to achieve their goals and why others  which attain what I will refer to as mezzanine status  succeed politically without reference to the Mayhewian notion of the redemption of rhetorical tokens. It follows the work of Habermas and Mayhew presenting evidence that professional communicators have the means of social influence at their disposal.

It examines the role of the newspaper in the determination of sociopolitics and attempts to place in context theories of persuasion and influence as they occur at local government level.

It analyses newspaper reporting of a proposal to invest in a high-risk low-yield scheme to develop commercial interests using taxpayer funding.

The paper focuses on the central roles played by journalists and politicians  acting as professional communicators  in the Australian city of Orange in supporting unconditionally economic development. It attempts to argue that political influence is assisted by mass media and of greater intensity in regional areas.

It examines government financial support based on Andsagar's (2001) proposition that interest groups attempt to shape public opinion using competing news frames.

It provides an analysis of the political process of policy making at and the precedent to invest taxpayer funds in high-risk low-yield proposals."

Tolkiens Lord of the Rings trilogy, the fantasy realm of Middle-earth has been transformed from a literary abstraction into a filmic visualization. During the novels four-year transition from page to screen, online fan clubs and CMC have been sustaining life-lines for fans to connect to each other, to the literary texts, to the world of Middle-earth, and most volubly, to writer/director Peter Jacksons artistic decisions. Thus, an ancient borderland inhabited by hobbits, dwarves, elves, goblins, and wizards is reinvented and revitalized as a futuristic borderland inhabited by USENETers, chatters, gamers, and avatars. Throughout the entire process of writing the screenplay, casting the characters, filming the production, and marketing the trilogy, Jackson and New Line Cinema have engaged in collaborative and promotional interactions with Tolkien online fans. This paper examines the impact of CMC at those four stages of cinematic adaptation. Then, it is argued that the process portends a new model of cultural production -- one with implications for the future role of the Internet as a public sphere and forum for the dissemination of opinion, fact, propaganda and publicity."

This paper argues that it has not. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among Burmese opposition activists in Thailand, this paper demonstrates how gender operates as the dominant frame through which communications technologies are understood and used. In the Burmese context, conventional understandings of gender have worked together with the global discourses of democracy and human rights to reinforce gender and ethnic inequities, ultimately facilitating the process of militarization. Perhaps the greatest hope for change, however, lies in the fact that women themselves are working to change the practices that have for so long inhibited the process of genuine democratization. It is the work of these women and other marginalized groups around the world to counteract militarized approaches to communication that may ultimately offer us the best hope for the demilitarization and genuine democratization of our interconnected world."

Conducting a feminist and semiotic analysis of stories that appeared in the American Journalism Review, Columbia Journalism Review, Communicator, Broadcast and Cable, and Quill, the paper argues that journalists public memories of their work relied on masculine metaphors of military and sport, reproduced Orientalist images of Muslim men, and privileged empiricist tasks of knowledge production over complex processes of internal reflection and historical contextualization. Exploring the reasons for such a masculinist construction of the profession, the analysis will situate the profession of journalism within other discourses of masculine capability and public ignorance of the Muslim world. Finally, fleshing out the implications of the analysis for pedagogy, the paper will offer recommendations for the training of future journalists in the classroom."
2003-0497,Mobilization or Media Malaise - How political media coverage changes German recipients' satisfaction with democracy,Paper,Mobilization or Media Malaise - How political media coverage changes German recipients' satisfaction with democracy,"An old and basically unsolved problem is whether political media coverage causes political mobilization or political alienation. Both of these contradictory assumptions seem to have been verified to the same extend by empirical studies. Yet, both theories are mostly examined by one time surveys which do not justify the claim that recipients' evaluations were really caused by media coverage. As a consequence, it remains unsure which of these assumptions is correct.
This study is concerned with the influence of political media coverage on individual changes in recipients' judgments on politics. We employed a combination of the methods of content analysis of television news and a panel survey conducted in six waves within a period of over three years. Content analysis data and survey data were then linked for each individual recipient. Recipients who had obtained predominantly positive information about politicians and political parties via television news four weeks prior to an interview did not develop a more positive political attitude. However, those recipients who had received predominantly negative information developed a less favorable view on politics. Causes and effects of these results will be discussed."

Along with an increased representation in weekly series, the often-ghettoized genre of the made-for-TV-movie followed suit in depicting sexual minorities. In these films, a noticeable trend is their adherence to what some have critiqued in the television movie as the personalization of the political. Most specifically, network and non-pay cable channels have tended to focus their lesbian narratives on universal issues of family (often the victimized mother). I will show how both Two Mothers for Zachary and What Makes a Family?, by addressing the universal concepts of mother and justice, exceed the expectations of docudrama by troubling homophobic politics while addressing an audience through an overt personalization of and manipulation by the films narratives. However, while these films render explicit the pervasive homophobia and hypocritical notions of family which guide our justice system, they simultaneously construct a limited and legitimized notion of The Lesbian via narrative (re)construction and star involvement. By examining the narratives, true stories, and popular reviews of these two films, I explore the possible ramifications of the clustered presentations of the victimized lesbian mother. Furthermore, with an eye toward the work of Judith Butler, Christine Holmlund, and Sue Ellen Case, I attempt to uncover The Lesbian who through repeated representation and call for identification becomes legitimized while alternatives are made invisible and/or inferior."
2003-0500,Monitoring and Blunting Coping Styles as Moderators of Fear Appeal Effects,Paper,Monitoring and Blunting Coping Styles as Moderators of Fear Appeal Effects,"Monitoring and Blunting Coping Styles as Moderators of Fear Appeal Effects
Over 50 years of fear appeal research still leaves us uncertain as to the conditions under which fear may effectively lead to adaptive attitude and behavior change. Theoretical emphasis has been placed on the relative weighting of threat and efficacy perceptions to understand adaptive versus maladaptive action (e.g., Rogers, 1975, Witte, 1992). While these perceptions are clearly important for the evocation of fear and potential responses, no fear appeal model based solely on these concepts is particularly well-supported by empirical research (Boster & Mongeau, 1984; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Mongeau, 1998; Witte, 1994). Surprisingly, though emotions are generally considered a mechanism to cope for the environment (e.g., Lazarus, 1991), fear most especially, extant research has not considered how coping style might impact the effects of fear arousal on information processing and message acceptance.
Monitoring and blunting coping styles are believed to reflect the degree to which people seek out or avoid information when confronting threatening situations (Miller, 1987). A number of studies investigating the effect of monitoring and blunting in clinical settings conclude that monitors tend to experience more anxiety during medical procedures, tend to respond better to more information, and pay more attention to preventative health behaviors (Miller, 1991). However, unanswered questions include how the effects of a message designed to evoke anxiety or fear might be processed differently by monitors versus blunters and to what effect. Stated differently, perhaps adaptive versus maladaptive reactions to fear appeals is a function not just of perceived severity weighed against perceived efficacy, but of coping style triggered in the face of threatening information. In considering coping style in the context of fear appeal exposure, we posit two hypotheses, noting first that monitoring and blunting are not considered opposite ends of the same scale, but rather two distinct coping styles.
First as monitors desire information and blunters avoid it, we would expect a positive correlation between monitoring and message processing depth, but a negative association between blunting and processing depth (H1). Second, whereas monitors and blunters should have comparable reactions under conditions of low fear arousal, we would expect that under conditions of greater fear arousal, monitors would have a more positive response to the message but blunters would have a more negative one.
Method
Of 320 city residents handed a survey ostensibly to examine reactions to information about diabetes, 290 were returned completed. Respondents¡¦ mean age was 44.78 years (SD = 14.65); 59% were female, 41Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide characterale. After completing demographic and perceived knowledge (Ñ = .92) and relevance (Ñ = .86) items for several health topics including diabetes, respondents read a message about diabetes designed as a mild fear appeal. The message contained information about prevalence and risk factors for diabetes, the symptoms and health complications associated with type 2 diabetes, and the steps people can take to protect their health (i.e., health diet, exercise, and get tested). Participants then completed a depth of message processing scale (Ñ = .94), a biased processing measure (Ñ = .82), attitude and behavioral intention measures for a dieting (Ñ = .78 and Ñ = .68) and getting a blood test (Ñ = .83 and testing Ñ = .79), fear arousal during message exposure (Ñ = .93), monitoring and blunting scales (Ñ = .77 and Ñ = .84 respectively), and family and personal history of diabetes.
Analyses were based on ANCOVAs for which the predictor variables ¡V fear, monitoring, and blunting ¡V were dichotomized based on median splits. Relevant control variables were taken into consideration, including sex, age, education level, race, current health, topic relevance, perceived knowledge, family history, and prior diabetes screening.
Results
H1: Monitoring, Blunting, and Message Processing
Partial correlations indicated a positive relationship between monitoring coping style and message processing depth (r = .14, p < .05, n = 271), and a negative association between blunting and processing depth (r = -.16, p < .01, n = 271). These results confirm H1 and serve as an indication of the validity of the coping style and message processing measures. Of note, blunting was positively correlated with biased processing (r = .12, p = .05, n = 271), suggesting that as expected, blunters engaged in cognitive techniques to discount threatening information. There was no association between monitoring and biased processing (r = -.01, ns).
H2: Coping Style, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions
Two sets of dependent measures were included in the survey: attitudes and behavioral intentions toward dieting behavior and getting a blood test to possibly diagnose diabetes. All dependent measures were subjected to Monitoring (low vs. high) x Blunting (low vs. high) x Fear (low vs. high) ANCOVA analysis. For three of the four analyses (all but attitude toward getting a blood test), a main effect for fear was evidenced (all ps T .05). For both behavioral intention measures, the high fear group was more persuaded. However, for attitude toward dieting, the low fear group was more persuaded. A main effect for blunting was identified only for attitude toward blood testing (p = .05) for which low blunters had more positive attitudes than high blunters. No main effect for monitoring was revealed in the analyses.
For three of the four analyses (all but attitude toward dieting), the expected Monitoring x Fear interaction was evidenced (ps T .05). In all cases, the high and low monitors differed little when experiencing low fear. However, when aroused, high monitors indicated stronger attitudes towards getting a blood test and intentions to get a blood test and diet relative to low monitors.
Counter to hypothesis, no Fear x Blunting interactions proved significant. However, a 3-way Fear x Monitoring x Blunting interaction appeared in two of the analyses: attitude toward blood testing and intentions to diet (ps < .05). For blood testing attitude, the interaction suggesting that the fear x monitoring interaction was particularly strong for the low blunters. Conversely, for intentions to diet, the fear x monitoring interaction was particularly strong for the high blunters.
In sum, these findings suggest that coping style ¡V monitoring in particular -- is a potentially important factor to consider when investigating the persuasive effects of fear appeals. Though no conclusive claims can be drawn a consistent pattern of high monitors responding particularly well when more fearful suggests this to be a variable worth including in future research on fear appeals. Additional findings focused on processing style and models of the relationships reported here will be included in the completed version of this paper.

What is the role of journalists in voicing norms and myths about issues related to race and ethnicity?
The case subject is the refusal of a Swedish town, Sjöbo, to accept refugees in 1987 and 1988 in violation of national immigration policy. A storm of negative coverage accompanied the unfolding political situation; in its wake, the town came to symbolize xenophobia, racism, and general backwardness in Swedish society.

The paper begins with Stephen Reeses idea of a News Paradigm, seeking to understand the medias role in supporting the dominant ideology and the News Paradigms function therein. Data were gathered using content and discourse analysis of 300 newspaper articles as well as transcriptions of depth interviews with the journalists who regularly covered the story.

The analysis indicates that the news paradigm is strong but not invisible, because journalists operate self-consciously within it. The newspaper article texts are strikingly similar both in terms of the normative consensus they support and in terms of the professional ideology reflected in them. However, interviews with the journalists suggest that they felt trapped by the news paradigm, implying that its primary strength, its invisibility, is undermined by individual journalist sensibilities.

In addition, analysis of newspaper articles reveals that the medias role in describing and perhaps perpetuating events became a prominent subtext in the newspaper narrative."

In a set of experiments embedded in a general population survey, I examine the effect of adding visual elements to traditional verbal knowledge questions. Then, I compare respondents' performance on two scales of political knowledge, a scale that measures visual recognition of politicians, and a traditional verbal knowledge scale. Data for this paper comes from a web-based survey of 2,358 randomly selected U.S. residents. Using a web-based survey design allows me to add photos of politicians to knowledge questions. I find, first, that minimal visual cues can increase people's performance on verbal political knowledge tests. Second, the analysis reveals clear differences between the sources of verbal and visual political knowledge. People who prefer visual news media-television news, rather than radio news or newspapers-have greater visual political knowledge. Verbal knowledge, in contrast, increases with political interest regardless of which medium people prefer. Basing our assessments of political knowledge only on verbal measures thus hides a major contribution of TV news to increasing political knowledge and disadvantages people in traditional knowledge tests who get a lot of their political information from television."

Participants rational and experiential thinking styles were measured using Pacini & Epsteins (1999) Rational Experiential Inventory (REI). Experiential thinking did not relate to the encoding and decoding of spontaneous communication displays; however, it was positively correlated with expressiveness and extraversion. Communication accuracy was high overall and women were more proficient than men at encoding and decoding. A communication accuracy pattern similar to that reported by Buck et al. (1972) was found."

The purpose of this study was to explore language shift, and parental folk beliefs and language ideologies of parents of first graders in Taiwan. Twenty-two parents and guardians of first graders enrolled in mother tongue instruction were interviewed using open-ended probes in two sites: Chhan-chng, a rural community and Taipei County, an urban area. Ethnographic notes were kept noting the physical space, participants, and circumstances of each interview. Analysis of demographic information showed a shift away from mother tongue speech, Tai-gi (also called Taiwanese, Hokkien, Southern Min) in the eldest generation to Mandarin among parents and children. This shift was greater among children living in Taipei County than Chhan-chng. Household composition best explains this regional difference. Analyses of parental folk beliefs found different perceptions across the two sites regarding how language is linked to identity in Taiwan. Similarly, parents generally supported mother tongue education as a way to preserve Tai-gi and enhance cross-generational family communication, and parents accommodate their language to meet the real and perceived language abilities of other interactants.

2003-0506,Motivated Information Search and Candidate Evaluations: On-Line Versus Memory-Based Process Models,Paper,Motivated Information Search and Candidate Evaluations: On-Line Versus Memory-Based Process Models,"The paper will report the results of a study that analyzes how (potential) voters form candidate evaluations in a dynamic campaign environment. We analyze the process by which initial candidate preference guides a subsequent search and selection of campaign information; how recipients of this information integrate it in an on-line affective tally; and/or how they store and retrieve the information from memory to form a final candidate preference and candidate evaluations. The study draws on several theories and addresses issues that have received considerable attention in recent years.
The cognitive information processing framework (Lang, 2000) has paid increasing attention to motivated information processing. The central idea is that recipients of information are not just passive receivers of information but are actively engaged in processing information. Preexisting attitudes and preferences, as well as processing goals, affect the selection, perception and acceptance of messages (Baumeister & Newman, 1994; Biek, Wood, & Chaiken, 1996; Ditto & Lopez, 1992; Kunda, 1990; Lodge & Taber, 2000). The research cited above stresses the important role of affect in information processing, exemplified in concepts such as hot cognition and on-line information processing (the sequential updating of evaluative tallies).
Two types of process models are used to explain the formation of candidate evaluations (Lavine, 2002). The on-line process assumes that voters, once they have formed an initial impression of the candidates, incrementally update a running, affective tally for each candidate whenever they encounter information about the candidate (anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic). While the running affective tally is stored and is highly accessible in memory, the memory for the content of the information usually decays quickly. The memory-based process, on the other hand, assumes that voters only form a candidate evaluation when asked for it. Only then they start searching their memory for relevant information and integrate their thoughts into an overall evaluation. Our first research question (RQ1) is to determine which of the two processes postulated above is a better predictor of final candidate evaluations.
Furthermore, information processing is goal-oriented, and the type of processing goal has been found to influence the processing mode (Huang & Price, 2001; Redlawsk, 2001). More specifically, the goal of forming an impression about candidates should induce an on-line formation of candidate evaluations and lead to a lower recall of information. The goal to learn and remember as much as possible about candidates should attenuate an on-line formation of candidate evaluations and facilitate a memory-based process. Our first hypothesis (H1) predicts that the information processing goal (task manipulation: impression formation vs. learning condition) will influence how candidate evaluations are formed (processing mode: on-line vs. memory-based, respectively).
Processing goal and processing mode can influence how voters search and recall information about candidates (Lau, 1995). More specifically, voters who merely form an impression of candidates can be expected to focus on one candidate at a time (candidate-centered information search) and update their affective tally without encoding most content of the information in memory. Those who want to learn and remember as much as possible about the candidates can be expected to both look for and recall more information across candidates (comparative information search). Thus, our second hypothesis (H2) predicts that processing goal and processing mode influence the type of the information search (candidate-centered vs. comparative). Our third hypothesis (H3) predicts that processing goal and processing mode influence the amount of recall (low vs. high recall).
Methodologically, the paper proposes and uses a computer-based study design that introduces enhanced realism in the study. Instead of exposing participants to a fixed set of specific messages in a static environment and merely measuring their reactions, our study used a dynamic information board that created a fictional campaign environment that is over-saturated with quickly changing information. Out of necessity, participants were forced to be selective and could choose only a limited number of messages. The computer-based study used custom-developed software (in Visual Basic 6) to dynamically present the information in form of headlines (and associated articles) and to track the information selection and processing behavior of the study participants. After completing the search, participants were asked about their perceptions and ratings of the information.

Data & Methods
The data collection for the experiment was completed in Summer 2002.
Participants: The participants were 229 undergraduate students who were offered extra credit for study participation.
Design, Procedure, and Stimuli: After participants completed an initial questionnaire about political issues, they were randomly assigned to either an accuracy condition (to learn and remember as much as possible about the candidates) or an impression formation condition (to form an impression of the candidates). The former condition was expected to induce a more systematic and objective information search, the latter condition was expected to facilitate development of an affective on-line tally as well as a more directional, biased information search that will strengthen the initial candidate preference.
The subsequent procedures were identical for both conditions. All participants were asked to play the role of a voter during a fictitious election campaign for an open congressional seat in Illinois. They were told they should be prepared to vote for a candidate in the upcoming election. The experiment required that they choose headlines and articles from the last ten weeks of the campaign. During the task, participants were presented with a random sequence of 40 headlines that, when clicked on, opened newspaper-style stories associated with the candidates in a window. On the front-page of the newspaper, participants always encountered four headlines that changed every 25 seconds to the next set of four headlines. On each screen, each candidate was mentioned in two of the headlines (one positive and one negative, respectively). The valence of the headlines was manipulated by using negative or positive words in the headline. A list of positive words (e.g., praise, hail, support) and negative words (e.g., accuse, oppose, criticize) was developed and used to create the headlines. The headline order across the ten screens and on each screen was randomized. The computer kept track of the selection and processing behavior (headlines, reading time) of the participants.
After their vote, participants were asked to complete several additional scales and tasks that measured information processing and effect variables. These included detailed candidate ratings, demographics, political predispositions, and a free recall/thought listing task. Participants were also asked to rate their recall items in terms of valence and importance for their candidate evaluations. They were also shown the articles they had read during the information search and asked to rate each of them in terms of valence and whether they perceived candidate bias.

Implications
By focusing on how voters process campaign information, the proposed study makes an important contribution to the research on how voters pay attention to campaign information and form candidate evaluations. The dynamic study design presented the participants with a fast-moving, information-saturated campaign environment that forced them to be selective. Giving participants the ability to select messages introduced increased realism in the experimental design and should facilitate the observation of motivated information processing. Because citizens in the real world have the ability to be selective, denying participants in previous experiments this opportunity limits the ability of these studies to understand how recipients process political campaign information.
The study design allows us to track and analyze participants information search behavior. This makes it possible to better determine with more appropriate measures which processing mode participants use to form candidate evaluations. The actual encounter of messages during the information search helps to measure on-line processing, and the recalled information helps to measure for memory-based processing. By focusing on the process between stimulus (campaign information) and response (candidate evaluations), we are able to shed some light on the information processing that happens in the black box of the human mind. Our paper will discuss in detail the implications of our findings for the specific theories involved and for political information processing in general.

The study also aimed to assess whether these SMS motives are related to age, gender, current education, mobile phone experience, SMS experience and SMS use. We located four types of motives for using SMS: entertainment, social interaction, immediate access, and efficiency (in time). Immediate access and social interaction were most salient and more often endorsed by young people than entertainment and efficiency (in time). The results of this study show that the most salient reason for young people in the age of 12 to 25 to use SMS is the convenience of being able to contact and interact with their peers whenever they want and wherever they are. To distinguish heavy SMS users from moderate SMS users, the following significant predictors were established: entertainment, social interaction, immediate access, mobile phone use, and current education. A remarkable finding from our study is that apparently, adolescents (age 12 to 18) use SMS more often for intrinsic or social use, like entertainment and social interaction, than young adults (age 18 to 25), who use SMS more often for instrumental or task-oriented use, like efficiency (in time). Another interesting finding was that although male and female users do not differ with respect to the number of messages sent, female users are apparently more enthusiastic about using SMS as a means of communication than male users."

Although there is some evidence to support the idea that restructuring normative beliefs can result in behavior change, the norms literature is silent about how or why this influence occurs. The literature also confounds descriptive and injunctive norms. Through a 2 (descriptive norms: high or low) x 2 (perceived benefits: high or low) x 2 (similarity: high or low) between-subjects (N = 174) experiment, we tested whether two cognitive mechanisms moderated the norms-behavior link. Results indicated that descriptive norms do not exert a direct influence on behavior. Rather, perceived benefits moderated the relation between descriptive norms and behavioral intention and perceived similarity moderated the relation between descriptive norms and self-efficacy. Recommendations for norms-based campaigns include (a) making distinctions between descriptive and injunctive norms, (b) specifying the underlying moderating variables, and (c) distinguishing strategies to improve self-efficacy from those to change behaviors."

Inspecting a sample of MTVs programming against the backdrop of the more traditional 60 Minutes enables a consideration of which old-guard practices might be due for retirement and which alternative attributes might enhance the appeal of news magazines. Among the traits discussed are reporter roles, camera shots, and sound tracks. The differences between 60 Minutes and MTVs programs point to a generations willingness to obscure the line between information and entertainment and desire to decide issues of culpability for themselves."

Using the ethnography methodologies, this paper examines how U. S. college students employ tattooing as non-verbal communication to establish their identities and create personal meanings. Over a two-month period, the author did in-depth interviews with more than 20 college students at a Midwestern university who had gotten tattoos. The author argues that although tattooing among college students was a form of cultural consumption, these tattooed students also tried to transform tattoos into signifers distinguishing themselves from others, and freeze a special moment in time or a relationship as an antidote to postmodern fluidity. The author also found that these young students got tattoos as a form of non-verbal intra-personal communication, which means the tattoo is more than a visual signifer open to other people's interpretations; it also serves as a signifer with special signifed meaning to the tattooed persons themselves."

Using the theory that journalism plays a mythological role in American society, the authors suggest that these phrases fueled an idealized scenario in which a victimized nation responded heroically. The paper then broadens the news-as-myth theory to encompass hegemony theory. Viewed through this lens, the authors suggest that the narratives underpinning these phrases played an important role in framing subsequent events."

Very little attention, however, has been directed toward myth-making online. This paper explores the myths created by and about Mexicos Zapatista movement online. Three significant myths and their implications are discussed: (1) the myth of the universal Marcos; (2) of noble savages and passive victims; and (3) of the neoliberal beast. These myths inscribe the movement with meaning that goes well beyond events and circumstances in Mexico and they channel the energies of national and international supporters. This case of myth-making helps to explore the ways people use myths online to come together, to address issues of global concern, and to make sense of the unwieldy amount of information on the Internet."

It examines the literature on television flows, advances several specific research propositions, and then examines the actual production and importation of television programs in sixteen countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and NAFTA. National production is compared with imports from the U.S., from within the country's cultural linguistic region, and to other international imports. We look at the countries over 40 years, in 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, and 2001. This empirical data base permits to examine trends in light of several competing theoretical predictions from cultural imperialism, cultural proximity, and asymmetrical interdependence."
2003-0514,Nationwide Newpaper Coverage of Detainee Rights,Paper,Nationwide Newpaper Coverage of Detainee Rights,"The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent war in Afghanistan has created some unique problems for the United States government. One of the issues to be dealt with is what to do with the former Taliban fighters who have been captured in Afghanistan. The most dangerous have been transported to the detainee camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba where they are being held under heavy guard indefinitely. A controversy has arisen over how to treat the detainees. The issue has not only created a partisan spit, it has polarized parts of the Bush administration and put the U.S. at odds with the rest of the world. This study uses a community structure approach to explore the connection between city characteristics and nationwide newspaper coverage of extending Prisoner of War status to the Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees imprisoned at Guantanamo, Cuba. A sample of 302 articles, chosen from 22 newspapers across the nation, was coded for prominence and article direction (favorable, unfavorable, or neutral). The results were combined to calculate a single-score Media Vector for each newspaper. A Pearson Correlation revealed significant, favorable relationships between Republicans and detainee rights coverage. Catholics, Democrats, and Hispanics were found to be significantly related to negative coverage of detainee rights. A regression analysis revealed that five variables accounted for 951f the variance: stakeholders (% Republican); media access (]able-subscribers); Buffer (come over 100,000); Position in Lifecycle (children 8-18); and violated buffer (ü¿°rime)."

A national cross section sample of 14 city newspapers was drawn using the Lexis-Nexis, Dialog Select, and Newsbank databases, sampling all articles 150 words or more in length between 1981 and 2001, resulting in 144 articles. The articles were then coded for both prominence and article direction (favorable, unfavorable, or neutral), then combined to calculate a single score Media Vector for each newspaper. The scores ranged from 0.284 to -0.401, with positive scores favoring and negative scores opposing music censorship.

Pearson Correlations linking city characteristics and Media Vectors supported both stakeholder and violated buffer hypotheses, falling into four clusters: partisanship stakeholders (% Voting Democratic - r =-.518, p = .029, % Voting Republican - r = .621, p = .009); belief system stakeholders (devotional reading  r =.673 p = .004); lifecycle position stakeholders (families with children under 7  r = .519 p = .029); and violated buffer, associating privilege with opposition to censorship (4 Years college  r = -.505 p = .033). Regression analysis revealed that four variables account for 921f the variance in newspaper coverage: % Republican voters and % Democratic voters (accounting for 681003410535f the variance), number of FM Radio stations, and number of Music Dealers."
2003-0516,Negotiating Boy Culture: Young Women Working in College Radio,Paper,Negotiating Boy Culture: Young Women Working in College Radio,"Over the last two decades college radio has become commodified in various ways, resulting in two identifiable trends at specific college stations: standardization and professionalization. This essay suggests that these two trends have affected feminist cultural production by creating an andocentric climate, silencing young women at college radio stations. Relying primarily on interviews with women working at four different college stations in the US, and applying a feminist political economic theoretical framework, this essay highlights and interprets their experiences working in college radio. Throughout the course of this project, the young women interviewed demonstrated two distinct reactions to commodification occurring at these stations. These reactions are significant because they point to an important legacy of Riot Grrrl. Women who self identified as having a Riot Grrrl feminist sensibility responded in more nuanced, informed and critical ways than women who did not claim such an identity."

We examine how Dutch newspapers frame the Bosnian war. From our perspective framing starts with the selection process, resulting in specific way of covering the news. Our research shows that the newspapers produce significantly more news about human suffering than the chronology (extra media data about the daily events in the conflict made by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation on Srebrenica NIOD, 2002). The assumption that news coverage increases when national interests are at stake finds its proof as well. The presence of Dutch soldiers in Bosnia guarantees a continuous attention to their activities. The research shows also remarkable differences between the various newspapers in media coverage."

Findings reveal some congruence as well as deviance in the patterns of evaluating news events by the three agencies. They all kept a close eye on events in the Asia-Pacific area, followed by North America; Latin America was the most inconspicuous to them. Each news agency had different types of events to look for from its neighboring nations and its own territory. The good news syndrome with Xinhua and the bad news mentality with Central News and Kyodo in their approaches to domestic news were also unmistakable. The selections of top events by each news service also reflect its particular stance and value judgments on Asian geopolitics."

During a 16-day coverage of the air disaster, journalists from the United States and South Korea reported the cause of the crash very differently. Korean journalists framed the cause on a combination of bad weather, faulty navigation devices, and negligence on the part of the Guam air traffic controllers but American journalists highlighted pilot error as the most probable cause. The comparative textual analysis of the news stories in the New York Times and NBC Nightly News of the United States, and JoongAng Ilbo and KBS News at 9 of South Korea, as well as depth interviews with the journalists who covered the crash, traces the divergent reporting to national interest, dissimilar interpretations of information from news sources, and preconceived personal biases held by these journalists.

The present study focuses on sensationalism in the main evening newscasts, covering both domestic and international news. In order to attach construct validity to the concept, sensationalism is defined and measured in terms of the psychological concepts of 'vividness' and 'salience'. A sample of 698 news items was analyzed. The analyses revealed, that according to some indicators television newscasts have become more sensational between 1995 and 2001, and that the most recently started program has played the biggest role in this process. Particularly the findings concerning the indicators which might best represent the 'vividness' of the sensationalist news, were in line with the hypotheses."

2003-0523,"News Norms, Indexing and a Unified Government",Paper,"News Norms, Indexing and a Unified Government","Abstract
From the early days following the terrorist attacks through the height of the U.S. military campaign, the president and his administration enjoyed a unique position with their substantial level of Congressional and public support that continued on into the military campaign in Afghanistan (Gallup 2001a). During this same period, the administration was able to concentrate their messages and war themes in selling the idea of a war on terrorism to the American people. With the unprecedented speed of moving to an overseas military campaign, near nonexistent Congressional criticism and the majority of the country rallying around the flag as a backdrop, the research presented here analyzed a census of news and editorial coverage of the New York Times and Washington Post between September 11 and the December 18th fall of Kabul, with the goal of examining the journalistic adherence of Tuchman (1972) and Bennetts (1990, 1996) newsgathering norms. Specifically, we attempted to discover if there would be discernable patterns in news coverage relevant to not only Bennetts (1990) Indexing theory, but a host of other academic findings that have since constructed new rules and aspects to Bennetts original 1990 indexing theory."
2003-0524,News of Priority Issues in Print vs. Internet Newspapers,Paper,News of Priority Issues in Print vs. Internet Newspapers,"A content analysis of three print newspapers and a panel study of these three print newspapers and their Internet counterparts found that news of priority issues identified from the two versions are significantly different, and the rank order correlations of the priority issues between content analysis and the Internet panel and between the print and Internet panels vary across the three newspapers. Prominence cues used in the print newspapers were also used in the Internet newspapers with two additional dimensions: immediate access and no wait for display. About 731f the news items retrieved from the Internet newspapers came from sections carrying national, international and political news. The findings reconfirm the agenda-setting function of print newspapers. They also suggest that readers may notice and read somewhat different stories on the Internet newspapers due to their different delivery and access pattern. However, it may not be true that readers will read less news of social significance if they access news information from the Internet newspapers."

The link between real or perceived bias by news organizations and consumers ideological preferences is often assumed, but relatively few empirical tests have been conducted. This paper investigates whether the particular newspaper that citizens read correlates with partisan preferences. Data include survey responses from the 1992 and 1997 British General Election studies. Britain provides a unique environment for such a test as most major newspapers have clearly perceived partisan biases. Respondents party identification, newspaper readership, and major party evaluations demonstrate that media consumption correlates with partisan and ideological preferences, although news consumers who read papers are more likely to modify their perceptions of party ideology in the direction of press bias. Media consumption correlates with ideological preferences and perceptions of political parties."
2003-0526,Newspaper Reporting in Another Time: The Ethics of Theodore Dreiser,Paper,Newspaper Reporting in Another Time: The Ethics of Theodore Dreiser,"Theodore Dreiser is best known for epic works of fiction such as Sister Carrie and An American Tragedy. But his early journalistic work is often dismissed because he freely admitted making up facts and stories as a reporter. But should he be judged by standards that werent even in place at the time of his newspaper career? Are critics of Dreisers early newspaper work caught up in a bad case of presentism? Even more importantly, if those well-known and imbedded notions/rules/guidelines that steer a journalist today were not in place, how did Theodore Dreiser and other reporters of that era make decisions on proper behavior?
Using Dreisers extensive autobiography on his brief newspaper career, this paper will attempt to strip away todays thoughts on the role of a journalist and find out how one person came into a newspaper career without any experience in the 1890s and proceeded to learn the culture of being a reporter. Those experiences will be matched against a framework of specific historical views of that eras journalism."
2003-0527,"New Women, Deviant Bodies: Unruly Functioning, Diagnosis and the Refeminization of Depression",Paper,"New Women, Deviant Bodies: Unruly Functioning, Diagnosis and the Refeminization of Depression","Historically, womens untraditional or gender-disrupting behaviors have been fodder for psychiatric diagnosis. The 19th century hysteria epoch, for example, has been critiqued as a moment of pathologization of mass middle females challenging the gender status quo rather than an actual epidemic of mental disorder. This paper argues that hysteria shares numerous symptoms with other periods in western history where women have been pathologized. It tracks these similarities by deconstructing the ""symptoms"" ascribed to the different disorders, including neurosis in the 1950s, personality disorders and post traumatic stress disorder in the 1980s and most recently, depression. Even while psychiatric literature describes depression as a disease that doesnt discriminate, this study argues that the psychiatric discourse works specifically to dub womens coping mechanisms and low productivity as dysfunctional and thereby ""re-feminizes"" depression. By drawing out the similarities among 20th century ""female"" disorders, the study contends that depression and depression-linked diagnoses have become normalized in the late 20th century. More, this cultural comfort with naming womens distress as disorder has allowed for new ""technologies"" of behavioral discipline to arise, namely activities of self-scrutiny, self-diagnosis, an appetite for psychopharmaceutical drugs and self-conducted treatments, and finally, new diagnosis created by mainstream media."
2003-0528,NGOs AND GOVERNMENT: THE SOCIAL SHAPING OF INTERNET FROM BELOW,Paper,NGOs AND GOVERNMENT: THE SOCIAL SHAPING OF INTERNET FROM BELOW,"This paper argues that novel approaches to social development of the Internet have emerged in Latin America. NGOs and social movements were a much greater influence on the early development of the Internet there, relative to commercial and other actors. This seems to have left important effects on the role of the Internet in society. The very early use of the Internet as a international tool for organizing resources and support by the Zapatistas in 1991 was only the most visible of a number of ways that NGOs, social movements and political groups throughout Latin America began to use the Internet to network among each other and mobilize support abroad. Small NGOs in Brazil were often using the Internet before medium size businesses. Peru developed extensive public Internet access before the United States did. While many businesses and branches of government are only now beginning to use the Internet, hundreds of NGOs have been using since 1990. We argue that this has given these groups within civil society a considerable agility in organizing and acting that may well create a lasting effect on relative power relations with other more traditional sectors of society.
This different path of Internet development is due to several converging factors. First, many activists across Latin America turned in the 1980s away from state-centered political work to grassroots organizing, often using alternative media (Fox l988). Second, a quite different relationship had developed between university and society in Latin America, which led professors and students to take technology into activism almost as soon as they discovered it themselves. Third, several NGOs, both global like the U.S.-based Association for Progressive Communications, and national like IBASE in Brazil or the Red Cientifica Peruana in Peru, built on universities and other early knowledge bases about the Internet to focus their operations on bringing the Internet as an organizing tool to a wide range of other NGOs and social movements. These NGOs trained people in how to use the Internet for networking and organizing, trained them in the technical use of the Internet, created and operated non-profit ISPs, and created models almost like non-profit franchises, for how to set up small cybercafes or telecenters.
Within these general approaches, there were an interesting variety of approaches, both early in the late 1980s-early 1990s and in the late 1990s to present. This paper concentrates on several cases within Brazil and on the Red Cientifica Peruana in Peru. The study finds that approaches have depended in large measure on the availability of telecommunications and ISP infrastructure. Those in turn depend on both government regulation of telecommunications and developments within private industry in telecommunications and Internet Service Provision.
Civil society in Peru had more open space to use Internet. Telecom use was more open to small businesses. RCP quasi franchise model could multiply freely. Even after privatization, Telefonica left the market open to small business rather than occupying it itself, so a space was created in which many small access centers, called cabinas publicas, flourished. Brazil had more directive policy. Brazilian telecommunication development was more directly driven by corporate and state interest. Both telecom and ISP market were quickly occupied by larger businesses. Bythe mid-1990s, however it became clear that Internet access needs by poorer people were not being met, so state and local governments, as well as NGOs have begun to create a number of telecenters."
2003-0529,No Collar: The Habitus of Professional Graphic Design Practice,Paper,No Collar: The Habitus of Professional Graphic Design Practice,"This paper draw on research conducted for a recently completed PhD dissertation that explores the realm of cultural production associated with graphic design, understood in this context as a ubiquitous, yet largely invisible, communicative practice that nevertheless contributes substantially to the make-up of our visual culture. In doing so it invokes the conceptual apparatus of Pierre Bourdieu, particularly the notions of 'habitus,' and the (middle) class fraction he labels the 'cultural intermediaries' (or ""no collar"" - as opposed to white collar). In this paper I focus on defining, elaborating and ultimately complicating the notion of habitus as it applies to the professional milieu of graphic design in North America. The alternative perspective thereby developed - and informed most tellingly by strands of feminist thought - allows for the comparative evaluation of various high profile graphic design interventions versus less celebrated, but rather more numerous, instances of graphic dissent."
2003-0530,No Future: Fruit Chan's Cinematic Vision of Post-Handover Hong Kong,Paper,No Future: Fruit Chan's Cinematic Vision of Post-Handover Hong Kong,"Hong Kong is very much a part of mainland China -- physically, geographically, culturally, politically, and economically. On the other hand, because of its role as a British colony for 150 years, Hong Kong is about as different from the rest of mainland China as it could possibly be.

Around the time of the so-called Handover at midnight on June 30, 1997, Hong Kongers went through a severe identity crisis. Did their loyalties -- and their cultural identities -- lie with the British, who provided Hong Kongers with all the rights and privileges associated with Western democracies? Or did they lie with the Chinese motherland, the last, great Communist totalitarian regime on earth?

Fruit Chan, an independent filmmaker in Hong Kong with a distinctive directorial style, dealt with the Hong Kong identity crisis in a series of films called The Handover Trilogy -- ""Made in Hong Kong"" (1997), ""The Longest Summer"" (1998), and ""Little Cheung"" (1999). This paper takes both a long view of the cultural identity of Hong Kongers and a close-up view based on the work of Fruit Chan, specifically The Handover Trilogy. It will attempt to show how cultural identities influence film portrayals of cultural identities, while the images in films reflect and reinforce these identities."

This essay discusses several issues related to Nigerias market liberalization goals by reviewing industry history, analyzing the reform decrees and key reform activities. In the end, it discusses what needs to be done in order to meet all the stated goals.
In 1992, Nigeria had issued a Decree to liberalize its telecommunications market that had long been under the control of government monopoly. To be sure, the Nigerian government, then under military dictatorship, had sought to hold firmly to government-control of telecommunications despite pressures, both internally and externally, for liberalization. It changed its policies only when it was compelled to believe that liberalization would be the key to the following: quickening telecommunications development, bringing in a massive infusion of cash to government coffers, and the beginning of the development of a telecommunications manufacturing base. There were several key liberalization strategies to achieving those goals including attracting technically capable market entrants, ensuring an enabling competitive and stable marketplace, and convincing investors about the markets profitability."
2003-0533,Object Formulation in the Operating Room: Pointing Out the Cystic Artery,Paper,Object Formulation in the Operating Room: Pointing Out the Cystic Artery,"We analyze interaction among doctors during a fairly routine surgical procedure: An experienced surgeon, a surgical resident, and a medical student gather around a patient to perform a cholecystectomy (i.e., the surgical removal of a gallbladder). Our purpose in taping and analyzing interaction in this setting was to explore how object formulation is accomplished through word and gesture. We describe the ways in which the determination of a particular structure, the cystic artery, was contingently and reflexively made by the surgical team. In attempting to provide a theoretical basis for our findings we draw upon the notion of inquiry developed by the pragmatic philosopher, John Dewey. We highlight two orders of inquiry relevant to the analyzed fragmentinquiry to resolve repeated acts of ostensive reference and joint inquiry to ultimately determine for the purposes of the surgery as the cystic artery. We argue that Deweys treatment of inquiry is helpful in understanding the socially-organized practices by which mundane objects are formulated in practical settings."
2003-0534,Objective Rejection?: Argument Quality Assessment and Involvement,Paper,Objective Rejection?: Argument Quality Assessment and Involvement,"Research investigating the role involvement and message strength in persuasion has demonstrated that the effectiveness of any message depends, in part, upon whether the individual is involved with the attitude object and whether the message is strong or weak (Petty & Cacciopo, 1986). Drawing from ELM research, social judgment theory research, and other persuasion literature, Johnson and Eagly (1989) conducted important meta-analyses of the effects of involvement on persuasion. In 1994, Johnson continued this research by integrating the work of Wood and her colleagues, (Wood, Kallgren, & Preisler, 1985; Wood, 1982) regarding the effects of knowledge on persuasion. Taken as a whole, research on knowledge, experience, and involvement has produced some crucial insights into what variables influence the relative strength of an argument or its ability to lead to persuasion.
Although consensus has not arisen, research utilizing the functional theory of persuasion has delineated various underlying functions, including the social adjustment, value-expressive, object appraisal or utilitarian or knowledge, the experiential, and the ego defensive functions (Katz, 1960; Smith, Bruner, & White, 1957; Snyder & DeBono, 1985; Herek, 1987; Shavitt, 1989; Maio & Olson, 2000; LaFrance & Boster, 2001; Lapinski & Boster, 2001, Hullett, 2002). More recent research on involvement has incorporated functional research in order to address differing types of involvement and the effects differing levels of involvement (Lavine & Snyder, 2000; Maio & Olson, 2000; Petty & Wegener, 1998; Liberman & Chaiken, 1996; Lavine & Snyder, 1996; Zuwerink & Devine, 1996; Maio & Olson, 1995; Johnson, 1994). Furthermore, argument strength and argument quality have been discussed and delineated in order to clarify whether the effectiveness of an argument in persuading is directly related to the individual assessment of the arguments inherent quality (Lavine & Snyder, 2000; 1996; Zuwerink & Devine, 1996; DeBono & Packer, 1991). It may be concluded that the attitude object and the individuals involvement with that attitude object influences the individuals assessment of argument quality, and subsequently affects persuasion.
This manuscript investigates whether argument quality assessment is affected by different types of involvement or attitude function (knowledge, experience, social adjustive, and value) and level of involvement or issue importance. Although a considerable amount of research suggests that type of involvement and that level of involvement effects attitude change (Lavine & Snyder, 2000; Petty & Wegener, 1998; Maio & Olson, 1995; Johnson & Eagly, 1989), the relationship of involvement type and level has not been systematically investigated in light of argument quality assessment. Given that argument quality assessment plays an important intermediate step between the message and persuasion (Hullett, 2002; Fazio, 2000; Lavine & Snyder, 2000; 1996; DeBono & Packer, 1991), a clear understanding of whether attitude function and involvement level effect the individuals assessment of argument quality would be valuable.
METHOD
Fifteen participants completed the pilot instrument. Twenty-seven attitude objects were pre-tested in order to find attitude objects that demonstrated a high degree of functional consensus (Herek, 2000) as well as a high standard deviation in overall agreement with the topic areas directional statement in order to be able to compare high and low agreement individuals. Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on seven-point Likert scales with statements matching their attitude with a function (i.e. this issue is informed by my values/morals) as well as their level of issue importance.
Based upon the criteria of functional consensus and variance in overall agreement, three attitude objects were chosen for each of the four functional categories, resulting in twelve total attitude objects. A separate group of 16 participants were asked to generate pro and counter attitudinal arguments that would be relevant to the functional consensus. For example, participants generated arguments for and against human cloning with the intent of making them relevant to a persons values. From the resulting list of arguments, a pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal argument was chosen that appeared to be relevant to the target function. At this point, a topic area was eliminated from each of the four categories due to the lack arguments generated that were functionally relevant. Human cloning and homosexual Boy Scout troop leaders were chosen as value relevant topic areas. DNA testing for death row inmates and payment of college athletes were chosen as the knowledge relevant topic areas. The experiential topic areas chosen were required group projects for university classes and a reduced drinking age to 18. Finally, the social function relevant topic areas were the educational benefits of international travel and free health care to elderly.
This project is currently in the data collections stage. We expect approximately 100 participants to complete the study instrument. Twenty participants have completed the instrument, and a complete analysis of all results will be available in the near future. Participants were given (and will be given) the same pilot test questionnaire regarding functional consensus and importance as in the pilot study to determine if the issues were perceived as functionally relevant, as well as to ensure that the manipulation was successful. Participants were asked to rate the quality of a pro-attitudinal and a counter-attitudinal argument about each topic area using a schematic differential scale measuring argument quality convincing/not convincing, logical/illogical, compelling/not compelling, and easy to argue against/hard to argue against (LaFrance & Boster, 2001).
DISCUSSION DIRECTIONS
Analysis of the 20 completed instruments indicates that the functional manipulation was probably successful, and that the argument quality assessment will probably be able to be analyzed as a composite. The goal of analysis will focus on two primary research questions; does the level of personal importance of a issue affect an individuals assessment of argument quality and does the perception that a topic is informed by a specific function affect an individuals assessment of argument quality. The examination of these questions will advance the study of persuasion, especially in the areas of objective argument quality assessment and functions and issue importance.

The following paper looks at the film Fire, a 1996 release by Indian born Canadian film maker, Deepa Mehta. Specifically, the paper discusses the controversy surrounding a review of Fire in Indias renowned womens magazine Manushi . It attempts to connect the various dialogues that arose on the South Asian Womens Network (SAWNET) in reaction to the review and looks at the identities that were constructed both in denouncement and defense of the film. An analysis of the reactions from the members of SAWNET, who are women in and outside of India, both lesbian and heterosexual, highlight the complexity of claiming authenticity as Indians, especially Indian women, outside of India and the struggle to balance pastoralized tradition with new world (post)modernity."

All 81 stories examined involve the case of Robert T. Morris, a 21-year-old graduate student from Cornell University who, in 1988, released one of the first computer viruses on the Internet. The study identifies four dominant metaphor categories -- biological, military, crime, and benign  and analyzes how these framed the Internet as a threat or a technology out of control. The study also examines how framing devices such as roots, consequences, and appeals to principle helped to minimize Morris culpability and may have eased the way for legal and regulatory control of the Internet."

Definitions various focus on project planning, implementation, evaluation, interpersonal communication, radio, participatory communication as a means to an end, participatory communication as an end in itself, and more. There is also debate over whether social marketing and entertainment-education can be employed in a participatory manner. Some say yes and others no. This paper reviews past and current approaches, and argues that Habermass theory of communicative action provides a useful approach to the definitional problem. It presents a scheme for differentiating among kinds of communication for social change using this theorys classification of ""action types,"" differentiating ""communicative"" from ""strategic"" action, as well as subtypes within these. And it argues that communication behavior, in terms of action types, should be fundamental in determining participation rather than a school of thought or program type."

However, the extent to which publics are maximizing their efforts through the Internet is unknown. This paper provides the groundwork for understanding users of environmental online action alerts. Results from the investigation attempt to bridge a gap by linking situational theory and constructs of empowerment to determine the relationship between online action alert users and public participation in activist groups. Organizations provide a means for individuals to send an enormous amount of e-mails to targeted officials through the Internet, but this passive behavior may not relate to one's dedication for the organization. Activist groups also benefit by learning to effectively design and communicate their messages to their intended audiences. This evaluation will further improve the relationship building process between organization and members."
2003-0539,"Online Privacy as Legal Safeguard: The Relationship Among Consumer, Online Portal, and Privacy Policies",Paper,"Online Privacy as Legal Safeguard: The Relationship Among Consumer, Online Portal, and Privacy Policies","The advent of information technologies has raised public concern regarding privacy, as documented by the results of several surveys. While several European Union member countries must follow strict and specific regulations that protect consumer privacy, the United States has followed a privacy policy of self-regulation; thus, individual companies themselves devise formulas for ensuring customer privacy online. As borders designed to protect the consumer, online privacy statements seldom provide explicit reassurance that consumer information will be kept confidential and will not be exploited. In this study, we focus on online privacy and investigate how consumer information is protected or exposed by online portal sites. Building on a previous content analysis, which found that privacy statements do not always protect customer interests as much as they serve as legal safeguards for the companies involved, we propose a textual analysis designed to supplement and strengthen our previous findings. We undertake this study because, whether or not consumers read these statements, they provide evidence of the internet industry's self protective efforts at the expense of consumer privacy of information.
Public discourse about the cultural impact of information technology often focuses on privacy concerns. The Pew Internet & American Life Project reveals that 701f Internet users call for new laws to protect consumer privacy online (Fox and Lewis, 2001). Advanced data mining technologies have led to the proliferation of consumer database and management enterprises. Personal data is now a tradable commodity in capitalist societies (Hamelink, 2000), placing free market principles and privacy protection at odds with one another. Since digitally stored data can have an indefinite life span, public concern over the ability to control our own information is evident in consumer reluctance to provide personal data to online businesses (Fox and Lewis, 2001; Elgesem, 1996).
Whether or not consumer anxiety about information gathering is warranted, the online industry has responded to public concern and consumer advocacy efforts with voluntarily posted privacy statements to alleviate those concerns. Although governed by suggested industry guidelines, these privacy statements seldom provide explicit reassurance that consumer information will be kept confidential and will not be exploited. Instead, they frequently outline how companies intend to use private customer information so that, in the event of consumer complaints, the companies are absolved of responsibility. Companies such as Microsoft Passport Services are known for exploiting consumer information, and were finally pressured into revising their privacy policies and statements following a series of articles originating from Salon.com. Both Yahoo's and Microsoft's Hotmail email services reportedly divulged customer information in opposition to their stated privacy policies not to share personally identifiable information (Gillis, 2002).
Online privacy statements are often placed inconveniently at the bottom of the page and are often tedious, complex, and replete with legal language the average web user finds difficult to comprehend. Kandra (2001) finds that many of the security statements of e-tailers sound reassuring, but offer very little protection to the individual consumer. Additionally, web users often find privacy policies difficult to trust (Reagle & Cranor, 1999). Building on this evidence, we examine privacy statements posted by online companies to determine whether they effectively protect personally identifiable and non-identifiable data. A discourse analysis of privacy statements could provide in-depth analysis of privacy statement content, and examine how portals use statements to guarantee personal information privacy and/or legally protect themselves. Because this is ultimately a policy question, a discourse analysis would allow the detailed examination of language, both legal and technical, contained within these statements to determine how a document designed to guarantee consumer privacy protection transforms into a company legal safeguard. Qualitative textual analysis techniques (following Fairclough, 1995; 2000 and van Dijk, 1997) seek a deep explanation of meaning through the observation and interpretation of patterns displayed in a mediated text (web portal privacy statements in this study). Textual discourse analysis lends an empirical grounding to the abstract observations about the social character of language and its cultural functions offered by social theory (Fairclough, 2000). A sample of web portals chosen from phase I of this study are analyzed.
This work examines discourse (as defined by Fairclough) as a text. Fairclough characterizes discourse analysis as an examination of texts or language in concordance with the thematic structure of the text and speech. This interpretation of textual characteristics considers speech practices and sociocultural practices embedded within the text. Thus, the aim of discourse analysis, according to Fairclough, is to clarify the ""systematic links between texts, discourse practices, and sociocultural practices"" (1995, p. 17). Similarly, van Djik's (1997) stated purpose of discourse analysis is to study texts ""not only as form, meaning and mental process, but also as complex structures and hierarchies of interaction and social practice and their functions in context, society and culture"" (p. 6). For the purposes of this research, discourse will encompass written language in the text of the privacy sections in the sample of web sites. The unit of analysis in this study is the relation between two themes within the online text: consumer protection and legal safeguards for the web company. It examines the legal and computer-oriented vocabulary, grammar and syntax, and organization of web sites to interpret the meaning of the use of privacy in terms of the data-sharing practices of the companies who own the sites. It examines assumptions about rights, concepts of privacy, and data mining. Specifically, this research asks: to what extent does the language in online privacy statements serve to protect and reassure the consumer while allowing the web company to sell and mine consumer information? Are abstruse legal and computer terms used to confuse the consumer in order to obscure the company's data sharing policies? What terminology do these sites use to maximize their own protection while reassuring the user? These statements will be analyzed in terms of policy considerations for the protection of personally identifiable consumer information.
Building on a previous content analysis conducted by the authors, we hope that this study will expose the vulnerability of the privacy statement as a method of privacy protection. Constant technological changes and the interlocked nature of new media ownership combined with the miniscule number of users who ever notice or even read these statements further challenge the effectiveness of this instrument and indicate that privacy protection should involve more direct and legislative measures. Focusing on the use of language will help understand the process through which private information is compromised under the guise of offering personalized and improved services. We hope that this research would lend support to the FTC's recommendation for a legislative solution to online privacy concerns rather than industry-driven privacy initiatives.

2003-0540,On Media Concentration and the Diversity Question,Paper,On Media Concentration and the Diversity Question,"The paper examines the literature on the concentration of ownership in American communications and the central question of media diversity. It is a think-piece that analyzes a good deal of the empirical studies on ownership, examines antitrust doctrine, and discusses a lot of the relevant court cases and FCC policy history. Among other things, the paper traces how a long-standing, but vague commitment to diversity on the part of the FCC (understood primarily as a diversity of viewpoints) got invigorated and reformulated by the civil rights movement in the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, diversity was understood as the ownership of media properties (particularly broadcast stations) by racial minorities and the FCC deployed minority preference policies to facilitate that outcome. But the change in equal protection jurisprudence that cast doubt on the constitutionality of minority preferences has also meant that diversity policy in broadcasting and media in general is now looked at with much suspicion by the appellate courts. This change in equal protection analysis (obviously abetted by the Reagan revolution), along with the growth in media and consequent claims regarding substitutability (abetted by the ideology of deregulation), underlay the recent moves to do away with most FCC media ownership restrictions. The paper takes issue with the metaphor of the marketplace of ideas and suggests that we replace it in favor of the metaphor of a mixed media system."

In this manuscript, I will relate a critical incident that has shaped my passion for investigating non-biomedical forms of healthcare. This passion led me to take a two-week ethnography course in Mexico City to examine the juxtaposition of science and spirituality in the Mexican context. This research was conducted during this class and illustrates how the separation of science and spirituality often precludes the experience of achieving both health and healing for chronically ill individuals. In addition, this manuscript represents a professional borderland, as I shed my quantitative background in my first attempt to conduct ethnographic research on health. This is the initial stage of a project intended to integrate both quantitative and qualitative perspectives on non-biomedical forms of health and healing in Mexico."

Third world and developing countries have earned a notorious reputation for being egregious violators of valuable intellectual property rights (IPR). This article discusses the concept of IPR, and the international mechanisms that protect them. It examines the unique characteristics of developing countries that contribute to their views on intellectual property rights, and evaluates the cultural and socio-economic forces that hinder enforcement. China is used as a case study to explore the scope of piracy and counterfeiting and the involvement of organized crime. Chinas legal and administrative structure, and how it relates to IPR, is outlined. The article suggests that an emphasis on strengthening the economic and legal infrastructure of developing countries is crucial to resolving the enforcement issue. It concludes that to succeed more scientists, engineers, and judges must be trained and educated to modern concepts of intellectual property rights."

It is argued that regardless of whether peoples perceptions of where they live are really shaped by media coverage, if people believe others are affected by this coverage, they are more likely to consider relocation. We investigated whether the perceived stigmatization of peripheral development towns in Israel has an impact on the desire of their residents to stay or leave, over and above the disaffection with actual living conditions in these communities. Using Structural Equation Modeling (N=472), results showed that believing that others are affected by the media indeed influences both perceptions and behavioral intentions."

Recreating a message board utility that they are familiar with, each subject in this study was asked to rate a constructed text message using the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI). This study used a two by two factorial design that manipulated the gender-oriented cues in the text message and the gender of the handle or nickname accompanying the message. The results showed different effects of masculine and feminine personality items of the BSRI in each of the four conditions."

This paper develops four alternative conceptual perspectives on the nature of reactance (i.e., combinations of cognition and affect), then provides an empirical test of each. Two parallel studies were conducted, one which advocated flossing (N = 196), the other of which urged students to limit their alcohol intake (N = 200). In both cases, a composite index of anger and negative cognitions fully mediated the effects of threat-to-freedom and trait reactance proneness on attitude and intention. The data showed that, in fact, reactance can be operationalized as a composite of self-report indices of anger and negative cognitions. The implications for persuasive health communication, in general, are considered as well the specific findings for flossing and drinking."
2003-0546,Opinion Climates and Deliberative Opinion Expression in the Electronic Forum,Paper,Opinion Climates and Deliberative Opinion Expression in the Electronic Forum,"This study seeks to tackle the problem of deliberation and equality especially in terms of majority and minority group dynamics. Discussing conformity and minority influence research in social psychology, this study proposes that anonymous communication ecology would facilitate the expression of minority opinions, and minority influence would be greater than conformity in an electronic forum. Instead of testing directly majority and minority influences in deliberation, this study focuses on how majority and minority opinion holders respond to different opinion climates both at the national and group levels. The analyses were conducted with two operationalized dependent measures of deliberative opinion expression (consistent expression of opinion, expression of reasoned opinions). The results render some support for the proposal with regard to opinion consistency, but not for reasonedness."
2003-0547,Opinion Leaders as Information Seekers: Communication Pathways to Civic Participation,Paper,Opinion Leaders as Information Seekers: Communication Pathways to Civic Participation,"In recent years, many scholars have bemoaned declining levels of social trust and civic engagement in our society, yet there is a group of citizens that does participate actively in civic life and that is strongly involved in the community  opinion leaders. Scheufele and Shah (2000) found that opinion leadership, or personality strength, is linked to civic engagement both directly and indirectly, mediated by various communication variables. However, they do not offer a complete theoretical account explaining the nature of these influences that relates them to the specific patterns of media use that foster participation. Accordingly, we explicate the construct of opinion leadership, outline it causes and consequences, and then examine hypothesized relationships using data from a large national survey conducted in 1998. We examine opinion leadership as an endogenous variable within a structural equation model. Our analyses show that opinion leadership is less a function of demographic variables than a number of psychological factors related to levels of self-esteem and confidence in ones own abilities. In addition, we find opinion leaders are strategic in their media use, with television hard news use prompting newspaper hard news use and subsequent on-line information search. Particularly important, the link between opinion leadership and media use is largely mediated by interest in politics, which triggers information seeking across all types of media. In turn, interest in politics, newspaper reading, and on-line searching are significant direct predictors of civic engagement. Implications for future research and practice are discussed."
2003-0548,"Oprah Winfrey, A White Woman Just Like Me;A Hegemonic View",Paper,"Oprah Winfrey, A White Woman Just Like Me;A Hegemonic View","Oprah Winfrey, through her sphere of media influence and continual media presence, constructs for her viewers an ideology of race. As unlikely as it may seem, Winfreys skin color and ethnic background are systematically effaced and she is presented as ""every woman neither black nor white. This pilot study is an attempt to analyze the dichotomy between the dominant culture that Winfreys television show, magazine, and web site seem to court and the readings of her as,  one of us , that several of the African American women that I interviewed echoed. The White middle class audience to whom she broadcasts has made a choice, bending to cultural and social pressures. They report seeing Winfrey as just like me. There is evidence that Winfrey has helped them to negotiate that reading. An examination of the artifacts that Winfrey produces represents a very hegemonic view of race in the United States."

Consistent with the model, adoption was positively related to staff members' attitudes toward computing in general, self-reported familiarity and experiences with the system, and adherence to organizational norms that stressed the importance of accountability."
2003-0550,Organizational Communication Relationships as Predictors of Psychological Job Outcomes of Customer Service Providers,Paper,Organizational Communication Relationships as Predictors of Psychological Job Outcomes of Customer Service Providers,"Organizational communication scholars have demonstrated the significance of communication relationships with supervisors, coworkers, and top management as predictors of employees psychological job outcomes. However, communication relationships with customers have been altogether ignored. This exploratory study examined the relative contributions of different organizational communication relationships, including communication relationships with customers, in predicting the job satisfaction, organizational commitment, burnout, and turnover intentions of service providers. Survey data were collected from 281 service providers recruited at a university and four restaurants. The analyses revealed the important roles of all communication relationships in predicting psychological job outcomes. Service providers who experienced more positive communication relationships with their supervisors, coworkers, and customers tended to be more satisfied with their job, more committed to their organization, and less burned out. Only their communication relationships with customers predicted their turnover intentions."
2003-0551,Organizational Culture Approaching the Edge: A Case Study of Organizational Change,Paper,Organizational Culture Approaching the Edge: A Case Study of Organizational Change,"This report begins by describing different orders of change and how complex adaptive systems evolve. Systems may reach a bifurcation point where the entire system must change. Managers have developed strategic initiatives to accomplish transformative change, but these initiatives normally fail unless there is a culture change. The purpose of our research was to describe one organizations culture as it approached a bifurcation point.

We employed qualitative methods to assess the culture of a large government agency experiencing turbulence. The themes in our data suggested that individuals were relying on identities in local units rather than the organization as a whole. Organizational members were experiencing uncertainty, had lost trust, but contained anxiety with humor."
2003-0552,Organizational Discourse and New Media: A Practice Perspective,Paper,Organizational Discourse and New Media: A Practice Perspective,"In this paper we assess scholarship about new media and organizational discourse from a practice perspective. While this scholarship in the last twenty years has yielded valuable contributions, we argue that its current innovative capacity lies behind that of both technology production and use. More precisely, we identify three issues which we believe a) are relatively under-developed in the current state of the literature, b) have become particularly problematic in the light of contemporary organizational and technological innovations, and c) may benefit from a practice perspective. These issues revolve around a relatively narrow characterization of context, an atomized view of communication processes, and a compartmentalization of technology?s discursive potentials. Based on an analysis of these limitations, we outline a programmatic statement suggesting how a more practice-oriented understanding of the recursive interaction between people, new media, and organizational discourse contributes to overcoming these shortcomings. We contend that by focusing on the everyday activities of situated actors, a practice orientation can provide insights into the dynamic, emergent, and enacted nature of organizational discourse as it unfolds through a complex array of new and evolving media."

(i.e., temporary vs. regular employee, superior-subordinate gender-dyad combinations), supervisors initial tactics of influence, subordinate communication satisfaction and quality of leader-member exchange. Results from 148 (71 temporary) new hires indicated (a) employee characteristics were not significantly related to LMX, (b) supervisors initial use of prosocial influence tactics were significantly and positively related to quality of LMX, and subordinates satisfaction with communication was significantly and positively related to quality of leader-member exchange."
2003-0554,Organizational Orientations Theory and Measurement: Developoment of Measures and Preliminary Investigations,Paper,Organizational Orientations Theory and Measurement: Developoment of Measures and Preliminary Investigations,"Four studies are reported which focus on organizaitonal orientations theory and relevant measuring instruments. An initial study designed to develop measures of the three components believed to constitute organizational orientation (upward mobile, indifferent, and ambivalent) are reported. Results of a follow-up study designed to improve those measures indicate the three measures developled are reliable instruments. A study designed to determine the association of organizational orientations with communication apprehension, immediach, assertiveness, responsiveness and job satisfaction is reported and discussed. Results point to both the reliability and validity of the new measures. Another study designed to determine the association of orientations with temperament, ob satisfaction, and subordinates' perceptions of the credibility of their supervisors also is reported. Results suggest that organizational orientations are associated with the ""BIG THREE"" temperament variables and are predictive of both job satisfaction and perceptions of supervisor credibility. Suggestions for future research and the limitations of the research program at this point are discussed."
2003-0555,Organizations as Discursive Constructions: Unpacking the Metaphor,Paper,Organizations as Discursive Constructions: Unpacking the Metaphor,"In this paper we examine the relationship between discourse and organization. It is a relationship of growing interest in organizational studies as organizations are increasingly framed as discursive constructions. However, such framing appears subject to at least three orientations. First, an organization may be cast as an already formed object with discourse central to the features and outcomes of organizing. Second, organizations may be seen in a perpetual state of becoming through the ways that the properties of discourse shape organizing. Finally, organizations and discourse may be cast as a duality that is mutually constituted. Moreover, each of these three orientations provides a different cast to the terms discourse and Discourses. We use these interpretations and different notions about discourse to explore the research traditions on language and social interaction. We contend that all three orientations are necessary and should operate simultaneously to reveal a complex view of the organizational-discourse relationship, one that is discerning of the strengths and shortcomings of discourse as a metaphor of organizations."
2003-0556,Orientations and Motivations Behind the Use of Tabloids,Paper,Orientations and Motivations Behind the Use of Tabloids,"Employing the uses and gratifications approach and data collected for the 1998 DDB Life Style Study survey, this research looks to understand peoples motivations for using tabloids. Structural equation modeling showed that all hypotheses were supported. Thus, we found two primary predictors for tabloid use  trend-consciousness and sexual traditionalism. People who are interested in whats hot in popular culture look for information about these topics in the media. Also, individuals with traditional attitudes about same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception are negatively related to tabloid use, because their views are not reinforced there. These predictors associate with tabloid use indirectly through the consumption of news and entertainment media. Therefore, people are using tabloids as part of their overall media consumption, for both diversionary purposes and as a means to seek information. These findings have significant implications for mass communication research."

This paper argues that anti-gay violence is rooted in the perception of same-sex eroticism as an egregious violation of masculine gender norms. Different strands of research and theory are cited in support of this argument: after a discussion of the essentialist/
constructionist debate, the focus turns to sociological work on the construction of homosexuality, on the legitimation of violence, and on the connection between masculine gender norms and homophobia. The paper then considers the role of (mis)interpretation of biblical scripture as a basis for anti-gay ideology, and concludes with a review of a psychological study of the motivations of incarcerated anti-gay assailants which supports the paper's thesis."
2003-0558,Our long 'return to the concept of powerful mass media' - a cross-nationally comparative investigation,Paper,Our long 'return to the concept of powerful mass media' - a cross-nationally comparative investigation,"Consonant media coverage, i.e., a very similar presentation and evaluation of issues in all media of a particular country, is usually considered to bring about powerful media effects. Though plausible, this notion has hardly been put to test. Similarly, we know little about media effects on attitudes towards European integration. This study pulls these two research strands together. It is investigated whether consonant coverage affects attitudes towards European integration by linking, at the individual level, content analytic measures to survey data in 13 European countries. If the media in a particular country evaluated EU representatives similarly (i.e., consonantly), then these evaluations positively affected people's attitudes towards further European integration. This effect was boosted by the visibility of EU representatives. Conversely, if the media in a particular country evaluated EU representatives dissonantly, then no effect of the coverage emerged. Cognitive selection mechanisms did not protect EU citizens from the influence of consonant media coverage, which indicates powerful media effects. The findings suggest that media effects should not be omitted when dealing with attitudes towards European integration. Moreover, the results imply that media effects research may, under certain circumstances, benefit from the 'concept of powerful mass media'."

The present study tested the notion that people would react more positively when speakers used I messages to express negative emotions as compared to You messages. We also tested the effect of I vs. You messages when the speaker expressed positive emotions. Our results failed to support the significance of attributing negative emotions to oneself rather than the recipient: no differences were found between these two conditions in recipients perception of the effectiveness, positive politeness, or negative politeness of the messages, nor in respondents positive and negative emotional reactions. However, respondents found messages attributed to them by the speaker (e.g., You messages) to be more positively polite and more effective, and reacted with more positive and less negative emotions. These results suggest that any expression of negative emotions is viewed negatively by recipients, but they appreciate getting credit for speakers positive emotions."
2003-0560,Parallel Discourses: Media Constructions of Anorexia and Obesity in the Cases of Tracey Gold and Carnie Wilson,Paper,Parallel Discourses: Media Constructions of Anorexia and Obesity in the Cases of Tracey Gold and Carnie Wilson,"Mass media images of gender, beauty and women have been at the heart of many feminist arguments about the need for change in our understanding of gender and the role it plays in our day to day existence. The role of a body, much like the role of a woman, is also negotiated between the pages and airways of our popular culture that precariously favors particular excessive behaviors and norms. A textual analysis of the popular press discourse surrounding two bodies demonstrates specific rhetorical strategies at work in the construction of the ""appropriate"" cultural body. This paper explores how these two bodies are positioned at the border of cultural intelligibility and how these bodies, acting as discourse themselves, speak to culture and reify their positions on the margins."
2003-0561,Parent-Child Co-viewing of Television and Cognitive,Paper,Parent-Child Co-viewing of Television and Cognitive,"This study tested the relationship between parent-child co-viewing of television and the cognitive development of the child. Both survey and experiment methods were employed to find out the participants television viewing habits and their cognitive achievements after watching a pre-recorded programme under different conditions. The participants comprised five-year-old preschoolers from a childcare centre in Beijing, China. The findings indicated a positive relationship between parent-child co-viewing of television and the cognitive performance of the child as far as a specific programme was concerned but long-term effects of parent-child co-viewing on the general cognitive development of the child could not be established due to the limitations of the study."

The responses suggest that while US parents adopted a coherent framework of threat-and-promise when relating to the Internet, their Israeli counterparts drew on several discourses to construct a more conditional and reserved commitment. These results paradoxically both challenge concerns over academic imperialism, as expressed in the practice of survey translation, and highlight the need for a more localized work that will provide insight into such cross-cultural variation."
2003-0563,"Parties, Candidates, and Policy Issues in the 2000 Presidential Election: Being primed or muted by media and interpersonal discussion",Paper,"Parties, Candidates, and Policy Issues in the 2000 Presidential Election: Being primed or muted by media and interpersonal discussion","Scholars of voting behavior have considered party identification, issues, and candidate images as key determinants of the vote. Although the traditional model of voting behavior points to the importance of the psychological factors at an individual level, it fails to explain whether and how the importance of the vote determinants varies depending on other factors during the course of an election campaign. Drawing on priming theory, this paper attempts to test how television news use and interpersonal discussion on politics moderate individuals¡¯ voting behavior. Based on previous discussion about television news¡¯ emphasis on candidates¡¯ character and political homogeneity in interpersonal discussion, it was hypothesized that television news use will promote candidate image-based voting, and interpersonal political discussion will encourage party-based voting. Results largely support these hypotheses. In the 2000 election, candidate character (i.e., competence and personal quality) and party identification were primed by television and interpersonal discussion respectively whereas policy issues have been muted by television news. Implications for voting behavior and priming theory will be discussed."
2003-0564,Patterns in the American News Coverage of the September 11 Attacks and Their Consequences,Paper,Patterns in the American News Coverage of the September 11 Attacks and Their Consequences,"This study combines content analysis and survey data to investigate how the media coverage of the September 11 attacks is related to citizens ability to explain what happened. To what extent did the coverage provide information about explanations for the attacks? And would exposure to media content produce more complex answers to survey questions about why they occurred?
We employ a content analysis of U.S. News & World Report following the attacks and data from a panel survey of adult Americans. The media offered few explanations, and survey respondents could not provide many. Individual factors like education explain the ability of individuals to form complex views of the world, but attention to news and the volume of coverage a person is exposed to also play a role. If news organizations do not produce content that informs citizens about the underlying causes of events, they do not serve citizens well."
2003-0565,Patterns of New Media Adoption in a World of Hybrid Media,Paper,Patterns of New Media Adoption in a World of Hybrid Media,"The motives to adopt new media, as exemplified by Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), were assessed in a uses and gratifications survey. To define motives of new media use, a preliminary qualitative study was administered. Diffusion research and the theory of play were considered to explain motives for adopting new media. Survey results suggest three gratification dimensions: playful exploration, status and function-related motives. Consumer innovativeness was taken into account as a personal predisposition toward new media use. Although the predictive power of gratifications was weak, the motive to play, first introduced by this study, was a highly ranked gratification. The results related to this dimension provide new insights into media adoption."

The theoretical position that human information processing involves a limited capacity system has been used to demonstrate that listening performance is retarded by increasing levels of cognitive load. Similarly, it is argued that increases in cognitive backlog during listening will lead to altered levels of anxiety during a listening task. As predicted, anxiety levels are observed to grow during listening performance. This pattern contrasts markedly with patterns observed for public speaking. In addition, decreases in affect for the listening task are observed, along with an unusual pattern of correlations between anxiety and listening performance."

Factors related to a raters perceived level of anonymity adequacy are examined as well as the types of identity information concealed by raters during performance evaluations. Significant, positive relationships were found between anonymity adequacy and both the quality of supervisor performance and the relationship between the rater and his/her supervisor. Additionally, the names of other organizational members were the most frequent type of identity information omitted by raters during performance evaluations. In general, this study enriches previous research that examines anonymity in performance feedback by exploring the raters experience of anonymity when evaluating supervisors and coworkers."

This study used a quasi-experimental survey design (N = 485) to examine the relationship between three within-subject factors type of disease (AIDS vs. cancer), sexual orientation (homosexual vs. heterosexual), target person sex (male vs. female) and one between-subject factor, respondent sex (male vs. female). Outgroup homogeneity effects were examined on four dimensions: appearance, interests, occupation, and personality. Sexual orientation (heterosexual), topic of the disease (cancer), respondent sex (female) and target person sex (female) emerged as stronger predictors of outgroup homogeneity effects. That is, female respondents perceived more homogeneity in female target persons, heterosexuals and people with cancer. In addition, interaction effects were found for respondent sex and target person sexual orientation such that female respondents perceived heterosexuals as being more similar on all four dimensions of outgroup homogeneity effect. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."

Respondents perception of sexual portrayals in the Chinese media seemed to indicate a pattern converging to that in the western media. While the majority of the students are aware of their sexual needs and wants, half of them actively engage in sexual monitoring. However, media consumption as a variable failed to predict sexual awareness. Respondents attitudes towards pornography generally followed the negative tone of the official campaign against such material. But more than half of the respondents recognized that such media do have positive values, indicating some degree of change in ideology formation."

Seven themes were isolated in the United States: understanding, compatibility, displaying positive behavior, smoothness of communication, positive outcomes, positive nonverbal behavior, and adapting messages. Nine themes were isolated in Japan: compatibility, appropriateness, relations between communicators, positive outcomes, smoothness of communication, displaying positive behavior, understanding, positive nonverbal behavior, and clarity. None of the themes in either culture are relationship or gender specific. The labels for several themes are similar, but the content is different. Perceptions of effective communication are outcome-based and individual-focused in the United States, and process-based and relationship-focused in Japan."

It denies the existence of racial problems by consciously or unconsciously, deliberately or non-deliberately downplaying, ignoring or simplifying the problems. It is evidenced from the claims of color-blindness and reverse discrimination, the belief in model minorities, and exaggerated/negative/purposeful racial displays permeating American culture.
In-depth interviews with fourteen Asian American professionals from various metropolitan areas. After carefully examining the data collected from the interviews, thirty-four recurring themes were identified. Diverse viewpoints on minority invisibility, model minority, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with mainstream American culture, and co-cultural ethnic relations are discussed in this study. They offer some suggestions for establishing a co-cultural coalition. Limitations and future research directions are indicated in the final chapter."
2003-0572,Personal and professional dimensions of news work: Exploring the link between journalists' values and roles,Paper,Personal and professional dimensions of news work: Exploring the link between journalists' values and roles,"Scholars studying news work have long focused on either journalistic roles or journalistic values, rather than trying to integrate the two as a way to better understand internal forces that drive reporters and editors. While media research is filled with references to journalistic values, there have been virtually no efforts to bring social psychology research on values to bear as a way to understand how journalists operate. This study examines those underlying values and looks at how values are reflected in the professional roles endorsed by editors and reporters. The link is not always clear, but this study shows there are some significant differences between the values held by editors versus reporters and that these values can shape whether a journalist sees his or her role to be simply to report the news, to help provide context for it, to assume a watchdog role, or to provide a public forum."

The findings revealed no associations between the personality factors and television exposure or preferences. Extraversion was associated positively with in-home movie viewing and with listening to hip-hop, jazz/classical and to pop/rock music. Neuroticism was associated positively with rock music listening. Psychoticism was associated negatively with watching ""light"" movie genres."

Abstract

This article examines the status of public relations and media relations in Croatia. It examines public relations tactics through media richness theory (Daft & Lengel, 1984, 1986) The findings suggest that the Croatian model of public relations is a mix of traditional media relations and personal influence. Croatian public relations is characterized by a heavy reliance on personal invitations, telephone contacts, and other interpersonal methods for conducting and evaluating public relations. This preference for richer media tactics has implications for public relations development in Croatia."
2003-0575,Personification: Crossover between Metaphor and Fictional Character in Computer Mediated Communication,Paper,Personification: Crossover between Metaphor and Fictional Character in Computer Mediated Communication,"This contribution defines the psychological processing of the artistic, cultural, and communication aspects of agents in information interfaces and characters in media entertainment (i.e. video games) as a new research topic in communication studies and computer science. It offers a theory of what personifications such as (intelligent) adaptive navigation assistants for Web environments can achieve, cognitively and emotionally: Personifications can be user-friendly, be motivating, and suggest ideas but only if their behavior is task-relevant. The personification should not only be more-or-less pertinent to the interface goals or story line but also be adaptive to changes in tasks, personal and business goals, and work processes as these change over time. This paper offers a multiple-meanings theory of metaphoric communication (i.e. personifications) and a general communication model for human-agent interactions. Although a theoretical exploration, it offers methods for empirical verification, blending technical tools from EEG-measurement labs, reaction-time recordings, and structured questionnaires."

Hypotheses and research questions were generated based on an integrated theoretical model of message processing and outcome. Formative research was conducted to investigate the construct of message cognition value and to evaluate anti-marijuana messages designed to vary on sensation and cognition value. In the experiment, 338 18-20 year old college students viewed 4 anti-marijuana public service announcements 4 times each over a 4-week period in a laboratory setting. They completed measures of sensation seeking (NFS), need for cognition (NFC), cognitive processing, attitudes toward marijuana use, behavioral intention to use marijuana and self-reported marijuana use. Results are consistent with previous research showing effects for message sensation value (MSV) on attitude, behavioral intention and behavior. Additionally, a significant main effect for message cognition value (MCV) indicates that high cognition value messages led to greater cued recall than low cognition value messages. This effect was particularly evident among high need for cognition individuals. Message cognition value did not have a main effect on attitude, behavioral intention or behavior. Need for cognition moderated the effect of message cognition value on attitude, but not behavioral intention or behavior. Interaction effects involving NFC/MCV and NFS/MSV were not found. Implications of results for future research and theory development are discussed."

More specifically, we analyzed patients and providers open-ended responses regarding the content and utility of the PALS brochure. The PALS brochure was designed to encourage a partnership between patients and their providers and implemented at a midsize Midwestern University medical clinic. Respondents included the 99 patients and five physicians who completed the open-ended portion assessing the PALS pilot intervention. Patients and physicians perspectives on the PALS brochure content and utility are discussed. As shown in this study, patients who already have proven methods that work for them in communicating with their physician may not perceive the PALS brochure or other intervention tools as beneficial. However, those patients who like and need tools to assist in improving the quality of the health care visit perceived the PALS brochure as highly beneficial."

An international comparison of television news.,"One important function of mass media in democratic societies can be described in terms of ""providing information about events and conditions in society and the world"" (McQuail 1983: 79). Thus, in spite of the fact that media systems over the world differ in many aspects, the tv format ""news"" is prevalent in almost all countries, making it suitable for international comparisons. The proposed presentation (1) reviews earlier comparative work on the political content of mass media, focussing particularly on the concept of news geography; and (2) presents the results of an international television news study that considers features of presentation and content.
The analysis elaborates on political and other content of television news following four research questions:
1. Are the four dimensions of news geopraphy still valid at the end of the Nineties, and do they hold true for countries other than Germany and the U.S.?
2. To what degree and for which types of issues can we observe a domestication of issues?
3. How does the news geography relate to issues and persons in media coverage?
4. Do common topics in the coverage in different countries exist that may indicate a topical integration across different nations?
For the empirical study, prime time news shows of 18 TV stations in eight European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Italy) and the USA were taped for seven consecutive days in winter 1998/1999. Fieldwork was done by multilingual coding teams at the University of Munich, Germany. The results give some insight into the specific news selection processes - with an identical historical situation forming the background of coverage."

This study examines how text and animated graphics impact the processing of television news stories for adults ages 28-80. As in a previous study using college students, animated graphics elicited the most attention while redundant text graphics elicited the least. Yet, as in the previous study, redundant text graphics elicited higher skin conductance levels than either the animated graphics or no graphics conditions. As in the previous study, the graphics enhanced recognition for harder stories more so than for easier stories. Delayed cued recall in both studies was best for stories with animated graphics and worst for stories with no graphics. The graphic conditions did not affect free recall of information in the previous study. But for these older participants both redundant and animated graphics aided free recall for stories that participants rated as being harder to understand, and animated graphics also aided free recall for easier stories."

Analysis is based on visual subordination, point of view, social distance, imaginary contact, behavior and general portrayal. Findings suggest despite signs of visual subordination and framing stereotypes, women under the post-Taliban regime are portrayed as more involved, interactive, more socially intimate and symbolically equal to the viewer.

2003-0581,Pink Collar Workers in the Digital Age: Technology and Gender in Academic Libraries,Paper,Pink Collar Workers in the Digital Age: Technology and Gender in Academic Libraries,"Since the first implementation of technology in academic libraries, the computer has affected all phases of library operation. College and university libraries are undergoing profound and undoubtedly permanent changes. Research reveals that technological change has a different impact on women workers than it has on men; it shapes the way in which work is conducted and by whom. What, then, are the implications for academic libraries, where the workforce is predominately female? This paper attempts to address this question. We begin with a history of technology and libraries to provide a context for the reader. Next, we review the literature in two areas: 1) gender and technology in the workplace, and 2). gender in libraries. Evidence for the relationship of shifting gender roles due to the introduction of technology in academic libraries is supported by three studies. First, examination of data provided by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics suggests that the gender composition of libraries is changing. Second, the results of a pilot study on technology and gender in academic libraries supports the hypothesis that men are increasingly occupying technology-based positions which include higher salaries and access to administration which improves their status and empowers them to make or influence decisions. Finally, the results of a survey in one academic library suggest that although male and female librarians and library workers are equally likely to have to use technology extensively in their positions, men are less likely than women to recognize as women as technology experts."

The study examined attitudes to the televised portrayal of gender in an animation for children. Young adults viewed a 35 minute video excerpt and then evaluated the depiction of either the lead male or lead female character. Male participants agreed with conventional sex role stereotypes more than female participants and found the male superhero to be a positive role model for children. Though neither males nor females believed the female lead character was a good role model, this effect was significantly stronger for females. Androgynous participants liked both characters significantly more than participants who measured high in masculinity and femininity. A significant relationship was observed between conventional sex stereotypes and the extent to which participants recognized sex stereotyping in character depiction. In addition, males indicated greater approval for allowing both their daughters and their sons to watch this program. The effects of academic major and race on stereotyping are also analyzed."
2003-0583,Play model of chat communication,Paper,Play model of chat communication,"A play model of communication processes in chat rooms is proposed that goes beyond motivational explanations of chat use and completes them. Using Goffman's frame analysis, the model explains why the anonymous and not binding nature of chat communication does not lead to a total disrespect of social conventions. Fundamental elements of conventional games (Linder / Roos/ Victor 2001; Sutton-Smith 1997) are applied to chat communication and substantiated in an empirical study combining observational and think-aloud procedures. The chat play deals with identity: The players in the chat room aim at revealing the identity of their fellow players and at the same time, at managing their own identity. The term ""identity"" is confined to key aspects of the physical appearance like age, gender, status and attractiveness. In face-to-face-situations, these attributes provide first impressions on a person - in chat rooms, however, conversations have to make do without these basic personal cues. Thus chatters try to solve the riddle of the other chatters' identities, and, in turn, ask them riddles about their own. However, the mere knowledge of the others' identities is not gratifying: What really produces pleasure is an inventive and creative use of language and a knowledgeable way of composing threads. ""Expert chatters"" excel in their strategic communication skills: Their active, speedy and inventive style in chatting makes them attractive conversational partners. Those who do not master these strategies, or disrespect fundamental social conventions are ignored and barred from play and its pleasure."

Clarity and Miscommunication in Pilot-ATC Interaction,"Communication plays an integral part in the operation of the aviation system. Few aviation activities can be executed without human interaction. This research is an examination of on aspect of aviation communication: pilot-air traffic controller (ATC) interaction. Two issues are examined in this study. The first issue is the role of politeness in pilot-ATC communication. The second issue is the effect of miscommunication. Polite communication and miscommunication have a theoretical link proposed by Brown and Levinson (1978) in their discussion of politeness theory. Being polite reduces clarity. Reduced clarity can result in miscommunication. The connection between politeness, clarity, and miscommunication is examined here."

During this process, the government, foreigners, chaebol, and labor workers played key roles. The full privatization of KT is the result of their political, social, and economic demands."
2003-0587,Political Correlates of Local Media Use,Paper,Political Correlates of Local Media Use,"Despite the crucial role that local news media play in studies of community and community integration, research on local media effects often is overshadowed by a concern with the effects of national media (Friedland & McLeod, 1999). This study examines the political correlates of attention to local news, focusing on evaluations of journalists and news media, political knowledge, and political participation. Analyses of survey data collected from a probability sample in XXXXXX, XX (N = 456) indicate nuanced relationships between attention to local news and evaluations of journalists and news media. Attention to news on television and in newspapers enhanced perceptions of knowledge, but it was only attention to newspaper local news that promoted political participation. Of particular note is the fact that both positive and negative evaluations led to participation, suggesting that unfavorable views of the press can invigorate democracy."

Although women were encouraged to work in the 1970s and 1980s, womens status was marginalized then and is still so in 2002. Since the end of the Cold War and, especially, the birth of second civilian government, Korean womens status has been gradually changing. Democratization of the state made the rise of popular feminism possible. The study explores how cultural and political changes intersect. Popular culture, as a barometer of peoples sentiment expressed at a given time, resonates with the changes. As an example of popular feminism that captured womens repressed wishes of reform of patriarchal society, a Korean television show Viva Women and its bulletin board messages are studied. While not inherently political, the messages express the repressed wish that has political implications and can help initiate collective activities that resist dominant consensus on womanhood."

2003-0591,Power Play: The Politics of Orgasm in Cyberspace,Paper,Power Play: The Politics of Orgasm in Cyberspace,"This paper argues that the ways in which female orgasm is enacted and represented in media has significant social, cultural and political effects. The experience of orgasm and the representation of orgasm in the mass media are closely related to hierarchies of power and politics. The importance of play in enacting and practicing ways of being powerful is related to the current increase in digital gameplay In cyberspace the link between orgasm, power and play becomes more evident and perhaps more malleable.The possibilities of cyberspace and gameworlds in particular as arenas where women can represent themselves and play in ways that are empowering are discussed. Examples are presented documenting games which perpetuate androcentric representations of female sexuality as well as examples of games which might be interesting to females and which create different models for sex and gender representation in digital environments."
2003-0592,Predicting Tolerance of Journalistic Deception,Paper,Predicting Tolerance of Journalistic Deception,"Deception is a phenomenon that occurs habitually in human interaction and yet is the root of many ethical conundrums in journalism. This study is an empirical examination of Elliot and Culvers definition of journalistic deception that departs from the focus on undercover work, hidden cameras and impersonation. In a Web-based survey with 740 journalists, competition and medium emerge as the two most salient predictors of deception tolerance. Journalists who view competition to be an important consideration in ethical decision-making are more tolerant of deception. Television journalists have a higher tolerance of deception than print journalists. The salience of competition and medium demonstrates how ethical decision-making is a function of occupational pressures as journalists negotiate the tensions between morality and professional demands. A regression analysis reveals that the newsroom environment, rather than individual-level variables, is the most important force shaping journalists assessment of deception."

It first compares various types of presence-related terms (e.g., telepresence, virtual presence, mediated presence, co-presence, and presence) and suggests that the term, presence, works best for the systematic study of human interaction with media and simulation technologies. After extensive explication processes, presence is newly defined as the psychological state in which the virtuality of experience is unnoticed. Three types of presencephysical, social, and self presenceare categorized based on corresponding domains of human experience. Conceptual definition of each type of presence is made following the general definition of presence. Finally, implications of the current explication to the study of presence are discussed."
2003-0594,Presence the equalizer: Reducing the third-person perception,Paper,Presence the equalizer: Reducing the third-person perception,"Third-person perception is the notion that media affects others more than oneself, whereas first-person perception is the opposite; the belief that oneself is more affected by media than others. Meta-analyses have revealed that a robust third-person perception exists, thus researchers have turned their interests to examining the conditions under which third- and first-person perceptions occur. This study examines the role of presence (i.e. perceiving the television experience as more intense and real) in moderating the third-person perception, specifically investigating the reversal of a third-person perception to first-person perception. Because presence has been described as a psychological state that can be induced given the right media conditions, and with minimal cues, then experiencing increased presence may be a situation in which television viewers describe themselves as being more affected. As such, presence should diminish the third person perception. A random phone survey of 402 adults confirmed a third-person perception of televisions estimated impact on thinking and feeling. However, as predicted, an increased sense of presence diminished the third person perception, apparently allowing viewers to admit to the effect of television"

Because this kind of targeted campaigning is encouraged by the Electoral College, with its winner-take-all rules, the data show that the Electoral College has a demonstrably negative effect on representative democracy."

Shortly after their seize of power the new political leaders began to edit such instructions. After looking to the organization of this process it is shown how the number of instructions grew over the years. In the core of the paper the types and forms of instructions are analysed.

Additionally the paper includes an eye to the system of press instructions that was introduced later under the communist government in the German Democratic Republic. There have been obvious similarities.
2003-0597,Presumed Influence: How Mass Media Indirectly Affect Adolescent Smoking,Paper,Presumed Influence: How Mass Media Indirectly Affect Adolescent Smoking,"While tobacco-related media content, both pro- and anti-smoking content, is widely believed to have a significant direct influence on adolescent decisions about smoking, the processes that may underlie this influence are neither well documented nor well understood. Particularly notable is the absence of evidence that anti-smoking campaigns achieve their intended effect. However, what does have a significant and well-documented effect on smoking adoption are adolescent perceptions of peer norms.
This study examined the role of peer norms and mass media in a test of the presumed influence hypothesis, a theoretical model suggesting that smoking-related media content may have a significant indirect influence on adolescent smoking via its effect on perceived peer norms. That is, adolescents may assume that smoking-related content in mass media will influence the attitudes and behaviors of their peers (even if not their own). These peer perceptions in turn can influence adolescents' own smoking behaviors.
Results of a pilot study of 129 middle-school students showed no direct effect of either pro- or anti-smoking promotions. But pro-smoking messages had a significant indirect influence through their perceived effect on peers. Most interestingly, anti-smoking campaigns were associated with perceptions of increased pro-smoking attitudes and behaviors among peers, thus compounding, rather than counteracting, the substantial influence of peer norms on smoking adoption."

My interest is not just in individual autobiography, but the parallel development of a social history of the transgender movement. To this end, this work represents a five-year ethnographic inquiry in transgender communities. Utilizing field notes, interviews with transgendered people, and video recordings of television shows, I attempt to contextualize these narrativizations."
2003-0599,Priming and Stereotyping: How Mediated Images Affect Perceptions in Interpersonal Contexts,Paper,Priming and Stereotyping: How Mediated Images Affect Perceptions in Interpersonal Contexts,"Priming and Stereotyping:
How Mediated Images Affect Perceptions in Interpersonal Contexts
Media represents an important mechanism for members of different social, cultural and ethnic groups to learn about each other. Storylines about social groups enable viewers to develop knowledge structures about these social groups which include information about their personality traits (e.g., aggressive), behaviors (e.g., talks loud ), and social status (e.g., uneducated). This particular function of media is often described as the reinforcement of social stereotypes (Fujioka, 1999; Wilson & Gutierrez, 1996). The present research examines how stereotypical portrayals of African American women in media significantly influence perceptions of African American women in interpersonal contexts.
The activation-recency hypothesis proposed by Hansen and Hansen (1988) suggests that individuals who are primed with media content are more likely to use the content for subsequent information processing than those not primed. Ford (1997) used the activation-recency hypothesis to test whether stereotypic portrayals of African Americans increase the likelihood that European Americans will make negative social judgments of an African American target person. Stereotypic and neutral comedy skits involving African American characters were used as priming stimuli. Participants viewed the skits and afterward were instructed to read a vignette describing a legal case in which a student was accused of physical assault. Ford found that the priming resulted in greater attributions of guilt for the perceived African American offender than the European American offender. Hansen and Hansen argue that participants transfer knowledge that is obtained via the media to other contexts because the distorted appraisal of a subsequent stimulus induced by activation is unlikely to be consciously corrected (p. 290). In other words, we are not likely to watch a situation comedy above African-Americans and consciously correct the impressions we form of African-Americans from that television show.
Previous research has failed to explore within group differences in stereotyping and instead comparisons have focused on between group racial differences. For example, most of the comparisons in the stereotyping literature are between blacks and whites (see e.g., Dijksteruis & van Knippenberg, 1998; Dovidio, Kawakami, Johnson, Johnson & Howard, 1997; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton & Williams, 1995; Spencer, Fein, Wolfe, Fong & Dunn, 1998). In this paper, we examine for both between group differences (e.g., black vs white) and also within group differences (e.g., different African-American female stereotypes). We hypothesize that mediated images of African American women activate a specific African American female schema and make it salient for subsequent information processing.
A considerable amount of research on social schemas suggests that the mental models we hold of others contain very complicated knowledge structures (Brewer, 2000). Collins (1991) argues that African American women have historically been portrayed by mediated institutions (e.g., television) as nurturing-asexual mammies, domineering matriarchs, sexually aggressive jezebels, and lazy welfare mothers. Collins, along with other cultural critics, contends that the salience of these popular forms negatively contribute to the ways African American women are perceived and the conditions under which they are accepted in society (Bogle, 2001, Dines & Humez, 1995; Gray, 1991; 1995; Omi & Winant ,1986; Wilson & Gutierrez, 1996). Thus, we expect that participants primed with a specific African American female stereotype will evaluate another African American woman as more consistent with that stereotype. For example, participants primed with a mammy stereotype should rate another African American woman as more nurturing compared to those primed with a jezebel stereotype.
H1a: Exposure to stereotypic portrayals of an African American woman will result in stereotype consistent judgments of another African American woman.
H1b: Response times will be faster to stereotype consistent adjectives than to stereotype inconsistent adjectives after viewing a mediated image of an African American woman.
While our first hypotheses focus on within group stereotype differences, a considerable body of knowledge suggests that media portrayals of African Americans are often automatically perceived as hostile, dangerous, lazy, and stupid (Dijksteruis & van Knippenberg, 1998; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton & Williams, 1995; Wittenbrink, Judd & Park, 1997). This literature suggests that regardless of the specific stereotype primed, the mere presence of an African American triggers a negative affective response. Devine (1989), for example, argues that we are all aware of the social perceptions of African Americans as generally bad in the sense that the social category Black/African American connotes negativity. Greenwald and Banaji (1995), on the other hand, argue that these subtle associations not only reflect knowledge of the stereotypes but a belief in them as well. Gaertner and Dovidios (1986) Aversive Racism framework supports this view by suggesting that associating African Americans with negativity illustrates a latent form of racism, which can enable an individual with an egalitarian self-image to behave in prejudicial yet rationalizable ways. They argue that these types of association are a reflection of personal beliefs, even in cases where indicators of more overt forms of racism are absent. Whether African Americans are associated with negative words quicker than are European Americans because of an underlying automatic categorization (Devines perspective) or because such associations imply aversive racism (Gaertner & Dovidio), we expect to replicate these findings in the present research:
H2a: Response times will be faster to negative words and slower to positive words when evaluating an African American woman.
H2b: Response times will be faster to positive words and slower to negative words when evaluating a European American woman.
Reaction times to negative words when evaluating an African American woman may be even faster when the individual sees two consecutive African American images. In the present study, individuals first view a film clip that portrays an African American woman in some stereotyped role or they view a control clip which does not portray an African American. In part two, they watch and evaluate either a European American or African American female in a job interview setting. Being primed with a televised image of an African American female in addition to viewing an African American interviewee may result in an additive effect whereby participants will make negative judgments fastest when they viewed both an African American female on the film clip and are evaluating an African American interviewee:
H3: Exposure to both a media portrayal of an African American woman and an African American woman interviewee will result in faster responses to negative judgments of the interviewee than will viewing the African American interviewee without the media portrayal.
Methods
A 4 (stereotype image: welfare mother, mammy, jezebel or no prime condition) x 2 (race of interviewee: African American or European American) between-subjects experimental design with both factors completely crossed is utilized. 260 undergraduate students between the ages of 18-29 from introductory speech communication courses will participate.
Independent Variables
Stereotype image. Participants in the stereotype image conditions view a two-minute videotaped segment of a movie where an African American actress played the role of welfare mother (taken from The Women of Brewster Place), mammy (taken from To Dance with a White Dog), or jezebel (taken from Introducing Dorothy Dandridge). In the control condition, participants view a time equivalent segment of a movie about the life of a European American male in high school (taken from Better off Dead). The three priming clips were extensively pilot tested to ensure participants viewed the clip as highly representative of the stereotype.
Race of interviewee. After viewing the priming tape, participants will observe one of two 3-minute interview tape involving a male interviewer and female interviewee in an employment interview scenario. The interviews are similar on all dimensions except for the race of the female interviewees (African American or European American). The male interviewer, who remains off camera, conducts both interview scenarios. The interview script was adapted from a set of job interview scripts (Wilson & Goodall, 1991).
Dependent Variables
Positive, negative and stereotypic adjective associations. Fifty adjective words representing words associated with positive and negative African American stereotypes, welfare mother, mammy and jezebel stereotypes are used for the response time measures. The items for the positive and negative stereotypes were adapted from previous research examining response times to African American stereotypes (Bargh et al., 1995; Devine, 1989; Dovidio et al., 1997, Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). Words related to the welfare mother, mammy and jezebel stereotypes were taken from descriptions of the stereotypes (Bogle, 2001; Collins, 1991; Jones, 2000). Participants will assess whether a term fits the person they observed on the interview tape. The speed at which participants associated the woman they observed on the interview tape with each adjective will be timed in milliseconds (Dijksterhuis & van Knippenberg, 1999; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Wittenbrink, Judd & Park, 1997).
Job suitability items. Participants respond to 40 items indicating how suitable the African American or European American female is for the position of sales representative that she was purportedly interviewing for using 1-7 Likert scales where 1 stands for strongly agree and 7 stands for strongly disagree.
Procedures
Participants will be told they are participating in two unrelated mini-studies as neither study alone takes enough time to fulfill the research requirement. For the media prime manipulation (mini-study 1), participants will be told that we are currently trying to develop a visual aide library for instructors to utilize in the basic courses and we need their help in selecting appropriate clips for different constructs. After viewing the priming clip and answering questions about it, participants will then be moved to a different room. Participants will be told that the second study is about interviewing techniques. They will watch an interviewee and then critique the persons performance. After viewing the interview tape, participants then complete the adjective association response time task using Micro-Experimental Lab (MEL). The adjectives will be counterbalanced such that participants view them in order 1 or order 2. Participants will respond to the adjectives by hitting a YES or NO key. The YES and NO keys will be counterbalanced to reduce any effects due to the dominant hand always associated with one key (e.g., yes always being the right hand key). Finally, participants will complete the job suitability items and then be debriefed and dismissed. Data collection for this project began in October.

These hypotheses were tested by way of a six-condition, between-participants experiment wherein female college students (N = 114) were randomly assigned to either a control condition (in which participants were not exposed to any version of the test) or one of five treatment conditions featuring the same basic purity test with concentrations of items pertaining to different sexual activities. Following this, a paper-and-pencil questionnaire elicited participants' perceptions of the prevalence of specific sexual activities among their peers. Results indicated that when interacting with variables such as prior sexual experience and views about premarital sex, purity test-taking does affect perceptions of specific sexual activity prevalence among peers. However, the relationships between purity test-taking and perceptions of sexual activity prevalence among peers did not consistently go in the hypothesized direction. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

This investigation compared established explanations for the way inoculation confers resistance and an alternative explanation based on priming. A total of 308 participants took part in the study in three phases spanning 80 days. The pattern of results indicated that inoculation treatments trigger threat; that elicited threat directly enhances Phase 2 attitude which directly fosters resistance. The results also indicated that inoculation treatments elicit anger and reduce the number of positive responses to the attack message, which, in time, directly enhance resistance to the influence of persuasive attacks. In addition, results showed that issue involvement enhances counterarguing output which, in turn, directly fosters resistance. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that inoculation treatments trigger threat; however, elicited threat neither directly nor indirectly enhances resistance. This unexpected finding may be attributed to one of the topics selected, which failed to generate a high enough threat level as was generated in previous studies. Finally, structural equation modeling didn't reveal any path between inoculation and resistance, suggesting that anger, responses to the attack message, and counterarguing output may have accounted for most of the variance in participants' resistance to the influence of persuasive attacks. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."

Over 50 years of fear appeal research still leaves us uncertain as to the conditions under which fear may effectively lead to adaptive attitude and behavior change. Theoretical emphasis has been placed on the relative weighting of threat and efficacy perceptions to understand adaptive versus maladaptive action (e.g., Rogers, 1975, Witte, 1992). While these perceptions are clearly important for the evocation of fear and potential responses, no fear appeal model based solely on these concepts is particularly well-supported by empirical research (Boster & Mongeau, 1984; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Mongeau, 1998; Witte, 1994). Although recent research has examined the effects of fear arousal on information processing, specifying the conditions that would lead to more or less careful message processing (Baron, Inman, Kao, & Logan, 1992; Baron, Logan, Lilly, Inman, & Brennan, 1994; Gleicher & Petty, 1992; Hale, LeMieux, & Mongeau, 1995; Jepson & Chaiken, 1990), prior knowledge, a variable that might impact perceptions of threat and efficacy, processing depth and style, and attitudes has yet to be considered in a fear appeal context.
Extant research has shown prior knowledge to impact persuasive outcome by promoting more systematic processing (Wood & Kallgren, 1988; Wood, Kallgren, & Preisler, 1985), stronger resistance to attitude change (Wood, 1982), and greater attitude-behavior consistency (Kallgren & Wood, 1986). Applying what is known about prior knowledge to fear appeal processes, two key effects are likely. First, topic-relevant knowledge should impact intensity of emotional arousal because the degree of uncertainty both in terms of threat and efficacy is constrained. Empirically this position is supported by Hoffner¡¦s (1997) research on children¡¦s fright reactions in which prior knowledge of the positive outcome of a film scene reduced facial expressions of fear as well as self-reported fear for those with a blunting coping style. Thus,
H1: Prior knowledge will be negatively associated with fear arousal.
As to message processing, Biek, Wood, and Chaiken (1996) found negative affect to interact with knowledgeability such that highly-aroused, knowledgeable people engaged in more biased processing of new information on AIDS risk scenarios compared to other groups. This study, however, did not consider a) fear apart from other emotions, or b) how potentially familiar arguments are processed. It is likely that a message repeating generally familiar information (e.g., the dangers of smoking or not wearing sunscreen), particularly information intended to induce a negative affective state, would encourage reactance among more knowledgable subjects, and thus lower message acceptance. However, for those who are less knowledgable, potentially threatening information might be both more arousing and more accepted. Thus,
H2: For less knowledgable subjects, high fear messages will be more persuasive than low fear messages. For more knowledgable subjects, low fear messages will be more persuasive.
Of note, subjective, rather than accurate, knowledge is the construct of interest because, as Wood et al. (1995) note, perceptions and attitudes, themselves subjective, are more influenced by information that is subjectively meaningful.
Method
The study involved a 2 (Perceived Prior Knowledge: high vs. low) x 3 (Fear: high vs. low vs. control) x 2 (Message: testicular vs. breast cancer) between subjects design. Two hundred and sixty-three undergraduates, 55 0.000000emale and 45Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide characterale, participated. Women received messages and survey items specific to breast cancer whereas men received messages and questions specific to testicular cancer.
Respondents first completed a survey measuring general cancer anxiety (six items Ñ = .78), specific cancer anxiety (six items Ñ = .83), perceived cancer-specific knowledge (2 items, r = .74), and trait anxiety (20 items Ñ = .90). After an intermediate task, respondents read one of three messages (efficacy-only, low fear, high fear) about either breast or testicular cancer. The survey then measured message-evoked fear (6 items Ñ = .93), message processing depth (14 items Ñ = .92), defensive (7 items Ñ = .92) and adaptive reactions (4 items Ñ = .76), perceived severity and susceptibility, response efficacy (3 items Ñ = .67), and self-efficacy (4 items Ñ = .70). Attitude toward self-exams was assessed with 19, 7-point semantic differentials (range ¡V3 to 3; Ñ = .92). Behavioral intentions to perform self-exams were assessed with seven 7-point Likert items (range ¡V3 to 3; Ñ = .87). Demographics, including age, sex, ethnicity, year in school, past-self exam behavior, and family history of breast cancer (for women) or testicular cancer (for men) were assessed. For ANOVA analyses, knowledge was dichotomized based on median split.
Results
Manipulation Check: Fear Arousal
An ANOVA with fear arousal as the dependent measure indicated a main effect for message type, F(2, 255) = 13.51, p < .001, Ø2 = .10, a main effect for sex, F(1, 255) = 6.90, p < .01, Ø2 = .04, and a sex by message type interaction, F(2, 255) = 3.95, p < .05, Ø2 = .03. Specifically, the high fear group reported experiencing more fear than the low fear and efficacy-only groups (p < .001). Men experienced more fear than women (p < .05). Finally, the interaction indicated that men and women experienced comparable fear levels in response to the efficacy-only message, but men experienced more fear in response to the low and high fear messages than women. These data support a successful fear manipulation.
H1: Prior Knowledge and Fear Evocation
Controlling for age, sex, family history of cancer, and past self-exam behavior, correlational analyses indicated a small significant, negative correlation between perceived knowledge level and fear arousal (r = -.12, p = .05, n = 250). This result supports H1.
H2: Prior Knowledge, Fear, and Persuasive Effect
A Message Type x Sex x Knowledge ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect for sex on attitudes toward self-exams, F(1, 245) = 7.94, p < .01, Ø2 = .03, indicating women had more favorable attitudes toward breast self-exams than men do toward testicular self-exams. As predicted, a significant interaction between knowledge level and message type, F(2, 245) = 3.41, p < .05, Ø2 = .03, indicated that there was essentially no difference in self-exam attitude across messages for those low in knowledge. However, the high knowledge groups had more favorable attitudes toward self-exams after receiving the efficacy-only, rather than the low or high fear messages. Importantly, a three-way interaction, F(2, 245) = 4.20, p < .05, Ø2 = .03, suggested that the 2-way interaction was primarily a function of differences for men, but not women.
The 2-way and 3-way interaction did not appear when considering processing depth and self-exam intentions. However, a Knowledge x Message x Sex interaction was evidenced for defensive processing, F(2, 247) = 3.01, p = .05, Ø2 = .024, indicating that high knowledge men felt least manipulated by the efficacy-only message and most manipulated by the low and high fear messages whereas the low knowledgeable men found the high fear message to be the least manipulative. Of note, men found their messages more exaggerated than women did, F(1, 247) = 9.32, p < .01, Ø2 = .04.
These results suggest that perceived knowledge level might not only minimize emotional reactions to fear appeals, but it may also impact perceptions of a message as overblown and exaggerated, and thus moderate its persuasive impact. Differences between the effects found for men and women, the absence of an effect for self-exam intentions, and the impact of knowledge on other variables measured will be addressed.

In previous studies, they have been used interchangeably to indicate the existence of the displacement effect of a new medium on the older forms of media. This paper suggests that such undifferentiated use of the two variables can be problematic, in that media use is an objective measurement while media reliance, perceptual. Using the data from a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2000, this study compares the differences between media use and reliance in three aspects: demographic characteristics, knowledge, and individual interests. Findings of our study suggest that interests in different content areas as well as demographic variables including age, education, and income have different effects on media use and reliance. Moreover, media use and reliance have different effects on knowledge about current affairs."
2003-0604,"Processing Radio PSAs: Production Pacing, Arousing Content, and Age",Paper,"Processing Radio PSAs: Production Pacing, Arousing Content, and Age","Processing Radio PSAs: Production Pacing, Arousing Content, and Age


This study will examine how radio public service announcements (PSAs) are processed by college-age and tween (9-to-12 year old) listeners. Specifically, it will look at the effects of production pacing, arousing content, and age on listeners= physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses to substance abuse PSAs aired on the radio. The study builds on previous research with college-age and adolescent viewers on the effects of production pacing and arousing content on the processing of televised substance abuse PSAs. Thus, this study asks whether production pacing and arousing content in radio PSAs have the same effects on listeners that they do in televised PSAs. Secondly, it asks whether radio PSAs have the same effects on tweens that they do on college-age viewers.
The study uses the limited capacity model of mediated message processing (Lang, 2000), which considers message processing to be the result of the interaction between the messages form and content and the message receivers goals and interests. Both the form and content of a message can elicit automatic allocation of processing resources, while message receivers can control the allocation of resources by deciding how relevant, interesting, or familiar the message is. Because people are limited capacity processors, whenever the automatic and/or controlled demands for processing resources exceed the capacity of the message receiver, the system is overloaded and some aspect of processing is performed less well.
Limited capacity theory predicts that both faster pacing and arousing content will automatically elicit both self-reported feelings of arousal and physiological arousal. Previous research has supported these predictions (Hitchon, Thorson, & Duckler, 1994; Lang, Dhillon, & Dong, 1995; Lang, Newhagen, & Reeves, 1996; Lang, Bolls, Potter, & Kawahara, 1999; Lang, Schwartz, & Snyder, 1999). Thus, in this study it is predicted that:
H1: As production pacing increases, both self-reported and physiological arousal will increase.
H2: Arousing content will elicit greater self-reported and physiological arousal in listeners than calm content.
In general, both voluntary and involuntary allocation of attention to an external stimulus leads to slower heart rates as the body is quieted in an effort to focus attention (Cacioppo & Tassinary, 1990). Research on television has shown slower heart rates during arousing television messages than during calm television messages (Lang et al., 1995; Lang et al., 1996; Thorson & Lang, 1992). We predict the same will be true with arousing and calm radio messages.
H3: Listeners will have slower heart rates during arousing messages than they will during calm messages.
Previous research has also shown that increasing production pacing increases attentional effort as long as the processing system is not significantly overloaded. Thus when fast production pacing does not push viewers beyond overload, fast-paced messages appear to receive more attention than slow- and medium-paced messages. Once the system reaches the point of overload and viewers can no longer keep up with the message, however, they appear to expend less effort  the result being that they pay less attention to fast-paced messages than to slow- and medium-paced messages. In this study, it is expected that fast-paced messages will result in significant cognitive overload. Therefore:
H4: Heart rate should be relatively faster during fast-paced messages than during slow- and medium-paced messages.
Previous research examining the effects of production pacing and arousing content on processing have suggested that there are no messages about risky products and substances that are not arousing (Lang, Lee, Chung, & Zhao, 2001). Thus, it is likely that both calm and arousing radio PSAs will push subjects into overload. However, cognitive overload will occur sooner (at a lower level of pacing) for arousing messages than for calm messages. Generally, overload is first seen as a decrease in recognition memory resulting from overload of the encoding process. Thus:
H5: There will be an interaction between Production Pacing and Arousing Content such that as pacing increases, recognition memory will increase to a point and then decrease, and this decrease in recognition will be greater for arousing messages than for calm messages.
Finally, in experiment one, subjects will be college-age students, and in experiment two the same stimuli will be used with tweens. This will allow us to find out if tweens show the same physiological, cognitive, and emotional responses to production pacing and arousing content as college-age students. This leads to the following research question:
RQ 1: Are there differences between tween and college-age populations on any of the dependent variables in this experiment?
To test these hypotheses and answer the research question, participants will listen to 24 radio PSAs that vary in terms of production pacing and arousing content.
Study Design
The design of the experiment is a mixed Arousing Content (2) X Production Pacing (3) X Message (4) X Order of Presentation (4) design. Arousing Content, Production Pacing, and Message are within-subjects factors, and Order of Presentation is a between-subjects factor. Two levels of arousing content (calm and arousing) and three levels of pacing (slow, medium, and fast) are fully crossed resulting in six categories (calm-slow, calm-medium, calm-fast, arousing-slow, arousing-medium, and arousing-fast). There are four messages for each category, resulting in a total of 24 messages. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the four counterbalanced orders.
Stimulus Materials
Pacing. Three levels of pacing (slow, medium, and fast) were identified for this study. Pacing was operationalized as the number of structural onsets (i.e. voice changes, change from voice to a sound effect) in the message (Potter, 2000). Slow messages have 0  3 structural onsets, medium messages have 8  14 structural onsets, and fast messages have 21 -38 structural onsets. An ANOVA confirmed the manipulation was significant.
Arousing content. Arousing content has two levels (calm and arousing). To categorize messages as calm or arousing, all of the PSAs being considered for inclusion in the study were pre-tested in two sessions with two different tape orders. The messages were shown to undergraduate students in communications courses who rated their emotional responses using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM), a pictorial scale used to assess emotional response along the three dimensions of valance, arousal, and dominance (Lang & Greenwald, 1985). From these ratings, five arousing messages and five calm messages within each production-pacing level were chosen for inclusion in the study.
Dependent Variables
Arousal. Listener arousal will be measured in two ways. Self-reported arousal will be measured using SAM. For this study only the valence and arousal dimensions will be measured. Physiological arousal will be assessed by measuring subjects= skin conductance responses.
Attentional Effort. Controlled attention will be measured using heart rate.
Encoding. Recognition will be used to assess encoding and will be measured using a forced-choice, four-alternative, multiple choice test. There will be four questions per message.
Process
Ninety undergraduate students enrolled in communication courses at a large Mid-western university are participating in experiment one October - December of 2002. Ninety tweens from schools in a Mid-western town will participate in experiment two in January - March of 2003.
Each subject will complete the experiment protocol individually. After giving informed consent (experiment one) or parental consent and informed assent (experiment two), subjects will be seated in a comfortable chair and sensors for measuring heart rate and skin conductance will be attached to the forearms and non-dominant hand. Subjects will then listen to the 24 national broadcast quality radio PSAs. When each PSA ends, subjects will rate how they felt while listening to the PSA using the SAM scale. Heart rate and skin conductance data will be collected while subjects listen to the announcements. After listening to all 24 PSAs, the sensors will be removed and subjects will complete a distractor task. After completing the distractor task, subjects will move to an adjoining room where they will be seated at a computer to complete the recognition test. They will also complete a sensation seeking questionnaire and respond to questions about their use or likely use (for tweens) of tobacco, alcohol, and/or marijuana.
Results from this study will add to knowledge about the effects of production pacing and arousing content in radio messages. It will also increase understanding of how tweens process media. This will help media producers be more effective in designing and creating radio PSAs that elicit attention, convey knowledge, alter attitudes, and perhaps change tweens= intentions to perform risky behaviors.

It explores, through textual analysis, ""community"" sections on retail-oriented web sites as a manifestation of the notion that interactivity can encourage communal interaction among consumers and promulgate good will for the retailer. Building on Habermas's theories on commodification of fundamental social institutions, this work posits that these retail communities use the rhetoric of community to entice new consumers and fulfill business goals; they are commodified versions of community which exist solely to sell. This work also uses Foucault's theories on technology as devices of social control to examine the possibility that these communities are used as surveillance mechanisms for the purposes of data mining. Discussion 1- examines how users are sold the idea of community through interactivity while data about them are mined for commercial profit, and 2- problematizes the collection of consumer information."

Questions explored career-related beliefs and practices, feelings about academic career progress, issues encountered while in the academy, and strategies used to manage these issues. Qualitative analysis of recurring themes as well as self-narratives of participants suggests that women associate professors are an overlooked or forgotten group. Evidence refutes the common wisdom in the academy that, if more women are hired at the junior levels, growth in the number of senior women faculty will happen with time. Women in the study expressed a sense of resignation and felt demoralized based on their experiences as assistant and associate professors in the academy.

This study was limited to the web pages altered by computer hackers from Israel, Arab, China, and the U.S. The current study content analyzed 418 defaced web sites in order to describe how they were changed. Particularly, this study focused more on what web tools were used, what emotional content was chosen, and what propaganda techniques were applied to disseminate hackers¡¯ messages in more effective ways.
The findings suggest that politically motivated hackers preferred graphic, text, and e-mail to spread their messages. They frequently used visual content (gruesome photos, national flags, and logos) and verbal content (profane languages, verbal insults, slogans, and statistics) against opponents. The most popular propaganda technique used by politically motivated hacker groups was name-calling. The usage of web tools, emotional content, and propaganda techniques was different among pro-Israel, pro-Arab, pro-China and pro-U.S. hacker groups."

Based on historical data from 1476-1776, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that combines political economy and cultural studies to uncover the forces driving the development of press freedom. It argues that the production of rights occurs in the realm of social relations, which have cultural, economic and political dimensions. The creation of rights is often precipitated by mass movements that are animated by an ideology, as was the role of liberalism in the transition from feudal absolutism. Once rights have been erected, they become the basis in turn for animating the struggles of other groups from whom those rights are excluded."

As a consequence, they have also altered the exchange relations between originators and receivers to the point of allowing other mediatized interrelation modalities which are interactive, of dialogue, in real time and personalized. Without a doubt, these modifications request a review of the concepts of information and communication that have been in use in the Sciences of Communication.
In Latin America, this new reality of significant production, spreads and sets within and by a cultural and economic context, that under clear and irregular regional developments, has developed a neoliberal way of thinking that claims the potentiality of the market, the free gain, the competition, and in a smaller measure, democracy, as the dominant value of Latin American society."

An in-depth examination on the connection between third-person perception and support for media censorship,"This study investigates the third-person perception and both preventive and punitive explanations for support for media censorship in a variety of communication context. The preventive explanation views support for censorship as a preventive action to protect others from threatening media effects; the punitive explanation argues that individuals' favorable attitudes toward media censorship reflect their intention to penalize the media for the harm they have done to the subject of the communication. The emphasis placed on which explanation shifts by context, which reflects the complexity of censorship attitudes. This paper also tests the role of self-esteem in third-person perception, although no support was found."

Participants were exposed to one of eight ratios including: 1) a high ratio of Black to White criminals, 2) a high ratio of White to Black criminals, 3) a medium ratio of Black to White criminals, 4) a medium ratio of White to Black criminals, 5) a race-unspecified condition, 6) a fluff (no-crime) condition, 7) a single Black suspect condition, and 8) a single White suspect condition. In addition, participants provided self-reports of their news viewing. Results revealed that heavy television news viewers were more punitive than light viewers toward a race-unspecified suspect when exposed to heavy ratios of Black to White criminals or when exposed to a fluff condition. In addition, heavy news viewers were more likely than light news viewers to endorse African-American stereotypes when exposed to the fluff condition. The methodological and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in light of priming and cognitive accessibility theory."

In its first part, the paper reviews traditional and current models or theories of journalists news decisions, concentrating on news factors, institutional objectives, the manipulative power of public relations by news sources, and subjective beliefs of journalists. It comes to the conclusion that most of these approaches lack deeper explanations of the underlying processes leading to news judgments. Starting from these shortcomings and from the assumption that most of journalists work is about perceptions, conclusions, and judgments it then attempts to apply psychological theories to news decision-making. The author holds that two general needs or functions involving specific psychological processes can explain news decisions: a need for social validation of perceptions and the need to preserve ones existing predispositions. Empirical data from several surveys among journalists is used to demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach to journalists behavior."

The author argues that the rising survey industry in China, which has infiltrated by both the state and the market, is actually swallowing the public. The survey practices in the 1980s can be characterized as state-sponsored. Most of the opinion polls were engineered by the Party-state to justify their reform policies by referring to public opinion and to mobilize the public consent for further reforms. The concept of public was thus formed only in terms of state-related. Moreover, since most of the surveys during this period were limited to the sample of the urban intellectuals, the public opinion represented by the polling became elitist in essence, which sacrificed the principle of universal and equal access for the general public. Since the 1990s, survey research has become a booming industry in Chinas market economy. However, the public represented in the surveys are still partial and incomplete. The development of the market economy in the 1990s led to the formation of a specific stratum of the urban middle-class, which now occupies a central position within the public. Most rural Chinese are excluded from the public opinion since the marketing research does not reach those rural regions. Surveys are still heavily regulated by the government and the Party draws resources from the market to conduct polls for its public control. With the increasing incorporation of the state and the market, Habermas vision of public sphere has yet to exist in China."
2003-0616,"Public Perceptions of Media Portrayals of Values: Individuals, Generations, Ethnic Groups",Paper,"Public Perceptions of Media Portrayals of Values: Individuals, Generations, Ethnic Groups","America's pluralistic society is growing increasingly diverse as groups compete for media representation. Bombarded by a sea of images, many people fail to see their images reflected in the media. Although this is often articulated in terms of minority groups, the issue can be generalized to multiple sources of identity and meaning in people's lives. People see themselves as individuals but also as men or women, members of generations, of ethnic groups, of organizations and various other social roles through which people enact their goals and values. This paper focuses on people's perceptions of how they are portrayed in the media as well as the issue of media influence on the values portrayed. A survey in a major Midwest metro area measured perceived importance of values and their portrayal in the media, finding TV viewing correlated with perceived media representativeness of oneself as an individual and TV news viewing associated with perception of one's ethnic group. Perceived importance of values also is correlated with perceptions of their portrayal. Several dimensions of values recognized in the media are linked to people's perceptions that the media portray people like them, their generation, and their ethnic group. Regression analyses controlling for social categories in predicting people's perceptions that the media portray people like them, their generation and their ethnic group shows that actual media use is relatively unimportant, while dimensions of values assessed for importance and the patterns of values recognized in the media are significant predictors."
2003-0617,Public Relations and Propaganda in Cyberspace: A Quantitative Content Analysis of Middle Eastern Government Websites,Paper,Public Relations and Propaganda in Cyberspace: A Quantitative Content Analysis of Middle Eastern Government Websites,"This study is a quantitative content analysis of the 10 official English-language, Middle East government and presidential websites to determine how these sites relate to public relations practices and traditional propaganda theory. Most propaganda theory research has dichotomized propaganda through the use of nominal labels such as good propaganda and bad propaganda. This study obviates this notion by considering propaganda as related to, and distantly part of, public relations practices and international government relations.
The coding instrument measures the prevalence and use of propaganda on these sites and measures accepted best practices of websites, most prominently dialogic function, which indicates the interactivity and openness of a website. Through this frame, a model is developed that places propaganda on a continuum that includes public relations practices. A framework is also developed for viewing Middle Eastern websites within a context that considers political and civic freedom and cultural associations of propaganda and public relations."
2003-0618,Public Relations Professionalism and Education,Paper,Public Relations Professionalism and Education,"This study attempted to evaluate the extent to which undergraduate college education prepares students to become professionals. The study surveyed 155 public relations educators and practitioners to determine their impressions on factors such as whether students are being imparted the knowledge and experience that is necessary for them to become public relations practitioners, the knowledge and skills respondents thought were critical for students to become successful professionals, the skills they felt new graduates needed to have, and what they considered to be the characteristics or criteria of the public relations profession. Results revealed that the first step appears to have been accomplished with agreement among public relations educators and practitioners about the importance of subjects that should be taught to college public relations students, and more importantly, the knowledge, skills and courses recommended by the Commission for Public Relations Education. While not all respondents agreed about the best career plan for future public relations professionals, a majority of respondents felt that majoring in public relations was the best thing for students who want to work in public relations. Because not all of the subjects that were perceived to be important by the respondents were also taught as much as they should be, it appears that some subjects need to be taught more. On every subject except new technology, the percentage of practitioners who felt that graduates were well-prepared was considerably lower than the percentage of educators who felt that graduates were well-prepared to enter the public relations profession."

This paper reports on an interdisciplinary attempt to improve both public understanding of science and experts understanding of public communication processes. More specifically, engineering, life science and communication students collaborated on a public communication campaign to improve the environmental sustainability of university activities. Given the recent convergence of communication theory, pedagogical theory and science communication on more experiential and interaction-based models, an action-based scientific report was generated to form the basis of the campaign. Communication theory students interacted with life sciences and engineering students to practically test theory, facilitate public understanding and implement change in accord with the reports recommendations."
2003-0620,"Pushing the Ethic, Aesthetic, and Epistemic Borders in Meeting Mediated People",Paper,"Pushing the Ethic, Aesthetic, and Epistemic Borders in Meeting Mediated People","A new theory explains how the shifts in ethic, aesthetic, and epistemic appraisals affect the engagement of mediated persons by conceptualizing this process as perceiving and experiencing fictional characters (PEFiC). Anchored in interpersonal communication, emotion psychology, and art studies, PEFiC predicts that variation in ethics, aesthetics, and epistemics in the encoding phase leads to variation in involvement, distance, and appreciation in the response phase. Similarity, relevance, valence, and subjective norm mediate these effects in the comparison phase. Identification and empathy are seen as two instances of various parallel involvement and distance conflicts. A 2*2*2 between-subjects experiment indicated that the PEFiC-model best fitted the data with unipolarity of factors. The PEFiC-model outperformed traditional theories in explaining, for example, that bad characters were judged highly dissimilar to oneself, evoked more distance than involvement, and yet aroused positive appreciation. Furthermore, the effects of mediated bad persons differed strongly from ethically good ones."
2003-0621,'Put the Cheetos Down': Camouflaging the Institutionality of an Interaction,Paper,'Put the Cheetos Down': Camouflaging the Institutionality of an Interaction,"This essay examines conversational exchanges that occurred at the beginning of top-management meetings at a nutritional corporation. We show, in and through analysis, that these moments of interaction, which we label pre-meeting talk, are multifunctional and serve a range of institutional goals. An important purpose of this paper is to make visible that pre-meeting talk includes features that are simultaneously ordinary conversation and institutional talk (Drew & Heritage, 1992). In other words, during moments of pre-meeting exchanges, participants do conversational work to camouflage the institutionality of their interaction. Talk that is ordinary conversation in content and turn design nonetheless helps participants accomplish important work functions. In the papers conclusion, we step back from the analysis of this one setting to consider implications for studies of institutional life and the ordinary/institutional distinction."

This essay contests one of the commonly received narratives about Hansberry that is articulated in both African-American and lesbian/gay contexts -- that she was an assimilationist playwright of little political importance except biographically as an African-American (lesbian). The essays careful reading of Hansberrys work in its pre-civil rights, pre-Stonewall historical context reveals Hansberry as a writer whose acumen and breadth clearly distinguish her as one of the foremost public intellectuals of her time. Moreover, in the context of gay/lesbian studies of public communication, Hansberrys contributions to the Ladder exemplify a distinctive and frequently omitted perspective in contemporary debates over race, gender, and sexuality."
2003-0623,"Quotes and Agendas: Israelis vs. Palestinians on Media, Public and Policy Agendas",Paper,"Quotes and Agendas: Israelis vs. Palestinians on Media, Public and Policy Agendas","This study examines the media, public, and policy agendas in five countries relative to the Israeli/Palestinian dispute for periods as long as a quarter century. The media agenda was measured in the Associated Press (AP) for the United States, Agence France Presse (AFP) for France, Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) for Germany, TASS/ITAR-TASS (TASS) for the Soviet Union/Russia, and the Xinhua New Agency for China. The full texts from all these news wires archived in the LexisNexis electronic database were searched for quotes by Israelis and Palestinians, using the InfoTrend computer program. The quotes were also scored for the side quoted first in the story. The public agenda in the United States was an assessment of American public sympathy towards Israelis and Palestinians in surveys from the POLL database of the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut. The American policy agenda of interest in Middle Eastern issues was explored by examining surveys asking about Palestinians compared those concerned with Arab nations. The most striking feature of the three types of the American agendas was lack of abrupt changes in any of them throughout the 25 years of the study. All shifts were so gradual that even cataclysmic events such as wars and the September 11 terrorist attacks did not lead to agenda shifts that were obvious by inspection of the time trends. Therefore, parties to the Middle Eastern dispute might not be able to count on a single event to lead to their allies to push effectively for a resolution to the conflict. Turning to other countries, all their news agencies showed a decrease in favorability toward the Israelis in 2002. These trends imply the impact of several factors, including the target audiences and the political environment of the media studied."
2003-0624,Racial Borderlands: Suburban Plantation Culture and 'Rancho California (por favor)',Paper,Racial Borderlands: Suburban Plantation Culture and 'Rancho California (por favor)',"This paper interrogates the spatial and iconic ways that landscape in Southern California is used inscribe, naturalize, and exploit a profitable racial caste system in San Diego County?the very border region that the ICA has chosen as its theme in 2003.

This project summarizes five years (1995-2000) of field work and media work by the author among migrant farm-workers?primarily indigenous Mixtecs from Oaxaca and Mayans from Guatemala--in northern San Diego county. Utilizing clips from the award-winning documentary Rancho California (por favor), the paper challenges two fundamental myths. The first is a mythology of commerce and public relations. California promotes its intensive agriculture as breadbasket for the nation and as a key to consumer utopia. Few realize, however, that California intensively tills and farms, not simply crops, but human labor as well. In the post-NAFTA age of globalization,?raced-labor? is, arguably, one of the state?s most important economic products. Rancho California (por favor) document several of the hundreds of farm labor camps that exist in Southern California suburbs; camps that are always slightly, and conveniently, out-of-view. In some cases, scores of families live in makeshift shacks within a few hundred feet of the gated communities that employ them in Carlsbad, La Costa, and Del Mar. In other cases several hundred indigenous Oaxacan boys live and work invisibly in vast produce farms near Fallbrook and Escondido. Rancho California (por favor) documents the organization of these camps; their functions; and the meticulous ways that this human product is cultivated by managed deprivation on the margins. Far from the high-tech start-ups, race-labor has always been California?s most central ?synergy.?

This paper and visual presentation also questions a second set of favored academic mythologies. A slate of easy truisms characterize documentary theories of the past 15 years, such as: the problematic representation of the ?other?; the stylizing and constructed nature of documentary ?actuality?; the problem of speaking with any voice voice that is not, in some ways, also autobiographical of reflexive. These celebrated postmodern notions in documentary emanate from models of post-structuralism that have spurred an even more extensive (but no less problematic) orthodoxy in media critical studies: of semiotic openness; of textual rather than political oppositionality; of reception as an unstable shifting and defined by a mulitiplicity of reading positions. And while visible evidence from the arroyos in Rancho California (por favor) demonstrates how power works through public constructions, it does not leave one much confidence in academic notions of multiplicity and openness. The ?signs? of power in this raced landscape, that is, are also literal containers for worker bodies. These ?texts? are also chain-linked barriers for families. The creative, ?counter-practices? of these California campesinos, are also acknowledged parts of many local economies. They are, however, seldom recognized on the ground as acts of symbolic resistance.

Tying the immigrant/race-issue to specific, explosive political initiatives?like prop 187, prop 209?that erupt and fade from the headlines, risks ignoring the long, economically productive (but apparently invisible) daily ?habits? of California?s racial formation. Rather than looking at landscape as a place where racism happens, this paper shows how landscape?as enacted by zoning commissions, community associations, and corporations, and as fenced by growers?is also the means by which racism is ?performed? and in some cases, celebrated. ?Performativity,? far from being limited to subject sexuality positions in the way that Judith Butler describes, also characterizes a contested social space that is dramatically physical rather than abstract.

2003-0625,Radio in Accra: A confluence of National and Traditional Representations.,Paper,Radio in Accra: A confluence of National and Traditional Representations.,"This paper draws on the critical cultural theory of hybridization, and hegemony to explain how radio programming has changed in Accra, Ghana, since the change of media policy in the mid 1990s. This article argues that private media participation has led to the use of Akan forms of representation to facilitate communication, through the articulation of national issues among an ethnically diverse group of people in Accra. It discusses how traditional Akan forms of representations have assumed national significance as a result of new forms of programming and representations. It posits that this dynamic in representation is the result of a media practice evolved through programming, which reflect authentic Ghanaian cultural identity. Akan has risen as a main language on some radio stations in Accra, because of the emergence of a hybrid cultural phenomenon which allows the use of an ethnic language for communications across an ethnically divers population."
2003-0626,Radio Sawa: The Creation of a New U.S. Government Arabic Service,Paper,Radio Sawa: The Creation of a New U.S. Government Arabic Service,"Abstract

Eight months before September 11, 2001, the Voice of America (VOA) started planning a new Arabic service that would reach the under-30 population of the Middle East. The basic plan for what was to become Radio Sawa involved round-the-clock news and both Western and Arabic music that originated from the Arab world; new high-powered mediumwave transmitters located in Cyrpus and Djiboudi; delivery by local FM rebroadcasts in Jordan, the U.A.E., Qatar, and Kuwait, with others to follow; and the use of satellite transponder subcarriers.
The paper reviews the history of the VOA's Arabic Service, its competition, and the linguistic, technical, and political problems of attracting Arab world radio listeners to Western broadcasts. It then describes the birth of Radio Sawa, the U.S. government's new entry in Middle East radio broadcasting."

Through this first New Deal period, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) sought to maintain its corporate dominance of broadcasting that it won in the the Radio Act of 1927, and later the Communications Act of 1934. The largest U.S. radio networks (the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System) through its control of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), largely steered the NRA code-making process. The NAB Board of Directors developed a set of ""war plans' to protect advertisers, agencies, broadcasters, alike from attacks by unfriendly groups. The NAB's principal focus was to protect the advertiser-supported broadcasting system from opposition groups. Though this organization, national broadcasting industry interests usually won out over the concerns of local or small-town broadcasters. Due to a largely cooperative policy that favored President Roosevelt, the radio industry maintained industry control through 1935 over the broadcasting status-quo despite challenges from organized labor groups such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and other organizations that had protested the almost complete commercial re-orientation of the industry. The following key turning points through the 1933-35 period: (1) organization of the Radio Broadcasting Code Authority (RBCA); (2) the establishment of network company unions to thwart independent unionism; (3) announcement of ""Code of Fair Competition for Radio Broadcasting""."

Also, does the website, as microcosm, represent the future of the organizational mission or strategy of a nation-states foreign affairs department? To accomplish these goals, this paper provides an overview of both the notion of digital democracy as well as a snapshot of the state of relations between public opinion and foreign policy formation, followed by an overview of the institutional tendencies of both the United States and the United Kingdom in constructing governmental online presence and finally an analysis of the content and functionality of the U.S. Department of State and the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) web sites."

Experiment 1 predicted and found that high rationality individuals who first received context-expanding information about a relatively likely hazard (traffic deaths) manifested less apprehension in response to a subsequent news story about a less likely threat (anthrax death) than did highs who read only the anthrax death story. It was further predicted and found that among low rationality individuals this relationship was reversed. Experiment 1 was conducted when the anthrax threat was perceived to be quite serious. The interaction was not found in Experiment 2, after national attention to anthrax decreased. Findings are discussed in terms of how high and low rationality individuals process threat-related information and how they respond to changes in the perceived seriousness of threat."

This objective emerged from the fact that we live in a so-called information society, in which we can speak of ensuring pressures upon organizational members to process the expanding volumes of information they receive at the office. Because electronic mail seems to contribute greatly to the expanding volumes of information organizational members receive, and consequently, to the ensuring pressures to process the information, this study used electronic mail to explore the way in which organizational members process information. As a result of the fact that research on this topic remained underdeveloped so far, we developed an exploratory pattern using diary surveys in three organizations. This pattern gives a first description of the different ways organizational members read information and it gives a first explanation for these different ways."

The discussion is comprised of a historically contextualized interpretive analysis and discussion of the music as politically progressive discourse and art, and is in this specific regard augmented by the insights of original interviews of some of reggae's most seminal creators and innovators. The paper is intended to establish the foundation upon which the author may move toward a more complex theorization of the past century's authentic ""rebel music"" from a philosophically informed perspective that considers its unique and manifold aesthetic elements vis-a-vis the globally conscious messages which seek to inform the present human condition."

As early as the 1920s, RCA president David Surnoff claimed that of all radios tasks, which include the provision of information and national education, entertainment ranks supreme. Several decades later, however, the obliteration of boundaries between entertainment and information was evident. This is also true of radio, which reflects the processes evolving in other media, which, affected as they are by market forces, adopted a profit and competition orientation characteristic of Western mass media as a whole where news and entertainment have become merged. Concurrent with changes in the status of the news  as a ritual, entertainment or the means to satisfy social needs  the Western media experienced a process of feminization. The present study focuses on the contemporary validity of the equation: women = soft news; men = hard news and the direction of the future development of newsrooms in light of the feminization of the media. In addition, the study examines the question of whether the above dichotomy is affected by gender or is an outcome of the social and cultural factors of change. In this era of obliterated boundaries between news and info-tainment, and between hard and soft news, a re-categorization of news coverage patterns is warranted."
2003-0633,Recognition and the Other,Paper,Recognition and the Other,"In this paper I reflect on the question of justice for sexual minorities with respect to radical alterity and non-reciprocity. In particular, I'm interested in the tensions and interplay between recognition and the other vis-a-vis what Levinas calls the ""pathos of liberalism"" and the radical possibilities of pluralism. What might it mean to give recognition to an other without resorting to flattening differences and privileging same over other, as is so worn into the fabric of liberal political discourse? How can discourse ethics contribute to understanding the politics of identity, hatred of sexual minorities, and political discourse about incommensurate moral orders? More specifically, what implications do the possibilities of pluralism-without-the-limitations-of-liberalism have for recognition of others in transformative public discourse?"
2003-0634,Re-conceptualizing interruptions in physician-patient interview: Co-operative and intrusive,Paper,Re-conceptualizing interruptions in physician-patient interview: Co-operative and intrusive,"Results of past research on physician-patient interruption present an inconclusive picture. This study re-conceptualizes interruption into co-operative and intrusive categories. Thirty physician-patient interviews, 13 male/male and 17 male/female, were audio-taped and micro-analyzed. It was found that physicians did not interrupt patients more or vice versa. Rather, physicians and patients interrupted differently, the former more intrusively and the latter, more co-operatively. Furthermore, physicians did not dominate speaking turns nor speak more words than patients, as previously believed. We argue that their difference may not be measured by the number of words or speaking turns because it is imbedded in their respective communication style. It was also found that female patients exhibited eleven times as much co-operative interruptions as did male patients. When physicians interrupted patients, they were unsuccessful only 61f the time. When patients interrupted physicians, they were unsuccessful 321003410535f the time. This pattern points out a novel challenge for training--teaching patients the skill of interrupting physicians successfully."

I argue that the end user¡¯s creativity in their activities of using works of authorship should be the focus in applying the principle of transformative use rather than the subsequent creation of transformed work, as found in the lower court cases after Campbell. The transformative use factor, interpreted and applied in this way, would not only be linguistically and legally correct but also be able to provide important guidance in determining what kind of use should be fair use in different kinds of contexts including the changing information environment stimulated by digital information technology."

Moreover, the demographics of emergency room visitors have changed dramatically due to inadequate levels of health insurance and ineffective mental health and substance abuse treatment. This 18-month ethnographic study of communication in an urban emergency room investigated the organizing practices used to cope with these changes, highlighting the various disconnects between current practices and traditional models of emergent care. A narrative description of the ER culture produced by the researchers served as an impetus for practical improvements at this site and prompted a better appreciation for the complex interdependencies characterizing emergency care today."

The purpose is to gain a fuller understanding of the emerging global system of information flow and trade in broadcast materials. Within this context, this paper examines in detail a number of bilateral and multilateral media trading relationships within the context of this system. This examination provides evidence to support Straubhaars asymmetrical interdependence thesis."

The British introduced broadcasting to the colony in 1937. It was based on the British public service model. When The Bahamas dismantled colonization with independence from Britain in 1973, the broadcasting system retained the structure that was left by the British. From its inception broadcasting was state-owned, a condition that remained in effect until 1993. Throughout its seventy-two years of history, broadcasting in The Bahamas has faced numerous changes and challenges. Today, perhaps its greatest challenge is staying economically viable and aesthetically appealing to local audiences. This article examines four significant periods of growth in the history and development of broadcasting in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas from its inception in 1930 to the beginning of private commercial radio broadcasting in 1993."
2003-0639,"Reflective Communication Management, a Public View on Public Relations",Paper,"Reflective Communication Management, a Public View on Public Relations","Current public relations is commonly defined as relationship building with publics. In this paper we will argue that a feasible managerial concept of public relations needs more indicators than relationships alone to reflect the plural nature of its service to organizations and society, and that this needs to be an empirically based concept. We, therefore, will propose a two-by-two-dimensional definition of organization and communication and derive four basic models of communication management from it. We will propose different indicators for each of the four models. Then we will argue that the four models are not exclusive, but complementary, and that organizations are best advised to use these simultaneously in various combinations, i.e., as strategies. We will argue that this is necessary because all models are positioned at the behavioral level, i.e., on (members of) organizations and their publics. Taken individually, the societal level remains totally neglected. We will argue that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the legitimacy problem of organizations. To address this we will propose a new view of practical public relations called reflective communication management that is derived from social sciences rather than behavioral sciences. In this view of communication management the four existing models are combined as strategies."

This paper, analyzing the front pages of The New York Times, print medias paradigm of stylistic conservatism, is an attempt to fill this void. In the process of categorizing the content of the visuals printed on the Timess front pages between 1945 and 2000, a story of national transformation has been uncovered. During the post-World War II era, visual imagery served as a reflection of the dominant climateacutely influenced by the technological, political, and cultural transfiguration America was undergoing at the time. Photography was a visual manifestation of a national phenomenon."

It was found that both countries strictly regulate child pornography, Indeed, the laws of both countries were similar until United States Supreme Court rulings in Reno v. ACLU and Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, essentially made American law different from French law in terms of criminalization of certain aspects of child pornography. While France has tightened its child pornography laws considerably in recent years, the ruling in Ashcroft has given rise to a potential conflict of laws when it comes to international action against child pornography. Furthermore, there is a potential for producers of of virtual or computer-generated child pornography around the world to move their virtual wares to servers in the United States because of this countrys greater protection of free speech, including virtual or computer-generated child pornography that is unlawful in other jurisdictions."
2003-0642,Regulatory Governance and the Implementation of Universal Service: A Comparative Study of the US and Japan,Paper,Regulatory Governance and the Implementation of Universal Service: A Comparative Study of the US and Japan,"With a worldwide trend of regulatory reform through liberalization, the goal of universal service might be threatened because the trend would undermine the cross-subsidy arrangements that have underpinned universal service. The choice among the different financing methods is a fundamental policy issue and is likely to be different in each country, given its own conditions and needs. Furthermore, the role of government and the regulator will vary with the particular method of funding that is chosen. In this context, this study tries to compare the implementation of universal service in the US and Japan focusing on the framework of Levy and Spiller (1996), which emphasizes the importance of institutional structure in policy-making processes. The study uncovers that the decentralized regulatory process and formalized regulation in the US are largely rooted in its institutional governance and have facilitated pro-competitive implementation in universal service. By contrast, in Japan strategic implementation has been possible through a more discretionary institutional system and the strong regulatory incentives for market-conforming intervention."

Three hundred and fifty-four college students completed measures of love styles, relational dimensions, and parental love styles. Results of this investigation indicated that love styles were related to relational dimensions. In fact, significant levels of variance of all six love styles (Eros, Ludus, Storge, Pragma, Mania, and Agape) were explained by the relational dimensions. Results of this investigation demonstrated that participants love styles were significantly different from their perception of their parents love style for four of the six love styles measured: Eros, Ludas, Pragma, and Agape. Specifically, participants rated their own Eros and Ludas love styles to be significantly higher than their parents, while they rated their own Pragma and Agape love styles to be significantly lower than their parents."

This claim was tested in a cross-cultural comparison between American and Singaporean respondents use of relational models in two different relationships: friendships and acquaintanceships. Results provide evidence for an association of horizontal collectivism with communal sharing, vertical collectivism with authority ranking, horizontal individualism with equality matching, and vertical individualism with market pricing. In addition, results showed that for Americans, there are no differences between friendships and acquaintances in regard to relational model use, whereas for Singaporeans, these two relationships are qualitatively very different. Implications of these findings for the study of interpersonal and intercultural communication are discussed."

As of yet, however, scholars have only tested this hypothesis using general scales that measure positive versus negative behavior. The purpose of the present study was to add specificity to the model by investigating a wider range of communicative responses to hurtful events. Utilizing a sample 263 individuals who had been hurt by something a dating partner said or did within the last 14 months, we investigated the relations among apology, forgiveness, and seven communicative responsesrelational repair, integrative communication, loyalty, de-escalation, revenge, distributive communication, and negative avoidance. Results suggest that forgiveness is most strongly associated with high levels of integrative communication and low levels of de-escalation and revenge. Forgiveness also mediated the relationship between these three communicative responses and apology, as predicted by the interpersonal forgiveness model. However, other findings (i.e., loyalty and distributive communication were negatively associated while apology and distributive communication were positively associated) ran counter to the model, suggesting possible theoretical refinements."

Its research aim is to know the relationship between TV consumption, viewers? favourite programmes, the electronic equipment that they have at home and the influence of these factors on the consumption of Pay-per-view (PPV) which started in Spain at the same time as digital TV, in 1997. The first important conclusion is that people who contract PPV services are great consumers of television and watch 218 minutes of TV per day; 5 minutes more than those who only receive general television stations, and 23 minutes more than those who have digital TV, but who do not contract PPV. The second conclusion is that there is no relation between computer technology (ownership of PC and consumption) and the contracting of PPV services. On the hand, contracting PPV is associated with the ownership of more modern TV equipment (screen 16/9, dual/stereo, VCR and videogame console) and audio equipment (Hi-Fi music centre). Thirdly, monthly household spending on PPV is also related to the possession of technological equipment. People who have a 16/9 TV set, or a dual/stereo TV set or teletext, spend more money than people who do not have them.

Introduction

This paper suggests that the ideology of 'modernity' and 'development' is an important aspect of the historical documentary films in Korea, and further attempts to identify the distinctive characteristics of this particular form of visual representation. In developing the idea that the historical documentary films in Korea can be understood in terms of their capability of enabling the ideological reproduction to emerge and work within this form of visual representation, this presentation suggests that the documentary films can be seen to have its own mode of representation, as well as its own structure of narratives.

Throughout the analysis both of the structure within the narrative and representational style, and of its changing relationship with the economic, political and social spheres, the paradoxical links between cultural practices and power relations can most usefully be explained. A number of different ways of looking at the documentary films are identified with this end in mind, including investigating the history and the definition which the documentaries have made, their own unique means of production, the relations of political and commercial forces within them, and their changing modes of representation.

In particular, this paper focuses on the way how the historical documentary films in Korea perform an important function of 'legislating', or 'constructing', and 'interpreting' the concepts of 'modernity' and 'development' embodying the nation's history, and also the way how the films efficiently mobilize the strategic modes of narratives and representation, so as to fulfill the designated ideological purposes. The modes of representation in particular allows us to consider the field of forces as unstable, and to consider the shifting nature of the relationship between visual production of documentary films and its reception from one historical period to the next.

The presentation suggests that while there are definite limits of a commercial, political and social kind placed upon cultural production of this particular visual form, the mobility of cultural objects made possible by the means of visual communication undermines, to some extent at least, the effectiveness of these restraints and underpins the specificities of the ideology of modernity and development dominating modern cultural life of our own.

This presentation assumes that documentary film is a vehicle for exposition, and is a more expansive form of representation than news, able to develop the values of duration, to stay with upholding action for several minutes, and to carry out an intensive filming of its topic followed by considered and lengthy phases of editing. Between the two poles of full theatricality and observationalism, documentary films have a whole range of options narrativizing its materials, both across the film or program as a whole or locally, within the terms of a specific scene. Given that documentary films do have a level of narrative structure, variously repressed or projected, this presentation would ask how the narrative actually works in this film or program, and with what aesthetic and cognitive consequences for the viewer.

""Imagined Modernity"" in Official Documentary Films

Historical documentary is frequently a vehicle for exposition of the ideology of modernity and development. By employing the strategies of their own narratives and representational styles, the television official documentary films play a role of legislating and interpreting the nation's history. This study, however, does not particularly concentrate on the ideology of 'modernity' established by the nation's official documentary films, but more specifically on the ideology of 'imagined modernity' through and in which the Korean's own identity is formulated.


The ""imagined modernity"" in this presentation is 'the modernity in mental map, manipulatively designated and operated by the media performance. The issue of ""imagined modernity"" raises the question of the nature of social challenge posed for the ethical project of social theory by modernity. Whatever the arguments about its genesis and its implications, we broadly agree that the transition to 'modernity' involved:
(a) an increased specialization or division of social labor in all social spheres, not just the economic - although economic specialization may have made other forms possible;
(b) the development of generalized structures of social co-ordination;
(c) what is sometimes called secularization but is more accurately described as the rise to dominance of a culture of critical rationalism and its associated scientific world view and the accompanying decline of doxa of tradition, especially the religious world view.

The problems raised for the Enlightenment project were the followings:
(a) first is concerning the question of how to build and rebuild the ""imagined community"";
(b) second problem is the question of structure and agency, and the dialectical relationship between social specialization and complexity, and the necessary accompanying growth in structurally constraining systems of general social co-ordination.
(c) the third problem is the relationship between the rational moral subject as individual consciousness and self-identity and the subject as socially formed.

This exposition is mostly grounded in to-camera and voice-over speech. And, the combination of presenter speech and images is often interspersed with the accessed voices of interviewees. Since many documentaries are concerned with the character and causality of other than physical events, their visualizations regularly need the support of speech, whether offered directly by a presenter or indirectly by those portrayed. Yet documentary is a more expansive form of representation than news, able to develop values of duration, to stay with unfolding action for several minutes, and to carry out intensive filming of its topic followed by considered and lengthy phases of editing.

The communication researches in the past largely rest upon an ideology as to the historical development of social provisions and their relationship to the development of modernity, and its characteristic structures and practices. They are narratives that make action and critique both possible and necessary. The form of history and the kinds of stories we construct and mobilize will depend upon both the question we are asking in the present and how that question has been framed historically. Such histories must be subject to validation both in the light of historical evidence and in the context of a rational discursive sphere of criticism.


Analysis

The aim of this study is to analyze the social origins of certain historically specific forms of ""modernity"" shown in official television documentaries in Korea, (""The Visual Diary"" in English, an official television documentary series, edited and produced, and broadcasted by a public broadcasting institution in Korea. The official documentaries themselves are ""the systems of identity formation"" funded and supervised by the nation's broadcast institutions which provide a universal broadcast service for all the audience groups in the nation. A set of broadcast institutions constitutes a national system when it supplies the majority of the nation's needs in information, and did so through an integrated and coordinated network of institutions. Such systems in Korea were consolidated since the 1960s, and they represented the precursors of modern state broadcasting.

Through analyzing the representational modes of the recent official documentary series, this study suggests that an oscillation of identification have continuously worked since the inception of the western modernity. Hence, the fixed ideal of unitary and coherent identity forced by official documentary films is in some senses invalid at least for the audiences who have passed through radical ruptures in history and experienced the vicissitudes of fate. The visual representation of history in the form of official documentary films presented the ideological foundation for the nation's total structure of governance by influencing the viewers' popular memory, but also reminded the historical wound of 'imagined modernity'.

Themes, key narratives, and codes for representation
(The Visual Diary - 1948, KBS)

17. politics in S.K. UN's recognition of S.K.government (nation-state; western recognition) OF / LS-FS (UN; dressed-up people in the street - towards the west)

This study suggests that historical documentaries produced by major nationwide television company may perform a kind of ritual function to integrate the divided individual experiences into a framework of collective experience - the ""modernity"" in history. Thus, the collective experience presents the ideological foundation for the nation's total structure of governance.

Not only by employing the both the quantitative and qualitative research methods to analyze the narrative structure, but by utilizing in-depth interviews with documentary viewers, this study analyzes the both thematic and aesthetic codes of one episode (1948 - Nation-building) of the documentary series. Through the research, the study reveals how the both aesthetic and thematic codes construct a coherent mythological narrative about the shape of modernity in Korean history. The study finds that the mythological narrative about the 'imagined modernity' is established, through a series of codes for visual representation, largely characterized by following three important themes.

(1) The Nation-State
The first theme is towards the construction of modern ""nation-state"", achieved in each clip more precisely by:
¨ç de-colonialism (Independence) (#4, #6; #7, #10, #11, #12, #13, #17);
¨è anti-communism (#4, #5, #14, #15, #16);
¨é economic development (#8, #12).

(2) Westernization
The second theme is towards the ""westernization"", which may include the concepts of:
¨ç Americanization (#8, #11);
¨è internationalization (#2, #10);
¨é western civilization (#1, #2, #11, #17).

(3) Humanism
And, the final theme is towards the ""humanism"", which has sub-categories of:
¨ç freedom (#3, #4, #5, #8, #10, #15, #17);
¨è democracy (#3, #4, #6, #7, #12, #13);
¨é the quality of life (#8, #9, #10).

The study implies that the mythological narrative about the modernity represented in documentaries intends to serve a specific need for ideological control over the society. The visual representation of history through the documentaries exerts the political influences over the audience's popular memories.

In so doing, I first start with pointing out some serious deficiencies of current media education, then proceed to discuss how critical pedagogical theories can be applied to media literacy education, and finally suggest some feasible ways of concretizing critical media literacy. At last, I conclude by arguing that the current media literacy education needs to be transformed in order to serve as a liberating pedagogy, which opens up a possibility of alternative and oppositional media education and practices for both teachers and students."

While updating the literature on the depictions of women in television commercials, this examination additionally aimed to provide insight into the quality and frequency of these characterizations across all age ranges. Findings suggest that males continue to outnumber their female counterparts, with the quality and diversity of these roles favoring males.

It especially investigates these images denial of voice, and their universalizing abnegation of the ambivalent, borderland position of many Muslim women both in the diaspora and in countries such as Iran caught between Western and Islamic values. Arguing that the image of the silent and silenced veiled woman has been used to derogate Islam as a pre-modern and barbaric religion, it also acknowledges the possibility of desire and fantasy evoked by this figure in Western eyes. Through an examination of instances when veiled Muslim women have, exceptionally, been granted speaking rights in media representations, the paper examines the complexity and ambivalence of the border territory that is denied expression in the dominant visual trope."

It explores the nature of the qualitative interview as compared to the therapeutic encounter and considers the similarities and differences of the two processes. The therapeutic techniques included for analysis within this paper are empathy, reflective listening, focusing, and therapist self-disclosure. The text provides examples that analyze the applications and outcomes of these therapeutic techniques and presents extended portions of the individual interviews as a means of identifying the therapeutic strategies embedded in the dialog.
The paper will initially provide a general description of the qualitative interview and the therapeutic encounter. These descriptions will orient the reader to the nature of these processes and identify the basic strategies and goals of each methodology. These discrete, yet similar events provide a foundational framework for this project and offer a point of reference for other, more detailed analyses that demonstrate a blending of the two. A broad definition of discourse and discussion of discourse analysis will provide a brief overview of the strategies employed for this exploration and clarify the emphasis on interview process rather than interview content."
2003-0659,"'Resistance Reexamined: Gender, Fan Practices, and Science Fiction Television'",Paper,"'Resistance Reexamined: Gender, Fan Practices, and Science Fiction Television'","Studies of gender, science fiction television, and fan culture have often asserted that female fans resist patriarchy by negotiating cultural texts through such practices as fan fiction and deliberation. This analysis holds that specific motivation and context must be considered in order to advance such a claim, especially in light of undercurrents of misogyny contributing to such phenomena as ""slash"" fan fiction authored by women and dealing with romances between male heroes. With this in mind, the study assesses the practices of female fans as well as relevant text and production factors in the context of particular, gender-related issues surrounding the series ""Farscape"" and ""Stargate SG-1,"" and finds that activities designated as emancipatory can, in fact, reproduce hegemony, and that fans sometimes appropriate resistive rhetoric in defense of hegemonic proclivities."

By analyzing a distinctive university BBS youth culture, the author intends to answer how is the resistance of a youth culture possible when it occurs in a fast changing society like China. Data presented in this article were based on face-to-face in-depth interviews with fifteen student BBS users from four Chinese universities. Discourse analysis is used in analyzing the data. Conclusions are as follows: first, new technology, such as the BBS, empowers the students to constitute their own BBS language style and to resist the real contexts they live in; second, resistance can only be observed if it is placed in a specific contextual and historical moment; and third, as to the case of the BBS youth culture in China, contradiction between the real trends of the society and the governmental and intellectual discourses produces subject positions for the youth to resist the orthodox ideas and traditional values; that is, the resistance of this youth culture is intimately related to their immediate living contexts."
2003-0661,Resonance as Mediator of Prime-Time Messages about Smoking,Paper,Resonance as Mediator of Prime-Time Messages about Smoking,"This study examined attitude change caused by messages about smoking embedded in prime-time television programming. Data were obtained from 224 college students randomly assigned to pro-smoking and anti-smoking message treatments taken from television programs. Subjects completed pretest/posttest measures of smoking attitudes. No significant changes were detected from pretest to posttest measures, nor between posttest measures. When subjects were bifurcated into smoking and non-smoking backgrounds, significant differences were found. Those from smoking backgrounds significantly increased favorable attitudes towards smoking after exposure to the pro-smoking treatment. Those from non-smoking backgrounds significantly decreased an favorable attitudes toward smoking after exposure to the anti-smoking treatment. Prime-time tobacco messages resonate with those whose backgrounds are consistent with the message."

Seven public relations strategies were tested using the theory of reasoned action to determine strategy influence on individuals beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward an organization responding to activism. Results indicate that salient beliefs predict attitude, and attitude and subjective norm predict behavioral intention. In addition, results indicate that salient beliefs are predicted by attitude toward organizational response to activism, which is influenced by public relations strategy type. Findings suggest that any type of strategic response to activism is better than no response. The cooperative problem-solving strategy produced the most effective outcome for the organization, and the threat and punishment strategy produced the least effective outcome for the organization."

2003-0664,Retesting the Marketplace Theory of Media Use,Paper,Retesting the Marketplace Theory of Media Use,"Relying on literature from mass communication and marketing, the current study reconceptualizes and retests the Marketplace Theory of Media Use. The theory suggests that news can be viewed as a commodity, product or brand that can be purchased, traded and consumed. News consumption, thus, is expected to develop as does product purchase. We retest a model that suggests that primary antecedents, such as perceived news accuracy and perceived financial aspects of journalism, affect attitude toward newspaper (AN), which then affects newspaper readership. In retesting the model via structural equation modeling and partial correlations, we find that the process appears to differ by newspaper and newspaper community. With data from a 2000 telephone survey of a large Northern urban center, we find support for the model in terms of readership of one of the two focal newspapers."
2003-0665,Risk and Efficacy as Motivators of Change: Test of the Risk Perception Attitude (RPA) Framework,Paper,Risk and Efficacy as Motivators of Change: Test of the Risk Perception Attitude (RPA) Framework,"Derived from the extended parallel process model (EPPM; Witte, 1992, 1994), the risk perception attitude (RPA) framework categorizes individuals into four groups on the basis of their risk perception and efficacy beliefs. These four groups  avoidance (high risk, low efficacy), responsive (high risk, high efficacy), proactive (low risk, high efficacy), and indifference (low risk, low efficacy)  are predicted to differ in various health outcomes. Prior research found that the avoidance group expressed more healthy intentions than the other three groups. Researchers hypothesized that this unexpected finding was due to participants prior knowledge about their low-risk status, which caused them not to believe the high-risk diagnosis they received. The current study was undertaken to test this incredulity hypothesis by conducting an experiment with diabetes, a disease that participants knew little about. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects (N = 134) experiment, participants risk and efficacy beliefs were manipulated to determine how these variables influenced self-protective motivation, intention to seek information, actual information seeking, knowledge acquisition, and behavioral intention. Results were mixed, but the risk x efficacy interaction was significantly related with three outcomes. Results are discussed in the context of the EPPM-based findings."

The role of the key interlocutor is often cast in shadow by the message he or she relays, but it is only through the actions of individuals that institutions can give rise to new policies, perceptions and pathologies. The continuities and disjunctures between ambitious miners of the new global imaginary serve here to illustrate some of the fault lines and foundations of an emerging information order in which speed of publication, mode of presentation, and perceived authenticity of authorial experience combined to shape the responses to knowledge production by both broad publics and high officials."
2003-0667,Robin Hoods or thieves? A Foucauldian analysis of international trade policies regarding software piracy,Paper,Robin Hoods or thieves? A Foucauldian analysis of international trade policies regarding software piracy,"International trade organizations in contemporary time have mostly failed in their stated missions of protecting software companies and protecting poor countries. Global software piracy rates are increasing, and problems appear more prominent than do solutions in the discourse after decades of efforts to improve trade situations, and even to define what constitutes ""improvement.""
In order to establish the problems and demonstrate reasons for them, a brief introduction of the system of regulation of world trade as it has evolved is presented, along with frequently offered reasons for failures in the system. Next, a discussion of contemporary trade in computer software is included, with particular emphasis on piracy and trade sanctions in Ukraine. Finally, comments and practices of parties to piracy and trade regulation are presented and analyzed, including unfair trade practices as various trade partners describe them.
Foucauldian (1972) analysis, specifically the examination of the international trade texts as ""discursive formations,"" is conducted. Foucault's (1972) critical scheme consists of a set of questions designed to uncover potential discursive formations and, thereby, systems of knowledge, power, and ethics. Foucault provides a heuristic system of 12 questions that are presented in four functional areas: objects, enunciative modalities, concepts, or strategies. The analysis leads to some conclusions about the nature of piracy and the efforts and effects of international trade regulation activity."

This study tested the differences between a picture of an on-screen character interacting in three different contexts (retail purchase, health advice, reading survey) versus a three-dimensional robot conducting the same interactions off screen. A laboratory experiment (n=72) was conducted in the US and replicated in Japan which tested differences in social evaluations, credibility, and memory. Results showed significant interactions between nationality and embodiment across a range of social and cognitive responses including perceived credibility, perceived surveillance, memory, and valence. These results are interpreted within technological and cultural contexts."
2003-0669,Role of Global Media Use on Adolescent Development in South Africa,Paper,Role of Global Media Use on Adolescent Development in South Africa,"A survey study of 471 teenagers in South Africa was conducted to explore the impact of the U. S. culture on the development of local adolescents. Adopting theoretical ideas from uses and gratifications research tradition, it was hypothesized that repeated, and more frequent, use of foreign media programs would lead to a positive attitude towards foreign products and ideas. The rationale was that the performance expectations built upon repeated use would lead to a point in which the individuals choice to gratify specific needs is no longer driven primarily by content-specific evaluation but by general expectations of the medium performance that are related to important audience needs and values.
The results showed a significant relationship between the exploration of ones own cultural heritage and the advancement of autonomy and socialization tasks through media use. Furthermore, the use of televisionwhich in South Africa is dominated by U.S.-produced programswas positively associated with the spread of a global image that is represented by the U.S. culture. Suggestions on how to improve the measures and the theoretical model for future studies are also presented."
2003-0670,Romance and Risk: Romantic Attraction and Health Risks in the Process of Relationship Formation,Paper,Romance and Risk: Romantic Attraction and Health Risks in the Process of Relationship Formation,"This paper directly investigated the partner characteristics that reflect both risk and attractiveness as well as the correlation between these two concepts. Every one of 36 attributes were viewed as important by at least some respondents and there was wide variance in the frequency with which they were chosen. While 801f the respondents felt it was important to know something about the potential partners appearance, less than 5 0.000000elt it was important to know about accessories. In addition to appearance, only 4 other attributes were selected as one of the 15 most important by at least 601015057760f respondents. Correlations between risk and attractiveness at level of an individual aspect also varied. For the most part, risk and attractiveness were negatively correlated but the correlations were quite low: for more than 7527777752002f the aspects, knowing something about attraction provides relatively little information about risk and vice versa."
2003-0671,Salient features of the television message,Paper,Salient features of the television message,"Scanning television programs with the aid of a remote control device to find a suitable viewing option has become a widespread selective strategy among television viewers (Heeter & Greenberg, 1988; Walker & Bellamy, 1991; Walker, Bellamy & Traudt, 1993). Although correlates like age, gender, education, channel repertoire or sensation seeking (Wenner & Dennehy, 1993; Heeter, 1988) are well known, the explanation of this particular choice behavior remains quite unclear: Why do viewers choose a certain program after a period of scanning? What makes this question especially interesting is that rapid-fire scanning does not leave very much time for the decision: Within a few seconds viewers have to decide whether an option is suitable for watching or not. So it is not very probable that viewers base their judgements on complex information of the television stimulus like the plausibility or the appeal of the narration. Rather, it stands to reason that time is too scarce for systematic and well-founded judgements and that viewers go by peripheral cues - features of the message that are easy to process and that can influence judgements considerably if there is no time, ability or opportunity to process a stimulus more intensively. This reflects the position of dual-process-theories in social cognition (e.g. Cacioppo & Petty, 1985, Petty & Wegener, 1999; Chen & Chaiken 1999) that assume two fundamental modes of judgement formation: One is the systematic or central mode where people try to extract the most truthful judgement out of a given stimulus constellation, and the other is the heuristic or peripheral mode where people try to save time and effort by using well-tried rules of thumb (Moskowitz et al., 1999). This basic idea of dual-process-theories is the foundation of the model and the empirical study to be presented. The model proposes that viewers constantly process information when scanning through programs; the judgments about the single options are based on the information they just perceived. The options are evaluated rather heuristically than systematically, as decisions are made very quickly, and moreover, are not very vital to the individual and can be revised anytime without monetary costs. In this situation, peripheral cues can stop the heuristic mode and initiate a more systematic evaluation. What becomes visible in television behavior is a longer pause at options that bear such peripheral cues. One type of cues seems especially relevant to this kind of process and has been subject to extensive research: Perceptually salient cues of the television message.
Formal features like pace, movement, visual effects, voices, sounds and music have been proven to evoke attention in viewers (especially orienting reflexes), and equally have content features like violence, erotic portrayals, humor and emotion been proven to have effects on attention and arousal .

Thus, when viewers are scanning through programs, an attentional shift or a rise in arousal can be provoked if they touch an option that is perceptually more salient than the previous ones. Furthermore, it is not only the mere amount of salient features that results in orienting reflexes, but also sudden changes in salient features (Eimer et al., 1996); so the amount of change from one option to the next should also have the potential to terminate heuristic processing (that is scanning). Terminologically, scanning periods are television intervals of short duration that serve as orientation; decision periods represent the first few moments of a chosen option that are equal in duration to the scanning intervals. Following these considerations, two hypotheses are be set up:

Hypothesis 1: The density of salient features in decision periods is higher than in scanning periods.
Hypothesis 2: The change in salient features from the last scanning interval to the decision period is higher than the changes within the scanning period.

Empirical study. To test these hypotheses, a study combining content analysis and behavioral meter data was conducted. On the one hand, television program from the 15 largest German TV channels was recorded in summer of 1997 during one hour, covering prime time between 19:30 and 20:30 p.m. This program was content-analyzed for cuts, camera movement, movement of objects and people, visual effects, voices, sounds, music (formal features), violence, erotic portrayals, humor and emotion (content features). The coding recorded the status of all mentioned variables for every second of the hour. On the other hand, meter data from the continuous national German television measurement system were available for the same period of time. The meter data recorded all movements made by all persons in the panel on a second-to-second-basis. Thus, an exact time match between content data and behavioral data was possible. Only persons who were watching television alone were included in the analysis, as not to confuse individual with group behavior. All in all, data of 1746 viewers were used. Prior to actual analysis, behavioral data were analyzed in order to identify scanning and decision periods; from this analysis, 3052 clusters of scanning and decision emerged.

Data analysis. To test hypothesis 1, a comparison was made between the amount of salient features in the scanning period (mean value) and the amount of salient features in the decision period (see figure 1).







Figure 1: Rationale for data analysis in hypothesis 1 (example with cuts per minute)

To test hypothesis 2, a comparison was made between the amount of change in salient features in the scanning period and the amount of change in salient features from the last scanning interval to the decision period (see figure 2).










Figure 2: Rationale for data analysis in hypothesis 2 (example with cuts per minute)

Hypotheses will be confirmed, if the value for salient features resp. the value for change in the decision period is greater than in the scanning period. To test the significance of the comparison, linear mixed models (Brown & Prescott 1999) were computed that take into account that viewers can perform several choices (repeated measurements).

Results
Hypothesis 1 can be partly confirmed: The values for camera movement, object movement, voices and sounds are consistently greater in decision periods than in scanning periods. On the other hand, visual effects, cuts and music could not yield that effect. As for content features, violence, humor and emotion but not erotic portrayals had higher values in decision periods. This means that most of the salient features have the predicted effect on television program choice: It is probable that viewers pause for a longer period of time if they come across a more salient television message.
Hypothesis 2: Looking at changes in salient features, we can confirm an effect on selection for all features but humor and erotic portrayals. This means that the change from the last scanning interval to the decision period is more important than changes within the scanning period. Hence, viewers tend to stop their scanning when they meet an option that represents an unusually high contrast to the previous option.

Abstract

Arguing that culture is an indicator of a particular way of life and that membership in groups is a determinant in the development of a personal and social identity, this paper will provide initial insight into the distinct fan culture surrounding the band Widespread Panic. Research suggests that music provides a framework with which individuals define their world while also being used as a resource to communicate identities. For many fans of Widespread Panic the annual spring, summer, and fall tours provide such an outlet. With the help of aspects of Richard Johnsons circuit of culture this paper attempts to further these ideas concerning music while expanding the notion that media consumption is an activity that defines identity."

The presence of patriarchy is identified through the use of hierarchical structures, value of external criteria, and emphasis on obedience and deference to authority. Impacts of patriarchy include violating the integrity of students, teaching them to be ""self-haters,"" and making them passive recipients of information. Using the three tenets of anarchism?liberty, equality, and solidarity and the feminist rhetorical options of desire, enfoldment, collective efforts, inherent value, and mystery, a new structure for our current educational system is created."

The Implications of Secrecy for Communications Researchers

This panel rationale is submitted in light of the experiences of the author as communications researcher in a sensitive and secretive environment.

Dr. Tom Clonan, a retired army officer (Captain) in the Irish Defence Forces, completed a PhD in Dublin City University, 1996 - 2000. The subject of the thesis was the status and roles assigned female personnel in the Irish Defence Forces.

As the researcher was subject to the Official Secrets Act, there were a number of key issues that affected the nature of the research. These included the requirement to get written permission from the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces for the work to be examined. It affected the manner in which the researcher conducted the research within the setting (overtly) and the manner in which the researcher could gather data.

Despite these difficulties, the PhD was eventually examined and as per the instructions of the military authorities, lodged in the library of DCU. However, when the findings of the study entered the wider public domain via the media, a series of events occurred which had major implications for the researcher, the Defence Forces and those personnel who formed the focus of the study.

The subject of this paper is directly relevant to the focus of the conference (The law as a border past which communications cannot flow) in that it highlights, in a dramatic way, the manner in which legislation was used to hinder the flow of knowledge from the unknown to the known.

The paper will also deal with the implications of such work for the researcher - professionally and academically.


Abstract

This paper will review the literature covering research methodology and ethics in research and will focus on the conduct of research in 'Sensitive' and 'Secretive' sites (Renzetti and Lee, 1994).

The paper will also propose an alternative view to the normal paradigm of the researcher 'entering the field' (usually from a university) and 'retiring from the field' to write up data.

The paper will be given in light of the author's experiences of communicating information involving illegal practices and policies as they applied to a minority group within a state institution.

The paper will highlight those obstacles in law that impact on the manner in which the research can be begun, the manner in which such research can be conducted and the manner in which its findings can be reported.

Crucially, the paper will highlight the dramatic impact the conduct of sensitive research in a secretive setting has on the organisation under study, participants in the study and the researcher themselves.

The paper will draw on the experiences of the author in bringing this study to completion as a PhD in Dublin City University, 1996 - 2000. The paper will place this study within the wider context of literature on research and secrecy, and in the context of research on women in the military world-wide."
2003-0676,"Seducing the Republic: Berlusconi, narrative seduction, commercial television and political power",Paper,"Seducing the Republic: Berlusconi, narrative seduction, commercial television and political power","Italy in the 1980's saw a transition from a national public television system with a monopoly held by the RAI to a duopoly with the rise of a series of commercial television networks in a cartel controlled by Silvio Berlusconi. Later, Berlusconi was to found a political party and to become Prime Minister of Italy in 1994. After some years in opposition, he has now been relelected with a handsome majority and is again the Prime Minister and Berlusconi has been nicknamed Il Gran Seduttore. What is the role of narrative seduction in his success? How did serialised stories help him in these moves? Put theoretically, in what sense did the stories on his television stations become scripts for the success of his networks and eventually his political career? Did it provide a script for performances in the public sphere or at least a set of metaphors? As texts are they performative, do they produce effects or change the way people view television or behave as political and linguistic subjects? How does the organisation of of desire by stories travel across genres and spheres of the social space?"

Furthermore, while women appeared to use expertise heuristics, exhibiting greater conformity to the male-charactered than female-charactered partner on a masculine topic, men displayed greater conformity to the male-charactered than female-charactered partner on a feminine topic, manifesting resistance to female influence. Employing a gender-neutral task, Experiment 2 demonstrated that while the gender of the character did not influence womens conformity behavior, male advantage in exerting social influence persisted among men. These findings are discussed in terms of mindless responses to the salient visual cues in CMC and differences in the ways men and women respond to social influence by gendered agents."

Legal change appears as another significant influence and this paper focuses on defamation law and news production and considers how defamation law attempts to take news production practices into account. US and Australian cases have created, and continue to draw on, models of journalistic practice, which appear to be aimed at lessening any 'chilling effect' of defamation law on media speech. The authors argue for an interdisciplinary, comparative approach to understanding the different legal regimes and their effects within news production. They outline an object of study that has legal and sociological value and position it within existing literature in each field."

A two-wave panel survey of college students was conducted. The study has documented two major findings: (1) a potential for Web sites to enhance the probability of voting turnout, and (2) respondentsf tendency of selective exposure toward preferred candidate Web sites. The first major finding provided empirical evidence contrary to what had been found in the previous studies, i.e., the online media were predictors for voting turnout while the traditional media were not. The second major finding also includes evidence that the degree of preference for a candidate corresponded to the degree of selective exposure."
2003-0680,Self- and Co-Regulation as Indicators of a Transformed Statehood in the Mediamatics Sector,Paper,Self- and Co-Regulation as Indicators of a Transformed Statehood in the Mediamatics Sector,"Liberalization, globalization and convergence lead to a political control crisis and subsequently to regulatory reforms in the mediamatics sector (media, telematics), the convergent communications sector. The traditional common pattern of statehood in the mediamatics sector is obsolete and a new common pattern seems to emerge, encompassing changes of political institutions, content and processes of regulation and control. In this paper we focus on one important element of such a transformed statehood, on the changing division of labor between governments and the industry  more generally, between state actors and societal actors  and in particular on the models of self- and co-regulation in the European Union. Self- and co-regulation are widely considered to be tools of great promise by the industry and various policymakers, prominently by the European Commission. In our analysis we summarize incentives, risks and success factors of self- and co-regulation, present a classification for the different types of regulation, and provide an overview and assessment of self- and co-regulation as defined and practiced at the EU-level."

Abstract

In 1998, British Petroleum began an integrated branding campaign to remake itself as an environmentally friendly oil company. By considering the meaning of artistic agency in the production of global advertising, as well as by acknowledging the implications for media consumers and critics, this essay interprets integrated branding as a source of the contestation described by Appadurai as the global imagination. The discussion is organized around an historical literature review of the century-long development of artists into graphic designers in the advertising industry, a theoretical framework based on concepts of globalization by Appadurai and Giddens, and a review of relevant critical theory. The BP campaign is analyzed in a semiotic analysis of past and present logos and their attendant meanings. Following this interpretive explication of the integrated branding process and its meaning, the study concludes that integrated branding represents a key obstacle for authenticity, agency and action in global communication."
2003-0682,Seniors and friendship formation online,Paper,Seniors and friendship formation online,"This paper addresses the issues of the digital divide, intergenerational and intragenerational friendship formation, and using email for improving social support networks. Data was collected from 90 seniors in 177 email friendship pairs. After four months, both received and sent email messages were coded for relational maintenance strategies, self-presentation strategies, self-disclosure statements, complaints, seeking common ties, frequency of contact, and mutual desire to maintain friendships. Results showed no significant differences between intergenerational and intragenerational pairs in the agreement to stay email friends. After controlling for total messages sent, it was found that the number of self disclosure and self presentation strategies used by friendship partners were the most important differences in intergenerational and intragenerational friendship pairs and in those pairs that agreed to stay friends and those that did not. Regardless of age cohort, it was determined that in email friendships both partners should communicate often, find common ties, and engage in relational maintenance strategies."

An analysis of peoples communicative activities on this day can reveal how communicative networks and mass media work under extreme conditions. This paper presents findings from a German study in 2002. Results from telephone interviews with 1460 persons show that the diffusion of the news followed patterns known from other extreme events. Special attention was paid to sources of information about the event, the use of these sources over time and to further activities of information on this day.
In the second part of the paper a comparison with data from studies in the US show that media have special strengths and weaknesses according to the local time of the events: news spread faster in Germany in the afternoon by means of television than in the US, while interpersonal communication was more important in early morning America."
2003-0684,Sex and Violence Makes Me Yawn: Autonomic Desensitization to Music Videos,Paper,Sex and Violence Makes Me Yawn: Autonomic Desensitization to Music Videos,"The influence of sex and violence are one of the major concerns in music video research. Content analyses of music videos has found a high degree of videos containing sexual or violent content (Sherman & Dominick, 1986; Tapper, Thorson & Black, 1994). Further, it has been found that some genres like rap are more likely than other genres to contain sexual and violent content (Smith & Boyson, 2002).
One effect of sex and violence that has been demonstrated is a desensitization effect. This effect refers to viewers who view a lot of violence or sex becoming less disturbed or aroused by it (Harris, 1999). Desensitization has primarily been demonstrated through attitudinal response. For example, Johnson, Jackson, and Gatto (1995) revealed that male adolescents who viewed violent rap music videos tended to more easily condone the use of violence as a means of social problem solving relative to their peers. Kalof (1995), demonstrated that viewing music videos that portrayed women in a sexually explicit nature led to greater acceptance of adversarial sexual beliefs. Further, Preston (2001) found that college students who viewed a lot of music videos perceived less sex and violence in music videos than students who very rarely viewed music videos. The purpose of this study is to examine whether desensitization to sex and violence in music videos is rooted in differential autonomic emotional reactions to the content on the part of heavy viewers compared to light viewers.
Emotional processing of media content during exposure could form the basis for latter evaluative reactions to media messages. Research in Cognitive Neuroscience has demonstrated that emotion gets associated with memories formed during exposure to information in the environment (Ledoux, 2000). A dulling of emotional reaction to information could lead to less strong emotions associated with information in memory which in turn could lead to the attitudinal responses found by researchers studying desensitization to sex and violence. A first step to testing this explanation of the desensitization effect for music videos is to examine whether there is dulling of emotional response during exposure brought on by frequent viewing of music videos. Therefore, this study will test the following hypotheses:
H1: Heavy viewers will be less aroused during exposure to violent music videos compared to light viewers.
H2: Heavy viewers will experience less negative emotion during exposure to violent music videos compared to light viewers.
H3: Heavy viewers will be less aroused during exposure to sexual music videos compared to light viewers.
H4: Heavy viewers will experience less positive emotion during exposure to sexual music videos compared to light viewers.
Method
Independent Variables
Violence
Violence was conceptualized as the visual presentation of an act of physical aggression against another human. Violence was manipulated by showing participants videos that had been rated during pre-testing as having a high degree of violence and videos that had been rated as having very little violence.
Sex
Sex was conceptualized as the visual presentation of real or simulated physical activities associated with human sex acts. Sex was manipulated by showing participants videos that had been rated during pre-testing as having a high degree of sex and videos that had been rated as having very little sex.
Dependent Variables
Arousal
Arousal was conceptualized as a dimension of emotion pertaining to how excited or calm a person feels (Lang, Bradley, Greenwald & Hamm, 1993). Skin conductance was measured by assessing participants' skin conductance. Skin conductance was collected for a five second baseline period prior to each video and time-locked to exposure to the music videos.
Emotional Valence
Emotional valence was conceptualized as a dimension of emotion pertaining to how positive or negative a person feels (Lang, Bradley, Greenwald & Hamm, 1993). Emotional valence was measured using facial EMG. Specifically, facial muscle activity was measured in the Zygomatic (smile) and Corrugator (frown) muscles. Facial EMG data was collected for a five second baseline period prior to each video and time-locked to exposure to the music videos.
Stimuli
Music videos for this study were selected in a two stage process. First, the researchers selected 15 videos they believed were high in violence, high in sex and low in both sex and violence. The pool of videos were selected from the music video library of a campus cable television station. This station airs a locally produced weekly music video program so it receives music video service from all the major record labels. The 15 selected videos were pre-tested on 10 undergraduate students enrolled in a communication course. Pre-test participants rated the videos for how prevalent and explicit sex and violence was in each video. Ratings on prevalence and explicitness were collapsed to give each video a gross sex and violence score. Three videos that scored the highest on violence / low on sex, highest on sex / low on violence and lowest on both sex and violence were chosen as stimuli. The nine stimulus videos were edited into three random orders.
Participants and Procedure
Participants were 60 (30 heavy viewers, 30 light viewers) undergraduate students enrolled in a communication course at a large northwestern university. Prior to the experiment 125 students enrolled in the class completed a survey that measured how often they viewed music videos. Students who scored at the extremely high end of the scale (heavy viewers) and students who scored at the extremely low end of the scale (light viewers) were contacted and asked to participate in the experiment. Participants completed the study one at a time in a psychophysiology lab. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were prepped for the collection of physiological data and then given instructions for completing the self-report measures. Self-report measures of perceived sex and violence were obtained for a manipulation check and were asked to indicate if they had seen the video before to control for familiarity. Self-report measures also included attitude toward the video and the arousal and valence dimensions of the SAM scale. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions and then were shown the videos. Participants completed self-report measures between each video and informed the researcher when they were ready for the next video. After completing self-report measures for the last video, participants were thanked and dismissed.

Its objectives were to identify the extent and types of sex discrimination, and to discover factors associated with the discrimination.

Findings are that virtually all respondents have experienced sex discrimination and feel it is prevalent in the industry. In particular, women experienced sex discrimination for story and beat assignments, promotions and training and fellowship opportunities. They were excluded from receiving important information from managers within the newsroom and from sources. They also encountered verbal and physical sexual harassment and age discrimination.

All women working for the 10 national newspapers and three business newspapers in Korea were surveyed. Only four women were editors and 11 were assistant editors. Many talented newswomen felt pressured to leave their newspapers, and many others assume they will not be at their newspaper in five years."
2003-0686,Sexual Intercourse on Television: Do Risk and Responsibility Messages Matter?,Paper,Sexual Intercourse on Television: Do Risk and Responsibility Messages Matter?,"This study contributes to research on the effects of televised sexual content. College students either viewed portrayals of sexual intercourse that also featured safe sex messages (i.e., condom use), sexual intercourse with no safe sex messages, or television programs with no sexual content. The results indicate that sexual intercourse on television can have an impact on peoples attitudes about sexual topics. Women who saw programs with sexual intercourse unaccompanied by safer sex messages later had more negative attitudes about condoms and safe sex than did the women in the other two groups. In contrast, women who saw sexual intercourse coupled with safe sex messages had more positive attitudes about these topics compared to the women in the other two groups. This finding highlights the importance of the context of a sexual portrayal in the effects process. No such findings emerged for men and subjects behavioral intentions to avoid risky sex did not appear to be affected."

While marketing research shows the considerable size of this audience, and their role in the diffusion of new media technologies, research on the effects of explicit content has been conducted primarily on students. Doing so prevents an understanding of the primary consumer of sexually explicit material, why they choose it over other content, and how such choices play out in their professional and personal lives. This paper presents an argument for why research into early adopters should be conducted as well as a framework of questions for what such research should focus on in the future. To accomplish this an overview of the available research on the effects of sexually explicit material is first presented, followed by an examination of early adopters and the characteristics that define them, concluding with a presentation of the links between the two and suggestions for future research."

The importance of the topic is due to the increase in public health concerns regarding rates of teenage pregnancy and AIDS and STD contraction. It is also based on the recognition that television is an increasingly major source of information for adolescents regarding sex and sexuality topics. Two samples were content analyzed: a) a composite week sample of programs (N = 937) randomly selected between October 2001 and March 2002 from the 10 most frequently viewed television channels, and b) an over-sample (N = 237) of primetime broadcast network programming. Results are compared with studies from the 1997/1998 and 1999/2000 television seasons. Results indicate an increase in the television portrayal of sexual messages, and especially sexual behaviors. Although there is a modest increase in the portrayal of risk and responsibility concerns (e.g., AIDS and STDs), these topics are still given only minimal emphasis on television."

Abstract

This paper attempts to critically analyze the media coverage on a possible war with Iraq, proposed by US President George W. Bush in September 2002. To analyze the issue as an international issue, this paper first extensively reviews various salient characteristics of international issues, their media coverage, and public perception. They include the structural limitations of news gathering, various distances or borderlands emphasized or deemphasized in international news, and construction of social sentiment. Based on this review, the latter half of the paper quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes U.S. media coverage on the Iraq issue through three agenda-setting newspapers. The quantitative analysis reveals news stories reliance on U.S. official sources, while relatively marginalizing Iraqi sources, although Iraq would be the most affected location concerned. The qualitative analysis shows how various distances and human agencies are discursively and linguistically emphasized or deemphasized; thus showing support for the U.S. position on the issue."

Coveys The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Through the lens of discursively influenced identity, we focus on the intersection of discourse and organizational practice to explore what characteristics of the enterprise discourse make it so effective at shaping the identities of organization members. We illuminate key characteristics of the discourse of enterprise for identity shaping and organizational control by examining micropractices at SkyWatch, a high-tech, defense-oriented government facility in the western United States. SkyWatch members, in response to Congressional budget cuts, reorganized themselves into a more competitive, market-oriented organization. During this period of change, facility leaders turned to Coveys 7 Habits as a way of teaching trust and character to the members of the SkyWatch workforce. This case thus provides an excellent opportunity to assess the implementation of a specific program of the enterprise discourse and to see what makes this particular discourse successful at shaping organizational identities. Specifically, our findings indicate that Coveys change program shows the simultaneously general and specific nature of value-based identity discourses, blurs the boundaries between the internal and external organization, functions in multiple contexts, and takes on the character of a mandate."

Given a set of descriptions regarding a fictitious target, participants responded privately to the psychological profile task, writing a psychological sketch about the target. In addition, participants indicated in writing what they believed to be the attributes of a prototypical or ideal group member. Participants then discussed the target from the profile task and came to a consensus regarding his character. Information quantity was operationalized as the number of units in the profiles and the responses to the ideal group member question were evaluated for similarity within groups. Multilevel analysis revealed a significant negative main effect for the ideal member prototype, as well as an interaction of the information quantity actor effect with prototype similarity."
2003-0692,Shifting Frontiers: Passing From Computer Literacy Into Computer-Mediated Communication Competency Territory,Paper,Shifting Frontiers: Passing From Computer Literacy Into Computer-Mediated Communication Competency Territory,"Literacy has always been a mark of distinction within our society. Instead of simply describing the ability to read and write, nowadays literacy often refers to technological know-how. However, literacy might not be exactly what communication scholars ought to assess in the technological context. Instead, this research proposes to assess fluency or competency. Also, technological fluency or competency can no longer be limited to computers alone, but must be extended to other technologies, such as email, the web, instant messaging, etc. The research described tested an existing computer-mediated communication (CMC) competency instrument that might fill the existing research gap. Over three applications, the revised instrument proves to be reliable and valid. Also, the research shows that CMC competency is partially due to the medium itself, but partially also due to the context in which the medium is used by an individual and his/her personal criteria in relation to others, and/or the socially constructed reality and meaning in which any CMC interaction takes place."

Specifically, the paper addresses the role of women DJs and their positioning within electronic/dance music (hereafter, E/DM). First, I investigate the marginalization of women in E/DM DJ culture. Second, this paper looks specifically at the functions and purposes of the Sisterdjs listserv for its participants. Ultimately, I argue that the Sisterdjs listserv is an educating and encouraging space for its participants with no offline equivalent. My findings suggest that Sisterdjs is important to the identity construction of female DJs. Collectives such as this one provide support to women who are pursuing interests beyond the borders of their traditional gender roles. Such encouragement and reassurance works to break down beliefs in the necessity and naturalness of performing prescribed gender roles, both within and beyond the borders of E/DM communities."

I employ ethnographic research methods to map the sites and discursive practices linked with lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer activist networks, and various forms of representation of non-normative sexual desires, pleasures and identities that contribute to queer visibility in Slovakia. The examples of such sites include the nongovernmental organizations Ganymedes, Museion, Altera, HaBio, CKKISM and the political initiative Iniciativa inakost, as nodal points of queer activist networks, the mainstream media as a site of normalization and contestation of heteronormativity, and various forms of self-representation revealing and contributing to the processes of non-normative identity and community formation."

A 2x2x2 experimental design was employed to assess reactions to 8 character conditions: (no smoking / smoking) x (low / high social status) x (protagonist / antagonist). Participants were 374 grade 7 and 8 students from Australia. Immediately after viewing the videos, students who saw videos depicting smoking reported higher perceptions of smoking prevalence among men and women than students who did not see videos containing smoking. Significant interactions between movie characters smoking status and social status revealed that attractive high status characters who smoke may promote positive perceptions of the utility of smoking, whereas unattractive, low status characters may detract from the appeal of this behavior. The findings support the proposition that characters who smoke on-screen influence adolescents beliefs about smoking."

This project investigates messages medical students receive through interactions with two important socializing agents: standardized patients and virtual patients. Through in-depth interviews with allopathic (M.D.) students, osteopathic (D.O.) students, and key administrators at both medical schools as well as an analysis of rhetorical artifacts about the formal curricula at both schools, we explored the ideological aspects of medical instruction as constituted and reinforced, perhaps subtly, covertly, and even inadvertently, through the pedagogical practices of using standardized and virtual patients. Our results highlight how these medical students perceive standardized and virtual patient interactions as an opportunity to ""play doctor in a safe environment,"" and confront a primary tension they will face in enacting their professional roles-being cost effective and efficient while also treating ""patients as people."""

With this in mind, this study paper investigated the issue of rebuilding social networks in retirement communities. Data was gathered from a longitudinal study in which participants were administered self-report questionnaires on three occasions spanning from 1997 to 2002. The questionnaires addressed issues of health, recreation, social support, marital satisfaction, computer usage, communication, and satisfaction within the community. Marital satisfaction, state of origin, and eight dimensions of social support were investigated. Results indicated that state of origin had an impact in the rebuilding of social networks at wave two but it had no affect on other waves. Results also showed marital satisfaction had no impact on the rebuilding of social support in wave one but it did have an influence in the various areas of social support at waves 2 and 3. These results, implications, and avenues for future research are discussed."

Participants were approximately 600 adults with workplace e-mail and internet access. They were randomly allocated to a weather forecast condition: standard forecast (no UV), standard forecast + UV, standard forecast + UV + sun protection messages. From late spring through early autumn, participants were e-mailed weekend weather forecasts on Fridays. Each Monday they completed a web-based questionnaire to report weekend sun-related behaviour and sunburn. Participants who received UV forecasts were slightly more likely to report the forecast had prompted them to take more precautions. However for the behavioural measures there were no significant differences between weather forecast conditions in reported hat use, sunscreen use, sun avoidance or sunburn. Results suggest that provision of solar UV forecasts in weather forecasts did not promote markedly enhanced personal sun protection practices amongst the adults surveyed."

It offers an overview of the questions and problems addressed by Habermass project from 1962-2001. Habermass attempt to renew the foundations of social science on a universal theory of communicative interaction fails to free itself from Thomas Hobbess civil science. In failing to formulate a research program capable of empirically corroborated claims concerning social interaction, Habermas is unable to directly address the question of how we overcome Hobbess modeling of just interactions on contractual relations. Consequently, this raises questions as to the adequacy of his proposed social evolutionary response to the fact of pluralism."

The study begins with the unlikely carnival in Taiwan. The 172nd -ranked island, which is famous for both its perennial dominance in Little League baseball and its indifference to soccer, became as crazed as any other country in the world during the soccer games. Other than nationalism, could there exist some other factor triggering this sports fever? To answer the question, this research traces the background of sports culture in different borderlands, such as soccer in Scotland, hockey in Canada, and baseball in Taiwan, in order to determine whether sports is a sheer site of nationalism or just another Trojan horse deployed by capitalism."

By analyzing data from large-scale consumer surveys conducted in three most economically advanced cities, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, this study constructs two consumerist value indices, quality consumption, innovative consumption and attitude toward advertising. It finds that exposure to market-content on media, media advertisements and foreign movies each has a distinct contribution to fostering a more ready acceptance of the two consumerist values and a more positive attitude toward advertising. More detailed analysis shows that different socio-cultural milieu among the three cities play different but still significant roles in enhancing the consumerist values. Implications of the findings and directions for future studies are discussed."

The ethnic minorities are reduced, exploited and appropriated for the purpose of construction of a national unity."

Also at issue is the notion that the law is an autonomous discipline that has no need of contributions from other disciplinary frameworks. After examining several recent court cases that confront this issue, the paper analyzes the conflicting First Amendment standards that may apply in such cases, including the Brandenburg incitement test and First Amendment strict scrutiny. Next, the paper analyzes a variety of philosophical positions on the issue of human free will. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses a number of key questions in the debate and offers suggestions for further research."

After providing an outline of theory and practice informing discourse analysis (especially Conversation Analysis), the author reviews the therapeutic use of this methodology, discusses the externalization of the speakers putative interior through the inspection of their own objectified talk-in-interaction, explains how the speaker-analysts self-perception may be altered by this practice, and enumerates the benefits of transcribing ones own talk-in-interaction."

In order to measure status, a reliable and valid scale was developed in the first study. It was found that the perceived teacher status is a weak predictor of student cognitive and affective learning, teacher evaluation, teacher socio-communicative style and teacher credibility. Students perception of their own status was also found to be a weak predictor of the learning loss, teacher evaluation as well as teacher competence, and trustworthiness. Moreover, status differential between teacher and student was found to be a weak predictor of student affective learning as well as teacher competence. In general, this first studys results show non-linear positive, but weak, relationships of both status and status differential with instructional outcomes.
In order to increase variance found in the first study, the measurement method was changed in the second study to accommodate the direct-magnitude estimate fractionation scaling approach of Barnett, Hamlin, & Danowski (1982). The results demonstrate significantly higher correlations among the variables studied. Status and status differential were found to be significant predictors of student motivation. Further implications of both studies are discussed."

This study explores that question in the framework of gratifications-sought and their relationship both to differential cell phone use and to social connectedness. Based on data from a survey of Taiwanese college students, we found that the cell phone supplements the fixed telephone as a means of strengthening users family bonds, expanding their psychological neighborhoods, and facilitating symbolic proximity to the people they call. Thus, the cell phone has evolved from a luxury for businessmen into an important facilitator of many users social relationships. For the poorly connected socially, the cell phone offers a unique advantage: it confers instant membership in a community. Finally, gender was found to mediate how users exploit the cell phone to maintain social ties."

Specifically, the authors apply a multi-dimensional concept of emotion to include pleasure, arousal and dominance, and examine this construct in relation to the traditional demographic variables of gender, ethnicity and age. The results demonstrate that emotionality conveyed in news photos is stereotypical to a large degree, particularly in relation to females, ethnic minorities and seniors."

This study provides a context for exploring the state of competition in the telecommunication industry, with particular focus on the merger activity facilitated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and subsequent court rulings. Using history as a guide, we profile the present state of concentration in cable and telephony and explore prospects for cross media competition permitted by the Act.
Study results suggest that industry concentration in cable is accelerating rapidly, with the top three firms controlling over 6537777777777f the market. A comparable market share is held by the top two local phone services, which have repeatedly filed lawsuits challenging both the Act and its enforcement. Recent developments, including AT&T's sale of its cable assets to Comcast and the vacating of audience ownership limits, signal a new era of competitive ""detente"" among telecommunication providers. Implications for cross industry competition, between cable and telephone industries as well as local and long distance sectors, are explored."
2003-0711,Stories from the front lines: Insights from university clinic health professionals on preventing the spread of HPV and fighting cervical cancer,Paper,Stories from the front lines: Insights from university clinic health professionals on preventing the spread of HPV and fighting cervical cancer,"Adopting a social marketing perspective, this study investigated insights from health experts at university clinics regarding how to prevent the spread and consequences of HPV among college students. HPV is the fastest growing and second most-prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. It has been identified as a primary cause of cervical cancer, a disease that kills 5,000 women in the United States. Mass media may be able to play an important role in fighting the disease because there is at present no cure and the disease is spread through sexual contact. However any media campaign must take into account the expertise and beliefs of university health professionals, since these individuals work at the ""front lines"" in protecting student health. Our findings suggested areas of broad consensus among these professionals, including beliefs in the high prevalence of the disease and the value of mass media for raising awareness and education. However there was little consensus about other issues of importance for message designers, such as the severity of the disease and the appropriate targets or objectives for message campaigns. A social marketing perspective is used to identify ways in which health messages can be developed that may assist the efforts of our respondents in fighting HPV and cancer."

When the organization stole thunder, journalists rated the practitioner as more credible, but also indicated greater interest in the story. No differences were found across the two conditions in terms of perceptions of crisis severity or framing of news leads written by the journalists. Implications for crisis communication and the ongoing journalist-practitioner relationship are discussed."

between centre and periphery


The paper describes the transformation of contemporary Russian journalism in the natural dichotomy of common trends initiated and set to a great extent from the centre of power in Moscow on the one hand, and specifics pertaining in the regions, on the other. As common trends characterising the post-Soviet society and media we note capitalization, westernization, commercialization and corruption. The specific character was formed by the political and economic conditions pertaining in St. Petersburg as one of 89 subjects of the Russian Federation from the end of the 1990s to the beginning the 2000s. The paper is based on the empirical study on the city media conducted 1998-2001 in St. Petersburg and presented as a licentiate's thesis in spring 2002 at the University of Tampere, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication. The data consists of pilot interviews with eleven experts in 1998, in-depth interviews with thirty journalists in the editorial offices of the eight basic media in 1999 and a survey of eleven experts in 2001. Posing the question how the common trends are converting into the local context the paper describes the forming of the conditions for journalism and its emerging characteristics. On the one hand, the study reveals crucial changes after the decade of reforms, such as the intensive development of informational and advertising services in society and commercialization of media and journalist's labour. On the other hand, the study notes the forces of continuity constituting the past because the media and journalists formerly served rather the interests of the political and economic groups than the interests of public."
2003-0714,Strategic news and political knowledge: a cocktail for political cynicism?,Paper,Strategic news and political knowledge: a cocktail for political cynicism?,"This study investigated the effects of strategic television news coverage of a routine political issue on political cynicism, issue evaluation, and policy support. An experimentally manipulated television news story about the enlargement of the European Union was produced in a strategy and an issue-framed version and embedded in an experimental bulletin of a national news program. Results showed that exposure to strategic news fuelled political cynicism and activated negative associations with the enlargement issue. Politically knowledgeable participants displayed higher levels of cynicism and were more negative in their evaluation. Strategic news did not suppress policy support. A two-wave experimental design with a second post-test was employed to test the longevity of effects. The effects of exposure to strategic news on political cynicism muted between the immediate and delayed post-test suggesting that effects may not persist unless participants are exposed to additional news framed in a similar way."
2003-0715,"Strategies of Illumination: U.S. Network News, Watergate, and the Clinton Affair",Paper,"Strategies of Illumination: U.S. Network News, Watergate, and the Clinton Affair","This study examines the metaphors of publicity which structured U.S. network television news coverage of Watergate in 1973-74 and the Clinton Affair of 1998. Using a qualitative method of metaphoric analysis, this study argues that both during Watergate and the Clinton Affair, the networks understood publicity to be the light of public inquiry. The two sets of coverage, however, differ substantially in the nature of that light. The Watergate coverage gives explicit voice to the metaphor of publicity as a searchlight, an apersonal and disembodied agent of surveillance which illuminates the political in a rational-institutional light. By contrast, the Clinton coverage is implicitly built around a metaphor of publicity as a floodlight, a dramaturgical exposure of the political process which celebrates instead an emotional, personal, and narrativistc frame for the political and a subjective, embodied approach to journalism."
2003-0716,"Structural factors in information system success: Limits and possibilities of project leadership, participation commitment",Paper,"Structural factors in information system success: Limits and possibilities of project leadership, participation commitment","Difficulties in the implementation of information system technologies
This paper will explore questions highlighted by strikingly severe and similar problems organizations face in the implementation of information systems. Clegg, et al, (1998) suggest that up to 801f information system projects do not meet expectations. Similar experiences are reported across time, industry, organizational size and national or cultural boundaries (Clegg, et al, 1998; Martinsons and Chong, 1998; Hirschheim, 1985). Further, scholars reviewing the literature find not only a consistent pattern of disappointment regarding the intentions of those initiating projects, but a fair amount of agreement on basic explanations. Explanations for information system project failures are broadly characterized as social rather then a technical kind (Bjorn-Anderson, 1986; Clegg, et al, 1998; Hirschheim, 1985). In other words, success turns on adaptation of organizational relationships rather then resolving technical glitches.
A key social problem repeatedly pointed to in the literature is the failure of organizations to elicit adequate levels of motivation on the part of the full range of those implicated in the success of a project. Motivation is understood as a question of the willingness or motivation of organizational members to exercise skills and energy in reference to the formal stated objectives of a particular project, i.e., ownership of or identification with the project. Two sorts of motivation are differentiated. Compliance is behavior in response to authoritative directives and regulated by the terms of the employment contract associated with efficacy of organizational functioning within established relationships. Commitment, on the other hand, is associated with organizational innovation and change in relationships. The overall argument made below is that information system implementation projects typically fail because they require some form of relational change undermined by deficits in commitment.
Social influence and project leadership factors in eliciting commitment
Processes of eliciting greater individual commitment - i.e., processes of mutual orientation in coordination of relational change - include participation in the project and social influence processes that lead to support for the project. A key to the latter is project leadership (Rost, 1998). Project leadership in this sense is not leadership typically understood in leadership research  that associated with positions of formal authority (Bush, 1998). Instead, following the social psychology of John S. Turner (1987, 2001) and some leadership theorists (Rost, 1998), it is understood here as situational quality. Situational factors include patterns of mutual identity that form around particular cognitive contents. In other words, leadership is a function of relational dispositions among sets of actors mutually identified or embedded in social processes of meaning formation, or mutual identification  a normative group or cohesive group. Rost (1998) leadership with the ability to impact particular outcomes  relational change through coordination of new mutual visions, beliefs, habits and practices.
Participation is a behavioral role in decision making regarding the project. Participation lends a sense of ownership and identification with the project leading to higher levels of commitment.
Structural parameters for project participation, project leadership and commitment
A review of the literature draws one to two basic organizational structural elements with potential to explain why organizations tend to fail to elicit adequate project leadership, participation, and commitment in projects. One is a particular form of authority relations  hierarchical, command-control structures. Organizational socio-structural factors are identified in grounding hypothesized determinants. One of these is the type of authority structure - centralized, command-control authority structures. These structures create social distance undermining social influence processes and thus the potential support of project leaders. In addition, these authority structures have implications for the role of participation in projects  limiting participation in general, and locating those who participate (and thus who are most likely to be project leaders) in structural locations at greatest social distance from the majority of system users. Those most likely to be project leaders due to overall organizational disposition and opportunity to participate are thus structurally located at greatest social distance from the full range of those implicated in the success of a project. Social distance in light of the heterophilious difference and conflict of interest between hierarchical levels is hypothesized as one foundation for failure of effective ability for project leadership.
Two social influence infrastructures are identified based on relational ties in the organization, in turn tied to types of organizational outcomes. Organizational outcomes are differentiated into relational and instrumental and tied to social influence paths grounded in particular types of relational infrastructures in organizations. Thus, leadership hierarchical ties are associated with relational outcomes, and managerial ties are associated with instrumental outcomes. Deficits in leadership relationships or social influence infrastructures are tied to command-control authority structures that tend to prefer managerial relationships.
A second structural factor examined as a structural foundation understanding levels of commitment towards a project is organizational politics. Organizational politics is understood as informal resources exchange networks within organizations  i.e., political coalitions  that determine or channel organizational resources. Two sorts of key resources are examined regarding information system implementation: Training and participation in decision-making.
In sum, two structural factors  centralized, command-control hierarchy and organizational politics  are examined as common factors that explain patterns of information system success and failure across organizations noted in reviews of the literature.
Data and methods
Data involves attitudinal measures as well as communication network measures before and after the implementation of two major information systems in service corporation in the 1990s. Using social network analysis concepts and techniques (Burkhardt and Brass, 1992), social proximity to project leadership will be modeled as social influence model explaining information project success. Goals are to specify and test constructs derived from speculative conclusions regarding the inhibition of information system success regarding organizational conflict and miss-management of resources due to hierarchical conflict and informal organizational politics. Further, this research develops social information processing theory by using social psychology theory to create and test new indices of normative relational contexts for social influence.

Unfortunately, no systematic method has been developed for reviewing, aiding, organizing and evaluating communication scholarship informed by structuration. This paper proposes such a framework for extant and future uses of the metatheory by communication scholars. Towards this aim, the central goals and elements of structuration are reviewed. Then, an organizational and evaluative framework, informed by these central goals and elements, is developed. Finally, the proposed organizational-evaluative framework is applied to extant structurational theory and research in communication scholarship."
2003-0718,Structure and Agency in Feminist-Media Interactions,Paper,Structure and Agency in Feminist-Media Interactions,"Feminists have produced fundamental challenges to traditional politics around the world. However, the public communication of these issues remains a key challenge for feminism. In this essay I review recent case studies of feminist-news interactions from around the world, including an empirical study of my own, in order to identify some of the shared structures (and agencies) involved in these interactions. Feminist-news interactions are complex and multi-level and I argue that the contradictory mix of containment and publicity that feminism has experienced in the public sphere is the result of feminists uneven success at negotiating different levels of this interaction. Feminists have generally been more successful at negotiating the economic or organizational structures of news  the structures of access  than they have been at countering the discursive rules of news  the structures of representation. Whether this impasse is permanent or negotiable is a critical question for feminist theory and practice."

Our purpose was to investigate students assessments of internal attributions and explanations for teacher anger. Students described instances in which a teacher in college expressed anger in the classroom. Respondents identified the anger as aggressive (e.g., Distributive or Passive) or assertive (e.g., Integrative) and rated the intensity of the expression. Then students attributed causes to the teacher anger, rated the level of appropriateness and identified specific reasons for the teacher anger. Students perceptions of causal attributions and appropriateness were influenced by the way teachers expressed anger. Furthermore, students included both teacher- and student-caused reasons for the anger. Implications of and directions for future research are discussed."

As proposed by Martin (2002), three perspectives to cultural studies, namely, integration, differentiation, and fragmentation were used to review relevant literature. The second half of the paper provided a critique of current study on organizational culture in foreign subsidiaries of MNCs. It was suggested that most studies assumed cultural boundaries as fixed, isolated, and stable, which failed to reveal the complexities involved in todays multinational companies. As a result, we indicated various ways how Martins subjective view of organizational culture as well as her nexus approach to cultural studies could be used to in studying organizational culture in binational or multinational work settings. Directions for future research were also discussed."

I am interested in how cocustody experts use their knowledge to discipline, to dominate, and (in Foucauldian terms) turn human beings into ""docile bodies."" Based on 30 open-ended interviews with coparents in California, United States, I examine how cocustody discourse collides with maternal and paternal discourses and how subjectivity becomes fragmented in new and potentially feminist directions. I find that notions of mothering and fathering are both disciplined and emancipated by cocustody policies."

Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were employed. Eighty-seven South Korean business negotiators responded to a written survey concerning business negotiation practices in South Korea. An additional 26 negotiators and academics participated in in-depth interviews and a mini-conference concerning South Korean culture and the South Korean approach to business negotiations. Definitions of success and failure of business negotiations provided by South Korean negotiators are discussed. Four factors for success and three factors defining failure are identified from the survey data and examined via the interview data. Areas for improvement on the part of South Korean negotiators are identified and discussed.
2003-0723,Successful communication strategies: A test of an integrated framework for effective communication,Paper,Successful communication strategies: A test of an integrated framework for effective communication,"In studies of advertising, many communication strategies have been formulated, but little research is done on how it can be decided what strategy can be used best in a certain situation. In social psychology, models have been developed that specify a number of behavioral determinants. In theory, these models can be used to explain, predict and influence behavior, but scientific proof that persuasive communication based on these models is more effective is almost absent. We will show how knowledge from advertising studies and social psychology can be combined in an Integrated Framework for Effective Communication (IFEC-model). In a study on chocolate bar buying behavior, we will proof that by making use of social psychological models, we can predict in advance which advertising strategy is the most effective. Because the IFEC-model is formulated on a general level, it can be used for many behavioral fields, such as advertising and health communication."
2003-0724,Surviving soccer fever: 2002 World Cup coverage and the (re)definition of Japanese cultural identity,Paper,Surviving soccer fever: 2002 World Cup coverage and the (re)definition of Japanese cultural identity,"In the early summer of 2002, Japan came down with a serious case of sokka feeva (soccer fever). Originating in this countrys first ever co-hosting of the soccer world cup with neighboring Korea, the virus promptly spread through the entire nation. Soon, every aspect of Japanese popular culture, and even of the Japanese physical environment, was somehow inundated with soccer references ranging from huge posters and billboards to magazine covers to world cup comic books or hello kitty dolls. In the muggy days of June, residents of Japanand the thousands of tourists who poured over the nations capital to attend the games hosted in the areawore blue soccer jerseys to the office, ate soccer cup noodles and drank soccer drinks, sang soccer songs at karaoke, used soccer graphics as their cellular phone screen savers and watched the games from home, bars, clubs, work or even the mall. All this in a country where barely ten years ago, the sport of soccer was virtually unheard of (Moffett, 2002).
This paper examines the visual narratives constructed in Tokyo around this historical occasion on various Japanese popular cultural sites including advertising, public relations campaigns, magazine and other print media photographs, and television coverage. I was fortunate enough to watch these narratives unfold as I resided in Tokyo at the time the world cup took place. I am particularly interested here in addressing how Japan visually located itself in relationship to the rest of the world for both a Western audience of tourists and the domestic Japanese audience. I will also examine how Japan managed to turn this foreign sporting event into a specifically Japaneseor at least Asiancultural phenomenon, domesticating Western cultural influence in the process. I believe that Japanese officials and media producers handling of the event is significant because it is illustrative of the larger process through which Japan has forcefully claimed its place as a major player in the global capitalist world order in the past few decades.

Sports in a global environment
Sports play a significant role in the construction of national and/or ethnic identities. Sundeed (2001) points, for instance, to the significance of Little League Baseball in promoting a new Taiwanese identity constructed in opposition to the Peoples Republic of China, even though the sport was originally introduced to help promote reunification. Boyle (2000) analyzes the central position soccer has taken in defining nationhood in the stateless nation of Scotland. As he puts it, At the national level, the Scottish international football team has at times been one of the few collective expressions of a Scottish national identity, (p. 22). Others have noted similar patters in France (Carrard, 2002), East Germany (Magdalinski, 1999), Cameroon (Vidacs, 1999) or Argentina (Alabarces and RodrÌguez, 1999). By allowing fans to engage in highly publicized events deemed of national or international scope, competitions such as the Super Bowl, the World Cup or the Olympics contribute to the creation of the kind of imagined communities Benedict Anderson (1983) considers essential to the development of cultural and national identity.
The types of sports deemed national or at least highly popular in a cultural environment are also reflective of the dominant values promoted in this particular culture at a particular point in time. This is certainly true in the case of Japan, where, at least until this summer, Baseball had been judged the perfect representative of the values of the corporate world, and, hence, the ideal national pastime (Horne, 1999). Japans adoption of soccer, which started being consciously planned by political and business leaders about ten years ago, might thus reflect a shift in this country internal value system from the highly hierarchical seniority-based cooperative ideal of the salariman to the more creative, youth-oriented, initiative-taking character of new entrepreneurs (Moffett, 2002).
But the appearance of soccer on the Japanese popular cultural scene is not just important internally. As numerous scholars have noted, Japanese popular culture cannot be adequately understood outside the context of this countrys long and complex relationship to the West (see for example, Ivy, 1993, 1995, 1989/1997; Hammond, 1987; Najita, 1989/1987). According to John Whittier Treat, the question of Japans popular culture inevitably invites the questions of origins, sources, influences and colonialisms both long-standing and otherwise (1996, p. 4). Indeed, as with many previous cultural importations ranging from Japans educational and media systems (Kato, 1978) to aspects of Judo or of the current Sumo championship system (Inoue, 1998; Thompson, 1998), soccer was consciously brought to Japan from Europe, only to be turned into a Japanese tradition with, in particular, the establishment of the J-league. Foreign managers were hired to train Japanese teams and turn corporate league players concerned with cooperating with and differing to the authority of their elders into competitive risk-taking individuals (Moffett, 2002). Japans selection as a host for the 2002 World Cup demonstrates this countrys ultimate success in importing the sport. The decision to so assertively do so may be indicative of a desire to reframe Japans image both internally and globally. I believe this desire was illustrated in the omnipresent imagery surrounding the World Cup events that took place in Tokyo throughout the summer of 2002.
The following analysis focuses on visual representations of soccer found in Tokyo and its surrounding areas as the World Cup was taking place. Because I strongly believe that Japanese popular cultural texts must be considered in the larger context in which they are distributed and consumed (Darling-Wolf, 2000a), I am not spotlighting one particular text, or type of text, but examining the ensemble of visuals omnipresent in the Japanese capital at the time as Tokyo residents or tourists might have experienced it. In order to do so, posters, billboards and street advertisements were photographed, materials referring to soccerfrom ads to magazine articleswere collected, and television programs and commercials were taped during a seven-week period started in mid-May 2002, shortly before the Cub started, to early July, shortly after it ended. Of course, I cannot claim to have been able to collect all materials referring to the event available at the time. I believe, however, that I was able to gather a representative sample of the type of imagery Japanese soccer fans and foreign tourists were exposed to. A close examination of these materials revealed a number of cultural myths (Barthes, 1972, p. 129) developing around the theme of the World Cup in photographs and other visuals displayed around Tokyo.

Japan as part of the world
One of the most obvious manifestations of sokka feeva in the early summer 2002 was the sudden proliferation of multiracial imagery in the Japanese media. While Western faces are certainly always present on the Japanese popular cultural scene (Darling-Wolf, 2000b; Creighton, 1995), the beginning of the world cup prompted an unprecedented explosion of united colors of soccer imagery in the streets of Tokyo powerful enough to cause residents to walk around with personal renditions of the Disney theme park song Its a small world after all running through their brains. Huge billboards advertising athletic shoes, sports drinks, or even cell phones featured soccer players of various ethnicities and nationalities united by the capitalist endeavor of venting the merits of these products to the Japanese audience. Japanese players were, of course, included in this diverse imagery, suggesting that Japan was one of the teams not only on the soccer field but also in the capitalist world order.
The most literal illustration of this phenomenon was, perhaps, the World Cup public relations campaign that ran in commuter trains until the Japanese teams elimination from the competition. The campaign was composed of series of small posters, similar to those found hanging from the ceiling of most Japanese public transportation, describing various high points in soccer World Cup history. One poster focused, for instance, on the French 1998 victory, another on the Maradona show that brought Argentina its 1986 victory in Mexico, a third on Brazils record-setting forth win in 1994 in the United Stated, all hanging next to each other. Written both in Japanese and English, the campaign seemed to be designed to appeal to foreign tourists as well as Japanese locals. The English language employed in the posters was, however, manipulated to closely resemble the grammatical structure of the Japanese language and consequently be easier for Japanese native speakers to comprehend. This use of Japoglish is a common feature of Japanese advertising written in English to suggest an international flavor but targeted at a domestic audience.
In case the Japanese audience did not feel included enough in the multiracial and multinational world of the campaign, the posters soon started boasting Japanese accomplishments. On the morning of June 15, the day after Japan beat Tunisia in its third World Cup game, several posters dated June 14, 2002as opposed to simply the year employed for other countries victoriespresented highlights from the game. Unlike all the other nations featured in the campaign, Japan had not quite yet won the cup itself. But advancing this far in the competition was reason enough for celebration and for visually locating Japan as one of the winners.
This celebration of Japans mere participation in the event was also illustrated by television commercials featuring Japanese from all walks of life exchanging their shirts, suit, or school uniform coats when encountering each other on the street, as soccer players do after a particularly good game. Numerous Japanese sports fans indeed wore jerseys from teams outside Japan and gathered in bars frequented by foreigners to cheer other nations on. In fact, rather than expressing disappointment after Japans elimination from the cup on June 18 after loosing to Turkey, Japanese fans gathered in Roppongithe area of Tokyo most frequented by foreignerto celebrate. Thus, the visual discourses surrounding Japans hosting of the World Cup stressed Japans involvement in larger world affairs, located Japan as a major player on the international scene, and promoted feelings of unity not only among Japanese, but also between Japanese and members of other nations.

The World Cup as a Japanese event
The emphasis placed in Japanese popular culture on multiculturalism does not mean, however, that Japanese cultural specificity was completely erased from soccer-related imagery during the World Cup. On the contrary, much of this imagery integrated Japanese cultural elements into Japans celebration of international and intercultural exchange. For instance, posters used all over Tokyo to welcome tourists in six different languages, superimposed a soccer ball over a reproduction of the famous wave woodcut print, an immediately recognizable symbol of Japanese traditional aesthetic. Another poster in the same ad campaign used an idyllic representation of Mt. Fuji (photograph included here, but could not submit electronically)


Similarly, much of the imagery designed to promote the event employed the cartoonish features characteristic of Japanese graphic arts heavily influenced by a long tradition of comic books and animation.
Members of the Japanese team, such as Hidetoshi Tanaka and Junichi Inamoto, also became cultural icons whose faces appeared on publications targeted at Westerners as well as Japanese. In fact, most of the coverage of the event turned into a celebration of Japanese popular culturethe youth-oriented culture most representative of the new generation of Japanese likely to claim soccer, as opposed to the more traditional baseball, as their sport. Extremely popular young Japanese celebrity Kimura Takuya was chosen to hosts the coverage of the opening ceremonies for NHK, the Japanese public television channel. Soccer was quickly integrated into Japanese popular culture and Japanese popular culture integrated into soccer.
As soon as the Cup started, the famous Sanrio charactersfrom Hello Kitty to Badzmaruwho have contributed to the spread of the Japanese kawairashiisa craze to the rest of the world, started to sport the colors of the Japanese team, along with more indigenous characters such as the robot cat Doraemon or the fuzzy king of the forest from one of the most celebrated childrens movies, Totoro. This integration of soccer into all aspects of Japanese popular culture served to turn the World Cup 2002 into a Japanese event. While Japan shared the limelight with Korea, and while this cooperation was generally recognized in official materials, the colors of the J-team very much dominated the spectrum of media coverage in Japan. Even Cookie Monster, Elmo and Big Bird opted not to support their home teams and donned blue and white jerseys.

Domesticating foreign culture
Indeed, cultural imports also fell victim to the Japanese strand of sokka feeva that struck Tokyo in the early summer. Either claimed as Japanesesuch as the Sesame Street characters mentioned aboveor presented as being on Japans side, foreigners and their cultural manifestations were effectively and safely integrated within the Japanese popular cultural environment in the visual discourses surrounding the World Cup. For instance, foreign soccer players were not only used to advertise products all over Japan, but they were often used to advertise Japanese products. Representations of foreigners also typically erased territorially grounded references to cultural environments outside Japan. While Tanaka was photographed with a smiley Caucasian boy in what seemed to be the street of a European country for a cell phone ad, foreign players were posed against a colored, or at least culturally neutral background. Displayed in the streets of Tokyo, these deterritorialized images of foreign playersoften accompanied by Japanese typographic elementsvery much became an integral part of the Japanese visual environment.
Foreign players were also available for purchase in the form of small plastic figurines sold at every corner store, or distributed for free with various soft drinks (some of them were even part of the bottle cap). These mini-players came equipped with a short bibliography identifying their name and the team/country they played for. Fans who drink a lot of soda were encouraged to collect them all.
Even potentially more disturbing aspects of foreign culture were similarly commodified and domesticated on the Japanese popular cultural scene. While Japanese officials occasionally expressed concern over foreigners (mis)behavior in their public relations campaignsone poster seen at every train station suggested, in English, lets safely enjoy the World Cup together and offered advice on appropriate behaviorother popular cultural texts celebrated the exotic darker side of Western touristic invasion. One Japanese magazine titled Furigan (the Japanese pronunciation of hooligan, as violent British soccer fans are known) provided advice on how to develop an authentic furigan style. One could even use the magazine to order small furigan figurines similar to those featuring the players, but sporting blood stains and angry expressions instead. Once turned into plastic representations to be collected by excited high school girls, however, these shady foreigners lost much of their threatening character.

Conclusion
The soccer World Cup and other sports events of international significance provide a fascinating terrain for the study of the construction of national identity. The imagery surrounding Japans first hosting of the cup created a visual discourse of international friendship and multiculturalism in which Japan was promoted as a major player. Not only was Japan presented as an important participant in this world eventand hence in world events in generalbut the event itself was turned into a Japanese-style celebration of commodified global cultural integration.

But when America finally proved ready for strong female personalities, that was precisely what female cartoonists delivered. Despite overarching similarities between many women cartoonists, who have incorporated a particular brand of humor distinctive from the mainstream (i.e. male-dominated) cartooning world, Nicole Hollanders Sylvia offers a unique case study. Sylvia, named after the strips brassy main character, began within the frames of The Feminist Funnies, a weekly comic published in The Spokeswoman in the late 1970s. The strips move from Spokeswoman to magazines such as Mother Jones and Ms. and finally to national dailies such as the Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune tells the story of not only a comic strip, but a movement incorporating itself into a realm that historically marginalized women. Sylvia is a microcosm of developments simultaneously transpiring within the second-wave feminist movement."

As technical organizations, schools are accountable to both internal and external constituencies. As institutions, they rely on the publics support of the system for legitimizing their existence. This paper examines that conflict. Following an application of institutional change principles laid out by Meyer and Rowan (1983), this study examines the implementation of the TAAS test in the Texas education system. From a review of public information from the TEA and news reports from the initial year of testing in 1990 up to 1999, public communication in the popular press is examined as it serves as the border between resistance and legitimization. A model is developed to explain the pattern that emerges from this review, and a metaphor of inoculation is proposed to explain the model more fully."
2003-0727,Taiwan as a Borderland in the Flow of Culture: Globalization and the Book Market,Paper,Taiwan as a Borderland in the Flow of Culture: Globalization and the Book Market,"Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to challenge the prominent association of globalisation with Westernisation. This argument is developed through a case study of the Taiwanese publishing industry. The publishing industry in Taiwan, for example, deeply influenced though it is by the West, forbids a simple equating of globalization with Westernization, such as the conventional literature assumes. On the contrary, it reflects a complex series of interactions with other Chinese language markets.
In studying how globalization influences the publishing industry in modern Taiwan, I consider Taiwanese publishing in the global market, and the publishing of other countries in the Taiwanese market. In particular. I focus on four areas: the cultural flow of publishing, the relationship between globalization and language, publishing and technology, and the production process in the global market. To do so, I critically review the relevant literature and gauge the complexity of cultural flows when Taiwanese books cross borders. The four areas are reviewed from theoretical perspectives, using empirical data from interviews, concerning, for example, the cultural flows between the publishing industry in Taiwan and global markets, traces of cultural imperialism within these cultural flows, and the hybridization process in the publishing industry.
This paper examines the complexity of the cultural flows of books as they cross borders and questions the theoretical assumptions of Globalization and Westernization. It also presents evidence that communication between East and West through books can build a relationship of cooperation, and can improve the understanding between East and West beyond any relationship involving cultural imperialism."

Mainstream Media Coverage of Anti-Global Capital Protests
Abstract Submitted to the International Communication Association 2003 Conference

This paper examines mainstream media coverage of events staged by global capitalists at the turn of the twenty-first century and the protests consistently mounted against them. It begins with the ""Battle of Seattle"" in the winter of 1999, when 70,000 people shut down a meeting of the World Trade Organization. Over the next two years, scores of protests against global capitalism were mounted at similar gatherings in the United States and around the world, including Washington D.C., New York, Philadelphia, Porto Alegre, Madrid, Barcelona, Goteburg, Davos, Salzburg, London, Paris, and Genoa. The Big Media could not ignore these protests, but they did strive to symbolically contain them. As one participant-observer told In These Times, ""Most of what has been written is so inaccurate that I cant decide if the reporters in question should be charged with conspiracy or simply incompetence.""
This paper combines textual analysis with political economy to examine the specific strategies employed by the media to symbolically contain the protests. These strategies include the depiction of anti-globalization activists as a fractious and disparate lot with too many different causes and internal conflicts to sustain a unified movement, and a focus on the police as a highly trained and disciplined force whose difficult job it was to protect people and private property by outwitting protesters. I believe the topic is particularly relevant to the theme of the 2003 ICA conference, ""Border Crossings,"" both because it combines political economy with textual analysis and because it examines media coverage of the peoples attempts to ""crash the gates"" of parties of the wealthy and powerful throughout the world."

We found three dominant ideological themes within the five films of the Star Wars saga. Acknowledging that Lucas operates from a United States of America ideological system, the first theme was that entertainment serves as an ideological state apparatus to educate the masses on the importance of democracy and rationality. Second, religious ideology is a dominant ""Force"" in the films. Using prominent Christian mythology, Lucas uses religious symbolism thought the telling of his saga. Finally, we found that revolt was likely precipitated not by the commoner as Marx suggests, but by a fallen elite classthe Jedi Knights."

Both organizations sought to justify their decisions in terms of professional norms, particularly in expressing their autonomy of news judgment. However, as geopolitical actors, the networks faced far different structural considerations. Al-Jazeera, which still depended on the sponsorship of the emir of Qatar, had to weigh the consequences of its decision on its reputation as an emerging independent network. The networks varied strategies reveal the gamesmanship inherent in global mass communication and suggest as well that audiences are gaining the potential for more complex understandings."

2003-0733,Technical Convergence in a Public Bureaucracy: Cultural Change,Paper,Technical Convergence in a Public Bureaucracy: Cultural Change,"This paper offers empirical grounding for a theory of organizational culture based on the simultaneous enactment of fragmentation, differentiation, and integration during organizational change. It has as its site an information-technology organization at a large western university. This public bureaucracy merged three, disparate, high-technology cultures to provide integrated computer and telecommunication services for its campus. Part of a two-year case study, this paper makes three contributions to our understanding of organizational cultural change. First, cultural change in the high-technology, public bureaucracy studied exhibits similar patterns to private-sector, high-technology organizations undergoing change. Second, the merged, independent technical cultures studied handle the tensions resulting from a mandated consolidation by reproducing their subcultures while adopting new organizational outcomes. Third, the behaviors of the members studied lend support to the claim that full integration or consensus is not a necessary feature of a productive culture. In the organization studied, a discourse of communication enabled the simultaneous development of an integrated culture and the reproduction of the subcultural identities within the context of technological evolution of services."
2003-0734,TECHNOLOGY AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF TELEWORK PRACTICES: THE CASE OF BROADBAND,Paper,TECHNOLOGY AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF TELEWORK PRACTICES: THE CASE OF BROADBAND,"Although empirical studies of teleworking as a fluid work practice in organizations provide little or no support for the claim that the availability of telecommunications technology drives either organizational or individual decisions to telework, broadband (high-bandwidth computing) is increasingly predicted to transform organizations and the nature of work. In a related vein, extant literature on telework has largely failed to examine how people work when they work at a distance (Bailey & Kurland, 2002). Drawing on interviews conducted with 46 teleworkers, this study investigates how workers' teleworking practices interrelate with other elements of the social-technological system, in particular, relationships with the organization, with coworkers, and with available technology. We use this information to consider the burgeoning relationship between broadband and work practices in organizational settings. We conclude by identifying opportunities in teleworking for increasing demand for broadband services."
2003-0735,"Technology, Contracts, and the Internet: Private Governance for Global Communications",Paper,"Technology, Contracts, and the Internet: Private Governance for Global Communications","One of the most persistent claims about the Internet has been its unregulability. In cyberspace it is allegedly impossible to make enforceable rules about users' online activities. As a network of networks based on packet-switched communications operating under the TCP/IP protocol, it has been understood that the Internet's inner workings render impossible central control, the identification of users, and, ultimately, punishment for misbehavior. Furthermore, as a global communication system whose functionality immediately connects individuals from around the world, the Internet's ubiquity allegedly creates an insurmountable thicket of institutional conflicts. With so many governments' jurisdictions overlapping in cyberspace, no one's law is supreme. Thus control - the ability to unilaterally influence user activities - and governance - coherent rulemaking for cyberspace as a whole - have both been understood to be impossible. The result -- often praised, sometimes cursed -- is an ""electronic frontier"" in which great freedom and even lawlessness prevail.

For better or worse, this claim of unregulability is mistaken. The claim about insurmountable technical barriers to control rests on an incomplete understanding of Internet technology. The Internet consists of more than a network of networks based on packet switched communications. It also includes the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a highly centralized addressing system and which is essential to nearly all Internet communication. The DNS provides a central point from which to control user behavior.

Likewise, the claim of insurmountable institutional barriers to governance rests on an incomplete understanding of law and jurisdictions. True, the public laws made by governments clash in cyberspace. However, private law - the law of contracts -- can operate across borders. Private law provides a means by which to promulgate global regulation of Internet activities. An arrangement in which every user signed a contract with a central private entity would give that private entity the power of a global regulator. Since its early days the administrative subsystem within the DNS has required every operator of an Internet identifier (domain name) to sign a contract.

Realization of global regulation through the DNS is no longer hypothetical. In 1998 the DNS was placed under the authority of a private corporation: ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is a private, non-profit entity whose official mandate includes the control of the DNS. Its decisions are subject to review by the United States government, which must approve of major ICANN decisions before they are implemented. Nonetheless, with its ability to control users and to promulgate global, contract-based rules, ICANN realizes the capabilities of Internet regulation.

I offer here a detailed analysis of how Internet governance is realized by ICANN. My purpose is to render comprehensible the interrelationship between technology, administration, and governance, explaining how a computer network addressing system makes regulation possible. To do this I define regulation, control, and governance, and I analyze the Internet's domain name system (DNS). Then I explain how the former are realized through the latter. I touch on, but do not analyze in any great depth, the substance of the regulations promulgated to date and whether they are good or bad

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I examine whether this new system of regulation is legitimate. Although any assessment of absolute legitimacy is problematic, ICANN clearly lacks most of the common mechanisms to ensure representation of relevant views, accountability to outside parties, and transparency in its operations. As a result, the organization's continued existence depends on its success in global power politics. It seems likely that its organizational form will continue to evolve until powerful interests reach a stable equilibrium and embody that equilibrium in ICANN's institutional design. ICANN could also fracture or fail if a rival institution should be able to win the support of sufficient number of influential parties. In other words, ICANN's lack of legitimacy makes it vulnerable to rather crude power politics.

ICANN is significant not only for the Internet but for global governance generally. As an emerging new institutional form it can be characterized in three ways, depending on the significance accorded the roles of the US government and the private corporation. The first view emphasizes US hegemony. Here, the private corporation can be understood as the mere agent of the US through which the US embodies its commands in contract law so as to circumvent other nations' sovereignty. US global hegemony is achieved through private law. Second, ICANN may be characterized as a semi-independent regulator in which powerful private entities make global rules for cyberspace. In this view, the US possesses unique veto rights but does not really control ICANN. Third, should the US act on its public commitment to grant ICANN its independence, ICANN would represent a new kind of private sovereign. In a manner similar to how the private International Olympic Committee controls those global games, ICANN would control cyberspace.

Among three indicators of liberalization, competition shows the most robust effects on network expansion both telephone and cellphone subscribers. The effects of privatization and regulatory independence on network expansion are divergent between developing countries and advanced economies of the APEC countries."
2003-0738,Telehospice: Supporting the Well-Being of Caregivers in Rural Areas,Paper,Telehospice: Supporting the Well-Being of Caregivers in Rural Areas,"Caregivers often feel isolated and experience stress from balancing caregiving, work, and other family responsibilities (Caregiving, 2002). Telemedicine, the use of telecommunication technologies to deliver health services over a distance, may be one means of alleviating the stress on caregivers.

Researchers found that perceived social support is correlated with caregiver quality of life. Furthermore, caregivers reported that although they have a social support network in place, very little respite care and support from extended family is available. Although pilot projects have shown that patients and physicians feel telehospice is a beneficial service, caregivers are hesitant to use telecommunication technologies for their own support.

The researchers conclude that for telehospice to be successful in enhancing social support of caregivers in rural areas, a significant education component from hospice providers is necessary to illustrate benefits of the service for caregivers, and policy needs to be enacted to provide telehospice services to caregivers."

Data were collected for 18,771 days of domestic violence, and game-related variables were collected for 794 games. Three analyses were conducted looking at structural, competitive, and dispositional variables. The first analysis showed that there was no unmediated relationship between football and domestic violence. After controlling for seasonal and weekday variations, two further analyses revealed a complex relationship. The Super Bowl was found to be associated with an increase in domestic violence similar to that of many other holidays. Finally, a latent effect was found for games expected to be especially close. As has been seen with homicides after prize fights and single-auto fatalities after heavily publicized suicides, domestic violence incidents significantly increased three days after games expected to be especially close. This relationship diminished as ones home team was expected to blow out -- or be blown out by -- the other team."

I examine and critique both anti television campaigns, launched by organizations around the nation and which are based on extensive media research which holds that television has tangible (and negative) effects on its viewers, as well as the pro campaigns, the fan-based efforts aimed at reinstating cancelled shows, positioning these campaigns as the activity of emotionally invested audience, rooted in an approach which views fans as producers of culture as well as consumers of it."

Survey data showed four taste cultures: clusters liked by old and disliked by younger people and vice versa; a lowbrow style disliked by higher educated informants, and a highbrow style unknown to lower educated informants. Interview materials are used to understand the mechanisms behind this asymmetric pattern of knowledge and dislike, and to answer the more general question how television can sustain a taste hierarchy like this, with one taste culture exclusive to high status viewers. Taste, it will be argued, has to be understood not only as a pattern of preferences and aversion, but as a form of cultural knowledge. This cultural knowledge varies between groups, in nature and amount, and is crucial in the perpetuation of taste hierarchies"

Results indicate news viewing increases both estimates of crime frequency and frequency of crime-related warnings, but does not influence fear for family members. Also, parents' estimates of crime frequency moderate the relationship between news viewing and warning frequency.
Data are interpreted to indicate an indirect effect of parents viewing habits on children's socially constructed reality about crime. The utility of investigating the influence of media on interpersonal communication topics is emphasized. Results are discussed in light of cultivation theory and heuristic processing."
2003-0743,"Television, Materialism, and Civic Engagement",Paper,"Television, Materialism, and Civic Engagement","Numerous scholars have sought to explain the underlying process behind Robert Putnams (2000) claim that television is responsible for much of the decline in American social capital over the last half-century (Shah, 1998; Uslaner, 1998). This analysis provides an empirical test of one such possible mechanism: materialism as an intervening variable. Given past literature indicating that a causal relationship exists between television viewing and materialism (Churchill and Moschis, 1979) and between materialism and social capital (Rahn and Transue, 1998), this analysis proposes that the relationship between television viewing and social capital can be explained through televisions effects on materialism, and materialisms effects on social capital, measured here in terms of civic engagement. Results suggest that not only does materialism fail to explain the effects of television viewing on civic engagement, but materialism, as operationalized in these analyses, is actually positively associated with civic engagement."
2003-0744,Television Station Ownership Characteristics and News and Public Affairs Programming: An Expanded Analysis of FCC Data*,Paper,Television Station Ownership Characteristics and News and Public Affairs Programming: An Expanded Analysis of FCC Data*,"*Top Three Paper, Communication Law and Policy Division

This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between television station ownership characteristics and the provision of local news and public affairs programming. The core data for this analysis come from the FCC's recent analysis of the programming practices and performance of Big Four broadcast network affiliates in which at least one (but not all) of the affiliates is a network owned and operated station. For this study, these station data were supplemented with additional data on market and station characteristics. The results support the FCC's conclusion that networked owned and operated stations provide more combined local news and public affairs programming than other affiliates, and that stations with an ownership interest in newspapers provide more combined local news and public affairs programming than stations with no newspaper holdings. However, the results also indicate that the predictors for local news programming are different than those for public affairs programming, and that a variety of market and station characteristics are of equal or greater importance than O&O status and newspaper ownership."
2003-0745,Terrorist images: The construction of Arabs as enemies,Paper,Terrorist images: The construction of Arabs as enemies,"Abstract
A textual analysis of the three main speeches and a prayer service/memorial President George W. Bush delivered subsequent to the September 11, 2001 bombing of the World Trade Center and Pentagon, show how word choices reconstitute, reinforce, and rigidify an agreed upon evil monolithic Arab stereotype. Spillman and Spillman's (1997) model of enemy image construction was applied to this rhetoric, showing how the use of particular language related to Christianity, God, good versus evil, and evil doers, has a powerful connection to deeply entrenched beliefs in dichotomies built upon a long history of mass media (mis)representations of all Arabs as Muslims, all Muslims as Arab, and now all Muslim/Arabs as terrorists. The findings have important civil rights implications for Arab Americans who have been victimized following the disaster as well as for other groups of Americans who have been similarly oppressed."

This experiment measures source credibility and the differences in priming effects between print and video messages. The analysis of variance shows a significant difference in attitude changes among different groups pre-exposed to priming cues using different media. Results suggest using video to communicate information is more effective in priming than using print and that using the combination of video and print may lead to relatively unfavorable attitudes towards the priming message."

To test this, participants were made to believe that their opponent in a computer game of air hockey was a human or a computer agent. With this manipulation we had predicted that a positive evaluation by a human would be considered more accurate than a positive evaluation by a computer. The data amply support this prediction. We had also predicted that respondents would resist a negative evaluation by a human more than they would a negative evaluation by a computer, in an effort to save face. The data, however, do not support this contention. The viability of social presence as an explanatory mechanism was examined. The results were encouraging, though not overwhelmingly in favor of a strong role of social presence, at least in the form in which it is conceptualized in this paper."

To accomplish this, viewers' construct mental representations of the movie as the movie unfolds. This focus on the understanding - or coherence - of a movie, and on the cognitive representation that under girds it is central to the mental models approach. This study tested the ability of the landscape model of text-comprehension to predict the mental representation that results from watching a clip from an animated T.V. show. In addition, the landscape models predictions for what people would recall from the story were tested. Overall, the results of the study were supportive of the landscape model. Future directions are discussed"
2003-0749,The 2000 presidential primary campaign and exposure to the newer media,Paper,The 2000 presidential primary campaign and exposure to the newer media,"Cable television news channels and online news sites appear to offer interested voters the ability to follow the presidential election campaign more closely than ever before. However, survey research looking at the extent to which Americans are taking advantage of these newer media is incomplete. Rarely is new media use adequately assessed in surveys, and no extant study has simultaneously examined exposure to contemporary news channels over the course of several weeks. The present study uses an aggregate-level analysis of naturally-occurring news consumption behavior to determine whether public selection of broadcast news programs, cable news channels, and online news outlets follows the primary election schedule and fluctuations in voter interest in the election. The results suggest that cable and online news exposure are more responsive to voter interest in the election than is broadcast news exposure. In addition, the data reveal that newsreaders from across the country use the World Wide Web to gather election information from sites of newspapers located in states holding primary elections. The study demonstrates that aggregate-level use of the newer media is responsive to changes in the political environment. Audiences have a growing number of options for finding information about politics, and they seem willing to take advantage of these new opportunities."
2003-0750,The academic call center: Reconceptualing a complex learning environment,Paper,The academic call center: Reconceptualing a complex learning environment,"Call centers are a fast growing segment of the telecommunications industry. Research of call centers has explored issues including the work practices (Pentland, 1992), organizational structure (Kinnie, Hutchinson, & Purcell, 2000) and surveillance methods of this industry (Bain & Taylor, 2000); yet most studies have overlooked an examination of how interaction with technologies create call center work as a complex task. This study looks at the ways in which an information technology call center within a large Western University operates as a complex workspace. Using communities of practice theory (Wenger, 1998), the study illustrates the ways in which workers make sense of workspace, rules, interaction, task and technology. In contrast to the common view that call center work is autonomous and individual, we argue there are possibilities for viewing the call center as a collaborative learning environment. Communities of practice, as a social learning theory, allows us to see the ways in which call center employees not only make sense of the work processes through the workspace, rules, interaction, task and technology, but they also continue to learn about their jobs and each other."

It paints the sense of the world of adolescence and the sense(s) to facilitate moving around in that world. It produces an effective terrain that can be occupied by what I call the adolescent body. Watching The Matrix is to become that body in those sensations, and through those sensations a very particular space is organized within which that body moves.

The circumstances surrounding the Civil War led to the birth of blues music, which was created to do the cultural work of an oppressed people. The same music can serve women to take back control of their sexuality and to gain empowerment to reverse the conditions of the American burqa. Two songs are offered as examples of the role the blues can play in asserting personal identity and revealing desires that include celebration of ones sexuality. By creating dialog and making connections, the blues reveals the hypocrisy of patriarchal society to be replaced by the multiplicity of real people."
2003-0753,The AOL Time Warner CCTV (China) television exchange: Guanxi in globalization theory,Paper,The AOL Time Warner CCTV (China) television exchange: Guanxi in globalization theory,"This paper examines the historic agreement between AOL Time Warner and China Central Television (CCTV) to exchange television channels. In October 2001, AOL-TW and CCTV signed an agreement giving the former landing rights in Guangdong Province. The deal marked the first time the Chinese government had allowed a foreign entity to retain control of content in a legal broadcast to the general public on the mainland. In exchange, AOL-TW agreed to put CCTVs English-language channel, CCTV-9, on cable in New York, Los Angeles and Houston. The paper uses globalization theory to examine the different understandings of the agreement each side brings to it. The paper finds that focus on the transnational dimension to the neglect of the national dimension of globalization is inadequate to account for the agreement. The paper suggests that Manuel Castells globalized understanding of the concept of guanxi clarifies the relationship the two parties are forging."

The AIT that is used in this paper is a corporate yellow pages. Corporate yellow pages are homepages on the intranet of organizations that describe competences, tasks, etc. of employees. A search through these pages is initiated with a who knows question, making it possible to identify knowledge of unknown employees. The paper argues that the same influences on the provision of content can be distinguished as postulated by Adapative Structuration Theory. This theory was developed to explain the influences on the use of an AIT. However, in some cases AIT can be used in two ways. Once when providing information to the technology (e.g., filling out a yellow page) and once when using information from the technology (e.g., using yellow pages to find a knowledgeable colleague). Structural equation modeling was used to see whether the influences on appropriation as proposed by AST were operating in the appropriation of content in Yellow Pages. The model is partly supported by the results."

Abstract

This study marks a first step towards examining individuals experience of emotional dissonance and the potentially moderating influence of their social identity (i.e., role and organizational identification) and the perceived solicited and unsolicited social support they receive from peers and supervisors. A survey questionnaire was used to address a series of hypotheses and research questions regarding teachers perceptions of their emotional labor and the extent to which their identifications (both role and organization) and perceived social support mitigate the negative consequences commonly associated with feelings of emotional dissonance. Results indicate that role identification significantly moderated the relationship between emotional dissonance and perceived (in)authenticity of oneself. No moderator effects were found for organizational identification. Although solicited and unsolicited support, from both peers and supervisors, did not moderate the relationship between emotional dissonance and any of the dependent variables, the interactions between emotional dissonance, job satisfaction and peer solicited support and emotional dissonance, job satisfaction and advisor unsolicited support did approach significance. Limitations and future directions are also discussed."
2003-0756,The Association of Experienced Spousal Support with Marital Satisfaction,Paper,The Association of Experienced Spousal Support with Marital Satisfaction,"Considerable research suggests that social support is one of the most important provisions of the marital relationship and is an important determinant of marital satisfaction. To date, however, research exploring linkages between spousal support and marital satisfaction has not systematically examined whether some types of social support (e.g., emotional, informational, tangible) are especially strong correlates of marital satisfaction. In addition, it is not currently known whether the magnitude of the association between different types of spousal support and marital satisfaction varies as a function of factors such as sex and nationality. Thus, the present study was conducted to determine the types of spousal support most strongly associated with marital satisfaction and whether these associations vary with gender and culture. Participants (100 recently married Americans and 102 recently married Chinese) completed instruments providing assessments of marital quality, dyadic adjustment, and five types of experienced spousal support (emotional, esteem, informational, network, tangible). Despite certain measurement problems, results indicated that spousal emotional support was clearly the strongest correlate of marital satisfaction, and that the magnitude of this association does not vary as a function of gender or culture. Implications of the findings are discussed, as are directions for future research."
2003-0757,The Blackboard in the Classroom: Evolving Genres and the Metaphorical function of Instructional Technologies,Paper,The Blackboard in the Classroom: Evolving Genres and the Metaphorical function of Instructional Technologies,"Electronic instructional and communication technologies are seen as engines for institutional reforms and powerful agents for the development of distance education programs. Similarly, discussion on the recent introduction and proliferation of web-based course management tools like Blackboard, WebCT and Prometheus have tended to focus on their potential to change institutions of higher education by facilitating distributed or distance learning. However, in order to gain further insights on web-based courseware and its adoption and use, it is insufficient to examine its features and functions. This paper argues that instructional technologies should be analyzed in context from the historical and organizational environ from which they emerge. Using structuration theory as a macro theoretical lens and applying complementary theoretical concepts of the genre and metaphor in organizational settings, this research addresses the mutual shaping of educational technologies and traditional institutions of higher education. The empirical focus is a case study that investigated the changing perceptions of the classroom and work practices of teachers using Blackboard, an electronic course management software in an institution of higher education. Results illustrate the various changes in the classroom meeting genre as the main genre of the course as instructors shaped and reconstructed their practices, rules, norms and expectations. The empirical evidence also sheds light on the role and metaphorical function of Blackboard on the adoption and pedagogic innovation of the technology. Finally, implications for future research are discussed."

Regarding the first focus, the starting point is the current necessity of understanding the part that this Clubs have as social actors inside the urban ways to communicate and to consume; on the other hand, these associations present characteristics that allow to include their study inside the social movements related with gender and cultural feminism.
Here the theoretical boarding is presented starting from the proposal on production and cultural consumption of the French sociologist Pierre Bordieu, presented in two of its books: The Rules of the Art and The Distinction; as well as the perspective of Berger and Luckmann in The Social Construction of the Reality. The empiric data is based on the observation carried out in several Book Clubs in the city of Guadalajara, Mexico, specifically one of the oldest: the Rosario Castellanos, during a three year period.
Inside these groupings of rich women it has been possible to observe a dynamic that presents two simultaneous processes: on one hand, they reproduce the habitsinduced by a social system that has transformed them in promoters of an elitist cultural consumption; on the other hand, the group interaction as well the reading is provoking changes in their perception towards the women world, therefore they are becoming aware of their oppressed situation."

Specifically, we analyzed news content and editorials in the New York Times and Washington Post, with two goals: (1) to examine the language of U.S. government and military leaders in discussing expectations, i.e. goals and challenges, for the war on terrorism, and (2) to explore whether these leaders messages were followed by discernible patterns in the editorial content of the Times and Post, the nations leading news outlets for national and international affairs. Our evidence is suggestive of the influence a presidential administration  or at least this one, in this moment of national crisis  can have upon the voices of news media."
2003-0760,The CNN Effect: The Origins and Development of a Misguided Concept,Paper,The CNN Effect: The Origins and Development of a Misguided Concept,"This study investigates the decade long effort to construct and validate a communications concept of international relations, which asserts that global television networks, such as CNN and BBC World, have become the decisive actor in determining policies and outcomes of significant events. The article traces the origins and development of this concept, known also as the CNN effect, and critically analyzes major academic and professional publications that have sought to explain it. These publications include theoretical and comparative works, specific case studies, and methodologies. The study reveals an ongoing debate among politicians, government officials, journalists, and scholars, on the validity of this theory. This article concludes that studies have yet to present sufficient evidence validating the CNN effect, that many works have exaggerated this effect, and that the focus on this concept has deflected attention from other ways global television affects mass communication, journalism, and international relations. The paper also proposes an agenda for research on the various effects of global television networks."
2003-0761,The concept Wakimae in Japanese: A case study of an implicit theory of interaction among Japanese,Paper,The concept Wakimae in Japanese: A case study of an implicit theory of interaction among Japanese,"In this short essay, a particular Japanese term, wakimae, is investigated aiming to develop the concept as a theoretical construct within the framework of face-to-face interaction and investigate a unique nature of face-to-face interaction in the Japanese culture. This type of emic research is expected to contribute not only to a better understanding of an implicit theory of interaction in Japanese culture, but also to the different type of cross-cultural studies (i.e., the etic approach). That is, the relative conceptualizations of related communication concepts to wakimae (e.g., politeness), which is often assumed to be absolute or universal across cultures, can be better understood and, in turn, can be validly re-defined as an analytic tool for the future comparative studies. In this paper, a case study is reported that explores the folk knowledge of the concept among the Japanese speakers. The preliminary analysis of the data revealed that the concept wakimae involves a wide range of interactional factors that are expected to guide ones behavior in general or specific situations. Specifically, it was found that wakimae is specifically conceptualized as ones keen sensitivity to or capability of correctly/effectively assessing such factors as a) situational context, b) situational limit/risk, c) the partners physical or mental status, d) ones own social status/role, e) ones own personal limits/characters, f) manner/rules, g) morals/ethics, h) common sense, and i) natural laws/reasons. These interactional factors were seen to guide both volitional (e.g., goal-oriented, task-oriented, strategic, etc.) and non-volitional behavior (e.g., obligatory language use, ritualistic behaviors, rule-governed behaviors in specific events, etc.). Also, the data suggested that the concept becomes an issue if the lack of wakimae in a behavior is expected to cause socially or interpersonally negative consequences, which might endanger a) the success of the social event/group, b) the success of the individual, c) the interpersonal relationship, d) the social relationship, and/or e) the actors own impression."
2003-0762,The Constitutional Right To Anonymous Association in Cyberspace,Paper,The Constitutional Right To Anonymous Association in Cyberspace,"This paper explores the constitutional right to anonymous association in cyberspace. It analyzes case law to explore the right to anonymous association in the offline world and the right to anonymous association in the online world. It also explores the viability of constitutional protection for anonymous association in cyberspace. The case law analyzed in this paper demonstrates that the right to anonymous association is so closely linked to the right of speech. When the right to anonymous association was endangered, the ability to exercise First Amendment rights was also endangered. The case law also suggests that the importance of this unalienable relationship increases in cyberspace since associational use of anonymity and expressive use of anonymity combines in most online communication."

We question the dominant emphasis on consensus as a preferred outcome. In an empirical study, we analyze 1,360 postings from three pedagogical discussions devoted to issues of race and popular/elite culture. Our analysis focuses not on outcomes but on verbing micro-practices -- dynamic communicative actions through which participants make and unmake public spheres. We have two guiding research questions: (1) How do consensusing and dissensusing when conceptualized as communicative practices -- verbings -- relate to other practices? (2) What are the implications of these relationships for the quality of dialogue among participants holding diverse perspectives? Our boundary-bridging, quantitative-qualitative analysis uncovered previously hidden patterns in communicating behaviors, suggesting that an emphasis on consensusing and dissensusing may inhibit communication processes necessary for effective public sphere dialogue."

More specifically, it concentrates on one dimension of the mutual shaping process: how actors' definition of their situation orients the realization of online newspapers' multimedia and interactive potentials. Drawing from field studies in three online newsrooms, this article shows that actors' definition of the situation regarding the locus of production, the role of the editorial function, and the identity of the end-consumer influences their appropriation of these new communication potentials."

Less is known about a newly-released fighting video game based on the series. This paper provides an analysis of the construction of Buffy as a hero in the video game, comparing it to her portrayal in the television show. The analysis suggests that the video game provides a uni-dimensional construction of female heroism, based on the Warrior archetype and omitting the Caregiver/Martyr archetype often present in descriptions of heroes. The series collectivist style of problem solving and focus on relationships is absent from the game, which emphasizes womens sexual characteristics (to a lesser extent than video games targeting males),
and includes terms that are derogatory to women. Like other constructions of female heroism, the game provides support for the idea that a woman can be strong but she must also be feminine."
2003-0766,The Content and Frequency of Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Beverage Ads in Video and Magazines Popular Among Adolescents,Paper,The Content and Frequency of Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Beverage Ads in Video and Magazines Popular Among Adolescents,"Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to compare the content of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverage advertising content to which adolescents are exposed in the United States.
Methods: A census of beverage advertising in popular magazines and on network television (n=757 ads) during the months of November, 1999-April, 2000 was analyzed for content and frequency.
Results: By far, the most alcoholic beverage ads appeared in Sports Illustrated (110) followed by Rolling Stone (98) and Playboy (75). Alcohol advertising outnumbers nonalcohol advertising by a ratio of 3 to 1. All types of beverage ads emphasized relaxation and portrayals of young adults. Alcohol was almost never associated with dining. Ads rarely portrayed risky situations but frequently were placed in magazines featuring sports and sexually oriented content. Alcohol ads demonstrated an emphasis on sexual and social stereotyping of women, and a lack of ethnic and age-related diversity. Themes and settings of alcohol ads were similar to those present in nonalcohol ads. One of every six magazine alcohol ads, and one of every 14 video-based ads, appeared to target underage drinkers.
Conclusions: Alcohol is advertised heavily in media outlets favored by youth. Alcohol advertisements also include many stereotypes and many elements known to appeal to youth, particularly youth already at risk to drink alcohol. That themes in alcohol ads parallel those in nonalcohol ads may further increase youths receptivity."
2003-0767,The Context of Knowledge Sharing,Paper,The Context of Knowledge Sharing,"In this paper, we explore the influence of commitment to the organization, communication climate and the use of Computer-Mediated Communication on knowledge sharing.
Based on theories concerning each of these subjects, we designed a causal model which was subsequently tested across six different organizational units. This model distinguishes two central knowledge sharing processes (knowledge donating and knowledge collecting), and specifies the influence of commitment, communication climate and CMC on both these processes.
We used AMOS, a software package for structural equation modelling, to test this model. Our results suggest that both commitment and communication climate are key variables in explaining knowledge sharing, and that CMC use also has a positive influence on this process (through commitment). Furthermore, the distinction between the processes of knowledge donating and knowledge collecting, respectively, turns out to be a relevant one. The antecedents of both processes are not entirely similar (commitment, for instance, influences knowledge donating but not collecting), and they are also interrelated: knowledge collecting can be seen as a condition for knowledge donating."
2003-0768,The Contribution of Speech Act Theory to the Analysis of Conversation: How Presequences Work,Paper,The Contribution of Speech Act Theory to the Analysis of Conversation: How Presequences Work,"Language and Social Interaction scholars often criticize speech act theorists for using invented sentences and fictional situations to illustrate their points, a practice which, according to these detractors, fails to capture the complexity and sequentiality of human interactions. In contrast, speech act theorists tend to accuse their opponents of falling into empiricism by collecting and analyzing naturally occurring pieces of interaction without truly explaining the inferential mechanisms by which interlocutors come or fail to coordinate their activities. This paper shows how these two approaches to language and social interaction could actually benefit from each other. More precisely, I propose a reinterpretation of the critique Schegloff (1988) addressed to Searle in his analysis of presequences and indirection. Contrary to what Schegloff contends, speech act theory can explain the inferential mechanisms by which interlocutors come to not only produce and understand presequences, but also mistake them for requests for information. Although Schegloff is right to point out that the phenomenon of presequences has not been anticipated by speech act theory, he is wrong to think that this model is ill equipped to explain the logic of the production and (mis-) comprehension of this conversational phenomenon. Interestingly enough, speech act theory - and this is the analytical power of this theory - helps us anticipate forms of presequences that have not yet being identified by conversation analysts."

Using semiotics as the primary analytic theory, and in-depth key informant interviews as well as focus group interviews as the means of data collection, the cultural meanings and filmic components of Nang Nak are analyzed to uncover one possible answer for why this film achieved wide popularity in Thailand despite the fact that Thai audiences have, in recent years, devoted a majority of their movie-going hours to mainstream Hollywood films. The results of the research indicate five important features of cultural beliefs and values and five filmic elements that provide one possible explanation for the popularity of Nang Nak. In addition to discussing those cultural beliefs/values and filmic elements, this study argues that Western theories can play a meaningful role in the analysis of Asian films."
2003-0770,The Datasetting Effect of Learning Fact From Fiction,Paper,The Datasetting Effect of Learning Fact From Fiction,"Previous research has shown that people appear to use television fiction memories when asked to make a judgment about social reality. It has been argued that such memory based judgment occurs because people mislabel fictitious memories or because they do not take information about source validity into account. This study argues that fiction contains cues which tell some viewers that some of what they see resembles reality. In that case a viewer makes an on line, stimulus based judgment and learns a fact while watching fiction. This sudden insight was called the data setting effect.
In a sample of 501 Flemish students 29 1f thirteen year olds had knowledge about police procedures in the USA which they could only have obtained by watching TV fiction. Knowledge levels increased with age. 74.4 1003410535f eighteen year olds possessed the same knowledge.
The paper argues fist, that that the data setting effect is strong and persistent. Second, that it may occur at an early age, which may explain why little or no association between measures of viewing volume and knowledge of the TV world is found in adult age groups. Third, the implication of the first two conclusions is that in TV effects research age should not be treated as a demographic background variable, but rather as a measure of overall lifetime TV viewing."

In so doing, this paper also navigates the cinematic borders represented by the desert and the labyrinth, both of which serve as metaphors for the cultural conditions generated by computers and new media. The labyrinth represents the border between control and freedom, the complex realm situated between social order and personal liberation. The desert not only represents the border between ""utopia"" and the rest of society, but also the border territory between the simulated and the real. In combination, Alphaville, Westworld, and The Matrix offer labyrinths and deserts to metaphorically illustrate the dystopian anxieties associated with computer and new media in contemporary technological society."
2003-0772,The Development of Digital Television in Italy,Paper,The Development of Digital Television in Italy,"The introduction of digital TV in the early 1990's has dramatically accelerated the pace of change in the European broadcasting sector. This paper analyses the development of digital TV in Italy. It examines how government policies, market forces, and demand factors are
shaping the current restructuring of the Italian broadcasting system in its migration from analogue to digital TV. The focus is on two issues that have emerged as key bottlenecks in the digital TV supply chain: the control of premium sports rights and the control of the digital TV home terminal. We argue that the new market structure and the new equilibrium between public and private operators will largely depend on how these two issues are sorted out by market forces and regulatory battles at the national and European level. We also argue that, as implemented to date, the introduction of digital terrestrial services is unlikely to challenge the comfortable duopoly between RAI and Mediaset in the Italian TV sector."

Daniel Lerner¡¯s concept of empathy and John Thompson¡¯s idea of the reordering of space and time with the development of the media are insightful in that the two dimensions of space and time are the basic elements of our experience. However, the ideas need to be reconceptualized with the contexts in which individuals are located because of the asymmetrical flow of information between nations, discussed in the cultural imperialism thesis. Therefore, this study discusses the possibility of articulation of these ideas with the political economy of communication."
2003-0774,The Dieter as Model Citizen,Paper,The Dieter as Model Citizen,"Research indicates that a third of the U.S. populace is medically overweight and that approximately 15 to 30 percent of Americans are on a diet at any given time of the year. The Surgeon Generals office is actively promoting weight loss for all Americans. This emphasis on weight indicates that, in the United States, dieting and fatness hold special symbolic significance beyond public health arguments that being overweight poses a personal health risk. This paper argues that the act of dieting parallels that of model citizenship. The dieter, like the model citizen, practices self-surveillance and self-discipline, observes a secular form of the Protestant work ethic and practices a moral lifestyle. In contrast, fatness symbolizes a lack of self-surveillance and self-discipline; as well as illness, laziness, and a number of other stigmatized characteristics. These symbolic meanings, rather than health concerns. contribute to anti-fat prejudice in the United States."

The digital divide between a local and a nationwide newspaper on the Web

A local newspaper faces more competition when it moves online than in the print world. This study chose Buffalonews.com as a local sample and USAToday.com as a nationwide sample of online newspapers. Using a content analysis of the online newspapers, this study investigated the strengths and weaknesses between the two competitors on the Web. This study found the digital divide between the two newspapers on the Web. The analysis was linked with a survey of 273 students in the local area to get an insight for the interactions between online media and their audiences. Demographic analysis of each online newspaper audiences provided a clue of understanding the new readership."
2003-0776,The Discourse Marker nu: Israeli Hebrew Impatience in Interaction,Paper,The Discourse Marker nu: Israeli Hebrew Impatience in Interaction,"This study investigates the non-lexical item nu, borrowed into Hebrew from European languages, particularly Yiddish and Russian. The corpus examined consists of audio-recordings of 30 casual conversations between friends and family members. Nu was found to be the second most prevalent interpersonal discourse marker (Maschler 1994a) in this database. The tokens of nu in the corpus function a) to hasten a non-verbal action, b) to urge further development within a topic, c) to grant permission to perform an action, or d) as a keying discourse marker providing a joking/provoking tone. The relationships among these functions are explored by reference to three continua constraining the use of nu: (1) ÔsequentialityÕ, (2) ÔkeyÕ, and (3) ÔmetalanguageÕ. Finally, nu is discussed in relation to the often positive perception of impatience in Israeli culture."
2003-0777,The Eastern European Womans Search for Identity: A Gold Digger or an Independent Spirit?,Paper,The Eastern European Womans Search for Identity: A Gold Digger or an Independent Spirit?,"With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Eastern European women enthusiastically embraced the radical social and political changes which advocated true equality at home and at the working place for women and men alike. However, the position of Eastern European women in society did not change as expected. On the contrary, the feminization of poverty overwhelmed the female population in Eastern Europe, leaving many women unemployed, devalued and depressed.
This paper argues that the woman of the new Eastern European democracies has asserted a new identity in sharp opposition to the traditionally established image of the Eastern European woman as a caretaker and a heroine-worker conditioned in a highly traditional patriarchal society.
By examining the rhetoric of the lyrical content of contemporary Bulgarian pop folk songs, this paper contends that Eastern European women have overthrown traditional stereotypes of femininity and asserted a new sexualized and aggressive role of independence, rejecting the stereotypes of the submissive, docile woman of the patriarchal society as well as the stereotypes of the asexual, emancipated woman of communist Eastern Europe."
2003-0778,The Effect of Downsizing on Organization-Employee Relationship Dimensions,Paper,The Effect of Downsizing on Organization-Employee Relationship Dimensions,"This study explored how downsizing influenced organization-employee relationships in a case study organization and tried to provide a workable application on how to maintain good employee relationships after downsizing. Qualitative data collected from in-depth interviews revealed that the relationship with management is generally negatively viewed by employees, while management generally view this relationship with employee as positive. The greatest gap was found in the evaluation of trust, commitment and communal relationship dimensions. Meanwhile, an accuracy analysis showed that employees have an accurate understanding of what management thinks of their relationship. Management, however, turned out to have an inaccurate understanding of employees¡¯ view of their relationship. According to this study, the management of the case study organization should work out measures to enhance its integrity and competence in trust level. And it should also try to establish a communal relationship with employees and elicit employees¡¯ commitment."
2003-0779,The Effect of Ego Involvement on Health News Processing,Paper,The Effect of Ego Involvement on Health News Processing,"Health news processing relies on the perceived salience of the health issue for the reader and on the relative commitment the reader has to health beliefs and values. The effect of ego involvement and salience involvement on the comprehension of a health news article is evaluated using multiple regression analysis. Hypothesis 1 was supported: salience involvement with the message topic significantly contributed to comprehension. Hypothesis 2 was supported: ego involvement significantly contributed to comprehension controlling for the effect of salience involvement. Ego involvement was also shown to contribute significantly to the accuracy , rather than the inference, portion of the comprehension test. The results are discussed in terms of a response-shaping persuasion context."
2003-0780,The Effect of Face Loss on Responses to Hurtful Messages from Romantic Partners,Paper,The Effect of Face Loss on Responses to Hurtful Messages from Romantic Partners,"Sometimes romantic partners engage in face attacks against each other. Based on Felsons impression management theory, an individuals face loss, feelings of being hurt and explicit responses were hypothesized to vary with the type of face attack expressed by a romantic partner, the social context in which the attack occurred and the victims argumentativeness. The results of an experiment in which undergraduates were asked to respond to hypothetical scenarios indicated that individuals would feel greater hurt, experience more face loss from the attack and be more likely to challenge the attack when insulted rather than teased. Regardless of whether the face attack was a tease or insult, individuals reported greater face loss would result from being attacked in public than in private and when the onlookers were friends rather than strangers. Also, individuals expected their own friends to be more supportive of challenging the attack than their partners friends. However, individuals were less willing to challenge the face attack when it occurred in the presence of onlookers than in private. These findings imply that when face attacks occur, individuals are sensitive to the type of face attack but also are concerned about suffering more face loss by challenging the attack in the presence of others. Argumentativeness was negatively related to hurt, face loss and pressure to end the challenge and positively related to willingness to challenge a face attack. These findings imply that not all individuals who experience face attacks will respond in the same way."
2003-0781,"The Effect of Limited Capacity, Social Judgment, and Advertising Topic on Perceived Reality",Paper,"The Effect of Limited Capacity, Social Judgment, and Advertising Topic on Perceived Reality","These studies are part of a program of research examining mental processes in making perceived reality judgments while viewing media stories. Two experiments examined the influence of pacing/mental capacity on reality judgments about narrative advertisements. The studies also examined self-other judgments about perceived reality and judgments about physical and conceptual reality. The results indicate that the evidence fits a cue-processing model of the effect of limited capacity on perceived reality, not a reality-as-default model that has been assumed. In addition, evidence was found for implicit egocentric social comparison in making judgments about reality about self and about other people. Evidence was also found that physical reality judgments are less influence by limited capacity than conceptual reality judgments."
2003-0782,The Effect of News Frames and Individual Schemas on Issue Interpretations and Attitudes,Paper,The Effect of News Frames and Individual Schemas on Issue Interpretations and Attitudes,"This study examines the effects of news frames on audiences?issue interpretations and attitudes, and how such effects are moderated by individual issue schemas. An experiment was conducted whereby four news articles systematically manipulated by value or consequence frames were presented to participants in a controlled issue framing environment. Results indicated that while news frames can indeed activate frame-related issue interpretations, they had limited impact on issue attitudes. Individual issue schemas, however, were found to be a significant moderator of framing effects. Those with distinct issue schemas differed significantly in issue interpretations and attitudes. Implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed."

Results show that participation of the audience directly affects the quality of campaign goals much less than, participation of outreach workers."
2003-0784,"The Effect of Political Discussion in Producing Informed Citizens: Roles of Information, Motivation, and Elaboration",Paper,"The Effect of Political Discussion in Producing Informed Citizens: Roles of Information, Motivation, and Elaboration","Recent studies have demonstrated a strong empirical relationship between political discussion and political knowledge. However, as of yet there has been no clear discussion or demonstration of how political discussion translates into increased political knowledge. The present study proposes three explanations ? exposure (similar to the two step flow), anticipatory elaboration (linking work on uses and gratifications and news information processing), and discussion-generated elaboration (focusing on how discussion itself can influence information processing) ? for this observed empirical relationship. In order to test these three explanations, data from the 2000 American National Election Study and a local community survey during the 1996 presidential election were employed. Findings suggest that the direct relationship between discussion and knowledge may be mediated through motivations and information processing behaviors. These findings support the anticipatory elaboration and discussion-generated elaboration explanations while questioning the exposure explanation."
2003-0785,The Effect of Press-Political Party Relationship on Framing: The Content Analysis of the Korean Media Tax Investigations in 1994 and 2001,Paper,The Effect of Press-Political Party Relationship on Framing: The Content Analysis of the Korean Media Tax Investigations in 1994 and 2001,"This study examines how two ideologically different groups of two Korean newspapers reacted to two different ideological situations involving tax investigations of newspapers in 1994 and 2001. The content analysis of this study focuses on two different relationships between newspapers and political parties surrounding the tax investigations: One is the dissonant relationship in 1994, when conservative newspapers and a liberal party were against the tax investigation and liberal newspapers and a conservative party were in favor of the investigation; the other is consonant relationship in 2001, when conservative newspapers and a conservative party, or liberal newspapers and a liberal party were in same positions regarding another tax investigation. According to the results of the analysis, two groups of newspapers kept their positions firmly in favor of or against the tax investigation regardless of switched policies of political parties that are ideologically similar to them. However, the opinions of two groups of newspapers were opinions more polarized to their positions in the consonant situation than the dissonant situation."
2003-0786,"The effect of sex appeal on believability, attitude toward the advertisement and brand, and purchase intention",Paper,"The effect of sex appeal on believability, attitude toward the advertisement and brand, and purchase intention","The primary focus of this study is to develop a path model to explain how sex appeals work on the traditional advertising effectiveness measures including attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand, and purchase intention. The present study is different from prior sex appeal studies in that it examines both believability and reptilian emotion as possible mediators of sexiness effects to track both the rational and emotional responses of the audience. Gender, age, sexual orientation, product involvement, religious anti-sex conservatism, religiosity, trait sexual excitement, and trait shopping excitement are included to assess individual differences in the present study. Several new scales are constructed in this study to tap the areas where no existing scales have touched. This study treats perceived sexiness as a multi-dimensional variable and manipulates it along three different dimensions. Path analysis was used to develop this sex-appeal model of advertisement. A two (high sexiness vs. low sexiness) by two (high congruity vs. low congruity) by two (model replication) by two (product replication) repeated measure design is used. Gender is identified as the major moderator variable and thus two separate models are developed for each gender. In general this study supports that sex appeal positively influences attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand and purchase intention."
2003-0787,"The Effect of Viewing Varying Levels of Aggressive Sports Programming on Enjoyment, Mood, and Perceived Violence",Paper,"The Effect of Viewing Varying Levels of Aggressive Sports Programming on Enjoyment, Mood, and Perceived Violence","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of sports aggression on viewer enjoyment, mood, and perceptions of violence. To do this, 100 participants viewed clips in one of three viewing condition: nonaggressive play (i.e., professional baseball), unscripted-aggressive play (i.e., professional boxing), and scripted-aggressive play (i.e., professional wrestling). Findings provide additional support to the few studies examining the enjoyment of aggressive sports, while adding the dimension of aggressive sports entertainment. Furthermore, the study offers new insight into the effect of sports violence on mood and perceived level of violence, especially in relation to gender differences and potential context effects."
2003-0788,"The Effects of Auditory Complexity on Attitudes, Attention, Arousal, & Memory",Paper,"The Effects of Auditory Complexity on Attitudes, Attention, Arousal, & Memory","An experiment was conducted testing the impact of auditory structural complexity on attention, arousal, attitudes, and memory. Twenty-five participants listened to 8 radio messages?half of which were greater in structural complexity. Physiological measures were taken during message presentation, and self-report measures after each. Results show that, as predicted, auditory structural complexity lead to higher self-reported and physiological arousal, better attitudes toward the messages overall and toward their non-claim components, and greater memory. Contrary to predictions, auditory complexity did not result in significantly higher self-reported attention. Furthermore, auditory complexity resulted in higher heart rate levels compared to structural simplicity."
2003-0789,The Effects of Coach Communicative Aggression On Athlete Learning And Motivation,Paper,The Effects of Coach Communicative Aggression On Athlete Learning And Motivation,"Recent research on communicative aggression has demonstrated that communicative aggression by educators is infrequent. But, when it occurs there are negative consequences on student learning (Myers & Knox, 1999; Myers & Rocca, 2001; Rocca & McCroskey, 1999). The popular portrayal of college athletic coaches, however, would suggest that communicative aggression is much more common at college sports complexes. College athletes from the USA and Canada responded to a survey where they indicated their perceptions of coach aggression, their identification with the coach, their learning (affective and cognitive), championship motivation, and motivation to perform as an athlete. The results were that verbal aggression by coaches negatively influenced identification with the coach. Affect for the sport and championship motivation mediated the link between identification with the coach and motivation to perform. There were unique effects for cognitive learning."
2003-0790,The Effects of Color and Language Intensity on Attitude Change and Emotions,Paper,The Effects of Color and Language Intensity on Attitude Change and Emotions,"This study examined whether messages using or not using emotionally intense language combined with high or low intensity colors would affect attitude change. Participants read controversial messages that used high or low intensity language printed on either red, white, or blue paper and then provided ratings of their attitudes and emotions about the controversy. Emotionally intense messages were more positively associated with attitude change than were those with low emotional intensity, but no interaction effects or main effects for color were found."
2003-0791,The Effects of Concept Structure on Attitude and Belief Change: A Spatial vs. a Hierarchical Model,Paper,The Effects of Concept Structure on Attitude and Belief Change: A Spatial vs. a Hierarchical Model,"Theories of inter-attitude relationships and attitude change have failed to identify the architecture of inter-attitudinal structures and then clarify its relationship to attitude and belief change. This paper examines two models (hierarchical and spatial) of inter-attitudinal structure that explicitly address the consequences of structure for attitude change. An experiment (N = 391) was conducted that manipulated type of hierarchy (explicit vs. implicit), whether the hierarchy was primed or not, and the location in the hierarchy to which a message was directed. The results show that, as both models suggest, linguistic organizational structures influence attitude and belief change. However, as the spatial model suggests, such change is constrained less by a concepts relative position in the structure and more by the strength of the concepts association with other concepts in that structure. Furthermore, within these structures, concepts directly targeted by a persuasive message often exhibit less attitude change than related concepts."
2003-0792,"The Effects of Frame, Appeal, and Arousal Intensity of Antismoking Messages on Attention and Memory",Paper,"The Effects of Frame, Appeal, and Arousal Intensity of Antismoking Messages on Attention and Memory","Antismoking ads have been found to be inconsistent in counter-marketing the influence of cigarette advertising. Although there have been many studies that examine how different message appeals can influence people¡¦s attitudes and behavior, there have been few studies that have explored the mechanism of how individuals attend to and remember antismoking information.
This present study examines how message attributes of antismoking TV ads (i.e., frame, appeal, and arousal) interact to influence people¡¦s attention and memory. This study can add to the understanding of how different message attributes affect individuals¡¦ cognitive processing, and help in the selection or design of antismoking messages in health campaigns."
2003-0793,The Effects of Internet Use on Social Trust,Paper,The Effects of Internet Use on Social Trust,"This paper examined both the direct and mediating effects of different motives of Internet use on social trust. Rejecting the time displacement hypothesis assuming that overall Internet use decreased social connectedness and therefore social trust, this study revealed that different motives of Internet use directly affected social trust in different directions. Furthermore, as personality was demonstrated to be a stronger predictor of the level of social trust, the process of how the motives of Internet use mediated the effects of personality on social trust was explored, and it confirmed the ¡°rich get richer¡± model (Kraut et al. 2002)."
2003-0794,The Effects of Media Consumption on Abortion Attitudes,Paper,The Effects of Media Consumption on Abortion Attitudes,"Using data from a national political survey, the present study examined factors predicting attitudes toward abortion, with a focus on the relationship between the type and frequency of media consumption and its effect on stands towards abortion rights. Our findings indicated that religiosity was the strongest predictor, followed by ones view of womens equal role in society. The only significant media factors were political talk radio listening and newspaper readership. Implications were discussed."
2003-0795,The Effects of Mediation Content on Children's Responses to Violent Television: Comparing Cognitive and Affective Approaches,Paper,The Effects of Mediation Content on Children's Responses to Violent Television: Comparing Cognitive and Affective Approaches,"An experiment with five- to twelve-year-old children compared two approaches to mediating childrens viewing of a violent television program. One approach, cognitive mediation, encouraged children to think about the fantasy aspects of the program. The other approach, affective mediation, appealed to childrens emotions by highlighting the negative social consequences of engaging in violent behavior. The findings revealed that affective mediation is the most effective approach, particularly for younger children and older children who are heavy viewers of violent programming. Cognitive mediation had either no effect or increased some older childrens vulnerability to media violence. The implications of these findings for developing parental mediation strategies and media literacy programs are discussed."
2003-0796,The effects of nonverbal mirroring with persuasion and agreement in a group discussion,Paper,The effects of nonverbal mirroring with persuasion and agreement in a group discussion,"Two experiments examined nonverbal mirroring in a group discussion. In Experiment 1 the participant interacted with 2 confederates. Confederates disagreed with each other and with the participant during discussion. One confederate mirrored the nonverbal behavior of the participant and one did not. Participants rated the imitating confederate as more confident and persuasive. However, participants were not more likely to change their viewpoint to match this confederate. Independent coders, unaware of the hypotheses, did not rate the 2 confederates as significantly different. In Experiment 2, the participant interacted with 2 confederates. One confederate agreed with the participant during the discussion and the other disagreed. One confederate rubbed his or her face during the discussion, and the other shook his or her foot. It was hypothesized that participants would be more likely to mirror the nonverbal behavior of the confederate who agreed with them during discussion. However, results failed to reach significance."
2003-0797,"The Effects of Nudity, Sexual Content, and Violence on a Film's Financial Success",Paper,"The Effects of Nudity, Sexual Content, and Violence on a Film's Financial Success","The production of major motion pictures is economically risky; it is therefore advantageous to understand what factors predict a film's financial success. While past research has identified a number of these factors, including production budget size and the presence of a popular star in the cast, the effects of adult content, particularly nudity, sex, and violence, are not known. Information about a sample of recent movies was analyzed to explore the possible existence of such effects. Nudity was found to exert no influence. Through path modeling, sexual content was found to exert a negative influence, mediated by budget and MPAA rating. Violence was found to exert a slight, indirect, positive influence on international box office revenues."
2003-0798,The Effects of the Media on Body Image: A Meta-Analysis,Paper,The Effects of the Media on Body Image: A Meta-Analysis,"Eating disorders are increasingly common among young women not only in the United States, but in other countries as well. The media have been criticized for depicting the thin woman as the ideal female form. Some argue these images create an unrealistic expectation of thinness in young women and lead to eating disorders. This study cumulates findings of empirical studies designed to examine the effects of media on body image. An estimate of an overall effect size, trends in the research, and the influence of moderating variables are examined and reported. Results suggest that depictions of thin women may have little to no effect on viewers; however, images of overweight women have a positive effect on womens body image. Furthermore, an increased exposure length is correlated with negative body image. Suggestions for future research are offered."
2003-0799,The Electoral Impact of Televisions Unemployment Coverage in Germany - A Time Series Analysis 1994-1998,Paper,The Electoral Impact of Televisions Unemployment Coverage in Germany - A Time Series Analysis 1994-1998,"There is a considerable amount of evidence to suggest that the political preferences of voters are influenced by the condition of the domestic economy. This paper examines the assumption that the connections between one specific economic development - namely unemployment - and the public's voting preferences are mediated by the way in which the television news cover unemployment. Using a time series analysis approach (August 1994  September 1998) with monthly aggregated data, it is shown that the media follow negative conditions in the labor market more closely than positive conditions. Although the television coverage fails to exert a direct effect on voting preferences, it does exert an independent and indirect effect through its impact on the publics perceptions of candidates, party competence, and the importance of unemployment as a national problem. Television inadvertently disadvantaged the mainstream parties and helped the radical right."
2003-0800,The Electorate and Their Own Knowledge: Effects of Guilt and Perceived Sophistication on Political Participation,Paper,The Electorate and Their Own Knowledge: Effects of Guilt and Perceived Sophistication on Political Participation,"Political sophistication has been offered as a key component in the make-up of an active political participant. This study expands the standard conceptualization of political sophistication to consider, rather than actual sophistication, the effects of perceived sophistication on political participation. Using an experimental design, this study manipulated 199 participants perceptions such that each believed that they possessed lower than average political sophistication. Participants were also randomly selected to either be given the option or not be given the option to express discontent with the study, the survey questions, the researchers, politics, or themselves. Additionally, the effects of an I dont know survey option on both perceived sophistication and political participation was analyzed. The findings of this paper suggest that perceived sophistication does impact political participation regardless of voters actual sophistication. Significant effects of the I dont know option on perceptions of sophistication were also discovered. The paper considers the implications of these findings for media, scholarship, and political activists. Recommendations for future research for the independent and dependent variables as well as additional study designs to reveal further effects are also offered."
2003-0801,The Emergence of Structural Patterns in Interorganizational Relationships in the Application Service Provider Industry (I),Paper,The Emergence of Structural Patterns in Interorganizational Relationships in the Application Service Provider Industry (I),"This paper examines interorganizational arrangements in the Application Service Provider Industry (ASP) that has arisen in response to technological imperatives. The study focuses on forms of interorganizational relations (IORs) and assesses the overall network patterns among ASPs during 1998-2001. The goal is to explore the underlying processes of such relations via mapping the network structure of the industry. Resource dependency theory (RDT) is utilized in the analysis of the industry. Sixty-Nine ASPs that have (within-industry) IORs with other ASPs are examined. The data analyses show that the industry is under the influence of economies of large scale and that the dominant ASPs with various IORs tend to focus on more generic type of service. Small companies should focus on provision of more specific types of services. The notion of resource dependence is discussed in relation to Giddens¡¯ theory of Structuration in theoretical interpretations of the results. In short, I argue that the notion of regularities found in structural and function approaches (such as RDT, for example) should be related to what people and organizations do in specific economic settings, rather than being related to sui-generis feature of such regularities."
2003-0802,The Enfranchisement Project: The Impact of a Case Study Intervention and Media Use on Perceptions of Responsibility to Community,Paper,The Enfranchisement Project: The Impact of a Case Study Intervention and Media Use on Perceptions of Responsibility to Community,"This study concerned itself with investigating the effectiveness of a case study, used as a teaching tool, and media use on students perceptions of responsibility regarding the democratic process as it relates to the 2000 presidential election. The findings suggest that the case study was successful in changing students perceptions of their ability to make a difference in both local and national politics. Moreover, after the case study intervention participants indicated that Universities and the media had a greater responsibility to facilitate democracy, and that something should be done about the fairness of the elections. Still, some of these effects were mediated by the hours students spent following the election coverage."
2003-0803,The Evolving Genre of Our Lady of Guadalupe: A Feminist Analysis,Paper,The Evolving Genre of Our Lady of Guadalupe: A Feminist Analysis,"Our Lady of Guadalupe, or the Virgin of Guadalupe, is the Virgin Mother of the New World. Our Lady has been revered as a saint, prayed to as a compassionate Mother, and held up as a model of ideal womanhood for all Catholics of Latin America, but particularly of Mexico, for over 400 years. Portrayal of Our Lady traditionally uses codified stylistic elements that rhetorically interpret her substantive elements, and may be considered one genre. Whereas that genre continues to the present day, contemporary Latina artists have, for the past 25 years, been rearranging and changing the stylistic elements to re-interpret the substantive elements of Our Lady. This rearrangement expresses a different gender construction that may ignite controversy within the Catholic community. The stylistic elements used by the Latina artists are recognizable by anyone familiar with Our Lady but the expression is different enough to give rise to a sub-genre within the Our Lady genre."
2003-0804,The Face of Crime: Viewers Memory of Race-Related Facial Features of Individuals Pictured in the News,Paper,The Face of Crime: Viewers Memory of Race-Related Facial Features of Individuals Pictured in the News,"An experiment was conducted to examine individuals memories of race-related facial features of an individual pictured in the news. Participants were presented with a series of news stories, including one of four different versions of the news story of interest: non-stereotyped, stereotyped/non-crime, nonviolent crime, violent crime. Subsequently, participants were asked to reconstruct the photograph of the individual pictured in the news story by selecting from a series of facial features (i.e., noses, mouths, skin tones) presented on a computer screen. While selected facial features did not differ from the actual photograph in the non-stereotyped and stereotyped/non-crime conditions, selected facial features in the crime stories featured more African-centered rather than European-centered features, and particularly so for the story concerning violent crime."
2003-0805,The Face Threat in Facework: Conversational Moves and Perceptions of Face-loss Prevention in Accounting Sequences,Paper,The Face Threat in Facework: Conversational Moves and Perceptions of Face-loss Prevention in Accounting Sequences,"In this paper, we present a study investigating friends discussions of failure events. Following Goffman (1955, 1967), the primary challenge types, offerings, and evaluations were coded from these interactions and analyzed for differences in participants judgments of attentiveness toward other-face. As well, we looked at perceptions of positive and negative face-attentiveness based on the complexity of offerings and acceptances. Although not every accounting form resulted in significant differences, most were perceived differently in some way by either the speakers or their partners, and in many cases, the judgments made by the speakers were not the same as those made by the partners. More complex account sequences were seen typically by offering elictors as less attentive to their own negative face. Qualitative analyses also revealed that a more direct form of facework might replace or work alongside accounts as a response to elicitations or offerings, requests for advice from the accounter may be related to judgments of greater negative other-face attentiveness by the accounter but less attentiveness by the listener."
2003-0806,The Fork in the Trail of Power: National and Regional Media Coverage of Post-9/11 Public Warnings,Paper,The Fork in the Trail of Power: National and Regional Media Coverage of Post-9/11 Public Warnings,"Al-Qaida's domestic attacks and the US federalism system create a new political accountability for public protection from external threat. Prior to 9/11, presidential administrations were exclusively accountable. After 9/11 , domesticized national security involves advisories and intelligence passed from national to state agencies, forcing gubernatorial administrations to share accountability for deciding to issue public warnings. How have national and regional media responded to this changed context of accountability and decision-making? Analyses of national and regional press coverage of Attorney General Ashcroft's second national threat alert and California Governor Davis's state bridge warning partly contradict congruence assumptions. Our regression analyses yield statistically significant findings showing that (1) national prestige media favorably covered Ashcroft and unfavorably covered Davis, (2) non-prestige regional media amplified the direction and intensity of national media patterns in published wire stories, but (3) regional staff stories reversed the pattern, by unfavorably covering Ashcroft and favorably covering Davis."
2003-0807,The Framing effect of controversial political agenda: Mediating role of prior attitude and party preference,Paper,The Framing effect of controversial political agenda: Mediating role of prior attitude and party preference,"This study is to see how the effect of news frame regarding controversial political issues touched off by the 2001 Press Tax Investigation in Korea is mediated by audience¡¯s prior attitude and party preference and then aims to deduce practical implication of journalism.
The first question was how different audiences¡¯ cognitive response to and interpretation of news frame can be in accordance with their prior attitude. The second question was about the effect of the individual party preference on their cognitive response and interpretation with regard to the Press Tax Investigation issue.
According to the study results, audiences present more pro-message reactions about news frame which correspond to audiences¡¯ prior attitude and party preference and produce more con-message reactions when news frame doesn¡¯t correspond to audiences¡¯ prior attitude and party preference. Also, the results show the difference of interpretation about each news frame according to audiences¡¯ prior attitude and party preference.
The findings suggest that controversial political agenda shouldn¡¯t end up as a social conflict caused by exhaustive political logic, and require the press to act as a catalyst that promotes social unity by increasing productivity of conflict."
2003-0808,The Globalization of the National News Agency,Paper,The Globalization of the National News Agency,"Abstract

UNESCO played a pivotal role in supporting many national and regional (print) news agencies in the developing world. This paper considers the rationale and mode of support, and the overall impact of UNESCO interventions. The key problem for all kinds of news agency in and of the developing world, including alternative news agencies that were not directly supported by UNESCO, has been to establish a business model sufficiently robust to guarantee longevity. The paper identifies a transition from an older to a newer business model for news agencies that emerged in first world economies and that has some potential for the developing world. The new model is certainly one that should contribute to UNESCOs strategic thinking, but it has limitations. Meanwhile, many elements of the developmental potential of news agency operations have been assumed by internet-based services created by regional, non-governmental agencies and other sources, including other institutions of the United Nations."
2003-0809,The Home as a Borderland: An Information Policy Perspective,Paper,The Home as a Borderland: An Information Policy Perspective,"Over the last decade the concepts of border and borderland have moved beyond studies of international political boundaries in disciplines like political science, history and anthropology into a variety of other fields, becoming metaphors useful in describing many types of human boundaries in addition to geopolitical ones. This paper extends the border metaphor to the home, specifically from an information policy perspective. It suggests that a variety of information policy issues can be viewed as arising where information technology is re-shaping the borderland between the world outside and the world inside the home. It begins with a historical definition of the concept of home, explores an organizing framework for considering the complex functions of the home and suggests how key issues in information policy relate to the home in light of those functions."

More than 40 articles from three major dailies were analyzed. The findings suggest that Asian-American candidates were constructed as different, outsiders, and aliens. The election campaigns were framed as outsider versus insider contests where foreign influences were involved."

An explorative study of textbooks in Geography, Religion, German lessons and History","Images of nations, however right or wrong they might be, seem to form, fundamentally, through a very complex communication process involving varied information sources. The process starts with one´s experience in very early life. Research has demonstrated that images of nations are very stable and resistant to change. The influence of schoolbooks in forming images of foreign nations and countries should not be underestimated. In the study about 40 schoolbooks (on religious education, geography, history and German language education) still in use have been analysed. In the textbooks India very often is compared with with China whereby the disadvantage is on India´s side. The main feature of India´s image is unbalanced development:On the one side there are incredibly rich people, on the other side so many people are living in absolute poverty. India is used as example for Third World problems like poverty, population explosion, child-labour and discrimination of women. In the textbooks on religion there is a partition in the good (Christians) on the one side and Hinduism on the other side. Only sometimes is India which seems to have no history introduced as a democracy. Proposals for the embetterment of the quality of textbooks are developed because schoolbooks in use today still present the very old stereotypes."

2003-0813,The Impact of Animation and Sound Effects on Attention and Memory Processes,Paper,The Impact of Animation and Sound Effects on Attention and Memory Processes,"The ability of computers to deliver information in multiple forms and presentation styles makes them an attractive resource for delivery of instruction to children who have different skill levels and learning styles. However, in spite of broad declarations about the positive impact of multimedia on childrens cognitive development and academic achievement, to date there is little empirical evidence to support these claims. This study will use the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing to find out how children respond to specific features, and combinations of features, in a multimedia lesson. Specifically, this research will examine whether 9-to-12 year old children orient to the use of animation and/or sound effects in a multimedia lesson and whether these features affect recognition and recall of content.
Information Processing and Mediated Messages
According to the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Processing, people have a limited amount of cognitive resources with which to perceive stimuli, turn them into mental representations, do mental work on those representations, and reproduce them in the same or in an altered form, (Lang, 2000, p.47). The model consists of three sub-processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Memory for a message is dependent on the outcome of all three sub-processes. Resources for processing are allocated to each of the tasks, and when there are insufficient resources to perform all of the tasks, some aspect of processing is inadequate or fails.
Several researchers have used the limited capacity model to investigate the effects of structural and content features on attention to and memory for television messages (Lang, 1990; Lang, Geiger, Strickwerda, & Sumner, 1993; Lang, Dhillon, & Dong, 1995; Lang, Newhagen, & Reeves, 1996; Lang, Zhou, Schwartz, Bolls, & Potter, 2000; Potter, 2000; Reeves, Thorson, Rothschild, McDonald, Hirsch, & Goldstein, 1985). In general, when a message has high levels of both structural features and arousing content, it will be liked and attended to by viewers, but resources needed for encoding will overload the processing system and memory for the message will be low.
Multimedia Learning
Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video delivered by a computer or other electronic means. Because multi-cue messages deliver more information than single-cue messages, utilization of multi-cue messages should result in greater learning. However, studies investigating this hypothesis have produced mixed results (Hartman, 1961; Ketcham & Heath, 1962; Severin, 1967b; Spaulding, 1956; Van Mondfrans & Travers, 1964). Severin (1967a) explained the inconsistent results by the degree of redundancy among cues. Studies that used cues with no redundancy between them, such as text accompanied by unrelated narrative, found multi-cue messages to be less effective than single-cue messages. In these studies, the unrelated cues likely required more resources for processing than were available. Studies that used cues that were essentially completely redundant, such as text paired with word-for-word narration, found no difference between multi-cue and single-cue messages. In these studies, the cues did not compete with each other for processing resources, but neither did they supply useful new information. Studies that used cues that were partially redundant, such as pictures paired with related narration, found multi-cue messages more effective than single-cue messages. In these studies, the cues appeared to provide a combination of redundancy and new information such that processing was not overloaded and the additional cues were useful. The current study will examine two components of multimedia: animation and sound effects. All animation and sound effect cues will be created so as to be partially redundant in order to provide new information without overloading processing.
Current Study
Because humans have an innate tendency to respond to things that move, animated messages are more likely to capture attention than static messages.
H1: The presence of animation in a multimedia lesson will elicit an orienting response.
Because they make things noticeable, animated stimuli will compel greater allocation of processing resources to encoding.
H2: The presence of animation in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recognition for the information presented.
By guiding attention to the important concepts in the verbal information, animation serves as a mnemonic device (ChanLin, 1998), and provides a framework for storing message information. Thus animated information should be more effectively stored than non-animated information.
H3: The presence of animation in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recall for the information presented.
Sounds can elaborate upon visual stimuli by providing information about invisible structures, dynamic change, and abstract concepts (Bishop & Cates, 2001). Like animation, sound can capture and guide attention and make things noticeable.
H4: The presence of sound effects in a multimedia lesson will elicit an orienting response.
H5: The presence of sound effects in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recognition for the information presented.
H6: The presence of sound effects in a multimedia lesson will result in increased recall for the information presented.
Design
The design of this study is a mixed Animation (2) X Sound Effect (2) X Message (4) X Order (4) factorial. Animation and Sound Effects are within-subjects factors; both have two levels, representing the presence or absence of the factor. These factors are completely crossed resulting in four categories of messages: no animation/no sound effect, animation/no sound effect, no animation/sound effect, and animation/sound effect. There are four messages in each Animation by Sound Effect category. Order is a between-subjects factor. Subjects will be randomly assigned to view one of the four orders.
Dependent Variables
Arousal. Physiological arousal will be measured using skin conductance as an indicator of activation in the sympathetic nervous system.
Attention. Orienting will be measured using phasic heart rate (there should be a short-term decrease in heart rate when viewers orient to an external stimulus) and cognitive effort will be measured using tonic heart rate (there should be a long-term deceleratory trend during periods of effort in attention to external stimuli).
Encoding. The efficiency of the encoding sub-process will be measured by a forced-choice, four-alternative, multiple-choice (recognition) test. The test will consist of 48 questions (3 for each slide in the lesson).
Storage. The efficiency of the storage sub-process will be measured by a cued recall test. For this test, subjects will be given a cue for each of the four topic areas and asked to tell the researcher as much as they can remember about that topic from the multimedia lesson.
Process
Ninety 9-to-12 year olds from schools in a Mid-western town will participate in the study in January, February, and March of 2003. Each subject will complete the experiment individually. After giving informed assent, subjects will be seated and sensors for measuring heart rate and skin conductance will be attached to the forearms and non-dominant hand. Subjects will then view the 16 slides in the computer lesson. Heart rate and skin conductance data will be collected during viewing. After viewing, the sensors will be removed and subjects will complete a distracter task. Following the distracter task, subjects will move to an adjoining room where they will be cued to various segments of the lesson and asked to describe everything they remember about the particular segment. Subjects responses will be audio-taped for later transcription. After this cued recall task, subjects will complete a forced-choice, four-alternative, multiple-choice recognition test. They will also answer questions about preferred learning style (visual or audio) and provide demographic information.
Results from this study will contribute to the development of theory that can predict how specific components of multimedia interact with students' processing of information. This understanding will provide a framework for people who seek to produce effective instructional media products.

This study attempts to clarify how the act of gossip and being perceived as a gossip influences source perceptions and message quality. It is argued that liking, trust, and suspicion of the source and message are influenced by relationship type (friend or stranger) and gossip valence (positive, negative, neutral). Using gossip as the manipulation in an experimental design, 120 confederates were enlisted to interact with either friends or strangers (participants) and, subsequently, engage in or avoid gossip. No significant results were found for gossips effect on message quality. Results, however, did determine that relationship type has a significant impact on gossips effect, such that friends were liked and trusted more than strangers regardless of gossip practices, and suspected less than strangers regardless of gossip practices. Results for analyses of gossip valence indicate significant effects of gossip on levels of suspicion regardless of relationship type. Additionally, these results indicate that negative gossip significantly decreases trust and dramatically increases suspicion of strangers, whereas, negative positive gossip increases trust of strangers. Results and implications are discussed."

Structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical regression modeling were simultaneously used to evaluate how mass media affect Korean immigrants¡¯ acculturation. The survey results from the two different analyses were consistent with each other, in that American media use was a significant positive predictor for the acceptance of American culture, and a significant negative predictor of the affinity for Korean culture. However, Korean media use was neither related to the immigrants¡¯ affinity for Korean culture nor acceptance of American culture. We surmise that the American mass media mainly reflect the American cultural climate, leading Korean immigrants to have a positive acceptance of American culture and a negative affinity for Korean culture. However, the Korean mass media in the U.S. generally reflect both hybrid Korean and American cultural values, which eventually lead to neither a positive nor negative perceptions about both American and Korean culture."

Our results suggest that media have little direct effect on shaping Americans attitudes about the rest of the world. Watching or reading the news and paying attention to news about foreign affairs had no relationship to whether people saw other countries as friendly or threatening. Exposure to broadcast news, however, influenced peoples support for military intervention in countries that potentially threaten the United States. Although media had limited effects on shaping Americans international opinions, respondents who were generally predisposed to trust other nations, as well as those who were generally isolationist, were less likely to feel threatened by specific countries and less likely to support armed intervention. We also find that general perceptions of threat interacted with exposure to network news to explain support for military intervention."
2003-0817,The impact of state-level social capital on emergence of virtual communities,Paper,The impact of state-level social capital on emergence of virtual communities,"The present paper analyzes the 48 contiguous states of the Union in terms of their level of social capital and their ability to create and maintain on-line communities (Yahoo! groups). Drawing on Putnams social capital theory it proposes that social capital is one of the most fundamental ingredients of social aggregates, be they off or on-line based. Geographic units will emanate a number of on-line formations and an overall amount of on-line activity commensurate with their social capital endowment. Multiple regression analysis indicates that state-level social capital linearly increases with increase in number of clubs per 100,000 state residents. Yet, the relationship between social capital and average weighted club activity, measured at state-level, is conditional and curvilinear. Social capital makes a difference, and a positive one, only for states under the mean in terms of social capital. States with a social capital endowment above the mean go in the opposite direction; they decline in terms of average club activity. The tentative explanation for these findings is that while high capital states facilitate on-line group creation, time and personal costs constrain the residents to focus more on their off-line lives and activities."

Five hundred and twenty-three young Thai adults completed questionnaires and twenty young adults participated in personal interviews. The findings that are discussed include, first, that the Thai qualities that emphasize smooth interpersonal relationships, education and competence, interdependence, grateful relationship orientation, and flexibility-and-adjustment serve as the best predictors of young adult's conflict tactics. Second, young adults' family satisfaction is significantly predicted by their levels of verbal aggression, approach to problem-solving, and withdrawal tactics. These findings, as well as other conclusions concerning the relationship between Thai culture and conflict management within the family, are examined in terms of conclusions that are suggested about young adults' communication competence and satisfaction with their family culture."

2003-0820,The Influence of Identity Status and Identity Processing Style on Adolescents Goals for Relationship Rule Violations,Paper,The Influence of Identity Status and Identity Processing Style on Adolescents Goals for Relationship Rule Violations,"At any age, a persons identity serves as an information processing filter that structures the activation of identity-relevant information (Kihlstrom & Klein, 1994). The concepts and information relevant to the self also have an instrumental influence on decisions to pursue particular goals (Bandura, 1989). While all individuals have some sense of identity, individuals vary in the degree to which they possess a stable sense of self (Markstrom-Adams, 1992). As such, variations in identity stability should have implications for that information which guides goal-related decisions in identity-relevant contexts.

The implications of variations in identity development are particularly salient in adolescence (Samet & Kelly, 1987). Marcia (1966; 1988) argued that the degree to which an adolescents identity can be considered to be developed is a function the presence or absence of active self-exploration and firm identity commitments; varying levels of these two dimensions reflect four different identity statuses: (a) achievers, (b) moratoriums, (c) foreclosures, and (d) diffusions. Individuals who are identity achieved have committed to a given ideology or interpersonal style following a period of intense exploration. Those who are still negotiating the exploration process, and in turn are not committed, are considered to be in moratorium. Persons who have committed to a particular identity, but who have not explored alternatives are in foreclosure status. Finally, adolescents who are not committed to a particular identity and are not engaged in exploration are said to be identity diffused (Marcia, 1988).

While identity status reflects an individuals degree of exploration and commitment with respect to a particular identity, Berzonsky (1989; 1992a; 1992b; Berzonsky & Kulk, 2000) argued that the two dimensions have implications for how adolescents engage in coping and problem solving. In particular, Berzonsky identified three identity processing orientations that are defined by exploration and commitment: diffuse-avoidant, normative, and information. Individuals with a diffuse-avoidant orientation possess low levels of self-exploration and commitment; when faced with challenging situations, these individuals are reluctant to confront personal problems and often procrastinate making decisions. Adolescents who have a normative orientation possess high levels of commitment and low levels of self-exploration; those with this orientation tend to be closed-minded and focus primarily on the standards and expectations of significant others. Finally, individuals with an information orientation possess a high level of self-exploration and either high or low levels of commitment; these adolescents are introspective and actively seek out, process, and utilize self-relevant information.

The research reviewed suggests that adolescents may differentiated in terms of their identity status and identity processing style. As such, we believe that adolescents varying degrees of self-identity development have implications for the types of goals that individuals pursue during identity-relevant events. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation is to examine whether developmental differences in adolescents self-identity development serve as an important explanatory mechanisms for the nature of adolescents communicative intentions.
Whereas identity status is generally assumed to operate in all situations, Berzonsky (1992) conceptualized identity processing style as particualry relevant to problem-solving contexts. Therefore, we focused our investigation on a context where adolescents are likely to face identity-relevant problems: relational rule violations in their close, voluntary relationships. Situations involving violated expectations often constitute a threat to an individuals sense of self (Sheer & Weigold, 1995). Further, such situations typically provoke cognitive activity (Langer, 1978; cf. Roloff, Soule, & Carey, 2001) aimed at making sense of the issue. As such, when individuals engage in a rule-violating activity, they are driven to purse communicative goals in response to their behavior (Names Withheld, 1998).

We conducted two studies to examine the influence of identity status and identity processing style on adolescents communicative goals for relational rule violations. In study 1, we sought to determine those communicative goals that were generated by adolescents after relational-rule violating situations. In study 2, we examined the influence of adolescents identity status and identity processing style on the importance of the communicative goals identified in Study 1.

Study 1: Identifying Adolescents Communicative Goals
Method
To determine the types of communicative intentions that adolescents generate in response to relational rule violations, we first asked one hundred adolescents (age range: 16 to 19 years, M = 17.04, SD = 1.08). to describe something that they had done in their relationship that could be described as a relational rule violation. Next, adolescents were provided with a half page to describe their intentions for how they communicatively responded to their behavior; we used these intention descriptions as indicators of communication goals. After examining the set of communicative intention responses, we grouped equivalent descriptions together to form a list of forty nonredundant exemplars of goal statements.

Analysis and Results
Using the forty exemplar goal statements, a sample of one hundred undergraduates performed a similarity-based sorting task. A data matrix was derived from the sorting results and was subjected to a hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique applying an average linkage between groups criteria. This analysis suggested the following eight clusters of communicative goals: (a) to be truthful, (b) to apologize, (c) to engage in restitution, (d) to maintain the relationship, (e) to terminate the relationship, (f) to manage partners positive face, (g) to negatively focus on the partner, and (h) to avoid blame. We used these eight goal categories to develop a measure of communication goal importance that was utilized in Study 2.

Study 2: Linking Identity Status and Identity Processing Style to Communicative Goals
Method
Our participants were one hundred and eighty adolescents who ranged in age from 14 to 19 years (M = 16.09, SD = 1.32). These adolescents completed a questionnaire that included measures of identity status and identity processing style. Then, similar to Study 1, respondents were asked to describe a relational rule violation with a close friend or a dating partner, and to describe what their communicative intentions were after the situation. Finally, respondents completed closed-ended measures of the communication goals derived from Study 1.

Measures. The thirty-two item Ego Identity Process Questionnaire (EIPQ; Balistreri, Busch-Rossnagel, & Geisinger, 1995) was used to measure the four categories of identity status. Respondents completed each item on a 6-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). In line with Schwartz, Mullis, Waterman, and Dunham (2000), identity status assignments were formed by median splits. Adolescents who were deemed high on both exploration and commitment were considered to be in the Identity Achievement Status. Moratorium individuals scored high on exploration and low on commitment. Individuals who were low on exploration and high on commitment defined the foreclosed category. Finally, adolescents who were low on both dimensions were labeled as Identity Diffuse.

Berzonskys (1997) forty item Identity Style Inventory was used to assess three identity processing styles. Respondents completed items on a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). To create a categorical measure of identity processing style, scores on the three styles were standardized and the style that received the highest score defined an adolescents identity processing style (Berzonsky, 1989).

We created thirty-two items (four per goal) to measure the importance of the communicative goals for responses to relational rule violations. Using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree), adolescents were asked to indicate the degree to which each of the eight goals identified in Study 1 were important concerns when responding to the relational rule violation that they reported. Given that goals can be singularly and simultaneously important (Names Withheld, 1999), we used this measure to determine the most important goal for each adolescent and to observe the operation of multiple important goals.

Analysis
The data for Study 2 have been collected and have not been analyzed at this time. To examine the central association proposed in this paper, a factorial ANOVA will examine the influence of identity status and identity style on the importance of communicative goals. Additional analyses will examine potential covariates (e.g., age, gender, demographic characteristics).

The Kim¡¯s (2001) structure model of cross-cultural adaptation, a theoretical explanation of the multidimensional mechanism of the individuals¡¯ adaptation processes in a new and unfamiliar cultural environment, provided a theoretical basis for this study. The results of correlation analyses showed that 1) the amount of EI was not correlated with SCAD; 2) the increased amount of HI was correlated with decreased SCAD; 3) the increased proportion of EI to the total Internet use was related to increased SCAD; 4) increased ICA was related to increased SCAD; 5) increased ICA was related to the increased proportion of EI to the total Internet use. Finally, a regression analysis confirmed that both increased ICA and the increased proportion of EI significantly predicted increased SCAD. Overall, support was found for the structure model of cross-cultural adaptation."

Second, the concept of peripheral cues has been criticized for being ill-defined and ambiguous. This project addressed both of these issues in the context of the WWW. To test the hypotheses the author utilized a 2 (argument strength) x 2 (issue involvement) x 2 (peripheral cue complexity) factorial design. 120 college students read a Web site with some combination of the three factors. It was predicted that the degree of peripheral cue complexity (PCC) would increase persuasion among those not personally involved in the issue regardless of argument strength. Results indicate that the degree of PCC may increase attention paid to message content among those less personally involved, and may have encouraged the processing of argument strength."
2003-0823,The influence of privacy and security on respondents trust and participation in E-surveys,Paper,The influence of privacy and security on respondents trust and participation in E-surveys,"This study examines online users perceived privacy and perceived security relative to respondents trust and participation in E-surveys. Using a social exchange perspective, the study demonstrates the importance of trust in maximizing E-survey returns and points to the pivotal role that privacy and security concerns play in individuals perceptions of risk. A variety of methodological tools were employed to demonstrate the hypothesized relationships, including factor analysis, content analysis combined with a clustering procedure, and regression. Although the sample is limited to college-age youth, the results lend support to the idea that E-survey returns can be maximized by attending to the privacy and security concerns of respondents."
2003-0824,The influences of Interpersonal Communication Styles on the Relationships between Perceived Organizational Justice and Uncertainty of Work Life of Japanese White-collar Workers,Paper,The influences of Interpersonal Communication Styles on the Relationships between Perceived Organizational Justice and Uncertainty of Work Life of Japanese White-collar Workers,"The objectives of the present study are (1) to explore the mediating effects of perceived procedural justice or fairness judgment on the relationships between interpersonal communication styles and uncertainty of work life of Japanese white-collar workers; and (2) to reveal what kind of interpersonal communication styles are effective for developing workersf perception of procedural justice. One hundred sixty three Japanese white-collar workers in the Tokyo area participated in the research. As a result of structural equation analysis, procedural justice mediated the effects of interpersonal communication styles on uncertainty reduction of work life. As a result of hierarchical regression analysis, it was found that rational communication styles such as reasoning, promise, commitment, question, and self-disclosure can promote workersf perceived procedural justice while authoritative communication styles such as a high-handed manner, demand/order, warning, and threat can promote their perceived procedural injustice. Based on the results, several academic contributions and practical implications are discussed. @"
2003-0825,The Influx of Refugees Bordered by Frames: A Frame Analysis of the Policy on Immigration,Paper,The Influx of Refugees Bordered by Frames: A Frame Analysis of the Policy on Immigration,"This paper examines the media frames the Belgian press is using to represent the issue of asylum, refugees and illegal immigration. Methodologically, the focus in this research lied on the question how these media frames can be detected in the press coverage. How can they sharply be defined independently of the interpretation of the researcher, since coming up with the names for frames itself involves a kind of framing? It was tried to go beyond notions of pro or con refugees, by using a specific framing approach. The media package approach as described by Gamson and Modigliani (1989) was used as a starting point. The extremities of the frame continuum which was operationalised were on the one hand asylum seekers are innocent victims and on the other hand asylum seekers are profiteers and criminals. Subtle differences such as the use of metaphors and the choice of pictures were taken into account. These frames indeed did have the power to set the terms of the debate. Homogeneity analysis by HOMALS is introduced into framing research. It turned out to be a fruitful way the set the borders of the frames in the policy on immigration. The discovered frames seemed even to be ingrained in our language and culture. Myths, the Bible, Christmas and the struggle of the Low Countries with the threat of water in ancient years are also nowadays capable to shape our view of todays reality."
2003-0826,The Interactive Effects of Time Pressure and Complex Syntax on Cognitive Processing and Perceived Reality of Television Scenarios,Paper,The Interactive Effects of Time Pressure and Complex Syntax on Cognitive Processing and Perceived Reality of Television Scenarios,"In a variety of domains, complexity has been shown to be an important factor affecting cognitive processing. Complex syntax is one of the ways that complexity has been shown to burden cognitive processing. Research has also shown that the determination of a communications truth or reality is affected by message complexity. Cognitive burdens have been shown to cause unrealistic events to be judged as more real. This study investigated the effects of syntactic complexity and time pressure on the perceived reality and response latency to high-, moderate-, and low-typicality television scenarios. As predicted, complex syntax caused reality cues in scenarios to have less effect on perceived reality. Contradictory to predictions, however, time pressure reversed instead of magnified these effects. Furthermore, it was shown that it took participants longer to assess the reality of moderately typical scenarios than high- and low-typicality sentences, although this difference was reduced under time pressure."
2003-0827,The Interactivity Paradox: Closer to the News But Confused,Paper,The Interactivity Paradox: Closer to the News But Confused,"As a mass medium, the World Wide Web may evoke a range of responses in users, both cognitive and affective. Notably, research has shown that users become easily disoriented in hypermedia environments. This study investigates the disorientation that users may experience while using major newspaper and television news sites on the Web. A repeated measures experiment was conducted in the two weeks before the 2000 presidential election. Study participants were placed in both interactive and noninteractive conditions on major news Web sites and answered questions that addressed the emotional and evaluative consequences of online contentan understudied aspect of user experiences with Internet technology. While interactive conditions were rated significantly more participatory, involving, and immediate than noninteractive conditions, interactive tasks also generated significantly more confusion, disorientation, and frustration than a noninteractive reading task. This dissonant set of results is referred to as the interactivity paradox. Though successful at bringing people closer to the news through features that invite involvement, online news operations are evidently leaving users who engage with interactive content somewhat confused. Disorientation in hypermedia environments is discussed not merely a nuisance problem but as a potentially serious issue affecting cognitive access to online content."
2003-0828,The Internet and Its Impact on Political Participation - A Case Study of Singapore,Paper,The Internet and Its Impact on Political Participation - A Case Study of Singapore,"The commercialization of the Internet has brought with it an integration of its operations in various levels of society. This has resulted in heightened claims that the revolutionary medium will result in a democratic society, facilitating active citizen participation. On the other hand, research has shown that confounding variables like political efficacy and political interest mitigate media effects. These variables mediate the relationship between the Internet and citizen participation  spectatorial, transitional, and gladiatorial.
This study analyzes the impact of the Internet, in view of these confounding variables, on three levels of citizen participation. In addition, traditional mass media and interpersonal communication were operationalized and included in the study for control purposes.
Over a period of two weeks, a survey was administered to a random sample of 626 respondents in Singapore who were at least 18 years of age. The results show that the Internet and interpersonal communication were not very important to the respondents for information on public issues. Instead, they preferred a more passive form of engagement  traditional mass media, like television. Also, levels of citizen participation were moderately low. Finally, regression analyses show that, in the Singapore context, the Internet cannot explain the level of citizen participation at all three levels. Instead, political interest and interpersonal communication were found to predict all three levels of citizen participation."
2003-0829,The Internet and Social Movements: An Exploratory Study of a Taiwanese Virtual Mobilization,Paper,The Internet and Social Movements: An Exploratory Study of a Taiwanese Virtual Mobilization,"TheInternet is becoming increasingly important as a tool used by social movements. It is used for a variety of purposes by these movements. The Website may be employed as a place to demonstrate the purposes of social movements. E-mail management lists may serve as a recruitment channel for membership in social movements. However, can actually be used to create a new form of social movement? This debate, therefore, raises fundamental issues for deliberating about the roles of information communication technology (ICT) in modern social movements.
In terms of function of organizations, the study shows the virtual social movement is an information provider and a mobilization vehicle as well. Secondly, in the analysis of the purpose of action, the paper finds that the virtual movement is still combined with elements of traditional social movements. For instance, the declaration of alliance, means we should avoid overestimating the emancipating power of technology. Most importantly, the study indicates a new type of self-reflexivity emerging from such Internet-based social movements. In terms of the e-mail content, the virtual movement member uses a common language to implement the movement. Apparently, the element of self-reflexivity should not be uniquely limited to the inflexible purpose of a movement group. Instead, the social boundary between public and private sphere in the virtual movement seems to be blurring."
2003-0830,The Internet and Traditional Media in Geo-ethnic Urban Communities: A Contextual Approach,Paper,The Internet and Traditional Media in Geo-ethnic Urban Communities: A Contextual Approach,"The current study takes an ecological approach to the issue of how the Internet is incorporated into existing communication environment. The relationship between the Internet and traditional media is explored in contexts of four ethnic communities  Whites, African Americans, Latinos and Asians. The findings indicate that the relationship between the Internet and traditional media in individuals lives varies by media type and ethnic groups. It is also found that using the Internet at home, work, schools, public sites, or commercial sties have different implications in different ethnic groups with regards to what kinds of relationship the Internet has with other traditional media."

Women¡¯s sports not only receives less media coverage than male sports but also when women athletes are covered, sex role stereotypes are often reinforced and white athletes receive more coverage than athletes of color. This study compares USA Today¡¯s coverage of the top three professional women golfers during the 1998-2001 LPGA seasons. A content analysis of 649 articles indicates that in 1998 the coverage reflected the newsworthiness of the tournament results, however in 1999 and 2001 the coverage was more likely to privilege white women athletes. The data demonstrate that the media continue to represent the dominant ideology of gendered stereotypes of women athletes to the exclusion of balanced coverage for women of color. Implications of these findings are discussed."
2003-0832,"The intertwining of advertising and editorial content in magazines: Attention, appreciation and acceptation",Paper,"The intertwining of advertising and editorial content in magazines: Attention, appreciation and acceptation","The best-known subtle advertising format in print media is the advertorial. Another form is the theme feature: an editorial feature in which brands are presented in small segments of text. This study examines attention, appreciation and acceptation of theme features and advertorials compared to traditional advertisements placed in magazines. In addition to these reactions the influence of perceived magazine characteristics was studied. A sample of 316 subscribers to 5 different magazines was part of this research. The results showed that readers paid more attention to theme features and also appreciated and accepted theme features more than advertorials, which in turn were more appreciated and accepted than advertisements. Furthermore, perceived magazine characteristics played a role in these audience reactions: attention, appreciation and acceptation of both theme features and advertorials were higher in quality and informational magazines."
2003-0833,The Korean Financial Crisis: Analyzing the performance of the Western Elite Financial Press,Paper,The Korean Financial Crisis: Analyzing the performance of the Western Elite Financial Press,"Noting market panic during the East Asian financial crisis in 1997, this paper examined the likely role of the Western elite press in initiating and aggravating financial panic. Four prestigious newspapers; the WSJ, FT, NYT, and WP were selected to examine media performance. Content analysis of 240 articles showed that the Western press had strong bias toward bad news, focused more on internal factors like corrupted political system than such external problems as structural vulnerability of market, and relied more on U.S. sources and private experts who are not immune from national and special interests each. This paper argues that media' abnormal calling attention to bad news with negative spin, lack of alternative views, and contexts free reporting all contributed to prompt herd-like behavior resulting in market collapses. Similar phenomenon repeated in followed financial crises in Russia, Brazil, and Argentine leads us to concern about the international financial information system."
2003-0834,The Land of Narrative: Journey of Discovery,Paper,The Land of Narrative: Journey of Discovery,"Stories infuse our lives and if they are well told, we never forget them. We are educated to seek information at this point in history and we have more access to it than ever before; but we dont gain information just to know, we apply information to help us understand our social world and discover who we are. We want to know who we are in case we get the chance to share ourselves with another person and meet our deepest need; to be known. Being known, either to yourself or another, doesnt just happen; it is revealed over time and through experiences as you journey through life. If you will, let us enter the world of narrative to see and understand its impact and power in our lives on our journey."

This study attempts to reveal the impact role and behavior have independently on character perceptions and level and type of viewer attraction for comic book characters, specifically examining prosocial and antisocial behavior and the hero and villain archetypal roles. The results indicate that behavior does not determine the perceived archetypal role of a character, but does influence perceived levels of characteristics associated with attraction. Assigned archetypal role was found to be a key indicator on aspects of character perception."
2003-0836,The Meaning of Roles and Relationships for Public Relations Professionals: From Public Relations Firms' Perspectives,Paper,The Meaning of Roles and Relationships for Public Relations Professionals: From Public Relations Firms' Perspectives,"This study explores how international public relations professionals at firms identify themselves and what kind of roles they play. It also examines how they manage relationships with international clients and what are difficulties and problems in those relationships based on in-depth interviews. It is important to know what these practitioners think about their job because it eventually helps client organizations understand the relationship from a different perspective. Furthermore, despite their massive roles and functions, practitioners working at firms have not received much attention. In this study I try to provide an opportunity to listen to their voice.
The findings show the participants identified themselves as consultants who contributed to more strategic tasks than technical services; however, they played both manager roles and technician roles with heavy focus on publicity. Meanwhile, the identity and position as consultants highly influenced the way they practiced as well as maintained relationships with clients. The professionals recognized the limit as outsiders; they were hardly involved in decision-making processes. In relationships with clients, they often followed whatever clients wanted to keep the relationship longer without losing the account. Although time differences and physical distances were some of the factors that made working with international clients harder, the key to the practice was maintaining good relationships with individual clients.
It is suggested that client organizations be aware of the responsibility for public relations programs and tasks; clients need to be clear with their goals and objectives before they hire public relations firms. The kind of services, technical or managerial, depends on their own directions, guidelines, and expectation. Consequently, those who hire firms should keep in mind that they have responsibilities for the outcomes and develop smart ways of fully making use of public relations firms."
2003-0837,The medias construction of consensus and the softening of authoritarianism in Singapore,Paper,The medias construction of consensus and the softening of authoritarianism in Singapore,"The logic of one-party rule is this: one-party governments can only legitimately claim to represent a consensual nation, since a fragmented nation would require multi-party representation. Analyzing the Singapore medias coverage of the Singapore 21 project, I argue that it is through the construction of a silent majority (that echoes values of the dominant party) and the dismissal of dissent as the voice of the vocal minority that allows the media to sustain the myth of national consensus on an everyday basis. This consensus is also reflected in citizens interviews, they expend considerable energy arguing with (the social expectations of) the silent majority and justifying their deviation, thereby affirming the relevance and centrality of public morality in personal lives. Through conflating state values with public morality, state coercion is rendered indirect, organic and legitimate. Through transforming state coercion as pressures to conform to Societys gaze, authoritarianism is also softened."
2003-0838,The Media's Role in Enhancing Self-Objectification and Eating Disorders,Paper,The Media's Role in Enhancing Self-Objectification and Eating Disorders,"Self-objectification is the tendency for women to evaluate themselves based on their physical appearance because they believe that this is how others judge them. Self-objectification may result in habitual monitoring of ones appearance, feelings of body shame because of the failure to meet a physical ideal, and ultimately, disordered eating as a way to improve ones appearance. Although it has been speculated that socialization agents such as the mass media teach women to self-objectify, this proposition has not been adequately tested. This study examined the role of self-objectification as a mediator of the relationship between media exposure and disordered eating among a sample of 299 White women. It found that trait self-objectification mediated the relationship between magazine reading, body shame, and bulimic tendencies."

Scholars are increasingly turning their attention to this new and important site for public relations. However, just like other organizations, countries at times face threats to their image, crises that are capable of being addressed with image repair discourse. This paper applies Image Restoration Discourse to Saudi Arabias attempt to repair its damaged reputation after the tragic events of 9/11. It was accused of supporting terrorism and of failing to support a possible U.S. attack on Iraq. Relying heavily on denial and bolstering, the image repair effort was partially successful at dispelling the first concern; it was notably less effective in responding to the second accusation."
2003-0840,The Meta-conversation: the recursive property of language as a key to organizing,Paper,The Meta-conversation: the recursive property of language as a key to organizing,"Putnam (1983) contrasts unitary and pluralistic images of organization: one organization or several, in other words? In this paper, we argue that complex modern organization is both. That it succeeds in being both one (the organization as actor) and many (all its members and their community affiliations) is explained by the phenomenon of meta-conversation: a conversation whose object is the multiple conversational worlds constituting an organization. Exploiting a narrative interpretation of sensemaking in language as our point of departure, we illustrate, using empirical data drawn from a field study, how the meta-conversation is constituted. We show how it simultaneously admits and reconstructs the local conversations of the organization into an encompassing conversation, where the identity of the organization as a whole is being continually generated. The central process at work is the production of a meta-narrative that enfolds and transcends the narratives of individual members."

Communication scholars have been at odds with determining just how the region has been portrayed, and their descriptions are not entirely uniform. But many have accused American media of taking sides in the 54-year-old conflict, and argue with their research that objectivity has been present but rare in the nations mainstream press. The following paper traces those research efforts in an attempt to establish a picture of the patterns and shifting paradigms of American media coverage of the Middle East, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
2003-0842,"The mismeasure of masculinity: The male body, race, and power in the enumerative discourses of the NFL Draft",Paper,"The mismeasure of masculinity: The male body, race, and power in the enumerative discourses of the NFL Draft","The athletic male body has long been idealized in Western civilization, and its dimensions are a key aspect of its iconic status. In this paper, we examine the discourses of the athletic male body as it is presented in the media discourses surrounding the NFL Draft. We focus specifically on the enumerative strategies used to define and delimit the bodies of football draftees. Through a close textual analysis of publications that cover the Draft, we uncover three main themes in the discursive construction of the athletes bodies: the delineation of the body in terms of its dimensions; the assessment of the bodys performance; and the bodys productivity in terms of mastery of the sport. In characterizing the athletic body strictly in terms of its relationship to physical space, the discourses invoke aspects of hegemonic masculinity related to size, strength, and the successful use of force. In addition, the deployment of quantification by white team owners and managers in the evaluation of mainly nonwhite players of lower class position, the numeric logics of the Draft reinscribe power hierarchies of race and class."
2003-0843,The Moderating Influence of Conflict Management Behaviors On Individual Stress,Paper,The Moderating Influence of Conflict Management Behaviors On Individual Stress,"Research shows that individual stress often results from interpersonal interactions. However, we argue that the manner in which people manage conflicts can increase or decrease people's stress levels. Accordingly, this study examined how conflict management behaviors affected changes in self-reported stress. We hypothesized that cooperative conflict behaviors and competitive conflict behaviors differentially moderate the association between pre-conflict stress at post-conflict stress. Conjugal couples completed pre-test measures, engaged in a problem-solving task involving conflict topics that they nominated, and completed post-test measures. Regression analyses indicated that men's, but not women's, stress indicators were correlated. In addition, competitive (but not cooperative) conflict behaviors moderated the association between T1 stress and T2 stress. This study shows that competitive conflict behaviors interact with pre-conflict stress levels to affect post-conflict stress in a way that exacerbates stress. Cooperative conflict tactics had no influence on the association between pre-conflict stress and post-conflict stress. However, the relative amount of cooperative to competitive behaviors completely diminished the effects of pre-conflict stress on post-conflict stress."

2003-0845,The Mutual Shaping of Technology and Society in Videotex Newspapers,Paper,The Mutual Shaping of Technology and Society in Videotex Newspapers,"In this paper I argue that a mutual shaping lens enables a more encompassing and dynamic account of the joint processes of technological and social change in new media than either the diffusion of innovations and social shaping of technology perspectives. Drawing from recent work in science and technology studies, I contend that the shaping and diffusion of media artifacts are so intimately tied that they should be seen as the two sides of the same innovation coin. Using examples from the history of videotex newspapers in the United States, I show that actors simultaneously pursued interdependent technological and social transformations, that this was an ongoing process in which partial outcomes in the technological domain influenced social events at a later phase--and vice-versa--and that such process was influenced by historical developments."

Press coverage is mapped in order to understand its impact on key tobacco use behaviors and policy decisions. Our textual analysis incorporates 6,332 newspaper articles from 350 U.S. daily newspapers.

Newspaper coverage reflects events occurring nationally, and at the state and local levels. It represents attitudes on the part of both the public and newsmakers. The press treatment of issues shapes popular attitudes, acts as an agent of public education, and plays an important role in determining the policy agenda (Baillie, 1996). Previous research of the coverage of particular tobacco issues has revealed patterns in terms of its content, slant and frame (Magzamen et al, 2001; Malone et al, 2000), but as yet, however, there has been little comprehensive consideration of press coverage of tobacco, and the potentially competing messages that such coverage may convey."
2003-0847,The newsreel myth of the Thor: a case study of Nazi propaganda during the Second World War,Paper,The newsreel myth of the Thor: a case study of Nazi propaganda during the Second World War,"During the Second World War, German news coverage and propaganda regarding naval matters were conditioned by two unwritten rules. The first prescribed silence on recent military achievements so as not to jeopardize ships that had carried out a successful action. The second guideline, which applied to military propaganda in general, required the hush-up of events that were likely to demoralize the home front.
When the German navy lost the auxiliary cruiser Thor during an accident that did not involve any enemy party, German propagandists decided not only to keep silent on the incident but also to pretend the Thor was still preying on Allied ships. In creating this myth they made extensive use of newsreel footage that had survived the Thor.
The case study at hand, based on investigations into existing newsreel research, published archive documents, literature and personal contacts with former Thor crew members, elaborates a hitherto underexposed example of German military propaganda. It not only focuses on newsreel reports but also takes other communication media, notably German newspapers and radio (which both depended from the so-called Wehrmachtbericht), into account."
2003-0848,The New Technology Track of USC's Jumpstart Program: A Case Study,Paper,The New Technology Track of USC's Jumpstart Program: A Case Study,"This paper focuses on one facet of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in education--their use in support of classroom instruction at the university level--by way of a case study of the Jumpstart Assistance Program for Curricular Technology at the University of Southern California's Center for Scholarly Technology (CST). Jumpstart was initiated in 1995 to provides grants, consultation, and technical implementation to faculty interested in bringing new media into their instruction.
Using Dutton's (1999) model of tele-access as a theoretical framework, and based on Web site analysis and interviews with CST staff and faculty participants, the paper considers whether and how the Jumpstart program achieved its goal of developing pedagogical innovations. Several themes emerge from the analysis of nine Jumpstart projects: increased tele-access to primary images and documents on the Web; a shift in pedagogy towards the visual and away from the verbal; a shift in student work from linear text to hyperlinked multimedia; and the asynchronicity of tele-access by the students to course information. The paper concludes that the innovations in the Jumpstart courses promote a shift from a passive to an active learning role for participating students."
2003-0849,Theoretical Model of Communication Network Use and The Effects of Social Information on Attitudes about Organizational Change,Paper,Theoretical Model of Communication Network Use and The Effects of Social Information on Attitudes about Organizational Change,"Organizational change has received growing attention along with the continuing development of office technology and todays fast-moving global business environment. However, there is still limited amount of research from communication perspectives.

Successful organizational change involves employees positive attitudes. Although social information processing (SIP) theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) suggests that employee attitudes are influenced by available social information in the office, it provides little articulation on the actual communication process including employees active communication behaviors.

In an organization, both formal and informal communication is exchanged on different types of communication networks. Not surprisingly, these types of networks are also established and maintained by electronic communication today. Using SIP theory as a theoretical framework, a new model is developed to reflect organizational reality. The new model will provide an updated communication perspective to studies on organizational change from both the individual and organizational levels."

Two hundred and fifty students completed a questionnaire measuring McCrae and Costas (1987) Big Five personality factors. Participants were then assigned to 57 groups, each of which had one hour to complete a complex decision-making task. Afterward, individual participants reported which decision rule they believed their group had used, their satisfaction with the decision, and the perceived fairness of the decision-making process. The percentage of group members who reported that their group made its decision by consensus correlated positively with average group member scores on agreeableness and negatively with average neuroticism scores. In addition, the percent reporting consensus correlated positively with average satisfaction and fairness ratings. Decision rule perceptions were not associated with independent judges ratings of the quality of group decisions."
2003-0851,Theorizing Vision at the Crossroads: the case of photography and digital imaging,Paper,Theorizing Vision at the Crossroads: the case of photography and digital imaging,"Theorizing vision at the crossroads: The case of photography and digital imaging
Introduction

Common expressions such as ""photographic vision"" or ""photographic memory"" suggest an individuals possession of a special quality for detecting or recognizing truth, non-distortion, or recall of details without will or effort. Photographic vision typically is associated with the photographers special native talent for connecting expression to the minds eye.
I argue in this paper that both highly advanced and novice practitioners of photography come to participate in the discourse of photographic vision by being socialized into photography as a domain of practice which 1) guides and inhibits a particular individuals use of the ideas, spaces, and materials and 2) provides a bounded space for challenges to these guiding standards.
In an ethnographic study of a program in photography education, (1992-1995, ) I examined ways that photographic vision was cultivated through artifact mediated collective activities of definition, and how those definitions exhibit both old and new elements as the artifacts change. This argument, in the tradition of Howard Beckers (1982) book Art Worlds positions photographic vision as a discourse, and questions several assumptions about vision as a particular form of skill defined in (bounded in?) and by the individual. I build on the discussion of the relationships between artifacts and vision outlined by Charles Keller and Janet Dixon Keller in their (1999) book on blacksmithing, and by Charles Goodwin and Marjorie Harnass Goodwin writing about Professional Vision (1992).
I discuss particular kinds of photographic vision as cultivated among experts and novices learning classical chemical darkroom photography methods in a university Visual Arts department. I compare this to the kind of vision invoked by a group pioneering the first courses offered in 1992 in the same department as digital imaging emerged as aa new way to work with photography
Goodwin and Goodwins work on ""Professional Vision"" treats vision as mediated by discourse, and as situated activity. (1995, 7). Often, discussions of the role of artifacts and social contexts in shaping human experience of vision introduce data from settings that are explicitly tradition-oriented (Keller, Dixon) or where technological change is not a focal point of the analysis (Goodwin and Goodwin).
I discuss what happens to what the Goodwins call the discourses of a profession when the artifacts supporting this discourse were changing dramatically. I asked how major technological change affected the acquisition or cultivation of particular norms of interpreting vision. I chose this research setting explicitly because a major issue for its members was the problem posed by the advent of new technologies for making photographic images.
Knocking on their studio doors were vendors, students and critics questioning the primacy and centrality of the departments curricular traditions, namely the central role of black and white, wet (chemical, darkroom, analog) photography in the program. Questions about what was going to happen (is photography dying?) what decisions should be made, (should we convert our program to accommodate or emphasize digital imaging?) and how to think about new forms of practice in teaching and art making (how do you evaluate digital art?) were all around. I was interested particularly in the sorts of standards that would evolve for evaluating digital images, especially after I participated in a series of critiques of student work in black and white photography, and experienced the rituals and traditions of the arts crit.
Stability and change in the routines of visual communication is an important theme on the borderland between photography and digital image making. My paper explores this theme with respect to photographic artists' relationships to vision when and where two radically different image making technologies come into play in the nteractions of a community of students and teachers accustomed to interacting around one well established medium and method.

2003-0852,Theory and measurement of exposure to a domestic violence prevention media campaign,Paper,Theory and measurement of exposure to a domestic violence prevention media campaign,"Recent studies have demonstrated that campaign reach is directly linked to potential for success, leading to a call for a shift in research emphasis from message design to campaign exposure. This paper introduces explanations of recall of campaigns and of potential sources of bias in measurement. The explanations are tested in a secondary analysis of data from the evaluation of a domestic violence prevention campaign comparing the determinants of credible recall and a false exposure claim. In paired multivariate analyses, both false exposure and recall are associated with radio listening, domestic violence-related beliefs and behaviors, and racial identification. However, false exposure is also associated with respondent sex and education, interviewer race and Black newspaper reading. While the difficulty of assessing exposure to a campaign is confirmed by this analysis, the distinctions found between determinants of recall and response bias provide encouragement for teasing out further differences in future."
2003-0853,The Other Other: The Chinese Peasant Girl in the Films of Zhang Yimou & Chen Kaige,Paper,The Other Other: The Chinese Peasant Girl in the Films of Zhang Yimou & Chen Kaige,"The early films of Chinese directors Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige have a recurring motif  the Chinese peasant girl. Feminist critics have asserted that Edward Saids Orientalism theories have completely excluded gender from the equation. While Said has fluently articulated race and ethnic divides, he has neglected the intersections of gender and class within society. In the absence of an occidental or Western influence, the female is almost always considered to be of lesser social standing than a male of the same culture. And if that female hails from rural roots, she is on the bottom rungs of the cultural ladder. This article examines and analyzes, in an already Oriental context, the role and symbolism of the Chinese peasant girl in Zhang and Chens films and how it illustrates contemporary Chinese society today."
2003-0854,The Other Viewing the Other: Perception of African-American stereotypes by a Japanese audience,Paper,The Other Viewing the Other: Perception of African-American stereotypes by a Japanese audience,"This research study uses focus groups to examine whether stereotypes of African-Americans are cultivated by a Japanese national audience. How do Japanese nationals perceive African-Americans given that their knowledge may be based solely on media contact? What factors play in the formation of these stereotypes? What are some of the direct and indirect effects in individual behaviors? 18 Japanese nationals-9 males, 9 females were recruited at a large, Midwestern University and interviewed in two separate sessions. The findings raise the question of possible other factors in stereotype formation, apart from pure exposure. Some form of selective retention, shaped by other external socio-cultural influences may play a significant part in shaping negative perceptions than previous quantitative studies account for. The pure focus on cultivation theory research of stereotype images needs to be complimented with other theories that examine the complexity of dealing with cross-cultural audiences."
2003-0855,The Other Woman: Stunt doubles performing womens work,Paper,The Other Woman: Stunt doubles performing womens work,"Stunt doubles perform the vast majority of the action sequences in most adventure-oriented programs on television. While a character might be adored for her looks, her wit, or her intelligence, it is herbody, the body in action that that is the most beloved by many of the action heros fans. But the medias coverage of the stars of these action programs, it is the star, not the double, who is celebrated as the strong, heroic performer.

The subtle erasure of the stunt double, or the downplaying of her role in the creation of the female action hero, is not unique. While the star is the primary actor in the role of the heroine, she does not necessarily play her in the moments of the program when the heroine is the most heroic. It is often the stunt double who animates the heroine, making her into the uniquely powerful woman that she is. What I wish to offer here is a study of the history of this simultaneous fascination with and erasure of the stunt double in the television production, within the text of these programs, with audiences through articles in the popular press, as well as with television scholars. While my point is not to cast blame, this analysis hopefully offers an examination of what virtually amounts to a unwritten conspiracy to negate the work of the stunt performer."
2003-0856,The Overestimation of Effect Sizes from F Values in Meta-Analysis: The Cause and a Solution,Paper,The Overestimation of Effect Sizes from F Values in Meta-Analysis: The Cause and a Solution,"Because estimates of effects sizes are often either misreported or not reported at all, meta-analysts must use conversion formulas that allow them to estimate effect sizes from the information available in a research report. The focus of this article is on formulas that convert F in ANOVA to eta squared, d, or the correlation coefficient. This paper demonstrates that the traditional F to r formula can differentially, and in some cases radically, inflate estimates of effect size when combining the results from studies with varying numbers of factors. Specifically, commonly used conversion formulas for converting F values to r, actually yield a partial r statistic that can be substantially larger than the desired zero-order r depending upon the number and relevance of additional factors in ANOVA. An alternative method to calculate non-partialled effect sizes according to the common formula (SSeffect/SStotal) is provided."
2003-0857,The Perceived Reality of Reality-based TV Programs,Paper,The Perceived Reality of Reality-based TV Programs,"This study investigates audience perceptions of various types of reality-based TV programs. Firstly, it reviews the existing literature on perceived reality and reality-based programming. Secondly, it reports the results of an experiment (N = 47) designed to investigate the relationship between various types of reality-based TV and the perceived reality of reality-based TV programs. Finally, the findings, implications as well as limitations of the study are discussed and ideas for future research are suggested. The results indicate that reality-based programs are not intrinsically ¡°real.¡± The ¡°perceived plausibility¡± of a program mediates the relationship between the type of program and its ¡°perceived utility.¡± This implies that the more viewers perceive a given program as real, the more likely they are to draw some useful information from it. In other words, the real test of reality is the degree of personal utility a viewer derives from a reality-based program."
2003-0858,The Perception of Online Collaboration Partners in CMC: A Social Identity Approach,Paper,The Perception of Online Collaboration Partners in CMC: A Social Identity Approach,"This study investigates the effects of social cues in collaborations with computer mediated communication systems. A distinction is made between cues that provide information about the individual (personal identity cues) and cues that convey information about group membership (social identity cues). Results show that personal cues affect impression formation in that they reduce ambiguity. However, effects of personal cues on work satisfaction and subjective performance are moderated by social identity cues. Participants who are identified with a social group do not require personal cues when the partner is an ingroup member. High identifiers expressed perceiving a higher shared identity with an ingroup partner when personal cues were absent, and this could be the process underlying the results. Implications for the use of CMC in inter- and intra-group settings (organizational as well as private) are discussed."
2003-0859,The Policy Deviation in China's New Media: A Comparative Content Analysis,Paper,The Policy Deviation in China's New Media: A Comparative Content Analysis,"This project is aimed at examining the influence of media ownership (state-owned media vs. privately-owned media) and communication channel (traditional media vs. on-line media) on media's degree of conformity to official Party ideology in China. A content analysis of four media--the Beijing Youth Daily, 21dnn.com, Phoenix Satellite TV, and sina.com--shows that communication channel has a significant main effect on media's degree of conformity while the ownership does not. Meanwhile, sina.com, a privately-owned on-line medium, was shown to be significantly more deviant from official Party ideology than the other three media. However, few news stories deviant from the Party line were found to challenge the government legitimacy above the municipal level. This finding is game-theoretically discussed
within a rational-choice paradigm in which the state and the media are assumed to be both rational players."
2003-0860,The Possibilities and Limitations of the Citizen Reporter System in Korea,Paper,The Possibilities and Limitations of the Citizen Reporter System in Korea,"This study aims to analyze the citizen reporter system, a unique phenomenon in the Korean media environment. The citizen reporter system is based not on professional reporters coverage but on ordinary citizens voluntary participation and engagement in the production of news. Through an e-mail survey and textual analysis of Web sites, the paper investigates how six online newspapers in Korea utilize this system and describes their main characteristics. It also analyzes the problems and limitations of the citizen engagement in news production."
2003-0861,The Possibilities and Limits of Self-regulation of Cyberspace,Paper,The Possibilities and Limits of Self-regulation of Cyberspace,"Self-regulation is often said to be the only means of regulation of cyberspace. This paper explores how far self-regulation can work generally, and particularly in cyberspace.
It begins by looking at various modes of regulation, viz, market, technology, government legislation and self-regulation. It then explores the meaning of self-regulation as traditionally used and currently understood, or, as contended, misunderstood. A frequent misunderstanding is that self-regulation is self-control on the part of the individual when it is industry regulating industry. Effective self-regulation requires government legislation as a backstop, an approach once called self-regulation but now called co-regulation.
The paper then draws upon examples in other industries to outline the conditions for successful self-regulation. Many of these conditions are absent from the internet currently. The paper concludes with some implications that should be noted when attempting to self-regulate aspects of the internet. (149 words)"
2003-0862,The Possibilities of Pedagogy and Philosophy:Fostering Gender Equity and Equality in the Communication Discipline,Paper,The Possibilities of Pedagogy and Philosophy:Fostering Gender Equity and Equality in the Communication Discipline,"This study utilized a feminist perspective to examine how communication teachers talked about gender issues in their introductory communication classes and displayed gender equity and equality in their pedagogical practices. The two primary methods of data collection were in-depth interviews and participant observation. Participants were recruited from seven academic institutions located in midwestern communities. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted and three hours of classroom time were observed for each study participant. The following six themes emerged through the data analysis process: (1) historical traditions, (2) course standardization, (3) patriarchal language, (4) neutral positioning, (5) authority, and (6) technological prowess. These themes revealed how gender was marginalized and minimized in the talk and teaching practices of many of my research participants who instructed basic courses. Such marginalization may perpetuate disparities in the academic experiences of male and female students taking introductory communication courses. Even though the preservation of white patriarchy was common in many research participants' talk and teaching practices, data were reported from two critically reflective teachers who disrupted patriarchal ideologies in their basic courses and as a consequence achieved greater gender equity and equality."
2003-0863,The Power of Discourse In an Organizational Conflict Negotiation,Paper,The Power of Discourse In an Organizational Conflict Negotiation,"In line with Foucault's (1977, 1980, 1994) ideas, I illustrate the importance of studying power in organizational conflict negotiations from a discourse perspective on a micro level by interpreting language use in a specific instance of labor-management bargaining in this paper. My aim with this study is to present scholars with an exemplar for conducting this type of micro-level critical discourse analysis. My analysis suggests that the meaning of certain key knowledge/truth constructs like ""discipline,"" ""company policy,"" ""consistency,"" and ""trust"" are not as fixed in the negotiation as they appear to be, but are communicatively negotiated between labor and management during the course of the collective bargaining. My interpretation therefore supports Foucault's claim that power relationships are maintained, reinforced, or altered via discursive formations and suggests that a negotiation can truly be a negotiation over meaning (Putnam, van Hoeven, & Bullis, 1991). To conclude, I discuss my findings in light of previous research."
2003-0864,The Pragmatics of Communication as a Borderland: Transcending Tolerance,Paper,The Pragmatics of Communication as a Borderland: Transcending Tolerance,"This essay will explore ""tolerance"" in its application to rhetorical communities as a form of social capital within the broader context of a revived North American pragmatism. A review of communication-based literatures reveals that the building and sustaining of communities is perceived to be aided by an ethos of ""tolerance"" as applied social capital. The metaphor of ""communication as a borderland"" suggests, however, the weak character of this ethos. The melding that takes place in a borderland--the simultaneity of mixing, even as distinctions are held--better calls to mind an ethos of transcendence. This essay, then, will argue for supplanting ""tolerance"" with an ethic of ""transcendence"" in theorizations of community, civic communication, and public deliberation."
2003-0865,The Problematic Relationship between Journalists and Public Relations Practitioners in Government and Business,Paper,The Problematic Relationship between Journalists and Public Relations Practitioners in Government and Business,"Journalists and public relations practitioners in government and business need each other and this suggests a symbiotic relationship of mutual dependence. The relationship between the two communication professions, however, is under pressure. Two factors seem to be important here: the increasing professionalism of the management of the news on the side of the communicators, and the explosive growth in media supply that resulted in an increased competition between journalists and an intense contest for the news.
Our research studies how journalists and PR officials perceive their mutual relationship, how they evaluate the goals and methods of both professions, and how they evaluate the quality of the reporting in the media.
To answer these questions, we surveyed a representative sample of (Dutch) journalists and PR officials in government and business (N=791).
Our research aims to contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between the professions that are responsible for our daily news, and of the possible positive and negative effects thereof."

To do so, the study employs a dual methodology, performing a narrative reading and investigating audiences responses to Charmed. The process of developmental empowerment, defined as empowerment based on cumulative knowledge and experience, is linked to third-wave feminist discourse. Audience responses recognized this process of empowerment, but also identified two key disempowering elements in the text that surface as consequences of empowerment. Ultimately, implications of the intersection of empowerment, disempowerment, third-wave feminism and witchcraft are explored."
2003-0867,The Psychological Appeal of Personalized Online Content: An Experimental Investigation of Customized Web Portals,Paper,The Psychological Appeal of Personalized Online Content: An Experimental Investigation of Customized Web Portals,"The evolution of technologyespecially the information revolution generated by the advent of the World Wide Webhas witnessed increased, and more effective, dissemination of individualized media messages. It is conceivable that users who are exposed to highly customized Web portals may be psychologically affected by customized messages. A between-participants experiment (N = 60) employing an ordinal-level operationalization of customization (low, medium, high) was designed to examine the hypothesis that greater levels of customization lead to increased perceptions of relevance, involvement, interactivity, community, and novelty, which in turn lead to a more positive attitude toward the portal. The results indicate that higher levels of customization result in more positive attitudes toward the portal, and this relationship is mediated by users' perceptions of relevance, involvement, interactivity, and novelty. In addition, customization also has behavioral effects because it affects users' Web browsing activity. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed."
2003-0868,The Relationship between Attitudes toward Foreign Language Study and Cross-Cultural Attitudes,Paper,The Relationship between Attitudes toward Foreign Language Study and Cross-Cultural Attitudes,"This study investigated the relationship between attitudes toward foreign language study (a general attitude toward language study; attitudes toward specific languages--Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish; and instrumental and integrative attitudes) and cross-cultural attitudes (world-mindedness and social distance). The results of a survey of U.S. college students (N = 151) indicated that (1) a general attitude toward foreign language study was significantly related to world-mindedness and social distance, (2) attitudes toward Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish were significantly related to both world-mindedness and social distance, whereas an attitude toward French was not significantly related to either world-mindedness or social distance, and (3) integrative attitude was significantly related to social distance, whereas instrumental attitude was not significantly related to either world-mindedness or social distance. These results are discussed for their pedagogical implications."
2003-0869,The Relationship between Fashion Magazine Consumption and Body Satisfaction in Women: Who is most at risk of influence?,Paper,The Relationship between Fashion Magazine Consumption and Body Satisfaction in Women: Who is most at risk of influence?,"Based on principles related to the self-concept, social comparison theory, self-discrepancy theory, and cultivation theory, this study predicted that increases in exposure to mediated ideal bodies would be associated with a greater likelihood to hold beauty-related beliefs consistent with those presented in mainstream media. The study further predicted that, by altering the fidelity of the relationship between the ought self and the ideal self, individual difference variables (i.e., bmi, self-monitoring, intrasexual competitiveness, and self-efficacy) would interact with fashion magazine consumption to affect body satisfaction. To test these predictions, 202 undergraduate women completed a survey during class time. Results revealed that fashion magazine consumption was positively correlated with beauty-related beliefs. While fashion magazine consumption did not directly predict body satisfaction, body mass and self-efficacy were direct predictors of body satisfaction. Self-monitoring interacted with body weight and fashion magazine consumption to influence body satisfaction, as did competitiveness. The implications of these results, as well as suggestions for future research, are discussed."
2003-0870,The Relative Effect of Television and Print News: Semantic Overlap Versus Reading Control,Paper,The Relative Effect of Television and Print News: Semantic Overlap Versus Reading Control,A study of the relative effectiveness of television and print to transmit news information was undertaken by exposing 100 university students to television stories that contained different text-picture formats and by comparing memory for these versions to other participants memory for the same news presented in print. The study was designed to retest the validity of two rival explanations for the relative effectiveness of television and print news (the reading control hypothesis versus the semantic overlap hypothesis). Results of a cued-recall test were in favor of the semantic overlap hypothesis. The study suggests that higher levels of semantic overlap between verbal and visual information on television news are decisive for the relative effectiveness of television and print.

Abstract


Few studies have examined the role of media in summit meetings between the leaders of nations. This study seeks to understand how media shape the presentation of issues at summit meetings by applying Lance Bennetts Indexing Hypothesis. The Indexing Hypothesis states that the press will include a range of voices in stories that mirrors or indexes those voices in mainstream governmental debate. Alternative voices will appear in the press, Bennett explains, only in negative interpretative contexts. While Bennett contends that this hypothesis only applies to everyday events, this study questions whether a similar indexing pattern would appear at summit meetings  special events.
As predicted, Bennetts Indexing Hypothesis explained only a portion of the press coverage of the summit. However, the study offers suggestions for a revision of the hypothesis to include special events, which would predict a wider, but still limited range of voices in public debate."
2003-0872,The rise and assassination of a charismatic party leader just before the Dutch elections: support for Pim Fortuyn in the news and in public opinion,Paper,The rise and assassination of a charismatic party leader just before the Dutch elections: support for Pim Fortuyn in the news and in public opinion,"Pim Fortuyn became the party leader of a new party, Leefbaar Nederland, in November 2001. In February 2001 he was kicked out of the party because of his extreme opinions (The Islam is a backwards culture). He raised a new party, the LPF (Lijst Pim Fortuyn). In the opinion polls the new party rose fast. One and a half week before the elections of May 15th 2002 Fortuyn was murdered by an extreme vegetarian. Still the LPF gained 26 seats in the 150-seats Parliament, but the ChristianDemocrats did win even more. From a bare 30 seats in the polls they ended on 43 seats.
This paper analyzes the news in the Netherlands in 5 newspapers and 3 television stations from the moment on Pim Fortuyn became the leader of Leefbaar Nederland. The news in each newspaper and in each television news program was assigned as a set of contextual variables to the readers of and the watchers of these particular media in an 8 wave panel survey. A network analysis of the news shows that the political position of the CDA was structural equivalent to the position of the LPF, albeit that the criticisms of the CDA on the government coalition were not as extreme. A LISREL-model of the effects of the news on party preferences on the respondents who read this specific news or watched this specific news shows that news on the own issues of the various parties was important, as well as support from societal groups. The model shows also that the perceived performance of a party leader in the news was an important mediating variable to explain party preferences."
2003-0873,The Role of Family Communication on Organizational Knowledge and Organizational Assimilation: A Case Study,Paper,The Role of Family Communication on Organizational Knowledge and Organizational Assimilation: A Case Study,"The purpose of this case study was to examine the effect of family communication on organizational knowledge and organizational assimilation. Firefighters (N=181) were surveyed in a large city in the western United States comparing assimilation and organizational knowledge levels for those with family members in the organization to those who did not have family in the organization. A structural model indicated that family communications impact on organizational assimilation was not mediated through organizational knowledge, however, family communication was a predictor of assimilation while tenure was not. These findings point to a need for further research on the impact of family communication on assimilation into particular organizations. The paper concludes with theoretical implications related to predictors of organizational assimilation."
2003-0874,The Role of General Interaction Rules and Frequency of Casual Interaction in Marital Quality,Paper,The Role of General Interaction Rules and Frequency of Casual Interaction in Marital Quality,"The purpose of this study was to examine features of social interaction that permit relationship behaviors to work smoothly. Specifically we proposed that two features of interaction, frequency of casual interaction and reliance on interaction rules contribute significantly to assessments of marital quality. Findings indicate that although each of these features certainly is associated with trust, liking, satisfaction, and commitment, reliance on basic interaction rules plays the most important role."
2003-0875,The Role of Imagination in Popular History,Paper,The Role of Imagination in Popular History,"This paper examines the role of imagination in collective memory. By fostering affect, identification, and engagement with historical narratives, imagination is a crucial yet under-explored factor in the production of collective memory. Moreover, affect in general has generally been disdained in much the way the importance of sentiment has been dismissed throughout popular culture. Looking at magic moments  moments of intense identification with historical narratives  experienced by American Civil War reenactors illustrates both the problems and the possibilities inherent in affective engagement with the past. Such engagement is the product of imaginative work. In deploying both central and acentral imagination, reenactors effectively blend their knowledge base with their own physical and emotional experiences to produce a highly meaningful, personal connection with history. While this personalization of the past can be prone the distortion of individual biases, it can also result in nuanced, politically aware readings of the past as well."
2003-0876,The Role of Propaganda Posters in the Political History of the New China,Paper,The Role of Propaganda Posters in the Political History of the New China,"Propaganda posters played an instrumental role in the political history of the New China since 1949. The massive use of propaganda posters in political movements in China could be attributed to several prominent reasons. First, a significant proportion of Chinese populace had been illiterate or semi-illiterate. Visual communication rather than written documents may be the only successful means to reach them. Two, because of its distinctive audient immediacy, visual communication promises greater cognitive penetrability. Third, Chinese people have a long tradition of pictorial messages as manifested in the folk arts of Nianhua (New Years Posters) and paper-cuts. Propaganda posters, therefore, are in conformity with Chinese peoples cultural habits.

With the illustration of actual propaganda posters from different political periods in the New Chinas history, this work explains the instrumental role of such visual communication in political movements. This work also makes the contention that propaganda posters played a quasi-television role in the pre-television age in China, and that, even today when television is pervasive, propaganda posters still play a role irreplaceable by television in Chinas political realm."
2003-0877,"The Role of Site Features, User Attributes, and Information Verification Behaviors on the Perceived Credibility of Web-based Information",Paper,"The Role of Site Features, User Attributes, and Information Verification Behaviors on the Perceived Credibility of Web-based Information","This study extends research on the credibility of Web-based information by exploring the role of site features, user attributes, and information verification behaviors across different types of Web sites, as assessed by users working in a relatively naturalistic environment. Data from 574 participants are used to assess perceptions of message, site, and sponsor credibility; to explore the extent and effects of verifying Web-based information; and to measure the relative influence of sponsor and design features. Results show that, for the most part, (news) media organization sites tend to be perceived to be more credible than electronic commerce sites and special interest group sites, which were viewed as more credible than personal Web sites. Findings also suggest that sponsor credibility may transfer from familiar entities to their Web sites, that site credibility can be achieved equally by familiar and unfamiliar sources, and that messages residing on sites may be viewed similarly in terms of their perceived credibility, regardless of the source that issues them. Contrary to expectations, a significant negative relation between self-report verification of site information and perceived credibility was discovered, indicating that reported verification does not match actual online behavior. These and other findings are discussed and several avenues for theoretical development of perceptions of Web credibility are presented."
2003-0878,"The Smile of Mona Lisa: Race, Gender and the Shaping of Consumer Television in India",Paper,"The Smile of Mona Lisa: Race, Gender and the Shaping of Consumer Television in India","This paper examines the neocolonial discourses and desires that surrounded the birth of consumer television in India in the late 1980s by analyzing policy statements, advertisements, and popular responses to the medium. This historical period marked Indias transition from a state-led planned economy to its fuller integration into the global economic by 1991. I demonstrate how state-owned television as a commodity, as a medium, and as a new discourse of representation, played a significant role in transforming the ideologies of consumption and desire, rewriting gender and racial politics, and re-imagining the nation in ways that decisively departed from the postcolonial development agenda. Television was advertised through racially hybrid images that signified transnational masculine productive power and oriented desires towards westernization/ whiteness. The reception of the medium reflected anxieties that coalesced around westernization of national culture, gender modernization, and class conflict. These contradictions were partly resolved by constituting the consuming family as the legitimate citizen-subjects of the televisual nation, excluding classes and communities on whose behalf television was first introduced in India."
2003-0879,The Social and Cultural Shaping of Music Technology,Paper,The Social and Cultural Shaping of Music Technology,"Popular discourse is filled with news about the widespread change wrought by Internet music technologies. Music and technology have been entwined in a close relationship for millennia. Yet in the communication literature the relationship between music and technology is ill defined. There is a disconnect between music research and theories of technological change. I argue that a social and cultural shaping of technology perspective can help bridge this gap. This perspective accentuates the social and cultural factors influencing technological change, and eschews both technological determinism and linear development models. For the history of the phonograph and early recording technology challenges the assumption that technology is predetermined from singular technologies, events, or actors. I will present an account of early Internet music technology based on primary historical research, which suggests that Internet music emerged from a confluence of disparate actors and events. These applications support the theoretical efficacy of the social and cultural shaping perspective for music and technology studies."
2003-0880,The Social Construction of Intercultural Identity of being Korean in the United States: An analysis of the influence of communicative interactions on identities of Korean-American students.,Paper,The Social Construction of Intercultural Identity of being Korean in the United States: An analysis of the influence of communicative interactions on identities of Korean-American students.,"Cultural identity is constructed through dynamic interplay of daily discourses and cultural activities in specific social contexts. In other words, identity should be regarded not as a fixed abstraction, but as a result of ongoing processes of negotiation, in which past experiences and history of the self interact with present, everyday life.
A thick analysis based on six-month participant observations and interviews in two Korean-American student communities -- at Rutgers University, NJ and at the University of Texas at Austin, TX -- was undertaken in order to situate the research participants identity construction processes. This study examines Korean-American students ethnic identity in terms of peer group, family, and media influence. By doing so, this study analyzes their identity negotiation processes as they engage in diverse cultural and communicative contacts. Although they were born and grew up in the United States, most of the interviewees at both universities expressed that they were Korean (or Korean-American) rather than American. Also, it was found that their family played an important role in teaching them Korean language and Korean customs in the early period of identity construction. More importantly, Korean videos and mobile phone were the main media through which these Korean-Americans learned about Korean culture and society. In addition, the Internet became another important medium for allowing Korean-American students more access to their heritage culture."
2003-0881,"The Spears Paradox: Binary Britney's Negotiation for Power among the Patriarchy, Feminism and Turn-of-the-Century Girl Culture",Paper,"The Spears Paradox: Binary Britney's Negotiation for Power among the Patriarchy, Feminism and Turn-of-the-Century Girl Culture","Using political economic and feminist theories, this paper explores the operation of power and the extent to which mediated discourse about Britney Spears, including magazine and television samples, articulates ideologies associated with third-wave feminisms girl culture. Through a seven-step approach to discourse analysis, six themes are identified in mediated discourse about Spears. These themes include: girl, woman, virgin, sex symbol, entertainer, and private person, which provide three avenues to Spears power: sexuality, economic clout, and ambiguity. Spears power, which is manifested in mediated discourse about her, articulates ideologies that are associated with girl culture through a web of contradictions. In other words, mediated discourse about Spears defines Spears paradoxically, while it expresses girl culture ideologies. Additionally, this research further verifies the need for continued studies of the girl culture movement and its relationship to the advancement of the feminist agenda."

Building on an earlier, 49-category, four-node, context-based model of ICT use, we analyze interviews with experienced users to learn the reasons for their sequences. The paper extends these individual strategies and the ICT model by displaying 24 different sequences possible from the four nodes of the model. When placed in a dynamic relationship, these nodes appear to vary in intensity and lose their distinctiveness, showing that sequence as a process changes the nature of its content. The key conclusion we draw from the likeness of our category nodes is that when these nodes are placed in a dynamic flow, the differences that were clear when the model was static suddenly fall away and the nodes begin to look more alike, as if theyre morphing into one another. It appears that they could almost be substituted for each other and the effects would remain the same."
2003-0884,The Subject of Adorno,Paper,The Subject of Adorno,"ABSTRACT: The Subject of Adorno
David Sholle, Miami University (Ohio)

The millennial moment has past; the postmodern moment (1968?) is now a faint glimmer; Capitalisms next war, however, looms in the future. Yet, in Cultural Studies it is the same old new game modernity must be churned under to make way for the new subject. Under the heading Late extra, Adorno writes,
The cult of the new, and thus the idea of modernity, is a rebellion against the fact that there is no longer anything new. The never-changing quality of machine-produced goods, the lattice of socialization that enmeshes and assimilates equally objects and the view of them, converts everything encountered into what always was, a fortuitous specimen of a species, the doppel-ganger of a model. The layer of unpremeditatedness, freedom from intentions, on which alone intentions flourish, seems consumed. Of it the idea of newness dreams. Itself unattainable, newness installs itself in the place of overthrown divinity amidst the first consciousness of the decay of experience. But its concept remains chained to that sickness, as its abstraction attests, impotently reaching for a receding concreteness. . . Today the appeal to newness, of no matter what kind, provided only that it is archaic enough, has become universal. . . Mankind, despairing of its reproduction, unconsciously projects its wish for survival into the chimera of the thing never known, but this resembles death. Such a chimera points to the downfall of an all-embracing constitution which virtually no longer needs its members.

In these terse lines Adorno expresses a desire to move beyond modernitys aporias, while at the same time recognizing that goal as unattainable. Contemporary cultural studies has tended to altogether dismiss such a goal and the conception of the subject upon which it is based. The critique of modernity and in particular the Cartesian cogito is presently the assumed jumping off place for cultural studies notion of the subject. Predominantly, this involves accepting the so-called poststructuralist1 death of the subject, and concurrently the rejection of dialectics in favor of the immediacy of the particular and the dispersion of forces.
Why bother with the subject? Because, how we conceive of the subject impacts the entire project of cultural studies: particularly, its conception of the limits of the present capitalist social formation and its strategies for social change and the support of freedom.
But how has Cultural studies taken up the subject? I will first describe two counterpoised projects within cultural studies in regard to the subject: 1) a populist cultural studies approach which, although positing a fragmented subject with floating identities, nevertheless anchors this subject in an active agency. 2) a contemporary cultural studies approach which unhinges the subject even further in favor of the notion of pure multiplicity. I will then counter this with Theodore Adornos approach to the subject which I claim avoids both alternatives: it neither accepts wholesale the active autonomous self, nor does it eliminate entirely the terrain of subjectivity.
I realize that I am carrying out a cultural heresy here, for it has by now become almost a requirement for every primer on cultural studies to contain a statement ridiculing Adorno and the Frankfurt School for their elitist, mandarin, modernist position which chastises the audience while monolithically positing a homogeneous deterministic mass media. Where Adorno is taken up it is to re-interpret aspects of his work in some poststructuralist guise, whether Derridian, Deleuzian, etc. It is the argument of this paper that Adorno is still valuable, not despite his modernism, nor because of some forced affinities with contemporary French theory, but precisely in and through his modernist defense of the subject.
A. Cultural Studies: Two Approaches
I. Populist
The work that I will describe as populist cultural studies is a particular configuration of the cultural studies position that is part of a larger movement in audience study originally identified with John Fiske and others. This ""reading for resistance"" approach was ceremonially2 dismissed in the 90s, but the conceptions of audience, subject, resistance and play upon which it was based persist in the more sophisticated versions that have followed. Within this approach, it is the knowledge that the audience possesses that is at question, and so the discipline constructs knowledge of a knowing subject (a subject that it, itself, has constructed). I will attempt to show how such a position mirrors empirical social psychology in constructing a particular kind of subject-- one invested in producing its own subjectivity.
By employing a complex vocabulary of discursive positions, multiple subjectivities, nomadic agency, articulations, polysemic textuality, forms of empowerment, and so on, cultural studies submerges its mirroring of the possessive individualism of liberal pluralism and the resulting rejection of Marxist class analysis.. But here, contradictions abound. Cultural studies, when emphasizing the multiplicity of subject positions that make class a secondary category, uses precisely the notion of the split subject; but when that subject becomes a popular audience member in activity, all of a sudden, the subject is whole and self-reflective in a rather transparent way. One way of overcoming this contradiction is by shifting the focus from cognitive activity to affective activity. I will attempt to show how this move simply replaces one side of the supposed modernist binaries (identity/difference) with the other.

II. Poststructuralist Cultural Studies

The critique of the epistemic subject engendered by Marx (through Hegel) is rejected by poststructuralist cultural studies. For Marx, the spectator model of the self is replaced with the notion of the producing self that fabricates objectivity through its own historical activity. As Benhabib notes, Marx, sees the task of reflection neither as the withdrawal from the world nor as access to clarity and distinctness, but as the rendering conscious of those unconscious forces of history and society which have shaped the human psyche. Although generated by the subject, these forces necessarily escape its memory, control and conduct. The goal of reflection is emancipation from self-incurred bondage.
Poststructuralist Cultural Studies unhinges this mode of critique by replacing the reflective (the realm of consciousness) with the linguistic (the realm of language). Thus, the subject is replaced by a system of structures, oppositions and differences which are not viewed as products of a living subjectivity at all. Here we have the full death of the subject. In this light, the various poststructuralisms from Foucault to Derrida have been instrumental in uncovering the forms of domination latent in Western cultures conception of self and other. For this, we can be thankful, but often the way this critique of the subject is carried out leads to a dead end, which I hope to show lies in a proto-metaphysics or ontology.
At any rate, I will agree with Adorno, that the Subject that should be critiqued is not simply the subject of discourse, but the subject formed in relation to social historical conditions. So for Adorno, yes, the subject is enclosed by the objective, but he refuses to denounce subjectivity as inherently dominative. Yes, the historical conditions within which the subject has formed have led to a compulsive identity, but the way out is not through a simple renunciation of self-identity. As Dews points out, Adorno held that the undifferentiated state before the subjects formation was the dread of the blind web of nature, that if the subject is liquidated rather than sublated in a higher form, the effect would be regression.
Poststructuralist thought in taking the oppressive self-enclosure of consciousness to be the only possibility for subjectivity remains trapped in the philosophy of consciousness, for the only option is the chaotic affirmation of the diffuse and heterogeneous. Such dispersion of the self merely enacts what Adorno takes to be the central aspect of capitalist socialitythe compulsive self is opened up only to be reinscribed in the indifference of the commodity form. The dispersed, transnational, flexible capitalism of the 21st century no longer needs a fixed subject, in fact, it needs a decentered onea subject characterized by openness to ambiguity and the ability to carry out multiple individual projects in a mode of anti-collective, anti-sociality.

ADORNO
What is evident in Adornos work is his constant critique of the self-standing subject and of the liberal pluralism upon which it is based. Adorno is in agreement with post-structuralism in his criticism of the illusory autonomy of the bourgeois subject. Adorno's refusal to surrender subjectivity in the face of his strenuous critique of it distinguishes Adorno from poststructural theory and provides the basis for the continued relevance of his thought.
As Zuidervaart attests, Adorno's Theory is crucial in developing a critical understanding of the task of imagining the world differently, other than it is: ""There can be no horizon for dramatic historical change unless people can imagine and enact something other than the prevailing modes of reality and reason. And for such imagination and such enactment, there must be semblances of subjectivity.

I will attempt to show that:
One Adornos work avoids the irony of the poststructuralist approach, following Nietzsche, i.e., that it posits that the structures of knowledge are constitutive of the object, albeit falsely. It thus re-inscribes a kind of idealism. Adorno, attempts to avoid this, by retaining the subjective principle, while critiquing its historical form. As he says, we must use the force of the subject to break through the deception of constitutive subjectivity.
Two The poststructuralist ontology is one in which the contingent and the particular are immediate, and incapable of conceptualization. But for Adorno, this opposition of the chaotic to the conceptual is falsepure singularity is itself an abstraction.
The opposition of the stable to the chaotic, and the domination of nature, would never have succeeded without an element of stability in the dominated, which would otherwise incessantly give the lie to the subject. Completely casting away that element and localizing it solely in the subject is no less hubris than absolutizing the schemata of the conceptual order sheer chaos, to which reflective spirit downgrades the world for the sake of its own total power, is just as much a project of spirit as the cosmos it sets up as an object of reverence.  Adorno, Negative Dialectics

Thus, what post-structuralism mistakes for immediacy is in fact highly mediated. Some recent cultural studies has adopted the poststructuralist dismissal of mediation, seeing it under the suspect Hegelian model of the synthesis of opposites. For Adorno, mediation never synthesizes contradictions, nor is it simply the way the self preserves its identity. Rather, where Adorno sees a contradiction there is already the identity of identity and non-identity. Mediation is not a transcendental operation or an act of self-enclosed consciousness, but as Jameson says it characterizes the way our spectatorship and our praxis alike construct portions of the world with a view to changing them.
For Adorno, the experience of the contradiction of Hegel (in which the non-identical in the object is reduced to a reflection of the subject) sparks off a second reflection in which the non-identical is no longer viewed as the isolated particular, the particular is now seen as standing in a pattern of relations to other particulars, a historically sedimented constellation. Thus, for Adorno there is no permanent antagonism between conceptual thought and reality, the problem is that within present social relations the concept is given primacy.
Three Ultimately, Adorno wants to reconceptualize the subject as capable of acknowledging its own moment of non-identity. Poststructualism, on the other hand, in rejecting any reflective consciousness, sees the ego or self as only capable of exclusion, thus, the only option is to reject this supposed unity of self-consciousness in favor of a dispersal of intensities, a metaphysics of desiring machines, or the indifference of boundless flux. Adorno, like the poststructuralists, sees the failure of modernity in its denial of the body, the sensuous and material existence, but for Adorno the mere affirmation of these non-identical others is no solution.
For Adorno, compulsive identity must be historically situated and treated dialectically. Despite the domination that it engenders, it was necessary (as a form of self-preservation) in order for human beings to liberate themselves from blind subjection to nature. To this extent such identity contains a moment of freedom. There is a necessary interdependence of identity and non-identity in the constitution of the self. Subjectivity is a problem of social relationsthe relation to the other is constitutive of subjectivity. The problem with the poststructuralist subject is that it is so entirely dehistoricized that it cannot be called upon to take up a role in the context of revolutionary agency. The roots of this lie in the Nietzschian destruction of any relation between interest, agency and knowledge.
Four And so Adornos critical theory is the antithesis of postmodernism and poststructuralism, for he calls for the intensification of self-reflection and reflective questioning. The unitary, controlling subject can be overcome only through subjectivization, not through its limiting. Adornos negative dialectics is the conduct of self-suspending thought, it is the self-consciousness of the objective context of delusion; it does not mean to have escaped that context. In this section, I will detail Adornos critique of identity thinking.
Further, for Adorno, the subject-object relation cannot be eliminated, it can only be reconfigured. Adornos tack in this regard is to give predominance to the object. The subject does not constitute the object, yet subject and object do mediate each other. A reconciliation of subject-object would involve, as Adorno says: Neither the undistinguished unity of subject and object nor their antithetical hostility. In its proper place, even epistemologically, the relationship of subject and object would lie in the realization of peace among humans as well as between humans and their other. Peace is the state of distinctness without domination, with the distinct participating in each other. Thus, Adornos conception of subjectivity is what Martin Jay calls a three-starred constellation: collective subjectivity, individual subjectivity and the objective world each take up their rightful place in a dialectic of mutually supportive non-identity. So, it is the restoration of difference and non-identity to their proper place in the non-hierarchical constellation of subjective and objective forces that he called Peace.
Five Adorno sees identity thinking as reflecting a social situation in which mental labor is effectively split from manual labor ( a relation which I plan to relate to current conceptions of information labor and cyberspace). When Adorno speaks of the priority of the object he is referring to the body, to the relations with others and to the material configurations of exchange and class. Adorno refers to a rational identity of the subject, by which he means 1)consciousness of the non-identical and 2) solidarity (through reflective memory) with those who have suffered. But Adorno would further claim that any utopian reconciliation would require first or rather simultaneously a dismantling of the social formation that has constructed the antagonism between subject and object. Adorno opens the possibility for another form of subjectivity, one that does not yet fully exist as a collective habit because the concrete form of social life to which it corresponds has not yet come into being.


The need to lend a voice to suffering is a condition of truth. --Adorno


1 I hesitate to characterize contemporary theory rooted in the work of Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, Lyotard, Butler, etc. as poststructuralist, because most of these theorists disclaim the term. However, within cultural studies as it exists within communication, poststructuralism is used to characterize the bulk of this work. Therefore I will use the term under this qualification.
2 I mean ceremonially in the sense that this was carried out in ritual form at specific occasions formally conceived as defining the field of cultural studies."

This study posits and tests for a mutually reinforcing positive reciprocal relationship between television and newspaper public affairs use. Combined 1992, 1996, and 2000 American National Election Study (ANES) survey data (N = 6006) are used to test for this relationship via Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). A simultaneous positive reciprocal relationship is found to exist between these two forms of public affairs media use, providing evidence to a lingering question that has been often assumed but never directly tested. Ramifications of this finding for studies analyzing both forms of public affairs media use are outlined."

It positions the U.S. evening news as a form of popular public discourse informative of dominant ideologies about race, ethnicity and the imagined nation. Through a case study analysis of the Elián González controversy, this study problematizes the journalistic discursive practices used to construct Latinidad through televisual representations of the Cuban American community. This paper theorizes that while the post-colonial hybridity of Latina/o identity vexes mainstream U.S. narratives of identity, dominant narratives about Latina/os are always produced against the ideological context of whiteness resulting in mainstream stories that work to symbolically colonize already marginalized groups."
2003-0888,The Textualizing Function of Writing for Organizational Change,Paper,The Textualizing Function of Writing for Organizational Change,Conversation and writing are two communicative media that hold different cultural meanings in organizations as members have preferences for which media should be used in which situations. In this paper I examine how writing serves a textualizing function in the accomplishment of organizational change. The data set consists of conversational transcripts and written documents collected during a nine-month long study of a project team at a high-tech corporation. Results show that written forms that create general truths out of individual experiences help both to create a space for organizational change to occur and to create the change as an object to be distributed and consumed by organizational members. Writing down weaknesses opened a space for the team to refer to in later meetings as topics for change. Changes later discussed were themselves textualized in written form. The project suggests that writing is a significant stabilizing practice in the achievement of organizational change.

The present study shows how variables involved in Ognianovas model apply in a country such as Moldova, one of the poorest and most turbulent of the former Soviet republics. Findings indicate that the economic, legal, and political changes enveloping Moldova fit within the transitional framework.

Moldovan newspapers, too, exhibited many of the characteristics found in the transitional model, including the concurrent operation of several press philosophies. Some newspapers followed the communist or authoritarian concept, eagerly joined forces with a political party or the government, and relishing the opportunity to become political leaders in the debates going on in the newly independent nation. Other newspapers, which were initially forced by economic necessity to court subsidies from the government or a political party, exhibited traits of the democratic socialist, and even the libertarian concept, by putting the needs of the countrys readership ahead of partisanship."

The paper begins by charting the troubled position of subaltern women in a variety of Western discourses, including Western feminist discourses.

This study also seeks to investigate the constellation of perceptions that are associated with subsequent judgments of deceit. Finally, potential miscommunication that can occur between members of different cultural orientations due to misaligned perceptions will be investigated. Findings from a host of prior cross-cultural studies suggest that those of differing cultural orientations are likely to possess differing motivations for deceiving and truthtelling, and as a consequence, are likely to exhibit differing perceptions toward deceptive and truthful messages. To test the proposed theoretical relationships, participants (N=240) were solicited from the United States (n=120) and Japan (n=120) to rate the transcribed verbal content of both deceptive and truthful messages generated by both American and Japanese subjects in a prior cross-cultural study of deceptive behavior. All participants were instructed to review and evaluate two out of a total of 40 transcribed dyadic interactions that were recorded as part of an earlier cross-cultural experiment investigating nonverbal behaviors under deception. For both transcripts reviewed, participants rated the verbal content of each transcript along the dimensions of: politeness, friendliness, formality, conventionality, and directness. They were also asked to rate their perceptions of the favorableness and deceptiveness of the verbal contents of each transcript. The proposed experimental method and corresponding statistical analyses are discussed in further detail in this paper."

Rather than attempting to demonstrate how a show like Survivor naturalizes the competitive aspects of life in contemporary capitalist society, I suggest an alternative reading: Survivor stages our self-conscious awareness of the artifice of social relations. Furthermore, it enacts the failure of those versions of ideology critique which rely on de-mystification as a progressive political strategy. We can no longer rely on the notion that de-fetishizing social relations will render them more amenable to shared collective control. The disturbing reality of postmodern ideology is that even when the natural character of the fetish is debunked, the fetish nevertheless retains its efficacy. Instead of crumbling capitalist hegemony, undermined by the retreating faith in its central narratives, we are faced with a resurgence of the ultimate modernist force: the productive power of the capitalist automaton, forging ahead, oblivious of the fact that its been unmasked. The pastiche of tribal life portrayed by Survivor stages this neat overlap of the pre- and post-modern."

In a first step, a conceptual model based on existing hypotheses was developed, and in a second step, this model was tested using a sample of 360 parent-child (8- to 12-year-olds) dyads. Using structural equation modeling, our findings showed that advertising was positively and directly related to childrens purchase requests and materialism. It was also positively, though indirectly (mediated by advertising-induced purchase requests), related to family conflict, disappointment, and life dissatisfaction. Parent-child consumer communication and parental mediation of advertising were important moderators of the effects of advertising on childrens purchase requests and materialism."
2003-0894,The Use of Community-Based Interventions (CBIs) to Reduce the Barriers of Severely Constrained Publics,Paper,The Use of Community-Based Interventions (CBIs) to Reduce the Barriers of Severely Constrained Publics,"According to the situational theory of publics (J. E. Grunig, 1997), practitioners can identify their most strategic constituencies by identifying publics who are most likely to influence their organizations and publics who their organizations actions will affect. Some publics are too constrained to participate in activism, however. In this paper, we examine the use of community-based interventions (CBIs) to build community infrastructure in regions where severely constrained publics reside. This strategy could result in reducing the number of severely constrained publics and increasing the amount of activism. In turn, increased activism drives organizations toward the Excellence model of public relations (L. A. Grunig, 1992). Planning CBIs therefore benefits severely constrained publics as well as the practice of public relations."
2003-0895,The use of Image-Induction for Increased Rates of Compliance,Paper,The use of Image-Induction for Increased Rates of Compliance,"Simply stated, image-induction posits that one can manipulate a person¡¯s self-image in order to gain compliance. Because source-suggested self-images work to create a desire to behave in accordance with a particular view of one¡¯s self, influencing a person¡¯s self-perception through suggestion enables persuaders to achieve increased compliance with requests associated with receiver¡¯s salient self-images.
By testing image-induction under various conditions (using non-pro-social requests; effects of face-to-face implementation vs. non-interpersonal text-based implementation; and changes in constructs from a willingness to try to new things to helpfulness) this study attempted to better understand the relationship between the use of image-induction and subsequent increases in compliance.
The results clearly indicate that the addition of an image-inducing question is associated with increased rates of compliance when compared to a control group. This trend was most noticeable among subjects in the interview portion of the experiment where it was theorized public commitment to the initial question would produce a stronger drive towards compliance. The theory also held true for the non-interpersonal text-based portion of the experiment. Subjects who were asked to comply with a request did so less often than those who received an image-inducing question prior to the request. Subjects not given the image-inducing question tended to comply with similar rates of acquiescence regardless of the construct (helpfulness or willingness to try new things) or format (interview or non-interpersonal text-based). The addition of an image-inducing question in the interview portion of the experiment tended to gain similar rates of compliance without regard to theoretical construct. The same was true for the non-interpersonal text-based version of the image-inducing constructs. Using the image-induction strategy was demonstrated to be more effective however in the interview portion of the experiment."

Research questions were examined in an experimental setting in which 199 students were randomly assigned to represent one of four groups involved in a simulated recreation management dispute. Analysis revealed considerable disagreement regarding the power and trustworthiness of most groups, with self-assessments being consistently higher than aggregate evaluations. Findings indicate that in-group favoring biases can have a substantial impact on the relationship between agreement and accuracy, and that this influence needs to be taken into account when employing a coorientational approach."

The survey used a mixed mode of mail drop and online survey to obtain statistics about the Internet users. Households were selected probabilistically using a multi-stage stratified sampling method. A letter was then dropped and the person whose birthday was closest to the date of the mail drop was invited to participate in the online survey. A prize of S$500 (US$285) was given to a lucky respondent. The findings were then compared with the 4th IT Household Survey, which had been conducted earlier. Key demographic findings in the present survey matched that in the earlier survey. This suggests that the method was effective as a means to conduct a valid online survey. Besides the faster turnaround time through bypassing the keying in of raw data, the online survey also cost a third of what it would have cost had a similar survey been done face-to-face.

2003-0898,The Veil has Fallen: Gender and Media Representations of Islam,Paper,The Veil has Fallen: Gender and Media Representations of Islam,"Compelling images in international media delineate the connections and fractures that characterize the contemporary world. In this paper I analyse media representations of Islam in South Africa, the US and Britain, examining the recurring figures of the veiled Eastern woman and masked Eastern men. The paper attends particularly to the role of gender in shaping understandings of an Orientalist East, tracing patterns of imagery from the colonial era to their continued impact in the contemporary era. By attending to gender and history, the paper outlines a visual vocabulary through which the East has conventionally been pictured.

The media theorist John Hartley (1996) claims that ""journalism is the most important textual system in the world because, beyond providing information, it leads us to understand the world in particular ways. Significantly, despite the international reach of media organizations, the media still creates a sense of belonging drawn on national lines. Hartley argues that the media provide a ""national, political fantasy"", and through it, a sense of community. Reading the media of different countries allows one to see who is inside and who is outside of these fantasized communities. Gender provides a crucial category and method of analysis of such mediated fantasies.

Because media representations calibrate gaps and emphases in public debates, they carry enormous power, especially during moments of social stress and conflict. By closely attending to the histories and impact of media imagery, as scholars I hope we may better be able to contribute to urgent current debates about human rights."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential values of the Internet use data and examine the validity of the Internet use data by comparing server-side data set and client-side data recording from identical Internet users. As a result of the triangulation of two datasets, we could recommend research designs and propose analysis schemes."

Using coverage of this issue in three national dailies, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post, from 1995-2002, this paper explores the dominant frames used to tell this story and attempts to understand the positive representation of the student activists by the news media. This positive media attention contrasts with dominant theories about the relationship between social movements and the news media. The implications of this contrasting case for other ongoing social movements are considered."
2003-0902,Third Gatekeeping in Korea:Screening First Edition Newspapers by PR Practitioners,Paper,Third Gatekeeping in Korea:Screening First Edition Newspapers by PR Practitioners,"This study analyzed the practice of reviewing the first edition of newspapers by public relations practitioners in Korean organizations. These practitioners frequently follow up their screening process by asking journalists to make changes and deletions in their next editions, and can be considered yet another form of news gatekeeping.
Research was based on in-depth interviews with public relations practitioners in Korean corporations and government agencies. Articles in the Korean press watchdog Media Today were also analyzed. From this data, we developing a typology of the form by which ¡°third gatekeeping¡± takes place.
We conclude that through their task of screening first edition newspapers, public relations practitioners serve as gatekeepers even after newspapers are published.
The study also provides a basis for a critical approach toward first edition screening, one that goes beyond the existing gatekeeping viewpoint and offers suggestions for how to modify its impact on Korean news content."
2003-0903,Third-Person Effects in the Aftermath of Terrorism,Paper,Third-Person Effects in the Aftermath of Terrorism,"We examined third-person effects in the context of television coverage of terrorist-related stories in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Whereas third-person research suggests the magnitude of perceptual bias is the important predictor of behavioral intention, such as restrictions of media content, the uses and gratifications model suggests perceptual bias is one influence amid other influential individual differences. We examined whether exposure to terrorist-related TV stories, locus of control, experience with crime, viewing motivation, third-person perceptual bias, and two viewer social attitudesfear and faith in otherswork in concert to predict support for restrictions aimed at combating terrorist activity. Path analysis revealed direct and indirect links among audience predictors and third-person perceptual bias, and between perceptual bias and social attitudes. However, there was no direct link between third-person perceptual bias and support for policies aimed at combating terrorism. Because locus of control and viewer motives were important antecedents of third-person perceptual bias, and perceptual bias was linked with fear, the borders of third-person research should be expanded to examine a wider range of media effects."
2003-0904,Third World Women's Communicative Experiences and Perseptions of Upward Mobility in the Corporate World: Africa,Paper,Third World Women's Communicative Experiences and Perseptions of Upward Mobility in the Corporate World: Africa,"The current literature review employs a feminist approach to explore theoretical frameworks relevant in explaining womens under-representation, their experiences and perceptions of upward mobility within organizations. Using feminist research as a backdrop, I will draw on three perspectives to try to explicate the current situation of womens upward mobility in organizations. And, since there is a dearth of literature on Third World (African) women and their organizational experiences, I can only accomplish this literature review by drawing on literature that focuses on women in North America and other industrialized worlds. The organization structure perspective, the gender-centered perspective, and the gender-organization system perspective are the three approaches within which this literature review is framed. Organizational mentoring and its implications for Third World womens upward mobility is a fourth trajectory that is also relevant to this study. Qualitative interpretive approaches will be employed as a means of data collection. These will include in-depth interviews, observation and document analysis of the two corporations chosen for this study. Note this is an ongoing dissertation research: a literature review."

In the present study, participants played a video game and were exposed to advertising logos, varying in the horizontal and vertical distance from the primary focal area. There were three levels of repetitions. The results indicated that horizontal distance and number of repetition affected recognition significantly while vertical distance did not. There was a three-way interaction among the factors, suggesting that at low numbers of repetitions, ads closer to the focal area on both axes were especially well encoded. User attention to the primary task negatively encoding, whereas gaming experience facilitated message encoding. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing and the limited capacity model of mediated message processing."
2003-0906,'Three Represents' and China's Youth: Using the Internet to Manage Social Change,Paper,'Three Represents' and China's Youth: Using the Internet to Manage Social Change,"This article explores the relationship between the Chinese Governments new social policy, the Internet and youth development. Implementation of the Three Represents Theory indicates that the Chinese Government is moving from a directive, top-down approach to managing social development and towards a more consultative, interactive style using the Internet as a new medium to access and respond to youth cultural ruptures in the fabric of Chinese society. The article draws on the emerging genre of grunge and shock literature to illustrate the types of cultural ruptures concerning the Government in relation to the direction of youth development. Responding to the change, the Government has begun to utilize several characteristics of the Internet to efficiently consult and interact with youth by linking into the popularity of this controlled new media technology to access youth and provide immediate information on issues. The result is that the Government is potentially more responsive to emerging youth issues relating to structures, values and roles in Chinas changing social milieu."
2003-0907,To Be A Patriot Or To Be A Journalist,Paper,To Be A Patriot Or To Be A Journalist,"Mass media are supposed to help knock down borders and barriers between people on the opposite side and bring about more understanding in this world. But in reality, more often than not, the opposite is true especially regarding international communication. This paper discusses the coverage of the U.S.-China air collision by the New York Times and the China Daily. The major dispute of the whole incident was about where the borderline should be drawn. National sovereignty is generally recognized worldwide and is supposed to be indisputable. But the coverage of the two papers made Chinese sovereignty murky and made readers wonder where exactly Chinese sovereignty extends and ends and where American rights start. Caught in the borderline dispute, journalists ethics was put to test. A combined quantitative and qualitative study of the coverage shows that journalists were unable to transcend national, political and ideological boundaries to remain neutral in the coverage of the incident. The resulting biased versions of the incident further divide people on opposite side of the border rather than bringing more understanding between them."
2003-0908,To Be or Not To Be: The Ontological Project of the Modern,Paper,To Be or Not To Be: The Ontological Project of the Modern,"This study investigates the identification process of the modern telecommunications professional as a reflexive process of adaptation to the prototypical characteristics of the modern economy. The data for this study focuses upon the accounts of telecommunications professionals concerning their experiences in the new economy, within multiple telecommunications organizations, and within an educational program. This study then, first contributes to previous understandings of the technical professional identity. A second contribution to theory emerges as these accounts reveal an interdependence of the rules, resources, and routines of professional identity structure. The routines participants described in their work processes and in continuing their education are meaningful for individuals in terms of their ontological security; routines are the means through which professionals prepare for and secure their future role as a professional. This work extends understandings of both identity as a structure (Scott, Corman, and Cheney, 1998) and how knowledge directly connects to the identity structure."
2003-0909,Today's Digital Divide in the United States: Inclusion of Individuals with Disabilities,Paper,Today's Digital Divide in the United States: Inclusion of Individuals with Disabilities,"Beginning with a powerful statement offered by Tim Berners-Lee, this paper defines the issues of Internet accessibility and usability pertinent to individuals with disabilities. With over 54 million individuals in the United States suffering with disabilities, focus and priority must be given to ensure that computer and Internet accessibility are ubiquitous. This paper is based upon three premises, the first of which states that access to a computer does not indicate accessibility for the disabled. Significant difference exists between access and accessibility. The second premise states that access to a computer does not mean access to the Internet. Even when an individual obtains accessible usage of a personal computer, several issues arise when he/she is faced with the issue of connectivity. Persons with a disability are only half as likely to have Internet access either from home or some other location than those without any disability. The final and most crucial aspect of this paper is website accessibility. Premise three states that access to the Internet does not by any means imply effective usage of the content by individuals with disabilities. Through a simple content analysis on various Websites, it becomes apparent just how much change must take place in order for the disabled to effectively utilize the Internet."

After reviewing a series of documents on the migration, it was observed that in the analyzed phenomenon it lacked a study perspective: the vision that the migrant has of himself, the explanation that the own actor gives to the situation, before this was defined that the object of study of this project would be: The social imaginary and its relation with the migration of the inhabitants of Tala, Jalisco, towards the United States, subject that what looks for to deepen in the statistics, the hard data do not show clearly the motivations of the migration; that is to say, that in the reviewed studies considers the migration as a phenomenon whose main causes are the poverty and unemployment; nevertheless, it was observed that next to these reasons others of subjective nature coexisted, such as: the desire of adventure, the necessity to participate in a male rite , the illusion to support the family or fleeing from a repressive family and social situation"
2003-0911,Toward a Communication-Centered Measure of Organizational Identification: Reconceptualization and Initial Scale Development of the C-OI,Paper,Toward a Communication-Centered Measure of Organizational Identification: Reconceptualization and Initial Scale Development of the C-OI,"This paper offers a re-conceptualization of the organizational identification (OI) construct that directly addresses the communicative nature of identification by focusing on both internal and external behaviors (sending, receiving, interaction, and nonverbal) displaying solidarity with the organization. This construct is relabeled communicative organizational identification, or C-OI. This framework is then used to organize scale items-pulled from existing measures as well as generated specifically for this effort-for potential inclusion in a C-OI measure. In light of recent calls for a moratorium on the most popularly-used measure of OI in organizational communication (Cheney's OIQ), scale development efforts for OI are perhaps needed more so today than in the 20+ years since this measure was first developed."

The author suggests that TPM power is the primary determining force in future large-scale technological developments. TPM power is conceptualized as a three-dimensional phenomenon, with technical, political, and voting powers as its co-dimensions. Based on existing literatures and personal observation, the author discusses three key networks of active stakeholders (the technologists, the government, and the activists), as well as twelve propositions that describe nine power resources (technical credibility, moral authority, communication competence, and etc.) in relations to TPM power and its co-dimensions. A three-dimensional visual model and a mathematical equation are also included to describe TPM power. The author concludes that future technological infrastructure will be shaped by networks of stakeholders who can successfully manipulate power resources to influence policy outcomes."

Organizational relations and boundaries in general, and the porosity and permeability of boundaries in particular are examined. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted. Both perspectives of structural sociology and economic rationality involving organizational networks serve as theoretical foundations. In addition, the perspective of cross-cultural psychology is adopted with emphasis on individualistic and collectivistic cultural syndromes. The following four aspects concerning organizational boundaries are explored cross-culturally: 1) self, identity, and role in the organizational setting, 2) psychological boundary porosity between self and organization, 3) boundary (relation) ties and porosity between an organization and its stakeholders, and 4) norms of boundary relationships and reciprocity."
2003-0914,Toward a Meaning-Centered Approach to Attributions Regarding Interpersonal Conflict,Paper,Toward a Meaning-Centered Approach to Attributions Regarding Interpersonal Conflict,"This study is an examination of interpersonal conflict using meaning-based attributions about messages. The processes associated with making attributions about one's own messages and the messages communicated by others are explored. We sought to validate an underlying assumption of attribution processes -- that message making is a common form of human behavior, therefore, we should attribute messages to ourselves and others as a part of making sense out of our interpersonal interactions and relationships, regardless of whether or not those messages were actually communicated during an exchange. Participants completed surveys after a conflict with either a friend or romantic relationship partner that included both scales measuring power, interdependence and satisfaction, and open-ended questions about their perceptions of the conflict and the message strategies enacted by both themselves and their partner. The responses were coded using a typology of compliance-gaining strategies. Results indicate a large degree of consistency in the responses of participants, and that emotional reactions to the conflict are overwhelmingly negative. However, the results also suggest that conflict participants are able to make message-based attributions about their partner's behavior during the conflict as well as their own."
2003-0915,Toward an Integrated Model of Postmerger Organizational Identification,Paper,Toward an Integrated Model of Postmerger Organizational Identification,"Identification in merged organizations is an understudied area in the current field of organizational identification research. van Knippenberg and van Leeumans (2001) social identity model of postmerger identification is the only existing model that examines identification processes in postmerger organizations. An integrated model has yet to be developed to provide insights into the complex, dynamic identification processes in postmerger organizations. In this paper, we expand their social identity model into an integrated model of postmerger organizational identification, importing insights from Ashforth and Maels (1989) social identity model of organizational identification, Mael and Ashforths (1992) reformulated model of organizational identification, and Dutton, Dukerich, and Harquails (1994) model of member identification. The model is tested using a case study of the merger between former Peking University and Beijing Medical University that happened in 2000. We briefly discuss the history of Chinas higher educational field and the on-going merging trend. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected for this study. The potential implications of this study are also explored."

This is in keeping with calls for a renewed theorization of the audience (Schiller 1996: 193) in media cultural studies. Also addressed are some issues from anthropology and ethnographic research that have come up in my own study or which could help in future studies. I argue in particular that the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1977, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992) and Anthony Giddens (1979, 1991a, 1991b) can help overcome some of the problems of audience research, just as the work of Williams, as extended by Dan Schiller, can help place audience research within the sociology of culture, or the study of society (Schiller 1996, Williams 1977, 1981)."

This paper provides a critical analysis of medium theorys explorations of communication technologies and semioticss inquiry into the meaning of texts. The two fields have traditionally held oppositional views regarding concepts such as media, interpretation, and content. It is the purpose of this study to bridge these two worlds. Through clarification and synthesis, it will be argued, semioticians will gain a sense of technological effects, as well as the importance of the medium when reading content on that medium. Alternatively, this will give medium theorists a better appreciation regarding the importance of the quest for meaning and the driving need for dynamic interpretation of texts. Finally, it is argued that, at heart, medium theorists are followers of the tenets of semiotics. A bridge linking these two theoretical structures will allow for a more coherent and significantly holistic understanding of the media environment, both in McLuhans sense of media as messages and semioticians view of messages framed within the media."
2003-0918,Towards an Ethnographic Approach to International Communication Theory,Paper,Towards an Ethnographic Approach to International Communication Theory,"This paper explores the history and regional trajectories of media ethnography, as well as the epistemological and political issues of representation that have confronted anthropology and which are relevant to media studies. The authors argue that rethinking the limits and potential of media ethnography to address cultural consumption also necessarily involves considering how ethnography can serve to engage and engender a vision of international communication theory grounded in the practices of everyday life. This reconceptualization of international communication is crucial at a time when some media scholars celebrate difference via micro assessments of postcolonial locales and the plurality of cultures without attempting to consider global structural concerns. In fact, thus authors argue, if media ethnographies are rigorously developed they can offer international communication theory with the material to bridge the gap between meaning and structure without losing site of the complexity, context and inherent power imbalances of cultural consumption."
2003-0919,Towards an Interactional Model of the Communication of Forgiveness,Paper,Towards an Interactional Model of the Communication of Forgiveness,"Given the potential benefits of forgiveness, it seems important to describe how forgiveness is communicated in order to more clearly understand this important aspect of human behavior. This paper offers an overview of the existing literature on forgiveness and highlights several important gaps in our current conceptualization of forgiveness. Next, I propose a model that contributes towards an interactional understanding of the communication of forgiveness. This new model of forgiveness responds to two components of forgiveness that are not explored in the current literature: (1) an assesment of the emphasis that is placed on pre-offense closeness between the forgiver and the transgressor; and (2) the mutual influence of face-to-face interaction and communication during a forgiveness episode."

William Jamess radical empiricism has been entirely ignored by both critics and advocates of pragmatist approaches to communication. This essay examines how Jamess radical empiricism demolishes the modern assumptions of scientism, psychologism, and mechanism, and by extension, theories based on John Lockes model of communication. I suggest Jamess formulation of indeterminacy articulates a central problem in contemporary communication theory: incommensurability. To this end, I examine briefly three post-positivist theories of communication  Pearce & Cronens Coordinated Management of Meaning, Habermass Theory of Communicative Action, and Moscos Political Economy of Communication  to see how their philosophies of communication handle indeterminacy. A close textual reading of Jamess initial approach to indeterminacy as chaos is provided and I argue James reformulates this as the problem of incommensurability in his radical empiricism. This is offered as a first step in the reconstruction of a pragmatist philosophy of communication as it is elaborated after Jamess death in the works of Mead and Dewey."
2003-0921,Towards Factors Contributing to Integrative Conflict Resolution: A Cross-Cultural Perspective,Paper,Towards Factors Contributing to Integrative Conflict Resolution: A Cross-Cultural Perspective,"The purpose of this paper is to articulate a framework that depicts factors contributing to integrative conflict resolution. The integrative strategy and third-party mediation receive special attention in this paper because these two strategies shed light on breeding cooperation and resolving conflict. The following factors inherent in conflict are investigated as an analytical framework: the source ad nature of conflict, the level of conflict and participants involved, power and resource, the role of time and relation continuity, and cost and consequence. Moreover, the perspective of cross-cultural psychology is adopted with emphasis on individualistic and collectivistic cultural syndromes, for further understanding cultural factors contributing to conflict resolution. Essentially, the Far-eastern culture that emphasizes authority, order, harmony, loyalty and personal relationship and guanxi, in contrast to American tradition that values individualism, goal attainment, constructive conflict, and independent-self orientation, help explain the nuances and complexity of the cross-cultural conflict resolution."
2003-0922,'Towards Understanding the Stunt Girl',Paper,'Towards Understanding the Stunt Girl',"Stunt girls have been understood traditionally as being part of the rise of sensationalism within newspapers at the end of the nineteenth century. This paper, instead, considers the stunt girl as a subject position involving a set of practices and ways of writing that risk traditional understandings of femininity and journalism. The risks these women took in transgressing these lines turned their public personas into spectacles, while simultaneously rendering them vulnerable to misunderstanding, scolding and scandals. Using articulation and feminist theory, it seeks to redress conventional approaches that devalue womens contributions by maintaining divisions between hard and soft news forms by considering the whole newspaper as it was understood and used by readers. The stunt girl wowed her readers with her journalistic exploits that traversed the world and spoke to the changing role of women within the public spaces of late Victorian society. She helped to popularize a new set of journalistic principles that survive today, including personal journalism, investigative practices, and an ongoing dialogue about what the concept of newsworthiness meant to women readers."
2003-0923,Tracking Messy Organization-Public Conflicts: Exploring the Natural History of Conflict Management through the News Coverage of Unfolding Cases,Paper,Tracking Messy Organization-Public Conflicts: Exploring the Natural History of Conflict Management through the News Coverage of Unfolding Cases,"Through the content analyses of news coverage, seven unsuccessful conflict resolution cases provides a natural history of the use of the contingency theory in public relations. The content analysis tracked the changing stances of five profit organizations (Enron, Napster, Philip Morris, McDonalds, Monsanto) and two non-profit institutions (Boy Scouts, Catholic Church) moving on the continuum from pure advocacy to pure accommodation, in response to a number of contingent factors that can just as readily move an organization toward accommodation as toward advocacy. Employing conflict and conflict resolution models from the conflict studies literature to advance the contingency theory in public relations, results confirm that perspectives of an organization and its public change over time. Both an organization and its public in each conflict demonstrated overall advocacy, but non-profit institutions and the public showed more neutral stance than profit organizations and the public. Both parties employed contending strategy dominantly during the conflict management process, but the aspect was less obvious for non-profit organizations and the public than profit institutions and the public. The news frame for the changing aspects over time were associated predominantly by the contingent factors, external threats, industrial environment, organizations characteristics and issues."

These selected TV dramas are dramatizing the fantasy, producing the popular knowledge, and projecting the apprehension of a yet-to-be realized modernity in post-socialist China. In the particular historical juncture in the late 1990s, Hong Kong, as a higher modernity at the doorstep of Mainland China, serves as a metaphor, an anchor, or a point of reference for the Chinese ethno-mediascape to embody the fantasy, knowledge and anxiety of modernization and marketization."
2003-0925,Transcending Borders in Television Drama: the role of ethnic representation in shaping multicultural national identity.,Paper,Transcending Borders in Television Drama: the role of ethnic representation in shaping multicultural national identity.,"This paper explores the role the television series play in presenting ethnic identities on commercial television. The paper draws on the work conducted by the Amsterdam School of Communications Research and the author¡¯s own studies of multicultural dramas in Australia. The paper highlights the countries¡¯ patterns of representation and how the dynamic process between these various representations contribute to a respective multicultural national identity.

While, de Bruin reviews and analyses the portrayal of ethnic representation after the program has been televised, the author has taken her experiences as the script editor on the Australian television drama series, Heartbreak High, to analyze the processes behind the creation of these ethnic characters and storylines.

The paper identifies three case studies from the youth drama to show the different methods by which ethnicity is portrayed and contextualized in commercial television. While the Dutch and Australian case studies are taken from different sides of production fence (pre- and post-production), the conclusion is clear: television drama can make a positive contribution to multicultural identity by diverse and complex representations."

was used to analyze data collected from an international sample (N=212) of
Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program alumni to explore the relationship
between a sojourn and the sojourners self-efficacy in intercultural and
everyday communication. Participants were asked to answer questions about
their degree of self-efficacy both before their sojourn in Japan and now. Data
analysis revealed that 195 of the sample reported an increase in self-efficacy.
The results suggest a relationship exists between sojourning and an increase in
self-efficacy in intercultural and everyday communication. In addition, data
analysis showed the more respondents rated their overseas experience as
challenging, the more they reported a self-efficacy increase. Correlations
were also found between self-reported success of the sojourn and scores of
perceived self-efficacy."

Herbert Altschulls Marxist approach have been widely used as general theoretical frameworks to examine press systems in the Marxist world in general and China in particular. Though a growing literature suggested significant changes in Chinese journalism in the past two decades, very few have sent a direct challenge to the two models theoretical wisdom through the Chinese case. Unsatisfied with this situation, this paper found neither of the two models is sufficient in conceptualizing the Chinese case as a result of Chinese news medias transitional nature and the two models inner theoretical flaws as normative press theories. Furthermore, realizing the growing conflict between normative media theories and accelerated post-Cold War global media transformation, this paper suggests a transitional media approach to revisit the traditional normative media approach and calls for a more systematic study of the transitional phenomenon of global media systems."
2003-0928,"Trials, Errors, and Revised Trials: Incrementalism and Policymaking on Television Violence",Paper,"Trials, Errors, and Revised Trials: Incrementalism and Policymaking on Television Violence","Violence in television programs and the negative effects that violence is supposed to have on viewers have been longstanding concerns for policymakers. Since the early days of television, congressional committees have periodically held hearings on television violence and what can be done about it. However, it took nearly forty years for legislation dealing with television violence to be enacted into law. Further, the laws that have been enacted do not appear to have been particularly effective in achieving their intended purposes.
Why has all the interest and activity in regards to television violence achieved so little in terms of results? The incremental model of policymaking provides a possible explanation. That model predicts that most policy changes are likely to be small, and offers reasons for why this might be so. This paper applies the incremental model to congressional policymaking on television violence to answer the question posed above."

Building Communications Capacity with Women NGO 's

By Doe Mayer, Barbara Pillsbury and Muadi Mukenge

This essay presents a case study of Women Connect! a five year effort
designed to help 30 women's NGOs in Zimbabwe, Uganda and Zambia be more
strategic and participatory in their use of communication and thereby
increase their overall effectiveness. Women Connect! provided technical
assistance, ran workshops and awarded small grants in support of
traditional media (such as posters and pamphlets) , mass media ( radio,
newspapers and theatre )and new technology (especially email and the
Internet). The groups worked primarily in women's reproductive and
sexual health areas including the prevention of HIV/AIDS and domestic
abuse. The article shows how these groups used communication tools and
strategies to become more successful in disseminating health
information, delivering services and advocating for improvement in
women's lives. It sets forth and discusses critical issues in the
collaboration between northern organizations and southern NGOs. It also
presents highlights, results, lessons learned, key findings from an
external evaluation and recommendations
for future efforts to support women NGOs in developing countries."
2003-0930,Understanding Inactive Publics: An Exemplar Audience Study in the Arts,Paper,Understanding Inactive Publics: An Exemplar Audience Study in the Arts,"A prominent theme in the current public relations literature is the building of relationships between organizations and their publics. Of particular concern for a number of scholars is the ethical dimension of these relationships, including an emphasis on the dynamics of power between organizations and their publics. A second, as yet minor, theme in the literature is the issue of active versus inactive publics and the lack of scholarly attention the latter group has received to date. The audience study presented in this paper situates itself across these two concerns. Based on in-depth interviews with respondents who would be considered low on both knowledge and involvement with the arts, i.e., members of inactive publics, a modified grounded-theory approach was used to identify emergent themes. Results are presented based on a conceptual organization of how the arts helped versus how they hindered in the context of informants everyday lives."

Seven adjuncts from three higher education institutions (community college, liberal arts university, and research university) and two disciplines (English and Business) were interviewed regarding their lived experiences and social understandings of part-time. Their themes of lived experiences are: (1) how they fit part-time work into life overall; (2) how they explain/account for being part-time or being an adjunct to others; (3) their perceived acceptance by others concerning their part-time work; and (4) how they experience tension between membership and anonymity in the academic community. Each adjunct presented a unique social understanding of the conceptual nature of part-time, which supports the identity of part-time being constituted through blended borderlands of self, work, and society."

This study employs narrative methodology in order to understand the lived experience of five students who have been victims of racist hate speech on campus. Thematic analysis of in-depth, conversational interview data was used to find commonalties in the interviewees experiences. The literature review includes contextual and historical information on racism and a definition of racist hate speech. Emergent themes from these narrative interviews were found in regard to victims experiences of racist hate speech. Those themes are discussed in the order of the interviewees experience: (1) indignation, (2) recognition of being stereotyped, (3) recognition of being a target of ethnic resentment, and (4) recognition of being a target of ethnic superiority. The victims experiences illustrate that racist hate speech is not only talk, but can be experienced through other communicative actions such as whispering comments, physical avoidance, and forms of eye contact."

The courses would have a team of instructors who would coordinate content and assignments, such that students would be encouraged to register for both courses in which the content and requirements would overlap. The goal (and hope) was to improve the student experience by emphasizing the reciprocal relationship between research and theory in a way that would spark student interest in learning and participating in both conducting research and refining or developing theory. What happened was that the courses were coordinated in terms of several assignments that focused upon a joint research project conducted by student teams whose members were representative of students registered in theory and research. This paper documents this unusual effort in experiential teaching methods."
2003-0934,Universal Access: What Have we Learned from the E-Rate?,Paper,Universal Access: What Have we Learned from the E-Rate?,"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 mandated discounts for high speed connectivity for schools, libraries, and rural health care centers. Innovative although somewhat complex mechanisms were developed to implement this mandate. Five years after the E-rate (as it came to be known) was implemented, what have we learned?

This paper examines some of the innovative features of the E-rate and how they have been implemented, such as:
· The discounts go to the end user (school, library, rural hospital, etc.), rather than directly to a carrier;
· Discounts are based on a combination of demographic and geographical factors;
· Educational connectivity is defined as access to the classroom, not just the school, resulting in subsidies for local networking and equipment;
· Schools must develop an approved technology plan before they are eligible for the discount;
· Entities eligible for discounts post requirements and receive bids through an interactive website.

This paper also examines issues including:
· Possible reasons for disparity in take-up of the subsidies, even among states with significant disadvantaged and/or rural populations;
· Whether schools and libraries have in fact served as anchor tenants to attract incumbent carriers or new entrants to provide broadband services in previously unserved communities;
· Whether the model of empowering the end user (rather than directly subsidizing a carrier) has proved viable;
· Whether schools and/or libraries could extend access to residents in otherwise unserved communities.

The paper also includes a case study on E-rate implementation in Alaska (which has the countrys highest E-rate take-up rate), including a review of the implications for rural areas of a waiver granted to Alaska that provides a mechanism for extending the schools access to the community. The paper concludes with an analysis of how these lessons might be relevant for other countries considering a mechanism to subsidize community or institutional Internet access."
2003-0935,UNVEILING THE VEIL: GENDERED DISCOURSES AND THE (IN)VISIBILITY OF THE FEMALE BODY IN FRANCE,Paper,UNVEILING THE VEIL: GENDERED DISCOURSES AND THE (IN)VISIBILITY OF THE FEMALE BODY IN FRANCE,"Much of the discussion that surrounded the question of the veil in France, following the 1989 in-famous affaire du foulard, has been couched in terms of restricting binaries: secularism-Islam; Us-Them; East-West. There have been few attempts to look at the resurgence of the veil among Muslim schoolgirls in French public schools outside of the politicized discourse of Islam is reversing the colonizing process. There has been only sporadic reflection on the significance of dress, and other bodily markers, in the contestation and re-negotiation of group identities within conflicting cultural spaces. Rather, the predominant discourse, which is consistent with the Orientalist mystique of the Orient as the Other, has revolved around the threat Islam and its dress code pose to the cultural integrity of French society.
The underlying premise behind such a parochial interpretation is the notion of identity as a bounded, already completed entity. This is mainly due to the limiting political discourse that has surrounded the veil affair ever since it was made public. Following Stuart Halls argument that identities are contextual and relational positionings which are never fixed but always in process, I argue that the young womens decision to wear the veil should not be viewed, exclusively, as a religious statement with an intent to subvert the status quo in French society. Dress is an important marker of difference, and highlighting ones religious, cultural, or social difference is expected in a context of marginalization and racism. In this paper, I will probe the cultural specifics as well as the political complexities that form the background of this affair."

International air traffic has played an important role in the recent globalization. Many pilots and air-traffic controllers whose native languages are not English are important part of it. As the common communicative tool, English proficiency is a crucial prerequisite for them to participate in the field. However, fatal accidents due to miscommunication involving limited English proficiency have still occurred. The paper first reviews some salient aviation accidents to critically analyze how communication breakdowns occurred in non-native-English-speaking environment. It then introduces some attempts to avoid such communication breakdowns and analyzes limitations of those attempts. Finally, the paper proposes few suggestions for the non-native English-speaking aviation personnel to achieve a safer environment."

This content analysis revisits its study in the general election of 2000 when public journalism has had a decade to develop, and also examines it from the perspective of photography and graphic design. This study found that public journalism in newspapers used more graphic elements to convey issues and analysis, common ground and solutions, and to present information that citizens can use to contact the media than did traditional journalism. But it did not translate mobilizing information or views of citizens into graphic form more frequently than non-public journalism stories, nor did it use more photographs of citizens than candidates, officials, and experts."

A representative U.S. sample of 387 respondents who read both printed newspapers and online news answered questions used in past uses and gratifications studies. The sets of gratification dimensions for each news medium were the same, lending construct validity to the measures. Findings indicated no differences between offline and online evaluations in the entertainment and interpersonal communication gratification dimensions. However, respondents exhibited greater scanning for online news use and greater skimming for newspaper use. The study conceptualized the ¡§information learning¡¨ and ¡§surveillance¡¨ gratifications to reflect a behavior-centric approach to offline and online news use."

By Guadalupe Victorica
The objective is to explore, describe and explain variables related to the use of Internet by students for educational purposes . The samples included Students, Teachers and Mothers of students. Of the five studies, four are quantitative. The data was colleted in Monterrey N.L. , Mexico from 2000 to 2002.

Traditionally students rely highly on each other to do school work in Mexico. Students agree that they like and are used to work in groups. Regardless of using Internet they prefer to work in groups. Students agree that if they have to choose they would like to work individually if Internet is available than work in groups if Internet is not available.
Internet has become a useful tool for school assignments. Students and Teachers trust and have confidence that Internet is a good educational tool. Mothers have high expectations in the use of Internet by their children for school purposes. They see the need for parents to supervise the use of Internet of their children but they say they do not. Students and Teachers need more direction and training in the use of Internet. Teachers need to incorporate de use of Internet sites in class room assignments.
There is a need to evaluate the use of Internet by students and Teachers for educational purposes in Mexico."
2003-0940,Using the Rhetorical Turn to Grasp the Full Importance of Public Relations,Paper,Using the Rhetorical Turn to Grasp the Full Importance of Public Relations,"This paper sides with critics who say that at present public relations is NOT a bona fide area of university study. However the paper argues that public relations COULD be made a legitimate and surprisingly important academic discipline through a deeper understanding of notions of rhetoric than that given by Robert Heath (Heath. 2001). In the post modern era, scientism, progressivism, grand-narration, in fact all the other pointers to thinking and philosophy, are coming adrift from their foundations for most western people. One consequence of this fragmentation of perspectives, this loss of religiosity or faith in progress and the modern, is that the academic market- as we might call it, has a new opening for a subject which specialises in understanding frameworks for thinking in the post modern age. Public relations activity fills this role in a similar way to the way rhetoric filled this role for the ancients."
2003-0941,Utilizing Usernames for Sex Categorization in CMC: Examining Perceptions and Accuracy,Paper,Utilizing Usernames for Sex Categorization in CMC: Examining Perceptions and Accuracy,"As more interpersonal interactions move online, people increasingly get to know and recognize one another by their self-selected identifiers called usernames. Early research predicted that the lack of cues would make primitive categories such as biological sex irrelevant in computer-mediated interactions. Little is known about the types of perceptions people make about one another based on this information, but research has shown that questions about gender are the first to be asked in online interactions and sex categorization has maintained salience. The current project was designed to examine the extent to which individuals might include obvious gender information in their usernames, as well as how easily gender could be attributed from usernames. Seventy-five coders were asked whether or not they could assign 298 people to a sex category based only on their username, and then to rate how confident they were in making the attribution. Results indicated that coders were fairly inaccurate in making these attributions, but moderately confident. Additionally, the results indicated that neither women nor men were more accurate in attributing gender from usernames, and that neither women nor men tended to use more obvious gender markers in their usernames. Additionally, those who did use obvious gender markers in their username tended to have less experience with computer chat. The results are discussed in conjunction with the limitations of the present investigation, and possibilities for future research."

A content analysis of 717 newspaper and television news stories in Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands showed that the summit was primarily framed in terms of political-institutional consequences and that the overall valence of the news was disadvantageous towards the EU and EU enlargement. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the valence of television news. A sample of 207 participants was randomly assigned to news framing the consequences of the summit as either advantageous or as disadvantageous. Participants exposed to disadvantageous news showed lower levels of general EU support and specific support for the EU enlargement and considered more negative than positive aspects of the enlargement than participants exposed to advantageous news."
2003-0943,Vertical integration and the must carry rules in the cable television industry: An empirical analysis,Paper,Vertical integration and the must carry rules in the cable television industry: An empirical analysis,"Using historical industry data, the study empirically tested the effects of vertical integration and other system-specific, station-specific and market-specific variables on cable operators¡¯ carriage decisions regarding local television stations in 1991, a time when the must carry rules were not in effect. Contrary to an anticompetitive explanation for carriage denials, the logit analysis found that vertical integration in the cable industry did not have a significantly negative effect on cable system carriage of local stations, holding other factors constant. Other results from the study indicate that stations more likely to be denied carriage by cable systems were those with lower viewing shares, young, independent and originating from a distance. While the studies raised concerns about the negative impact of non-carriage instances on small independent stations and in smaller markets, the findings generally support the notion that cable¡¯s local station carriage decisions were more a result of efficient than anti-competitive motives."

In the first study, we conducted focus groups (n=96), then used Likert scale development methodology to create a scale for measuring video game play motivations derived from the focus groups. The second study relates those motivations to patterns of video game genre preferences and amount of game use in a survey (n=550). Results show that video game uses and gratifications are a strong predictor of video game use and of genre preferences among games. Patterns of different game preference and hours of use between players and non-players are examined."
2003-0945,Violence and Peace in the Print Media: News Discourse and Social Construction of Reality in Colombia,Paper,Violence and Peace in the Print Media: News Discourse and Social Construction of Reality in Colombia,"The authors studied the social construction of reality on violence and peace emerging from coverage of Colombias socio-political conflict by the print media. Authors drew on Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmanns Social Construction of Reality and upon Teun Van Dijks discourse analysis. 600 news pieces from newspapers El Tiempo and El Heraldo, corresponding to the first semesters of 1999 and 2000, related to Colombias armed conflict were analyzed. A coding form included macro-structure or summary (headings, opening paragraph); microstructure (context, verbal reactions, expectations, conclusions and consequences; and iconography); and the objective social construction of reality, which included tipifications, roles, and sedimentation and traditions.

Results indicate that Colombias armed conflict is part of the daily discourse of the country; also, a thinning of the borderline between news genres is found, which has an impact upon the coverage of the conflict. New actors of the conflict emerge in the news discourse, whom are either more visible (i.e., guerrilla groups) or more invisible (civil society), and while there is talk about coverage of the peace process, discourse focuses more heavily on violence. Authors formulate a model for journalistic coverage of armed conflict by integrating the theoretical concepts used in the study due to the lack of contextual orientation for readers found in the discourse. The authors end their analysis with a proposed agenda for future studies of the Colombias armed conflict."

Numerous media outlets within the areas of primetime television, newspapers, newsmagazines, and television newscasts are analyzed separately as well as compared in determining how much violence and what types of violence each has included over the past two decades. Results find that the media types vary in terms of percentage of overall content that contains violence as well as number of physical and verbal violent acts. The media types are also found to differ in terms of longitudinal trends. For some, amount of violence has increased over time, whereas for others it has decreased. Finally, comparisons are drawn between the amount of violence in the media examined and external factors, namely amount of governmental and press attention to the issue of media violence as a social problem and FBI crime data. Scant evidence of a relationship between presence of violence in fictional and non-fictional media and these factors is found."
2003-0947,Violent media content and aggressiveness in adolescents: A negative feedback-loop model,Paper,Violent media content and aggressiveness in adolescents: A negative feedback-loop model,"Theory and research on media violence provides evidence both that aggressive youth seek out media violence (selective exposure) and that media violence prospectively predicts aggression in youth. We argue that both relationships, when modeled over time, should be mutually reinforcing, in what we call a negative feedback-loop model. The present study uses structural equation models to analyze two sets of cross-lagged relationships between these variables, each measured approximately eight months apart in panel data. The measure of use of media violence included viewing action films, playing violent computer and video games, and visiting violence-oriented Internet sites by students from six middle schools in three districts from three different regions in the U.S. Chi-square difference tests indicated that violent media content use was prospectively predicted by aggressiveness after controlling for baseline scores and demographic control variables, and that in turn aggressiveness was prospectively predicted by violent media content use after controlling for selective exposure as well as baseline and demographic control variables. The path coefficients were significant for the hypothesized relationships in all but one of the selective-exposure links. The findings appear largely consistent with the proposed negative feedback-loop model. The implications of this model for theorizing about media effects on youth, and for bridging active audience with traditional media effects perspectives, are discussed."

The history of the Kenyan press should include an account of these publications provided by the nationalist journalists who produced them. What vision did these Africans hold for the press? This paper finds that far from seeing their publications as only political propaganda, nationalists saw the press playing more complex roles. They believed it could provide a forum for voices which were usually ignored by the settler-oriented mainstream press. They thought it would encourage self-reliance among a people whose self-worth was denied by the colonial institutions and people who governed them. They envisioned it creating a sense of community, and the nationalists did believe the press could raise political consciousness by giving voice to the complaints about and criticisms of the colonial government. Ultimately, they believed that the press should provide a nonviolent means of resistance to the colonial government."
2003-0949,Visiting the Borderless City: Traveling via the Internet,Paper,Visiting the Borderless City: Traveling via the Internet,The flow of images and information on the Internet extend the borders of cities into cyberspace. One can now travel virtually to neighborhoods throughout the world. The synergy between the Internet and travel makes it one of the most successful products to be sold on the World Wide Web. But how does a city's construction in cyberspace impact its physical space? Does it encourage greater standardization or greater diversity? This paper begins to explore these questions. Two examples of tourism in New York City after September 11--both promoted via the Internet--are analyzed: the pilgrimage to Ground Zero and demonstrations at the World Economic Forum. These examples reveal the complex ways actions in real and virtual space impact one another.

Because there is little evaluative research regarding the effects of visual literacy programs, this study was conducted as a small step toward filling this gap in the literature. The study provides a history of visual literacy programs, background on the children who participated in the program, and an analysis of their web pages. Initially it was thought that the children's underprivileged status might affect their web page design. An aesthetic analysis found no profound influence of their social status on their web pages. An overall primitivistic, yet sophisticated style was evident in their web page designs. The outcome of the literacy program found little linkage between the children's social status and how and what they visually created."
2003-0951,Visual Representation and the Prediction of Emotion,Paper,Visual Representation and the Prediction of Emotion,"Through content analysis of news photographs and measurement of viewers response to those images, this study explored what visual characteristics contribute to emotional responses in viewers.

We conducted a content analysis of a sample of images and measured the presence of variables hypothesized to predict emotional response. Subjects viewed sub-sets of these images and provided self-reports of their level and type of affect. The independent variables were derived from the content analysis measures. Dependent variables were viewers level of either positive or negative affect. Significant predictors of negative affect included the presence of violence, the outcomes of violence, the effects of disaster, negative emotional displays by image subjects, and unusual juxtapositions of people and/or objects. The presence of violence, unusual object juxtapositions, and negative emotional displays had significant, but negative, relationships with positive affect. Positive emotional displays, viewing the more central subjects from the front, and image subjects appearing close together significantly and directly predicted positive affect."

Based on the existing literature, individuals from diverse backgrounds (N = 28) were interviewed about their experience in workplace communities. Four types of narratives about jobs were found based on the participants sense of voice, agency, and engagement. Two types of negative jobs focused on the organizational systems, while the other two centered on the struggle for voice in relationships. Informal voice and voice with peers as well as supervisors were important to participants. Perceptions of voice in the workplace were important for giving participants a sense of agency or control over their environment. In addition, the participants linked their perception of voice to engagement in their work and workplace relationships. The current project makes a unique contribution by (a) including diverse perspectives not heard before in the research regarding the workplace; (b) extending muted-group theory to better address the communication of people from muted groups in diverse communities; and (c) providing research results that have the potential to be useful both to individuals and organizations."

However, other research has argued that the news media does not make citizens more cynical or alienated. This study will try to explore the relationships between Taiwan voters¡¦ media behavior, political cynicism, perceptions of media negativism, and actual voting behavior.

The result has found that age is the only demographic variable predicting voters¡¦ perception of negative television election coverage. Voter education and income were significant predictors in explaining their cynicism. Moreover, voters¡¦ cable television use was significantly related to their cynicism. Voters in Taiwan might be cynical, but the data has demonstrated that they won¡¦t be disappointed by the electoral process and shown quite satisfied with the outcome."

The article argues three propositions: (1) that President Bush rhetorically constitutes a war by demarcating the border between an enemy, they, and an ally, part of us, endowing the latter with moral superiority; (2) that he dissociates Muslims and other nations from terrorists, and identifies them as part of us, thereby creating a world war against evil; (3) that in the context of world war, he speaks through multiple identities/ Is: a leader of the government, leader of the American people, and leader of the world; and the combination of his different identities constitute him as a commander-in-chief in the world war.

The proposed explanation for this finding is the role played by media during periods of intense social incandescence. During and since the 1965 events media coverage has used Watts as shorthand for the racial problems of the city. Greater fear of Watts in the maps of those who rely heavier on television for social and personal orientation provides support for this proposition."

Adapting a ritual view of communication, this paper studies the evolution of a discourse of the United States constructed by U.S.-based foreign correspondents for six Western European newspapers at the turn of the twenty-first century. It found two universal tenetsthe acknowledgment, ranging from grateful to hateful, of the United States as the worlds sole superpower, whose isolationism is feared just as much as its meddling, and a stereotyping of Americans crystallized in the thorough dislike for President Bush. The construction of a common transatlantic identity was limited to the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, while the constructions of American and being American were unaltered by that tragedy."

Understanding this complexity can and should be accomplished through the analysis of the communication that occurs there and partially serves to constitute the place. This study seeks to introduce a framework for the examination of place-based communication along the border. Furthermore, through a brief analysis of some communication produced by border dwellers, a unique sense of place is formulated and made viable. This is accomplished through the enactment of two contrasting coding practices, one which sees a coding of the border as a place of freedom and lawlessness and a more profound coding of the border as restricted. The final argument is that the U.S.-Mexico border is an accomplishment of communication."

It examined Webers thesis on the relationship between religion and capitalism and critiqued his investigation of Confucianism with regard to whether it helped to promote the growth of capitalism in China. It further examined Hofstede and Bonds argument about the connection between Confucianism and economic growth in East Asia. It reviewed the Chinese Values Survey study and critiqued its findings in terms of reliability and validity. Impact of this study on other studies on Chinese organizational communication practices was explored. This paper also examined the individualism-collectivism construct and investigated how it impacted scholarly research by Western scholars on Chinese organizational communication practices. Postcolonialist theory was applied to guide the review and examination of these conceptualizations.

In particular, we found many examples of how the agency-agent ratio is articulated in the interviewees words. The women articulated companies, human relations departments, bosses, doctors, generalized others, and pregnant women as agents subservient to the bureaucratic means of setting up maternity leaves. However, there is some evidence of an alternative pentad and map in the discourses that aligns with feminist transformation processes. We offer an initial attempt at what one such alternative might look like, and suggest that some of these women may want to focus on an agent-agency ratio in which the mother has more control over maternity leave."

Abstract
Cultural assumptions are imbedded in interpersonal communications texts. In this study, five commonly used textbooks were reviewed using Hofstede's four dimensions: individualism-collectivism, power distance, masculinity-femininity, and uncertainty avoidance. The review revealed definite American cultural biases in all four dimensions, and concluded that when Americans teach interpersonal communication in foreign places, they are exporting American cultural values imbedded in the material."
2003-0964,What binds employees to an organization? A study of organizational identification in two Thai organizations,Paper,What binds employees to an organization? A study of organizational identification in two Thai organizations,"This study examined organizational identification in the context of two Thai non-profit organizations: government-run Community Development Department (CDD) and privately-run Population and Community Development Association (PDA). The degree to which CDD members identified with CDD and PDA members identified with PDA was assessed by using the Organiational Identification Questionnaire (OIQ) constructed by Cheney (1982). Comparison of PDA and CDD scores on the OIQ provided findings that mirror those of previous studies of organizational identification. Specifically, the level of organizational identification among those employees who work for the privately-run social cause organiation was significantly higher than was true of the employees who work for the government organization. Thus, the private organization appears to be more effective than the government organization in successfully fostering employee identification. However, while factor analysis of the OIQ revealed three dimensions, they were not the three dimensions theorized by Cheney. Instead, within the context of Thailand, the dimensions describing organizational identification appear to reflect: Pride in Membership (life values), Fit with the Organization (social values), and Comfort Zone (personal values)."

However, when defining and measuring relational closeness, scholars have overlooked the LD friendship. For example, Bersheid et al.s (1989b) work based on interdependence emphasizes face-to-face interaction and disadvantages the LD friendship. This study asked 113 participants to define closeness generally and in LD friendships. Results illustrated that previous methods of conceptualizing and measuring closeness do not fully capture the nuances of closeness when face-to-face contact frequency is low.

Early radio and the instability of genre(s),"This article uses the example of the radio quiz show' Vox Pop (1932-1947) to illustrate the instability of various genre definitions and points to the flux of generic form and generic terminology. Starting out as a show focused on the man on the street,' Vox Pop, according to its creator Parks Johnson, consecutively developed into a quiz show, an interview show, and a talk show. While quiz shows do relate to ""everyday genres"" (Bakhtin, 1981) such as parlor games and interviews, they are not clearly defined through established industry practices or audience expectations. The case of early radio quiz shows in the 1930s suggests that genre might be better theorized as a system of fundamental hybridity and arbitrariness. As Derrida (1992) points out, genres as classificatory systems are ever present, but tend to be invoked in a contradictory manner in everyday practice. The instability of genre definitions in early broadcasting therefore does not just speak to a general sense of confusion in the industry, but to the multiple generic affiliations of any given program."
2003-0967,"What is Theory? Interpreting Spivak, Postcolonial and Indigenous Theory",Paper,"What is Theory? Interpreting Spivak, Postcolonial and Indigenous Theory","The August 2002 issue of Communication Theory (an ICA journal) recognizes the importance and relevance of the term 'Postcolonial' in contemporary analysis of culture and politics. A raging definitional debate in various disciplines about Postcolonial theory and the term Postcolonial has continued for some time. Shome and Hegde's introductory article in Communication Theory outlines the possible connections between Postcolonial and Communication theory. In such an effort, they interview Gayatri Spivak as a prominent Postcolonial and feminist thinker whose scholarship they write, ""...has significantly shaped the course of postcolonial thinking and has had profound impact on conceptualizing issues of culture, identity, communication, and transnationalism."" In this paper, I hope to provide a brief critique of Spivak. I also provide an outline of what Poonam Pillai and others have termed as ""Indigenous theory"" and its relevance to Postcolonial theory, an area of study marginalized both by Spivak and others. At the core of this critique is the unspoken assumption of ""West as Theory, East as Evidence."" My primary aim is to examine the ways in which metropolitan and Postcolonial theories (such as Spivak's), which apparently critique colonialism and imperialism, themselves participate in perpetuating Western cultural imperialism."
2003-0968,What Makes E-Commerce Websites Sticky? : Interactivity and Impulsivity in Online Browsing Behavior,Paper,What Makes E-Commerce Websites Sticky? : Interactivity and Impulsivity in Online Browsing Behavior,"This study examined the relationship between interactive attributes and the consumer browsing behavior at e-commerce websites based on the two contending theoretical frameworks: uses and gratification theory and social cognitive theory. While the former assumes that consumers are rational and try to minimize their search and transaction costs through online shopping, the latter relaxes the assumption of rational consumers arguing that consumers can be impulsive from deficient self-regulation. From the empirical study of the top 65 e-commerce websites, this study found out that interactive attributes supporting each of the two contending theoretical perspectives coexist at e-commerce sites: some attributes promoting rational consumer¡¯s efficient shopping activity and the others enticing impulsive consumer¡¯s inefficient browsing behavior. Even among the competing interactive attributes with the opposite directional influences, the sensory stimulus (the picture size of the products) turned out to be the most influential attribute for making e-commerce websites sticky by attracting and holding consumers in the websites."

It uses two search engines to examine the contents of the Web on four dimensionsinformation included in an encyclopedia, time (measured by years from 1900 to 2001), geography (the 181 members of the United Nations), and economic power (measured by revenue of Fortune 1000 companies). In each case, the frequencies with which various categories of information were found on the Web fell into a backward-L distribution. That is, a few topics get a great deal of attention on the Web and most topics get a very small amount of attention. In light of these findings, users should be warned that the Web does not include the entire body of human knowledge but heavily favors certain topics."

Earlier, in her album ""When It's Deep"" (1996) she had performed her own original lyrics (and those of other songwriters) that included same-sex love manifestations. Her ""unofficial"" coming-out has been ignored by the Israeli media which have hardly related to her sexual identity although her lesbianism was a kind of ""open secret"" among journalists, musicians and the many of her female and male, straight and lesbian fans who have identified with her messages for many years. Significantly, this erotic knowledge was manifested in her album ""When It's Deep"" not only in the texts themselves but also in the subtexts, double and subtle meanings, alternative presentation, and particularly in the sophisticated linguistic manipulations of Hebrew, a gender grammatical language that ""frames"" the speaker's gender and sexuality."
2003-0971,When the 'Telecommunications Revolution' and the Drug War Collide: Money Laundering and the Proliferation of Surveillance*,Paper,When the 'Telecommunications Revolution' and the Drug War Collide: Money Laundering and the Proliferation of Surveillance*,"*Top Three Paper, Communication Law and Policy Division

For a decade, US law enforcement agencies as well as many policy makers, academics and journalists have taken the position that the ""telecommunications revolution"" is undermining the US States capacity to prevail in the War on Drugs. They are arguing that law enforcement agencies are ""losing control."" Without enhanced surveillance powers, the argument runs, drug trafficking organizations and other illicit businesses will be able to use telecommunications technologies with impunity and anonymity. The problem with this narrative is that it functions to narrow the scope of policy analysis by obscuring the ways in which developments in criminal justice policy and associated changes in the US State have fuelled money laundering and law enforcements response to it. Indeed, the narrative also masks the fact that the US State has contributed to some of the very problems (e.g., drug trafficking) anti-money laundering initiatives are supposed to address. An alternative narrative is sketched, one that places the US State at the center of analysis. Specifically, it is argued that the escalation of the US States failed War on Drugs has been a key factor driving the money-laundering problem. The question of the influence of the ""telecommunications revolution"" on money laundering and drug trafficking must be considered within this broader political context."
2003-0972,When Uses and Gratifications Meet the Knowledge Gap: The Impact of Media Motives and Demographics on Political Activity,Paper,When Uses and Gratifications Meet the Knowledge Gap: The Impact of Media Motives and Demographics on Political Activity,"This study examines how motivations to use the media in a political domain interact with demographic variables. The motives to use political media flow from uses and gratification theory, while the examination of how these motives interact with demographics flows from knowledge gap theory. Three motive dimensionssurveillance, social interaction, and diversionwere identified from data from a 2000 telephone. Social interaction reduced the voting gap created by race, the consumption of political coverage gap created by age, and the interpersonal communication gap created by length of residence in a community, while it increased the education gap for voting. Surveillance increased the education gap for interpersonal communication. After the effects of demographic were removed, media-use motives still predicted voting, news media consumption, interest in politics, and interpersonal communication. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of media-use motivations in understanding how demographics create differential levels of political activity."

A Content Analysis of Introductory Public Relations Textbooks,"The purpose of this study was to examine the representation of women in introductory public relations textbooks. The photographs, profiles, quotations, and citations of six current edition textbooks were examined using content analysis to determine the inclusion of women. Findings suggest that women are not represented in introductory public relations textbooks at the percentages at which they represent the field. For example, women were identified sources for quotes only 91f the time, and were identifiable citation sources only 101003410535f the time. In addition, women were not the sole subject of the majority of photographs included in textbook chapters. These results suggest that the contributions and importance of women to public relations may not be covered in as much detail as would seem justified since the field is a feminized practice."

Media coverage, political interest and voting behaviour in Singapore's 2001 election","Singapores ruling party, the Peoples Action Party (PAP) has governed the country uninterruptedly since the first election in 1959. In 2001, the PAP again won with a huge margin of over seventy five percent, relegating opposition to the background.
This paper gives an overview of Singapores political system and the factors sustaining the dominance of the PAP. It examines the issues and concerns that emerged in the political agenda during the 2001 election and voter perception of these issues. It also evaluates the role of the mass media in the electoral process and the extent to which the electorate used the mass media even though electoral outcomes were predicted before polling day.
The present paper reports findings from a post-election survey done through CATI interviews on a sample of 691 Singaporeans. The socio economic variables were measured with the exposure to mass media and election information, interest in the elections, issues of the country and those of the citizens and finally the voting behaviour.
Singaporeans showed a high level of interest in the political process and followed party campaigns in the media. Awareness of issues was high. Newspapers and television were major sources of information and influence. The family also played a key role in influencing voting behavior. PAP dominated electoral space with extensive campaigning and media coverage. The combined strength of opposition parties were no match for them."

Issues of self and identity have attracted the attention of scholars, as indicated by a heightened increase of continuing conversations across and within academic disciplines (Gergen, 1991, 1999; Giddens, 1992; Mandelbaum, 1996, in press; Mokros, 1996, 2003; Shotter & Gergen, 1989; Taylor, 1989). In addition, there is also an acknowledgement that work and organizations function as important sites for identity construction (Cheney, 1993; Cheney & Carroll, 1997; Cockett, 2000; Czarniawska-Joerges, 1997; Lievrouw, 1996; Mandelbaum, 1996b; Mokros, 2003).

The intent of this paper is to explore the theoretical claims that (a) self and identity are central issues for the social sciences, and (b) work and organizations are important sites for the consideration of self and identity, and how communication scholarship contributes (or may contribute) to an understanding of these claims. Finally, this paper considers the relevance of scholarly interest in the confluence of identity, self and work for the development of communication theory."
2003-0976,Who is the Real Target? Media Response to Controversial Investigative Reporting,Paper,Who is the Real Target? Media Response to Controversial Investigative Reporting,"This study examines elite print media reaction to two controversial investigative reports: ABC's 1992 Primetime Live report on Food Lion supermarkets and NBC's 1992 Dateline NBC story on General Motors' trucks. The case studies and content analysis of print coverage of these controversies suggest that scholars should pay greater attention to how media response to investigative reporting can influence its ability to act as a watchdog on power and provide a diverse marketplace of ideas. In both cases, corporate targets of investigative reporting used litigation and public relations to divert media attention from muckrakers' charges against targets to questions of newsgathering ethics. Ironically, we find that the more that news organizations under attack defend their right to muckrake, the more they risk the rest of the news media burying the disputed story under discussion of First Amendment rights and media ethics. In addition, the print response studied here did not offer much diversity of viewpoint on these controversies, privileging the views of corporate targets over victims and their advocates."

Two field studies serve as a framework for this analysis of the ways fieldwork can contextualize and make problematic the ""vision"" of critical pedagogy. Within this context, I locate power and empowerment within critical pedagogy to examine the ways in which the theory frames not only the struggle but who does the fighting and the site at which the battle occurs."
2003-0978,'Whose game is this anyway?': Negotiating corporate ownership in a virtual world,Paper,'Whose game is this anyway?': Negotiating corporate ownership in a virtual world,"This paper explores the ways the commercialization of multiuser environments is posing particular challenges to user autonomy and authorship in online spaces. With ever broadening definitions of intellectual property rights the status of cultural and symbolic artifacts as products of collaborative effort becomes increasingly problematized. In the case of virtual environments  such as massive multiplayer online role-play games (MMORPG)  where users develop identities, bodies (avatars) and communities the stakes are quite high. Players invest time and effort into developing characters, relationships, and building game communities yet the status of both their labor and the culture they produce is increasingly being seen as the property of the corporate game owners. This analysis draws on several case studies from the growing genre of online games to raise questions about the status of culture and authorship in commercialized digital culture."
2003-0979,Why we watched: Factors Affecting Exposure to TV News Coverage of September 11,Paper,Why we watched: Factors Affecting Exposure to TV News Coverage of September 11,"This study addressed the phenomenon of why people are drawn to watch news coverage of tragic events. A total of 376 undergraduates completed anonymous questionnaires about their responses to the events of September 11. The study examined the extent to which patterns of news interest and exposure could be explained by individual differences in empathy (empathic concern, personal distress) and coping style (monitoring, blunting), emotional responses to the news events (fear, sadness, anger), and news viewing motivations (surveillance, reassurance, morbid curiosity). The findings suggest several reasons why viewers were interested in and exposed themselves to tragic news, including concern about the victims, the desire to remain informed (which may have provided a psychological sense of control), the inclination to monitor the environment for threat cues in stressful situations, the desire for reassuring information, the need to bond with others in a similar emotional state, interest in tragic events (i.e., morbid curiosity), and the meta-emotional tendency to enjoy the experience of sadness."

The study proposed a theoretical model of the purchase of avatar-related products using attitude toward an avatar, self-presentation, subjective norm, identification and immersiveness.
An avatar is a graphic icon representing users in three dimensional (3D) or virtual reality games and chat rooms. Many young people have avatars, and spend money to decorate their cyber ¡°self.¡± This research began with this question: Why do young people buy avatar-related products in cyberspace?
The data (n=335) indicated four outcomes. First, the link between the attitude toward an avatar and identification was very strong. Second, high correlation was also obtained for the attitude toward an avatar and immersiveness. Third, self-presentation was an important construct for the avatar usage. Lastly, the subjective norm was also the significant predictor for online purchase of avatar-related products."

Drawing on archival research and interviews, the paper suggests that the roots of communication study, as separate from professional journalism training and the study of rhetoric, goes further back than previously assumed. The paper seeks to explain why the Chicago programs, which involved famous scholars who are widely credited as pioneers of communication research, are unknown in our discipline's history, and what that tells us about academic institutions in general, and mass communication research in particular."

Privacy concerns are thus revealed. Self-regulation is preferred by the government and the industry. This research applies the analysis of the traditional media¡¦s self-regulatory efforts to predict if self-regulation works in the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet does not provide circumstances for a successful self-regulation regime. First, Internet industry members do not have strong incentives to comply with privacy principles. The only means to encourage industry members to take action to self-regulate their privacy practices may be threats of government legislation. Nevertheless, the government believes that the industry has the ability to self-regulate and therefore takes a hands-off stand. Second, it is noticeable that the enormous size of the Internet across nations will make the enforcement difficult. Third, funding of self-regulatory organizations is a problem. Fourth, enforcement mechanism and power are not effective in encouraging compliance of members. Finally, public participation in the Internet¡¦s self-regulatory efforts is problematic. In sum, legislation is necessary to ensure the industry¡¦s consistent and persistent commitment to fair information practices and their compliance. This paper attempts to assist policy observation and policy making by evaluating policy proposals, analyzing conflicts, and identifying the best ways to deal with online privacy controversies in light of the revealed social conditions and Internet characteristics."

We argue that these implications fall into three categories:

* First, the use of these systems for public safety involves the creation of a surveillance infrastructure which will be used for police and commercial interests.

* Second, the commercialization of the systems permits the incorporation of more intimate and detailed data into pre-existing geodemographic systems which typify places and persons.

* And third, the systems have been associated with a general rationalization of the landscape, affording to some, but not others, the ability to ""read"" and manipulate social activities in places.

Much of the policy action and public concern with locational surveilance systems has focused on privacy. However, ""privacy"" may be an inadequate frame through which to understand these three issues and to fashion appropriate responses."

Rockefeller Jr. in the aftermath of the bitter 1913-1914 Colorado coal strike. Mackenzie King-not his more recognized counterpart, publicist Ivy Lee-provided many of the modern public relations ideas that Rockefeller eventually adopted to alleviate tensions and improve labor relations. These included the development of the Colorado Industrial Representation Plan, a prototype company union structure that was designed to facilitate employee communications. Mackenzie King, who later served 22 years as prime minister of Canada, also advised Rockefeller on a wide range of public relations activities, including testimony before government hearings, meetings with union leaders, community philanthropy in Colorado, and Rockefeller's historic visit to Colorado in September-October 1915."
2003-0985,Womanhood in Japanese Anime: A New Cultural Borderland to U.S. Gender Politics,Paper,Womanhood in Japanese Anime: A New Cultural Borderland to U.S. Gender Politics,"As an emerging field of popular culture, Japanese anime has been steadily entering the discourse of media studies in the U.S. as an alternative to the Hollywood film industry. This study will examine the portrayal of womanhood in Japanese anime to better understand the Japanese concept of womanhood. With the increasing amount of anime imported into the U.S., American viewers are exposed to images and narratives that are ridden with Japanese cultural values that may sometimes conflict with the western gender politic. Within the Japanese societal framework, the public sphere has been dominated by the males voice, including that of popular culture. However, since the emergence of the sh?o (girls) manga industry during the 1960s-1970s, the female manga artists and readers seemed to have created a sphere where they could possibly resist, subvert, and reappropriate the existing patriarchal ideology that constricted them within limited social participatory roles. Depiction of womanhood in manga and anime is important not only because of the breadth of its readership and viewership in Japan, but also because they may function as an Althusserian ideological state apparatus. Manga and anime as media can function as a vehicle in maintaining the Japaneses own sense of womanhood, which may then become important tools into the insight into Japanese gender culture. I have selected the Japanese Fruits Basket television animation series because of its significance as a U.S. imported series that will be aired on Toonami in the near future. Through examining the female portrayals in anime texts, American viewers may develop a better understanding of the emerging cultural borderland of Japanese anime to the U.S. media."

Women were randomly assigned to view slides of slender, idealized female models with no text; with text explaining how to attain the depicted body type; with irrelevant text; or no slides. Men were randomly assigned to view slides of muscular, idealized male models with no text; with text explaining how to attain the depicted body type; with irrelevant text; or no slides. The dependent measure was the number of pretzels voluntarily eaten during administration of a post-viewing questionnaire. Compared to participants who viewed no slides, participants who viewed models paired with text explaining how to attain the depicted body type ate significantly less, regardless of body mass and gender. For women only, the same effect occurred for those exposed to slides of models without text. Viewing of slides paired with irrelevant text did not result in significant reductions in eating. Discussion focuses on the role of text in distracting attention from or reframing perceptions of ideal-body images."

Among the most important issues examined there are those concerning the status and rights of women. Using discourse analysis, this paper examines three English-language newspaper websites from three politically different Middle Eastern countries  Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia - to see how women are portrayed. This paper examines from a feminist perspective how women are portrayed on these Internet sites and extrapolates from the images some observations about the status of women in those countries.
The review of the Jordan Times, the Gulf News and the Arab News found that there were three major ways in which women were most frequently portrayed: (1) as victims, (2) as angels of mercy, and (3) as increasingly important to development of economic assets of the region. When female authority figures were represented, they were generally members of royal families and were providing either commentary on the victimization of women by the Israelis or were leaders of relief efforts aimed at helping these victims."

The study found that the extrinsic factors commonly used in international communication research  press freedom and political freedom  affected how international editorials framed the September 11 attacks. The study also found that religion, an extrinsic factor rarely tested in international communication research, turned out to be an important variable in framing international editorials toward the September 11 attacks. The variable of religion should be taken into consideration in future communication research dealing with foreign policy or world peace.
The major contribution of this study to mass communication research is the methodology of integrating two seemingly separate lines of research  news flow analysis in international communication and framing analysis."

With this in mind, I ask the following questions: How do Missy Misdemeanor Elliott and Kimberly Lil' Kim Jones present their bodies/selves in the public realm as constructions of black womanhood? Do either of them break or transform existing stereotypes of black women? Do they create new options for black representation? And if so, how?"

People claim that young people today are more ignorant, apathetic, and cynical about politics than at any other time in the past. A recent report from the Washington Post quoted a young voter from Arkansas as saying, ""The young people don't feel connected to the candidates, because they don't campaign to them. And the candidates don't feel connected to the young people, because they think they don't vote."" Using the National Election Study (NES) data, this study seeks to discover the relationships between various factors that influence voting behavior and voter turnout among young people aged 18 to 35 in the 2000 presidential election. Using hierarchical regression, this study tried to predict how much of variance in voter turnout among young Americans was explained by certain factors. This study further develops a profile of the young people who are likely to turn out to vote on an election day using discriminant analysis."

Findings from this study add knowledge to research in health communication and provide information for designing messages in public health campaigns. This study used a think aloud method and a within-subject experiment design, where participants verbalized their thoughts when they repeatedly viewed different messages with emphasis on either costs of smoking or benefits of not smoking. It was found that participants engaged in thinking about the likelihood for a certain outcome to happen or whether it is a direct result of smoking, much more than about the severity of the outcomes. A pattern was also observed that loss-framed messages aroused more negative emotions and induced more favorable attitudes than gain-framed messages."
2004-0001,A Bibliometric Analysis of Disciplinary Self-Reflection in Communication Studies,Paper,A Bibliometric Analysis of Disciplinary Self-Reflection in Communication Studies,"This paper reports the results of a bibliometric analysis of the patterns of co-citation among the authors most cited by the 121 articles that also refer to a special symposium issue of Journal of Communication (JoC), published in 1983, called 'Ferment in the Field.' This symposium, in attempting to make sense of the potential implications of 'critical theory' for communication studies as a field at that time, is argued to constitute a moment of 'disciplinary self-reflection' whose subsequent employment within the communication studies literature indicates the reflexive concerns of the discipline. The analysis conducted here suggests that disciplinary self-reflection in communication studies includes both epistemological-ideological and structural-functional critiques of the discipline. This analysis underscores the tensions between two views of what communication 'in the public interest' entails: on the one hand, a gimlet-eyed appraisal of the vagaries of media power; on the other, a pragmatic and useful program that contributes to policymaking and interdisciplinary inquiry."
2004-0002,A Big Fat Indie Story: Discourses Surrounding the Making and Marketing of a 'Hollywood' Movie,Paper,A Big Fat Indie Story: Discourses Surrounding the Making and Marketing of a 'Hollywood' Movie,"In this paper, I argue that the standard media narratives about the production and distribution of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" reinforced a number of inaccuracies and misperceptions about the operations of the contemporary media industries. These stories constructed certain dichotomies between ""Hollywood"" and ""independent"" which obscured the interconnectedness and fluidity existing within the contemporary film and television industries.

This paper consists of two parts. First, I survey three dominant ""claims"" made in mainstream publications about the film. In this section, I complicate assertions that the film can be labeled as the most successful independent film of all time; I challenge the assumption that film such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding are rarely made by Hollywood anymore; and I problematize declarations that the film represents a triumph in grassroots marketing tactics.

Second, I propose that the film's extraordinary financial success should not be interpreted as evidence that Hollywood has lost its way, but rather as proof of the existence - and effectiveness - of specific business practices and aesthetic parameters within the contemporary media industries. Ultimately, I encourage media analysts to cease from viewing ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" as an example of one woman and one film defying the odds. Instead, we should consider the film as an example of the uniformity of journalistic discourses, the complexity of the operations of contemporary Hollywood, and the continuing ideological power of the so-called American dream."
2004-0003,Abused Children and Television: Examining Parasocial Interaction in Special Populations,Paper,Abused Children and Television: Examining Parasocial Interaction in Special Populations,"The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the difference between abused and non-abused childrens relationships with television characters. Abused and non-abused children between the ages of 7 and 16 years old were interviewed about their favorite television character. Analyses were conducted to investigate parasocial interactions and how they differ by abuse status (abused vs. non-abused) and gender (boys vs. girls). Findings suggested that abused children parasocially interact with their favorite TV characters less often than non-abused children. Girls were more likely to identify social behavior as an important character attribute in their favorite character, while boys were likely to report strength. Conversation topics during these parasocial interactions typically were about episode information for non-abused girls. Abused girls reported seeking and giving help as the reason why they engaged in these relationships, while non-abused girls described affective reasons."
2004-0004,A Causal Model of the Persuasive Effects of Types and Forms of Evidence Introduction,Paper,A Causal Model of the Persuasive Effects of Types and Forms of Evidence Introduction,"This inquiry presented and tested a causal model predicting attitudes from a combination of variables including different forms of evidence. In addition to direct effects on attitudes, which were directly examined, the model revealed that attitudes could be predicted from a combination of message believability and source credibility ratings on the character dimension. Believability, in turn, was predicted from perceived message clarity, source character, and source competence assessments. Character was predicted from the use of evidence, source competence, and perceive message clarity. Message clarity was predicted from competence assessments. Thus, results suggested that evidence and credibility effects were somewhat complicated and influenced the ways the message was perceived as comprehensible and credible."

The stress that they experience during the process of cross-cultural adaptation is called acculturative stress. The current study investigated relationship between acculturative stress among Chinese international students, social support and use of online ethnic social groups. A survey was conducted among 110 Chinese students who attended a southeast university in the United States. The results suggested that those who were more satisfied with their interpersonal social networks had less perceived discrimination, perceived hatred and negative feelings caused by change, but not less fear. Online group activity level was not significantly related to the degree of acculturative stress. However, students who experienced less acculturative stress reported receiving higher amounts of emotional and informational support from online ethnic social groups. In addition, Students who were less satisfied with interpersonal social networks tended to perceive more informational support from online groups than students who were more satisfied with interpersonal social networks."

The satellite development program is divided into two phases. Phase I, from 1956 to 1977, is marked by nationalism and military concern as the impetus that pushed the satellite industry. Phase II, from 1978 to the present, is characterized by Chinas efforts to commercialize the industry. The importance of context-specific analysis over generalizations about the national diffusion of space technology is stressed."
2004-0008,A comparison of cognitive and emotional predictors of the enjoyment of reality-based and fictional television programming,Paper,A comparison of cognitive and emotional predictors of the enjoyment of reality-based and fictional television programming,"This paper reports the results of two studies designed to compare predictors of enjoyment of reality-based and fictional TV programming. In Study 1, 260 adults completed a survey of their cognitive and emotional reactions to either the fictional or reality-based programming that they generally watch. In Study 2, 502 adults completed a similar survey but with a particular reality-based or fictional program in mind. Results of both studies suggest voyeurism (i.e., curiosity about others) is likely a distinguishing marker of reality-based and fictional programming. However, different predictors of enjoyment for reality-based and fictional programming suggests there are as many differences among types of reality-based programming as between reality-based versus fictional programming. Both studies also found more variance explained for the enjoyment of reality-based versus fictional programming. Further, certain gratifications (learning, surprise, suspense, and self-awareness) had quite different effects on enjoyment depending on the context in which they arose. The discussion presents arguments advocating the need to broaden the conceptual understanding of gratifications, to Sreassess the degree of activity necessary for their acquisition, and to better understand their link to media enjoyment and possible subsequent behaviors."
2004-0009,A Comparison of Organizational Conflict Management Strategies Between Americans and Koreans,Paper,A Comparison of Organizational Conflict Management Strategies Between Americans and Koreans,"This study investigated how the conflict management strategies (non-confrontation, control, and solution) were influenced by culture (Korean and American), by work relationship (superior, colleague, and subordinate), and by tenure (1-7 years and 7+years). The answers of 501 participants (Korean N = 240; American N = 261) on the Organizational Communication Conflict Instrument (OCCI) of Putnam and Wilson (1982) were analyzed. Both Koreans and Americans use the solution strategy most frequently in their conflict situations, followed by the control strategy. They least use the non-confrontation strategy. Americans use the solution strategy more frequently than Koreans, while Koreans use the control strategy more frequently than Americans. Americans more frequently use the solution strategy with a colleague and a subordinate than with a superior, and less frequently use a control strategy with a superior than with a subordinate and a colleague. Koreans more frequently use the solution strategy with a colleague and a subordinate than with a superior, and more frequently use a control strategy with a subordinate than with a superior and a colleague. As the tenure of Korean participants increases, the use of the control strategy also increases. As the tenure of American participants increases, on the contrary, the use of the control strategy decreases. The findings are discussed."

The study found that the beliefs emphasized in the advertisements varied by year. The most frequent and consistently mentioned beliefs regarding the negative consequences of drug use were the loss of athletic skills, messed up life, unachieved goals, and death. The advertisements also frequently mentioned how children are under pressure to use drugs. The Integrative Model of Behavior prediction is used to analyze and relate these findings to previous evaluations of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign."
2004-0011,A Crisis In Reputation Management: The Implications of Kasky v. Nike,Paper,A Crisis In Reputation Management: The Implications of Kasky v. Nike,"This paper examines the legal controversy caused by the efforts of Nike Corporation to defend its corporate reputation, culminating in the California Supreme Courts decision in Kasky v. Nike. From a public relations standpoint, Nike did what any other corporation would most likely have done in trying to control the damage caused by negative media reports  it began a reputation management campaign to counter media criticism and to restore its tarnished corporate reputation. Nike undertook a series of specific activities, all of which are standard reputation management practices when a corporation is faced with a crisis related to maintaining its good name.

Kasky v. Nike is important for those involved in reputation management because all participants apparently have assumed that public relations communication may constitute commercial speech, even if there is disagreement about whether Nikes specific defense-of-reputation campaign in this case can legitimately be so designated."

In the first section, the theoretical constructs of primary/secondary goals are introduced, focusing on the definitions of primary/secondary goals and the goal-planning-action model of message production. After the theoretical review, empirical research assessing the primary/secondary goals framework is reviewed, which includes goal types and goal structures in influence situations, primary/secondary goals in contexts other than influence situations, and primary/secondary goals research across cultures. The final part evaluates the primary/secondary goals framework and discusses developments needed in the future."
2004-0013,A Culture of Thinness: Negotiated and Oppositional Decoding of Eating Disorder Discourse by Anorectics,Paper,A Culture of Thinness: Negotiated and Oppositional Decoding of Eating Disorder Discourse by Anorectics,"Within a popular culture built on inconsistencies, contemporary media present conflicting representations of thinness. Within the cracks of these contradictions, a sub-culture of anorectics has created a reading position for itself outside of the dominant eating disorders as dangerous diseases ideology. This sub-culture can be found in the electronic communities of pro eating disorder websites. Referred to as Pro Ana or Pro Mia sites, messages on these pages encourage harmful behavior by: (1) posting tips on how to avoid eating and/or purge food, (2) describing drugs and home remedies for weight loss, (3) instructing users how to hide eating disorders from family and friends, and (4) providing pictures of emaciated models as a form of encouragement. The electronically preserved nature of anorectics tertiary texts on pro eating disorder websites affords the cultural critic a profound opportunity for analyzing the decoding strategies of a marginalized group operating outside of the dominant ideology. The current investigation utilizes a combination of Stuart Halls theory of encoding/decoding with Michael de Certeaus theory of subversive bricolage as a theoretical framework for analyzing the tertiary texts present in pro eating disorder websites. This analysis will argue that, through negotiated and oppositional decoding of eating disorder texts, the anorectics participating in pro eating disorder websites systematically de-construct and re-construct discourse to serve their own ends."

Using this model as a framework, we examined the dynamic relationships among perceived goal difficulty, goal success, and self-efficacy within an hour-long online session during which students visited a WWW travel site and designed a travel plan for a trip to China. The results suggest that success in meeting information goals in one cycle led to an increase in self-efficacy, which in turn reduced the perception of goal difficulty for the next cycle. Although the immediate effect of success on self-efficacy was not as strong among those with higher baseline intrinsic motivation for the task, the correlation between success and self-efficacy was significant for both groups. Also, both perceived goal difficulty and self-efficacy showed temporal stability across cycles."

The analysis yielded interesting and somewhat conflicting results regarding a possible third-person effect: frequent users were more likely to admit some addictive potential for themselves but concurrently appeared to be more defensive regarding the mediums addictive potential for others."
2004-0016,Adolescent girls and the homospectatorial gaze: Queering teen pop culture,Paper,Adolescent girls and the homospectatorial gaze: Queering teen pop culture,"This paper offers a theorization of the relations of gazing that underpin the ardent fan culture of preteen girls and their hypersexualized pop idols, notably Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Young girls emulations of these stars have become a matter of public interest and concern, generating urgent debates and media discourses centering on girls sexuality. Invoking the literature on female film spectatorship, which speaks to the interplay of desire and identification, in this paper I argue that preteen girls are encouraged to gaze scopophilically at the sexy images of these female stars. Although a presumptive heterosexuality underpins the mass circulation of these images, there are possibilities of lesbian desire being legitimized in this gazing process, especially because of the girls developmental age vis-à-vis their burgeoning sexual identities."

Six hundred adolescents between 9 and 18 years of age completed a questionnaire in their classroom. Fifty percent of adolescents who used the Internet for chat or instant messaging indicated that they had engaged in Internet-based identity experiments. The most important motive for such experiments was self-exploration (to investigate how others react), followed by social compensation (to overcome shyness), and social facilitation (to facilitate relationship formation). Age, gender, and introversion were significant predictors of the frequency with which adolescents engaged in Internet-based identity experiments, their motives for such experiments, and their self-presentational strategies."

The primary focus of this analysis is the September 20, 2001 address to the U.S. and the world, the 2002 State of the Union Address, and the memorial speech on September 11, 2002. The author argues that these speeches form the foundation of a rhetoric surrounding the War on Terror. This paper will engage the rhetoric of the War on Terror by describing the tragic frame, and the ways in which the rhetoric is deployed through that frame. This will lead to an examination of how framing the situation tragically leads to an act-agent emphasis in its description of the situation. Through this rhetoric, George W. Bush communicates the situation through a tragic frame to make sense of U.S. military response, one that is not limited to one particular action, but instead can be extended to other theatres as a result of the original threat. This framing serves to construct the U.S. response as inevitable, natural, and beyond question. Future implications of this rhetoric are examined in terms of how this rhetoric will dictate future action. The paper concludes with a discussion of how a comic evaluation of the War on Terrorism may be more appropriate, and better allow personal and social growth."

In most of these studies, the responses of US participants have been compared to those of participants from East-Asian countries. In this paper, two experiments are reported on that addressed the question whether such cultural differences in responding to advertising appeals are found between participants from Western-European countries as well. The responses of Dutch, German, and English participants were compared when responding to an appeal to either Success or Modesty, and the responses of Dutch, Belgian, and Spanish participants were compared when responding to either an Adventure or a Certainty appeal. Instead of cultural differences, the results revealed clear preferences for the Modesty and the Adventure appeals regardless of the participants' nationality. The results raise questions about what would make participants from different cultures respond differently to different value appeals."
2004-0020,Advocating Alternative Futures: Screening Biometrics and Related Technologies in Science-Fiction Cinema,Paper,Advocating Alternative Futures: Screening Biometrics and Related Technologies in Science-Fiction Cinema,"This paper examines films that construct social worlds in which biometrics and similar technologies pervade everyday life  films that portray U.S. society as significantly transformed thanks in part to the application of new bodily identification technologies. Such films can provide insights into how truths about the future possibilities for these technologies are constructed, popular visions for how they will function within institutional contexts, and ideas about what new social relations will be established as a result. I consider three science fiction films that have created distinctive  and to some extent realist  images of our technological future, treating technology as a conscious problem: Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982), GATTACA (Andrew Niccol, 1997), and Minority Report (Steven Spielberg, 2002). Each of these films inform and participate in the current expansion in discourse about new surveillance technologies and practices, taking their place among academic research, legal discussions and policy debates, mainstream press coverage, and postmodern visual art. I explore the tensions that run through these films between the authoritative visions of the future they construct and their effort to critique determinist ideologies that suggest that a particular future is inevitable and knowable in advance. As these films attest, the techniques of narrative cinema can provide condensed and compelling elaborations on social and cultural transformations that are both bringing about and resulting from emerging technologies. As they contribute to the discourse, they can help change the terms of the debate, adding as much to the contingency of the future as to its clear trajectories."

Abstract

The research reported here is inspired by the question how posters communicate the quality of aesthetic objects. It addresses the communication of the quality of theatre performances through theatre posters. We test the hypotheses 1) that theatre posters reproduce the same aesthetic qualities that play an important role in the experience of performances that they advocate, 2) that the quality of a poster influences the expected quality of performances, and 3) that expertises of theatre and posters mediate the influence of posters on perceived performance quality. In two studies 37 Dutch theatre poster  performance pairs were judged by three different groups as to 1) aesthetic features complexity and unconventionality, and 2) quality. The results imply a substantial support for the conveyance of the aesthetic qualities of performances through posters, and for a relation between perceived qualities of posters and related theatre performances. The influence of expertise could not be established."
2004-0022,A Fantasy Theme Analysis of User-Produced Korean Internet Pornographic Novels,Paper,A Fantasy Theme Analysis of User-Produced Korean Internet Pornographic Novels,"This project discusses the rhetorical vision of human sexual conduct promoted in user-produced Korean Internet pornographic novels. Symbolic convergence theory and fantasy theme analysis were used to deconstruct the 40 collected novels to look for common thematic and dramatic elements and reconstruct the rhetorical vision. Multiple open coding processes generated the conclusion that the genre collectively promotes a drama in which the active and assertive male character temporarily satisfies his insatiable sexual desire through engaging step by step in a hierarchy of physical contacts with the passive and vulnerable female character. Variations occur in the actual account of sexual conduct according to what thematic and narrative elements are prioritized in each story. Fantasy themes that constitute the vision include the messages: that sexual desire is a natural, constant, and irresistible driving force; that men read and fantasize about female bodies as a prelude to making sexual advances; that discourse around intercourse is gendered; that females are vulnerable to and thus available for male sexual advances, and so on."
2004-0023,Affective Responses and Exposure to Frightening Films: The Role of Empathy and Different Types of Content,Paper,Affective Responses and Exposure to Frightening Films: The Role of Empathy and Different Types of Content,"A total of 183 undergraduates completed self-administered questionnaires that assessed three dimensions of dispositional empathy (perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress), enduring emotional responses to frightening films, and enjoyment of and exposure to such fare. Respondents also completed a multi-item scale that measured the extent to which various aspects of scary content (suffering, danger, thrills, realism) affect their enjoyment of frightening films. Results showed that empathy was differentially related to enjoyment of different types of content. Empathic concern was associated with less enjoyment of suffering, but both empathic concern and perspective taking were associated with more enjoyment of danger and thrills. Regression analyses revealed that personal distress was the component of empathy that most consistently predicted affective responses and exposure to frightening films, with higher personal distress associated with more enduring reactions, regret, and avoidance, and less exposure to horror and suspense films. In contrast, perspective taking was associated with more enjoyment of frightening films and marginally less avoidance and more exposure to suspense. Overall, the results are consistent with previous research indicating that empathy is an important individual difference that contributes to viewers' responses to frightening films. Interpretations and limitations of the findings are discussed."
2004-0024,Affinity Spaces and Contact Zones: Building Blocks for Intercultural PR Theory,Paper,Affinity Spaces and Contact Zones: Building Blocks for Intercultural PR Theory,"Burgeoning populations among communities of color have forced a new imprint upon Western societies. Impelled by above-average birth rates and immigration, such communities are part of a worldwide swell of young people, estimated to include 800 million people globally by 2010. Diversity has come of age. In contemporary settings, thus, the prospect of managing diversity looms increasingly as a necessary imperative to doing business, yet today's diversity is not like yesterday's. More and more, what experience and research suggests, is that the true model for interculturalism will have to encompass a dynamic approach whose essence will be to juggle disparate cultural and social parts. At the center of this new set of negotiations will be the public relations function, a practice singularly ""charged with identifying, monitoring and shaping trends in society."" (Kotcher, 1995, p.6) To effectively do this, public relations must adapt its practices and perspectives to a model of intercultural relationships that recognizes and responds to race as a social construct influencing communication acts."
2004-0025,A Finnish Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility,Paper,A Finnish Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility,"The major challenge of the study was to find out the meaning and value of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of Finnish global companies in a global operational environment and how companies seek to achieve their targets. Case study research was chosen as a research strategy as this has been shown to be a relevant method in the investigation of a contemporary phenomenon. The data were collected by interviewing (in 2002) seven CSR directors/coordinators of seven Finnish global companies and additionally the director of the organisation Finnish Business & Society. The study suggests that the prominent driving force behind corporate social responsibility is companies long-term profitability supported by company leadership and efficiency, competitiveness, and the ability to anticipate the future. The long evolution of Finnish companies since the 18th century creates fruitful ground for responsibility. There proved to be no significant moral or ethical guidance but for the most part the thinking was business-oriented. The management and the organisation of CSR areas appeared to be professional and efficient. The position of CSR was found to be optimal at the highest level of the organisations, and the commitment of the top managements unquestionable. The present status of CSR seemed to exist more at a principle and theoretical than practical level. Implementation was found to be a major challenge for the future. The jungle of standards and measurements forms a relevant problem. Communication was not integrated into CSR, and there seemed to be no strategies for CSR communication."
2004-0026,A Functional Analysis of Presidential Direct Mail Advertising,Paper,A Functional Analysis of Presidential Direct Mail Advertising,"This study investigated the nature of direct mail advertising, a commonly used but little studied form of political campaign communication. 715 brochures were content analyzed employing the Functional Theory of Political Campaign Discourse. Acclaims were more common than attacks, which in turn occurred more frequently than defenses. Primary campaign pamphlets used more acclaims and fewer attacks than general campaign brochures. Democrats use more attacks and fewer acclaims than Republicans. In the general campaign, incumbent party candidates acclaimed more and attacked less than challengers Winners and losers. Incumbents were also prone to use past deeds to acclaim more, and attack less, than challengers. Challengers tended to use future plans to acclaim more, and attack less, than challengers. Winners used more acclaims and fewer attacks than losers.
Overall, direct mail brochures discussed policy more than character. Democrats discussed policy more and character less than Republicans. Democrats discussed Democratic issues more, and Republican issues less, than Republicans. Incumbent party candidates discussed policy more, and character less, than challengers. Winners discussed policy more, and character less, than losers. Winners attacked more on policy, and less on character, than losers. Similarities and differences between direct mail advertising and other message forms were discussed."

It measured instant responses from the readers contrary to the traditional agenda-setting studies. There are some interesting characteristics of online articles found significant in the effects compared to the traditional studies. The obtrusiveness of a news story did not have a significant effect on the readers responses to the article; however, the length of a news story and the number of hyperlinks of the story were correlated with the number of readers comments for the article. The number of multimedia cues showed different results according to the format of the online newspaper. This study contributes to a better understanding of the agenda-setting process in online newspapers."

The main focus is on the different influence that media exert upon the salience of public aspects (i.e. sociotropic perception: ""most important national problem"") as opposed to private aspects of the issue (i.e. egotropic perception: ""fear of loosing one´s job""). It is called into question that issues may simply be pigeonholed as obtrusive or unobtrusive in the sense of Zucker (1978). Instead, an issue like unemployment is likely to contain obtrusive and unobtrusive aspects at the same time, and thus the nature and severity of media effects is subject to the framing of an issue.
The above assumptions are investigated in a multi-variate time-series-analysis. It spans the period from 1991 to 1998 combining data from three sources: 1. a broad and longterm content analysis of German media, 2. a monthly public trend-survey beeing representative of the German population, 3. German unemployment statistics on a monthly basis. Content analysis includes four most influential news-media (a TV-newscast, a wire-service, a newsmagazine and a newspaper).
The results show that on an aggregate level people´s assessment of the sociotropic, national importance of unemployment is largely determined by news coverage, whereas this assessment is largely detached from the development of the labour market. The opposite is true concerning egotropic aspects: people´s perception of how secure their job is, largely depends on the development of the labour market, only to a tiny degree does it depend on news-coverage."

This study evaluated anxiety and patterns of coping through social support and communication. Gender differences in anxiety and coping are examined. This paper explores coaches, family, and friends as three potential social support avenues for anxious athletes. A sample of 20 male and female collegiate track and field athletes indicated levels of anxiety through the Competitive Sport Anxiety Scale-2. There were no significant gender differences in the level of precompetition anxiety reported. Females reported communicating with family and friends significantly more than men did to reduce sport anxiety. Males reported perceiving more social support from the coach than did females."
2004-0031,A Group Communication Perspective on Organizational Learning,Paper,A Group Communication Perspective on Organizational Learning,"This paper takes a group communication perspective on organizational learning. Specifically, it takes a socialization lens to build on Marchs (1991) organizational-level view of learning through the rate of flow of organizational members entering and exiting organizations. The basic argument is that Marchs model of organizational learning does not help us understand the processes of organizational learning. In turn, complementing his view with learning processes at the group level help us better understand the relationship between individual knowledge and learning at the group and organizational levels. To complement Marchs organizational level view, the theoretical background in this paper distinguishes between Marchs slow and fast learners of the organizational code and learners intelligence. The framework built in this paper is based on communication directionality, the need for communication is learning is to occur, and the view of organizational groups as communities of practice (COPs). The framework is explained through a practical example based on the working experiences of an acquaintance of the authors. Finally, some conceptual and methodological implications of organizational learning and groups as COPs that are highlighted by the model developed here are briefly discussed."

A series of three studies was conducted to explore potential effects architectural style may have on people's perceptions of houses depicted in photographs. Results of the current research confirm that different architectural styles elicit different affective responses and that visual incongruity is noticed and also shapes responses. However, contrary to expectations, gender was not found to influence people's perceptions of the environments."
2004-0033,AIDS and the representation of deviance: Western constructions of African bodies,Paper,AIDS and the representation of deviance: Western constructions of African bodies,"This paper engages in a careful examination of the current AIDS discourse with the intent to provide an alternative means for understanding and approaching AIDS education in Africa, in particular, and the global AIDS discourse, in general. Central to this paper is the assumption that bodies are neither natural nor pre-discursive, but that they are created within the power/knowledge matrix of the dominant discourse. The discourse of AIDS in Africa provides the conditions for the construction of deviant bodies, and this construction holds practical implications. This paper conducts an archaeological survey of the AIDS discourse, with a special focus on its international context, and examines the ways in which the discourse of AIDS constructs racialized and sexualized bodies. Additionally, the discourse seeks to keep bodies under surveillance. The discourse affects policy and education programs, particularly by denying agency and subjectivity to African bodies."

We examined participants encouragement and discouragement at attempts to dialogue in public hearings. To do this we looked at transcripts from a series of public hearings arranged by the Minerals Management Service regarding the Liberty Plan. Statements were coded into categories of dialogic, non-dialogic, and anti-dialogic. Statements in this paper show dialogic moments, but even more non- dialogic, and anti-dialogic moments. It is these non-dialogic and anti-dialogic moments that lead us to support Mathews (1999) claim that public hearings are not particularly effective."

2004-0036,'A little bitty spot and I'm a big man': Patients' perspectives on refusing diagnosis or treatment for lung cancer,Paper,'A little bitty spot and I'm a big man': Patients' perspectives on refusing diagnosis or treatment for lung cancer,"Variations in lung cancer treatment markedly affect survival. Patient refusal of physicians' recommendations may account in part for these variations. Reasons for refusal have not been well researched, and patients who refuse are often labeled as irrational or noncompliant. This study explored why patients refused recommendations for further diagnosis or treatment of suspected or confirmed lung cancer. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine patients with chart-documented refusal of doctors' recommendations for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Questions focused on patients' understanding of disease and medical recommendations, and perceptions of the decision-making process. Patients'decision-making emphasized self-efficacy, minimizing threat, fatalism or faith in a higher power, and distrust of medical authority; explanations were often multi-dimensional. Comments also included complaints about communication with physicians, health system discontinuities, and impact of social support. Patients' explanations of their decisions reflected several ways for coping with an undesirable situation. These included strategies for reducing, sustaining, and increasing uncertainty. Problematic Integration Theory helps to explain patients' difficulties in managing uncertainty when assessments of probability of disease outcomes and evaluations of toxic or invasive treatment recommendations diverge. Implications for clinical communication include increasing trust while delivering bad news, understanding the source of resistance to recommendations, and discussing palliative care."
2004-0037,Al Jazeera: Hybridity and Development in the Middle East,Paper,Al Jazeera: Hybridity and Development in the Middle East,"This paper examines the hybridity of Al Jazeera within the discourses of development and globalization. Popularly recognized as a prototype for autonomous Arabic language television, Al Jazeera actually combines Western standards of journalism, regional political and religious ideologies, and a conservative political financing structure. The result is a unique blend of tradition and modernity that serves the public interest in the Middle East."
2004-0038,All For Him: Topics and Relationship States in Articles about Sex,Paper,All For Him: Topics and Relationship States in Articles about Sex,"Research on sources of information about sex indicate that independent reading is a primary source of information for many young people. For young men in the United States today, such reading is likely to involve lad magazines, a relatively new but very popular genre of lifestyle magazines targeted at young men. In this study, a systematic representative sample of articles about sex from the three most popular American lad magazines are subjected to content analysis. Results indicate that the most common topics are what women want sexually and improving the male reader?s sex life. Analysis of intersections between main and secondary topics suggests that most articles focused on what women want sexually are framed in terms of improving male sexual outcomes, particularly through increased variety of sexual behaviors. At the same time, the normative relational context of sex is depicted as either serious dating relationships or strangers, though both classes of relationship are presented as strongly ambivalent relative to sexual outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of gender stereotypes pertaining to sex."
2004-0039,"A Longitudinal Analysis of Media Crime Reporting, Public Perceptions of Crime and FBI Crime Statistics",Paper,"A Longitudinal Analysis of Media Crime Reporting, Public Perceptions of Crime and FBI Crime Statistics","The overall purpose of this study was to compare the role of four nationally influential print news sources (the New York Times, the Washington Post, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report) with the role of network TV news in accounting for variance in public perceptions of crime as the most important problem facing this country today (MIP) from 1980 through 2001. MIP data were obtained from 25 national Gallup Poll surveys. A Lexis-Nexis online-archive search produced 4,696 print media crime news stories for analysis. An existing database of network TV news stories (Lowry, Nio & Leitner, 2003) was also used. Results indicated that print media crime stories accounted for a significant proportion of variance in MIP from 1980 to 1993, but not from 1994 to 2001. The subjective reality of crime was influenced significantly more by network TV crime coverage than it was by either (a) the crime coverage of four influential print media or (b) actual real-world crimes."
2004-0040,A Longitudinal Investigation of Children's Safety Concerns Surrounding News Coverage of the Terrorists' Attacks,Paper,A Longitudinal Investigation of Children's Safety Concerns Surrounding News Coverage of the Terrorists' Attacks,"The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of childrens exposure to news coverage of the terrorists attacks on their enduring fears and safety concerns. To this end, 140 randomly sampled parents of 5- to 17- year olds in Ingham County, Michigan were surveyed at two points in time: one week and nearly one year after the attacks on New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington DC. Parents were queried at each time period about their childs patterns of exposure to TV news, safety concerns, and fear. Regression analyses revealed that early exposure to the terrorists attacks the week of September 11th 2001 was related to heightened safety concerns a year later, but only among 5- to 8-year olds in the sample. The findings emerged despite controlling for parents fear as well as their childs Time 1 level of safety concern."
2004-0041,A Longitudinal Study of Organizational Communication Climate,Paper,A Longitudinal Study of Organizational Communication Climate,"This report describes the organizational communication climate at the state office of a large state agency over nearly five years. At the start of the period, the agency moved from reporting to one larger agency to another within the state bureaucracy, examined job responsibilities and its internal structure, changed leadership, and moved to a different locale. Later there was a change in its mission statement and another move of the agency within a larger agency.

Organizational members completed the same survey near the end of the first, third, and fifth years. Over the five years, there were improvements in the adequacy of information and the effectiveness of various communication technologies, but there were few changes in relational climates, and communication competence remained low. The pattern of results suggests that the various organizational changes had little impact on the organizational climate beyond the turbulence of the first year."
2004-0042,Always Connected: A Longitudinal Field Study of Mobile Communication,Paper,Always Connected: A Longitudinal Field Study of Mobile Communication,"Twenty-five novice users of a new mobile communication device, allowing them to be always connected to their e-mail, e-calendar and organizer via GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), were closely tracked for a period of three months. The benefits of being always connected, to be accessible at all times and places make technology-enabled people almost automatically adapt the new mobile communication device to their daily lives for both instrumental and intrinsic uses. The results of this longitudinal field study suggest that peoples motivations for using mobile communication technology are initially influenced more strongly by their perceptions about the expected use, which is more task-oriented. Over time, due to the quick habituation of the new mobile communication device important, initial gratifications, like permanent access and social interaction, appear to be less manifest reasons for using the mobile communication device and become more latent, while gratifications like fashion/status and entertainment appear to become more dominant. Moreover, the boundary between work and personal life slowly disappears as people can easily use mobile communication technology simultaneously for personal and business purposes in both social and work-related contexts."
2004-0043,A Marriage Between the Internet and Alternative Voices,Paper,A Marriage Between the Internet and Alternative Voices,"This paper compared the newly emerging web-based alternative news media with the mainstream newspapers in their coverage of the anti-America movement in 2002 in South Korea. The findings show that the issue coverage was initially led by alternative online news media, and mainstream newspapers participated in the coverage in earnest when the issue expanded its scope. This paper also found that alternative online news media and mainstream newspapers approached the issue differently in terms of the types of news stories, topics, and sources. Implications of these findings for the agenda-building process are discussed."
2004-0044,"Ambiguity, SARS and Media System Dependency Theory",Paper,"Ambiguity, SARS and Media System Dependency Theory","This paper begins with a comparison between ambiguity, uncertainty and other synonyms. It is suggested that the term ambiguity works better for future systematic and interdisciplinary researches. It then proceeds to explain the routinization of media systems centralized roles, using Giddens structuration theory. Ball-Rokeachs (1973) definition of ambiguity as absence of a definition of situation is adopted. Two types of ambiguity (i.e. inability to define the situation, inability to choose from over two definitions) are discussed later in the case of SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which combines the previous discussion of ambiguity and centralization of media system. The first type of ambiguity emerges out of Chinas authoritarian media system. The second type of ambiguity emerges out of Hong Kongs responsive media system. Both types of ambiguity are analyzed in multi-level storytelling systems. Finally, a relationship between ambiguity, SARS and media system dependency theory was summarized. It is claimed that SARS is a perfect example of pervasive ambiguity in which people form more intense media system dependency relations."
2004-0045,Ambivalent social networks and their consequences for participation,Paper,Ambivalent social networks and their consequences for participation,"Does perceived disagreement in political discussion help or hinder citizens political participation? Some argue that disagreement prompts reflection, perspective-taking, and tolerance. Challengers argue that disagreement fosters ambivalence and hinders participatory activities and turnout. One seminal study that tackled this dilemma formulated the cross-pressures hypothesis (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, & Gaudet, 1944/1968), which posited that the more individuals are betwixt and between conflicting social positions, the longer the time for their vote intention to crystallize (and the lower the likelihood they would vote). This paper offers a critique and refinement of the cross-pressures hypothesis. First, previous studies confounded intra-individual and structural sources of cross-pressures. Second, past operationalizations of exposure to disagreement focused on the sheer amount of opposition to the individuals point of view, rather than his or her exposure to two conflicting points of view. A new measure--network ambivalence--is proposed to capture the latter dynamic. Conceptual and methodological refinements of the cross-pressures hypothesis are tested on a representative sample of voting-age respondents in the United States, interviewed on the National Election Study 2000 panel (N = 1555). Results suggest that not only were these pressures rarely detrimental to participation, but they also facilitated the formation of considered electoral preferences."
2004-0046,A Mediated Reality of September 11 and the 'War on Terrorism': America Portrayed in The Independent,Paper,A Mediated Reality of September 11 and the 'War on Terrorism': America Portrayed in The Independent,"Using framing theory, this study explored how one British newspaper, The Independent, covered the events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent war on terrorism in order to gain a better understanding of the British publics mediated reality of these events. Units of analysis included articles that appeared in the paper during three different time periods between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2002. News stories and commentaries were examined on two levels: 1) a thematic level that examined the topic of the article; 2) a linguistic level that examined the articles descriptive language. Studies have shown that media images can influence world opinion and international relations. Therefore, it is imperative to understand what those images are. This study found that The Independent presented both negative and positive images of America during the time periods studied. Primarily, America was portrayed as a victim, but also as a war monger and a weakened superpower."

Interviews with corporate communicators at the airline and analysis of electronic publications released internally within the airline reveal how mediated communication channels supported the supervisory communication efforts after the 9/11 attacks. An internal employee campaign called ""Good Words"" is used to illustrate how emerging technologies can support the emotional needs of employees after a crisis. The article concludes with lessons American Airlines learned from the terrorist attacks and implications for crisis communicators."

It is based on a sub sample of the latest American journalist study and the study Online Journalists in Germany. The comparisons show some striking differences between the American and German online journalists  basic characteristics, professionalization levels and role perceptions are much more different than expected. This leads to the question whether studies in certain national contexts can be easily transferred to other countries, or whether we need more comparative studies to fully understand differences and similarities in the development of public communication worldwide."
2004-0049,"American Stereotypes, Television Viewing, and Personal Contact",Paper,"American Stereotypes, Television Viewing, and Personal Contact","The purpose of this research is to explore how exposure to Chinese television contributes to the American stereotypes held by Chinese people and how interpersonal contact with Americans influences the cultivation effect. Based on Cultivation Theory and the contact hypothesis, it is proposed that TV viewing is correlated with the stereotypical views of Americans, and the frequency and quality of personal contact would weaken the cultivation effect. A self-administered survey was distributed to a snowball sample in China to test the hypotheses. The collected data demonstrate partial support for two of the three hypotheses: total TV viewing and viewing of some genres of programs are found to be correlated with certain types of stereotypes; frequency of personal contact is found to partially influence the cultivation effect of U.S. MTV."
2004-0050,America's Rap Audience: An Artificial Divide?,Paper,America's Rap Audience: An Artificial Divide?,"The paper explores how African-American and white audiences construct different understandings of rap music and rap artists. The history of American popular music has included a phenomenon known as black innovation and white popularization. Blues, jazz and gospel records are the results of two centuries of African-American creativity. But while the music became more accessible to a broader audiences, popularization usually came at the expense of the original versions of the music itself, as record companies altered it for what they viewed as a mainstream audience. The phenomenon has helped perpetuate a cultural separation of white and black audiences. Some recent research, however, suggests rap musics mainstream popularity may help overcome some of the traditional divisions between black and white audiences of popular music. This paper tests this proposition, exploring the extent to which African-American and white audiences construct different understandings of four cross-over rap artists. The study is a content analysis of a mainstream music magazine with a primarily white audience (Rolling Stone) and one music magazine with a primarily black audience (The Source). While the articles portray most of the artists mostly in starkly different terms, there is some indication that certain unique artists attract coverage strikingly similar in nature and tone."
2004-0051,A Meta-analysis of Journal Articles Intersecting Issues of Internet and Gender,Paper,A Meta-analysis of Journal Articles Intersecting Issues of Internet and Gender,"During the past several years, the propagation and mainstream acceptance of the Internet has been a hot topic addressed in media, business, and scholarly environments. Academic journals are one source of scholarly information on the Internet, and have provided some broad research on this topic. Journals in the disciplines of communications, social sciences, and technology have addressed the various issues around Internet technology. One of the main issues of concern around the Internet has been the idea of a digital divide, or a gap in access and usage patterns based on social/cultural status, including gender, income, race, education, and age.

Internet usage of males and females in the United States has been increasing to a point of equity in recent surveys. But many studies still point to differences in usage of and representations within technology that can lead to disenfranchisement and inequity. By framing the gender gap in Internet usage as all but eliminated, continued research could be discouraged regarding gender differences beyond access and how this new type of divide is manifesting itself toward the potential of Internet. This study looks at the evolution of articles that deal with the gender implications of the Internet in journals in the fields of communications, gender studies, and technology and society."
2004-0052,A Methodology for Observing Emotions During Interpersonal Arguments,Paper,A Methodology for Observing Emotions During Interpersonal Arguments,"Although face to face arguing is a kind of communication that can be very involving emotionally, we have little research on moment-to-moment feelings during arguments. This paper is a first report on a method for observing and rating feelings. Attitude toward the other and several discrete emotions (anger, happiness, sadness, and tenderness) are rated at approximately 30 second intervals for two videotaped interactions. These ratings proved to be reliable, and to generate interesting data regarding three fundamental issues: do arguers mirror one another's emotions? do the rated emotions move in synchrony with one another within each arguer? do emotional displays connect with argument content? With only two arguments providing data, generalizations about emotions during arguing are inappropriate. However, the research method appears to hold promise for full scale investigations."
2004-0053,'A Minor Earthquake':Barthes and New Media Texts,Paper,'A Minor Earthquake':Barthes and New Media Texts,"In S/Z, Barthes (1974) writes that
We shall therefore star the text, separating, in the manner of a minor earthquake, the blocks of signification of which reading grasps only the smooth surface, imperceptibly soldered by the movement of sentences, the flowing discourse of narration, the ""naturalness"" of ordinary language. The tutor signifier will be cut up into a series of brief, contiguous fragments, which we shall call lexias, since they are units of reading (p. 13).
The method Barthes begins to describe here, and the turn from structuralism to poststructuralism that it signifies, affected the way we theorize the relationship of author, text, reader and culture in a way that indeed constituted at the least ""a minor earthquake.""
Roughly twenty years after the publication of S/Z, its ideas became central to theorizing the then-nascent new technological form called hypertext, and have remained central to thinking about digital media forms since then. This essay will consider Barthes's influence on various aspects of theorizing new media, as well as how this theorizing may reflect back on thinking about Barthes."

2004-0055,Analyzing variability in discourse and stability of racist justification,Paper,Analyzing variability in discourse and stability of racist justification,"In this presentation, I will be discussing how to analyze racist ideology while acknowledging the fragmented, episodic and disjointed nature of discourse that does not contain an inventory of ideology as readily recognizable structures. I will be analyzing examples from Danish popular discourse on immigration.

Scholars with a post-structuralist and social constructionist orientation have long been aware of the contingent nature of the language. Variability and intertextuality (multiple voices) in utterances indicate the rhetorical (responsive) nature of meaning. This raises an important question: if utterances are episodic, disjointed, interactive (responsive) and often contradictory, how do we identify and analyze racism?

Many discourse analytical studies have demonstrated that there is a pervasive feature of ethnic discourse: people often end up justifying racial and ethnic discrimination even when they mobilize egalitarian and liberal ideas. Variability indicates the problematic nature of attitude research but it does not explain this enduring tendency to justify discrimination even while displaying liberal and anti-racist sentiments.

The term hegemony as Laclau and Mouffe formulated may be helpful in conceptualizing this paradox (variability in discourse vs. stability of racist justification). Floating (fragmented, contradictory) elements in discourse are articulated into racist effects through argumentative chains in a responsive manner to the discursive interventions from privileged access points, which constitute reference points that stabilize (fix) meaning in public discourse (not in peoples heads). Public opinion is then produced by measuring peoples responses to these particular articulations."
2004-0056,An analysis of activist frames: How the Sierra Club frames public messages,Paper,An analysis of activist frames: How the Sierra Club frames public messages,"This study looks at the master and sub frames used by the Sierra Club to communicate with its members and the public. Content analysis of Sierra Club chapter newsletters, regional and national newspapers was conducted to identify the occurrence of message frames and sources.
Frames in three areas  drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, coal-fired power plants, and sprawl  were analyzed. Sprawl was the most mentioned subject in all three media. Sierra Club themes were found infrequently, suggesting the need to focus frames. Nevertheless, Sierra Club frames appeared with greater frequency than competing frames. Environmental sources were the majority in the sampled articles, suggesting the opportunity for powerful framing of public opinion, with focused message frames and trained environmental spokespeople at all levels, i.e., national, regional, local.
This study opens new theoretical ground for public relations scholarship and could influence message strategies of activist and corporate or government organizations."
2004-0057,An Analysis of Adjustment Pattern of Japanese students in the US,Paper,An Analysis of Adjustment Pattern of Japanese students in the US,"This paper reports the results of a study on the intercultural adjustment experience of Japanese students overseas. First, it describes the culture shock experience of university students, according to the definition given by Mumforld (1999). It then analyzes the multi-dimensional relationship of various constructs used in cross-cultural research as co-influencing the students` adaptation abroad. It suggests that other than language and interpersonal communication competence (Nishida, 1984), the skill in intercultural communication competence (ICC) is more essential in predicting success in overseas adaptation (Hammer, et al, 2003). By categorizing research variables into two groups: those that describe the sojourners` psychological and environmental conditions prior to departure, and those of the host culture, it attempts to provide an integrative framework for an analysis of intercultural adaptation research. (Kim,1989)."
2004-0058,An analysis of instrumental and socio-emotional content in online multiplayer videogames,Paper,An analysis of instrumental and socio-emotional content in online multiplayer videogames,"The present study examined the instrumental and socio-emotional content of messages produced in an online multiplayer videogame. Over four thousand messages produced by 65 players over a 2-week period were analyzed. The results suggest that players produced significantly more messages expressing socio-emotional content than task-oriented content. Of the socio-emotional content that was produced, the vast majority of it was positive in nature, despite the official game objective of fighting one another. The experience level of the players also played an important role in message production. More experienced players produced significantly more positive socio-emotional content than less experience players, and they were more likely to use specialized conventions (e.g., emoticons, abbreviations, and scripted emotes). These results generally support predictions flowing from the social information processing theory of interpersonal computer-mediated communication."
2004-0059,A Narrative Analysis of The Oprah Winfrey Show:,Paper,A Narrative Analysis of The Oprah Winfrey Show:,"On November 5, 2002, Oprah Winfrey aired an episode of her show called ""What Does the World Think of Us?"" Winfrey teamed up with CNN correspondents from around the world to pose this question to citizens of different countries. The show was aimed at the American audience with the stated intention to inform Americans about what the world thinks of them. On one hand, this show illustrates how little the media teaches Americans about the world, but, as a mediated text, this show also moved to make up for that lack. This essay analyzes the structural features of the narrative in order to discover the how the show functions not only to inform the audience but the manner used to persuade the American audience of the need to become more aware of international opinion. Additionally, it examines some aspects of the narrative that ultimately, may work against the intended persuasiveness of the message."
2004-0060,A National Longitudinal Study of the Effect of Exposure to Alcohol Advertising on Youth Drinking,Paper,A National Longitudinal Study of the Effect of Exposure to Alcohol Advertising on Youth Drinking,"As the public concern about youth drinking mounts, there has been continuing debate among policy-makers and scholars about the role of alcohol advertising in causing youth to drink alcoholic beverages. To examine the relationship between drinking alcoholic beverages and advertising exposure among youth 15-26 year olds, a large-scale national longitudinal study was conducted. Survey data over four time periods from 1873 individuals living in 24 different media markets was matched with data about the amount of television, radio, and outdoor advertising in their market. The study found that alcohol advertising exposure led to increased youth drinking to a greater extent than drinking led to subsequent alcohol ad exposure. Self-reported advertising exposure accounted for 17 percent of the variance in youth drinking amounts. A test of the reverse causality hypothesis found that prior drinking explained as much as 8 percent of the variance in subsequent ad exposure. Drinking levels were slightly affected by the mere amount of alcohol advertising in the market."
2004-0061,"And Baby Makes Three... : Gay Men, Straight Women and the Parental Imperative in Film and Television",Paper,"And Baby Makes Three... : Gay Men, Straight Women and the Parental Imperative in Film and Television","Relationships between gay men and straight women have long been a significant theme in popular representations of queerness, both creating and reinforcing cultural myths about male homosexuality, femininity (always conflated with female heterosexuality), and the >natural= links between them. This article explores one rather surprising aspect of this queer representational tradition: the parental imperative.

In various films and television programs over the last 40 years (including ""A Taste of Honey"" (1961), ""Soap"" (ABC: 1977-1981), ""Sidney Shorr: A Girl's Best Friend"" (NBC: 1981), and ""The Object of My Affection"" (1997)), pregnancy and parenting recur over and over again as major themes in gay-man/straight-woman representations, producing a number of striking narrative patterns.

By unevenly deploying what I refer to as ""parental capital,"" these domesticity/pregnancy scenarios generally present gay men as socially and emotionally responsible members of society, while regularly producing female characters who are selfish, self-interested, and unfit for motherhood. Moreover, while these stories would seem to revolve around the possibility of establishing viable alternative family structures, the vast majority of their narratives end in separation or the complete dissolution of the family unit.

Yet there are also glimmers of a more expansive set of narrative possibilities. Some texts do provide opportunities for us to imagine new models for fatherhood, motherhood and relationships between men and women, gay and straight. And these alternative relationships, following Foucault's belief in the transformative power of ""affection, tenderness, friendship, fidelity, camaraderie, and companionship,"" have the potential to reorganize and reinvent the culture in which we live."
2004-0062,And then nothing turns itself inside out,Paper,And then nothing turns itself inside out,This paper looks at the influence that philosopher Gottfried Leibniz played in the thinking of everyday life philosopher Henri Lefebvre. Lefebvre's theory of moments and his conceptions of 'the everyday' draw upon often overlooked (and controversial) elements from Leibniz' monadology (and other later writings). The paper concludes by considering how substituting 'everyday life' for the 'culture' of cultural studies requires a closer consideration of the inherently biopolitical implications that Lefebvre teased out of Leibniz.

This investigation measured and compared use frequency of rhetorical devices used to discuss patient care during weekly multidisciplinary BMT outpatient and inpatient team meetings; and measured and compared use frequency of rhetorical devices that describe task and socio-emotional relationships within the multidisciplinary BMT outpatient and inpatient teams in their weekly meetings. Ten rhetorical devices were developed for this study and partitioned into three main groups: (a) Patient Centered rhetorical devices, (b) Group Centered rhetorical devices, and (c) Intermediary rhetorical devices. The data indicated that (a) Inpatient Clinical rhetorical devices were used significantly more frequently than Inpatient Non-clinical rhetorical devices; (b) Outpatient Clinical rhetorical devices were used significantly more frequently than Outpatient Non-clinical rhetorical devices; (c) Inpatient Task rhetorical devices were used significantly more frequently than Inpatient Socio-emotional rhetorical devices; and (d) Outpatient Task rhetorical devices were used significantly more frequently than Outpatient Socio-emotional rhetorical devices. Research implications and future directions are discussed.

Working from the theoretical framework of the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) this empirical examination tested whether college students attitudes toward mental illness and the mentally ill were affected by watching a television sitcom containing DTC ads for prescription drugs to treat such conditions. It also examined the influence previous experience with mental illness has on stigma towards mental illness and attitudes toward treatment of mental illness. It was found that as frequency of DTC ads viewed increased, mental illness was perceived as more treatable and participants with low previous experience were more likely to interact with people with mental illness after viewing more DTC ads."
2004-0065,An Empirical Test of SES and Media Use: Modeling the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis in the TV versus Newspaper Context,Paper,An Empirical Test of SES and Media Use: Modeling the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis in the TV versus Newspaper Context,"Conventional wisdom holds that people with higher educational level are more likely to engage in reading newspapers, thus gaining more knowledge than those with lower educational level. However, a specific question about the difference between higher SES and lower SES people in terms of their exposure to newspaper versus exposure to television has not been directly answered through empirical test. The present study tested a basic model of the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and media use. Using logistic and multiple regression analyses, the findings of the present study suggest that higher SES people have a significantly higher probability of reading newspaper than lower SES people, and higher SES people spend significantly less time watching television than lower SES people."
2004-0066,A Network Analysis of Computer-Mediated Communication Patterns between American and Chinese College Students,Paper,A Network Analysis of Computer-Mediated Communication Patterns between American and Chinese College Students,"In an exploratory pretest/posttest field experiment, 22 American (8 female, 14 male) and 22 Chinese (13 female, 9 male) college students were induced to exchange e-mail messages. Participants provided information about hobbies and other interests via a pretest questionnaire. The Americans information and e-mail addresses were shared with the Chinese and vice versa. Participants were then asked to send messages to participants in the other country and to copy all exchanged e-mails to the researcher. After three weeks, posttest questionnaires measured participants e-mailing experiences and collected scores on a standard personality index, FIRO-B (Schutz 1958). Participants demographics and personality traits were analyzed in concert with network analysis techniques to determine whether strong ties were formed. Results indicate students with high desire for social interaction spent less time on the Internet, but were more likely to exchange e-mails with the foreign students; Chinese women and American men were most likely to sustain online relationships."
2004-0067,An examination of the social categorization of Chinese ethnic groups and its influence on intergroup relations in Australia,Paper,An examination of the social categorization of Chinese ethnic groups and its influence on intergroup relations in Australia,"A content analysis of a purposive sample of 857 articles from four Australian newspapers was conducted to examine the social categorization of Chinese ethnic groups in Australian and non-Australian contexts, as well as the possible social influence of those identified categories. Results indicate that Chinese were primarily portrayed as illegal immigrants representing ordinary people and authoritarian leaders representing the government. While issues such as politics, business, moral/legal matters received significant coverage, issues relating to multiculturalism and interethnic co-existence received scant attention. The possible effects of exposure to these categories are reinforcement of differences between ethnic majorities and ethnic minorities rather than the promotion of interethnic co-existence. These findings enrich the existing research on the effects of media portrayal of ethnic minorities on intergroup relations and point out a few directions for further study."
2004-0068,An Experimental Investigation of Source Confusion in Political News and Advertisements,Paper,An Experimental Investigation of Source Confusion in Political News and Advertisements,"ABSTRACT

This study employs an experimental design to investigate the effects of message structure on memory for source of information. Political messages are presented in three types of formats  conventional political advertisements, news-like advertisements and news stories. Memory for the source of the information is measured directly after exposure and a week later. Forty subjects participated in this experiment.
The results of the experiment suggest that format and time had
a significant effect on memory for source. Subjects identified the source of information at about the same rate right after exposure. However, the rate of source confusion for news-like advertisements increased significantly after a week.
Format also significantly affected judgment criteria for source such that undetected information presented in news-like advertisements was more likely to be guessed as coming from a news story than advertisement. At the same time the rate of correct source guessing for conventional advertisements was higher than that for news stories."
2004-0069,An Experimental Study on the Cultural and Situational Influence on Self-Construal and Conflict Strategies,Paper,An Experimental Study on the Cultural and Situational Influence on Self-Construal and Conflict Strategies,"This study combines the perspectives of culture-as-shared-values and culture-in-context to investigate the self-construal model. It was hypothesized that cultural and contextual factors interact in deciding what self-construal components would be salient in conflict situations. Further, cultural and situational factors should interact in deciding what conflict strategies one would use. The hypotheses were tested with an experimental design. A hypothetical conflict situation was provided and four types of self-construals of the hypothetical interactant were induced. A total of 233 participants (101 Taiwanese and 132 Americans) were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions and one control group. Results supported the hypotheses. Cultural and situational factors interact in affecting peoples self-construals, as well as their choices of conflict strategies. The authors concludes that although cultural values shape ones self-construal, situational factors decide which values to be activated. Therefore, cultural and contextual factors should both be considered in self-construal research."
2004-0070,An Exploration of Internet and Traditional Media Uses in the Rio Grande Valley,Paper,An Exploration of Internet and Traditional Media Uses in the Rio Grande Valley,"The present study explores Hispanic residents uses of the Internet and traditional media. The Hispanic residents sampled in this study live on the Texas/Mexico border, also known as the Rio Grande Valley. Many of these residents live in colonias where accessibility to technologies is hindered due to infrastructure problems as well as a lack of resources. Despite these difficulties, the Rio Grande Valley residents benefits from public access locations where the Internet is available. Building off of previous uses and gratifications work, our results provide insight into why residents use computers and the Internet. Additionally, our results differentiate how residents use traditional media such as (1) books, newspapers, and magazines, (2) e-mail and the Internet, (3) face-to-face communication, (4) telephone, and (5) television compared with newer media such as the Internet in satisfying their general needs as well as their social integration, entertainment, informational, and instrumental needs. Lastly, our results illustrate how skeptical residents are of both traditional and new media. Our results are compared with published reports that examine why respondents, often from mainstream United States populations, use traditional and newer media. Directions for future research that have particular relevance to the discussion of the digital divide among Hispanics of different age, gender, and class groups are discussed."
2004-0071,An Exploration of Parasocial Interaction and Reality-Based Television Programs,Paper,An Exploration of Parasocial Interaction and Reality-Based Television Programs,"This study explores the immense popularity of reality-based television programs by examining the concept of parasocial interaction. Previous research has indicated that parasocial interaction is a significant gratification received by regular viewers of programs within this genre. In this study, 302 students at a large southeastern university viewed one episode of 14 different comedy, drama, or reality programs. Afterward, they completed a measure of parasocial interaction. Results indicate that prior exposure to the program is significantly correlated with a persons level of parasocial interaction. Furthermore, levels of parasocial interaction were found to differ significantly among the programs screened in the study. Future research should be directed at examining differences between programs in the genre and examining their effects on viewers."
2004-0072,An exploratory study of public knowledge and perceptions of dredging and reuse of dredged materials,Paper,An exploratory study of public knowledge and perceptions of dredging and reuse of dredged materials,"Despite the prevalence, economic importance, potential public conflict, possible health and environmental risks, and the necessity of creating disposal sites, there is a scarcity of research into the public perceptions of and knowledge about dredging or the fate of dredged materials. In Rhode Island, a recent change in state law promoting the beneficial use of dredged materials on land, a number of ongoing and proposed dredging projects, the recent approval of a facility for de-watering and storing dredged material, and the lack of an off-shore disposal site combined to create a unique opportunity for research in the public interest. Our findings reveal misunderstandings about dredging and mistrust of public officials in relation to the regulatory process in Rhode Island. We offer several recommendations toward diminishing the potential for public outrage and increasing the level of public engagement in the regulatory process."

This paper narrates little-known facts about Hickys journalistic career, the influence of his newspaper on society and other issues not probed by earlier researchers.
Hicky quickly realized that truly distinguished newspapers should serve society, even at the risk of official displeasure. Hickys newspaper made interesting reading with its ample dose of scurrilous reporting, risqué advertisements reflecting the low morality in society, and scandalous accounts of the misdeeds of British administrators in India.
Soon enough, the British rulers charged him of libel. Hicky was harassed, attacked and jailed. Undaunted, Hicky continued to edit his newspaper from prison. But his publication did not survive long and the British rulers caused him immense harm and Hicky died a pauper."
2004-0075,An integrative review of various types of long-distance romantic couples:,Paper,An integrative review of various types of long-distance romantic couples:,"Numerous types of romantic long-distance relationships are reviewed including dating relationships, dual-career couples, and spouses separated due to military deployments or incarceration. The usual criterion of relational stability as success is simplistic, as success may be defined in numerous ways and upon numerous levels: individual, dyadic, and institutional or societal. The role of communication in each of these levels of success is considered. Vague, positive communication may help sustain LDRs as it fosters idealized images, yet the extent to which stability or idealization are good is questioned. The possibility that relational dissolution or lessened contact may be considered as success in certain circumstances is raised. Pragmatic implications are discussed."

Messages sent and received by members of health organizations have a tremendous impact on the primary, secondary, and tertiary identities of cancer patients (Harwood & Sparks, 2003). An intergroup approach to the study of providers and patients reveals that beliefs, emotions, and behaviors during cancer care impact social identity."
2004-0077,An interpretive analysis of postgraduate student - advisor conversations: An intergroup approach,Paper,An interpretive analysis of postgraduate student - advisor conversations: An intergroup approach,"The main aim of this study was to qualitatively analyze intergroup communication processes in conversations between postgraduate students and their academic advisors. Communication accommodation theory (CAT) was used as the main theoretical framework. A secondary aim was to contribute to the CAT literature by operationalizing CAT communication strategies. Transcripts of conversations between 31 supervisor-postgraduate student dyads were analyzed, and a number of predicted and emergent themes were produced. The themes included dominance, status, mentoring, academic identity, and postgraduate students independence, amongst others. Face issues also emerged as a central theme. The findings supported CAT as a robust theory for examining ingroup and intergroup processes in supervisor-postgraduate student communication."
2004-0078,Anonymous Organizational Communication: Influences of Organizational Members Perceptions,Paper,Anonymous Organizational Communication: Influences of Organizational Members Perceptions,"Organizations provide areas for anonymous communication to flourish and anonymity is becoming increasingly common in the workplace. Nevertheless, little is known about how the receivers of such communication are affected and how their perceptions change about the source of the communication. Simply state, anonymous communication is an often used, but rarely studied phenomenon. Many factors, some unique to the organizational setting, influence how an organizational member perceives anonymous communication. This paper reviews current research concerning anonymous communication and offers ideas for future research to help to further our understanding of how anonymous communication is perceived by organizational members."

Developments on the international stage brought attention to Muslims and raised questions about the compatibility of Islam with democracy and modernity. Through a textual analysis of a series about Muslims in Europe, this study argues that National Public Radio mediated an image of Muslims in Europe, which suggests that Islam as a culture forms an Orient that is no longer bound by geography and exists in the Occident."
2004-0080,Another Approach and Perspective,Paper,Another Approach and Perspective,"In this paper, the author is trying to portray the China-American differential features within a broader perspective or framework. China-American differences are classified into three categories from the upper to base: 1) Spiritual Differences; 2) Emotional Differences; 3) Material Differences. On the spiritual level, Chinese are atheistic; Americans are, on the contrary, strong God believers. On the emotional levels, Chinese culture stresses emotional elements but has put them in a random and unsubstantial pattern; American culture disregard emotions impact but has built a stable and consolidate pattern to harness, cultivate and maintain human emotional energies. On the material level, China is a thrifty nation with limited natural resources and comparatively backward technology; America is a wealthy country with rich natural resources and undoubtedly the most advanced technology. The differences exit on all levels and in all fields. These three categories would cover almost all the aspects. However, due to the lack of specific, objective and in-depth survey, further researches are necessary to realize and complete this portfolio of China-America cultural differences."
2004-0081,Anticipation and Communication in Communication Systems: Towards a Model for Luhmann's Sociological Theory of Communication,Paper,Anticipation and Communication in Communication Systems: Towards a Model for Luhmann's Sociological Theory of Communication,"A system which contains a model of itself can function in an anticipatory mode. Anticipatory systems can be simulated. The social system can be expected to contain two anticipatory mechanisms: (1) meaning is provided with hindsight, i.e., with a time step difference from the reflected operation; (2) the differentiation in the social system generates an asynchronicity (Ät) between the operation of its subsystems. The differentiation allows for another anticipatory mechanism: the codes of the different subsystems provide them with representations of each other. When the two anticipatory mechanisms are left free to operate on each other, a so-called strongly anticipatory system can be shaped as a resonance between the two degrees of freedom. While weak anticipatory systems contain a model of themselves as a prediction, a strong anticipatory system can also construct its next stage. The social system then generates endogenously mechanisms for its renewal. For example, the systems of reference can be redefined in a technological evolution of the social system. The knowledge base of this system or its subsystems (e.g., the economy) can become globalized."

In particular, it examined the relationships between instructor use of antisocial behavior alteration techniques (BATs), student perceptions of instructor interactional justice, and students likelihood of indirectly aggressing against their instructors. Results indicate that student perceptions of instructors use of antisocial BATs and instructor interactional injustice predicted increased student indirect aggression. In addition, student perceptions of instructor antisocial BAT use and interactional justice were negatively correlated and interactional justice was a stronger predictor of student indirect aggression than was instructor antisocial BAT use."
2004-0083,"ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE or HERE AND NOW, IN THIS CONTEXT",Paper,"ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE or HERE AND NOW, IN THIS CONTEXT","The central question in this paper is how valuable users of mobile telephones find 3rd generation mobile entertainment and information services and what the underlying context and situational variables are that influence their choices. The assumption is that the use of mobile entertainment and information services is context and situation-dependent. To test to what extent context and situation influence the use of the above-mentioned services we have used the so-called Policy Capturing Method. On the basis of questionnaires we have collected data among a homogenous group of students of Delft Technical University. The results of this study indicate that users of mobile telephones, depending on their specific context, as yes show little interest in the use of 3rd generation mobile entertainment and information services. On the one hand that leads to scepticism regarding the success of these services. On the other hand we have to wonder where mobile services can find their place in the wide range of available alternatives. It may very well be the case that the development of 3rd generation mobile services will have to be extremely niche-oriented."
2004-0084,A Panel Study of Community Attachment and Local News Media Use,Paper,A Panel Study of Community Attachment and Local News Media Use,"Numerous studies have demonstrated a relationship between community attachment and local news media use. However, despite calls for panel studies to help determine the direction of causality in this relationship, there is little in the way of evidence beyond cross-sectional surveys, and these surveys are most often limited to single communities. In order to help provide empirical data to help settle the longstanding debate about the direction of this relationship, we conducted a four-wave national panel study with repeated measurement of community attachment and local news media use across waves two, three and four, with antecedent demographic and structural variables measured in the first wave. Cross-sectional analyses confirmed the expected relationship between news use and community attachment, but more conservative panel analyses with control for prior levels of outcome variables indicated no significant relationships. An additional prediction about the role of community size as a moderator of the relationship between local news use and community attachment was not supported. We discuss methodological and theoretical reasons for the lack of support for these hypotheses and make suggestions for alternative study designs for future research."
2004-0085,A pitfall of new media? User controls exacerbate editing effects on memory,Paper,A pitfall of new media? User controls exacerbate editing effects on memory,"How does user control affect cognitive outcomes of consequence for communication research, such as memory? While one might expect increased user control to diminish the previously-documented impact of content complexity on memory, this paper reviews reason and evidence to believe that user control in fact can exacerbate such editing effects. In order to investigate this possibility, researchers developed an interface offering two levels of user control and conducted an experiment with 75 participants at a large university in the Midwestern United States. Results support two main hypotheses, not only indicating that participants were more likely to recognize context stable media content in comparison to less stable content a week after initial viewing but also pointing to a significant interaction between that content feature and the degree of user control permitted in affecting memory. Implications for Internet-based education and strategic communication efforts, including those in the public interest, are discussed."
2004-0086,"Apolitical Politics: GOP Efforts to Foster Identification from U.S. Latinos, 1984-2000",Paper,"Apolitical Politics: GOP Efforts to Foster Identification from U.S. Latinos, 1984-2000","The growth and youth of the U.S. Latino population at the close of the twentieth century makes them a desired constituency for both major political parties. Intriguingly, the party organization which has long resisted the recognition of internal voting blocsthe GOPhas allocated unprecedented resources between 1980 and 2000 to inspire identification from Latinos. This study investigates the nature of these invitations. Specifically, it reveals how a party, whose organizational identity opposes acknowledging individuals as ethnic group members, appeals to an ethnic group. By examining (1) English and Spanish language television advertisements and (2) elite interview data with Republican Latino strategists, we argue that these ads depict satisfied Latino citizens, emphasize Latino family connections, and eschew traditional political issues. These identification strategies are notable for they may have considerable effects on the American polity at the dawn of, and well into, the twenty-first century."
2004-0087,Apology and Personality Dispositions,Paper,Apology and Personality Dispositions,"Personality predisopositions and their relationship to apology styles were investigated. Subjects completed the Big Five Personality Profile (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) and wrote what they would say in 14 hypothetical situations that varied in offense intensity and relationship familiarity (strangers, acquaintances, friends). Only agreeableness significantly affected apology use. In support of the first hypothesis, high agreeables were likely to provide more apologies, explanations, offers of repair and take more responsibility for their actions than were low agreeables. Consistent with the second hypothesis, high agreeables were likely to use more pro-social intensifiers and fewer denials than low agreeables. Implications for further research are discussed."
2004-0088,Appealing to Those Most Likely to Shop New Websites,Paper,Appealing to Those Most Likely to Shop New Websites,"This study extends the conventional wisdom concerning how a commercial website can be configured to attract online shoppers, and specifically, initial shoppers. Based on past research (e.g., Torkzadeh & Dhillon, 2002) and theory (e.g., Rogers, 1995), a number of form and substantive website features were assessed as to their attractiveness to consumers of varying (a) Internet experience and (b) innovativeness. A self-administered survey was completed by a convenience sample of 363 residents of the U.S. and Canada. A discriminant analysis confirms that two functions, generally representing form and substantive features, each discriminate between (a) high and low innovativeness (DF1) and (b) high and low Internet experience (DF2). Further, those with more Internet experience show a stronger preference for substantive features than do those with less experience. But high and low experience groups do not differ noticeably with regard to preference for form features. It was also found that, conversely, the more innovative shoppers reveal a stronger preference for form features. But high and low innovativeness groups do not differ appreciably in respect to desire for substantive features. This suggests the dynamics underlying the attraction of initial Internet users to particular shopping sites. Both theoretic and practical implications of the findings are discussed."

We describe one project jointly undertaken by the College of Communication and the College of Engineering at an east-coast land grant university that addressed the interconnections of energy efficiency, economics, communication and global climate change with respect to their impact on individuals, the local business community, and society more generally. This project established that a pragmatist approach focused on local solutions to global problems can be both a valuable learning tool for students and an effective method of accelerating the application of socially-responsible and sustainable technologies for the benefit of society."

2004-0091,Are soft topics good predictors of emotionality? The case of TV news in Britain,Paper,Are soft topics good predictors of emotionality? The case of TV news in Britain,"This paper examines the use of topic-based classifications such as soft/hard or sensational/non-sensational stories to evaluate changes over time in the presence of emotionality content features in TV news. This work proposes a different framework from traditional studies of tabloidisation of news for the analysis of televised news, based on the emotion-eliciting qualities of news empirically verified by audience research (see Grabe et al., 2001). Using only categories with empirical support, this research indicates that there is no clear association between the presence of emotionality and soft news. Only crime stories (a soft news category) and, to a limited extent, political stories (a hard news category) provided clear manifestations of the presence of increased emotion-laden coverage on British television news over time. In general, the presence of emotion-eliciting content attributes increased over time, especially over recent years, but most particularly in the case of hard news topics. Further, the news on commercial TV stations (ITV) was more emotional in these terms than was that on the main public TV channel (BBC1) in terms of hard news."

Newspaper Discourse, Identity, and Culture","This is a study of the Chinese cultural premises for personhood through a close analysis of newspaper discourse of heroes and villains during the anti-SARS period. Cultural themes for heroes and villains, which are invoked in the newspaper discourse, are identified and discussed in light of the pragmatic theory of social identities (Carbaugh, 1996). It argues that social identities are both a communicative (i.e. performative) and cultural process, enacting and reflecting cultural premises for personhood. Finally the pedagogical functions of the newspaper discourse in the Chinese cultural context are discussed."

The premise of the present study is that cognitive aspects of suspicious receivers must be accounted for to further appreciate their active participation in deceptive communication. The present study attempts to identify a suspicious receivers interaction goals and strategic behaviors and find links between the goals and behaviors. Data was collected from seventy-three undergraduate students in dating relationship. The results revealed eleven interaction goals and seven behavioral strategies of suspicious receivers. Some qualitative differences between the goals were found in terms of their association with behavioral strategies. Implications for future suspicion research are discusses as well as the studys limitations.

Guided by previous research on media bias, intimacy, rituals, constructing audiences, imagined communities, paralanguage theory, and narrative theory, a sample of twenty-five hours of Bell's programs were analyzed to ascertain how it is that Bell creates a community of listeners. It was found that by spatially situating the audience, using language/paralanguage techniques to create a sense of we-ness, and dialogically constructing community through intimacy and suspense, Bell creates a community of listeners. This study raises questions and provides insights that pertain to the role of radio, in particular, talk radio, as a vehicle for civic discourse in the public sphere."

This textual analysis considers the 2000 Benetton Death Row advertising campaign and the 1995 Calvin Klein Jeans campaign as sites of cultural production, concentrating on the receptive disparities between local and global. We consider how each campaign is articulated within the prestige press: The Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, New York Times and The Washington Post, comparing the campaigns on the basis of local or global origin and within an historical context. Placing the media frames in correspondence with the respective social and political conditions, we examine the ideological articulations embedded within mediated discourse. Our study also attempts to understand how hegemony, as communicated through media, influences perception and reception of local cultural production and messages of a foreign other."
2004-0097,A Schema-Based Conceptualization of Image and Reputation in Public Relations,Paper,A Schema-Based Conceptualization of Image and Reputation in Public Relations,"According to institutional theory, the survival of an organization depends not just on its material resources and technical information, but also on its perceived legitimacy, acceptability, and credibility. This necessary legitimacy must be accomplished at several levels, such as the cultural-cognitive one, where cognitive schemas and taken-for-granted assumptions play a critical role. From this perspective, I have reconsidered one of the most debated concepts in the PR field, namely the idea of corporate image. In this paper, I conceptualize the idea of corporate image as a cognitive schema made up by beliefs about the organizations and attitudes toward the organization (corporate reputation). A corporate image is formed through a symbolic negotiation between corporation and publics about the identity and social role of the corporation. I suggest that a corporate image is a primary source of legitimacy for the organization. Therefore, it should be regarded as an important asset in an organization. The PR department of an organization should be in charge of this asset as a dedicated organizational function."
2004-0098,A Search for Meaning in the Debate between Classic Mass Communication Research and Critical Cultural Scholarship (Or: What is the Point?),Paper,A Search for Meaning in the Debate between Classic Mass Communication Research and Critical Cultural Scholarship (Or: What is the Point?),"This paper explores some of the central issues surrounding the debate over what constitutes meaningful social inquiry, including why this remains significant, and possible directions for some limited reconciliation between the positivist social sciences approach and a more interpretive, critical cultural studies approach.
Arguing that while these two viewpoints share some common ground, this paper suggests that a fundamental difference in worldview exists between them that finally works against a complete and universal accord. This is not to say that individuals are not able to bring together useful aspects from both paradigms within specific critical and investigative practices of social inquiry. Theories and methodologies are not immutable. Like all socially constructed human endeavors, they are continually in flux, shifting with the contingencies of intellectual, cultural, political, economic and individual inclination. Notwithstanding important individual exceptions, though, there remains an ideological and epistemological gap that will not be easily bridged."

We will discuss the findings of three studies that are consistent with self-categorization theory, and difficult to reconcile with self-enhancement, attributional, and media exposure explanations."
2004-0100,A Self-Categorization Perspective on Gender and Communication: Reconciling the Gender-as-Culture and Dominance Explanations,Paper,A Self-Categorization Perspective on Gender and Communication: Reconciling the Gender-as-Culture and Dominance Explanations,"The two major theoretical accounts for communicative differences between men and womenthe gender-as-culture and dominance explanationsare limited in their ability to account for contextual variations and often are unnecessarily portrayed as mutually exclusive. As a result, research on gender and communication would benefit greatly from a theoretical account that explains what communicative behaviors men and women will use, under what circumstances, and why. The objective of this paper, then, is to offer such a theoretical account based on self-categorization theory and, in particular, the concept of gender identity salience. By understanding the social context in which inter-gender contact takes place, we can predict concomitant effects upon the salience of gender identity, its normative character, and the emergence of descriptive and prescriptive rules for communication. In other words, communication reflects the relevant similarities and differences of men and women in any given social context. In support of this argument, we review research on gender and communication with the aim of reconciling unexplained and inconsistent results in the literature. We also provide explanations for contexts that evoke mutual accommodation between men and women and linguistic gender reversal. Finally, a set of propositions that flow from self-categorization theory is elaborated. Our goal is to advance a theoretical line of reasoning to cast a brighter light on the dynamics of gender and communication."
2004-0101,A smoker is never alone: Test of a typology of social influences on smoking cessation,Paper,A smoker is never alone: Test of a typology of social influences on smoking cessation,"The operationalization of social influence in the theory of planned behavior is very limited. Only the perception is measured whether important others would approve or disapprove it if a person performs a certain behavior. However, more types of social influence can be discerned and it is hypothesized that the conceptualization of the social factor should be broadened. A typology of social influences on smoking cessation is outlined and is tested on 2,703 Dutch smokers. This study shows that several social factors influence the intention to quit smoking. These effects are not completely mediated by the variables of the theory of planned behavior. The consequences for health campaign strategies are described. Most likely, the same holds for other behaviors as well, but the relative importance of the various social influences varies dependent on the behavior and population under study."
2004-0102,A Social-Biological Perspective on the News,Paper,A Social-Biological Perspective on the News,"This paper elaborates an evolutionary psychology based definition of news and tests a series of hypotheses using an experimental design to measure viewer physiology in response to news coverage of national crises. The analysis focuses on ways in which news of terrorist attacks, military interventions, and political crises can be viewed as a type of survival-relevant information. To situate the findings, the literature review distinguishes between several different definitions of news derived from varying research perspectives. The present paper reports the results of a physiological experiment that exposed viewers to four different versions of national crisis news. Subjects were shown a series of broadcast news reports that varied by story topic, and level of emotional valence and arousal. Physiological responses to the broadcasts, including heart rate, skin conductance, and facial EMG (electromyographic) measures, were recorded during viewing. Preliminary results show that across the news stories, there is a significant main effect of survival relevance, such that high-intensity images elicit more attention (i.e., slower sustained heart rate) than low-intensity images. Moreover, negative images elicit more frowning that positive images, and positive images elicit more smiling activation. Images high in intensity elicit marginally more frowning regardless of valence. Thirdly, within six seconds following an especially threatening news image, we see an increase in skin conductance in viewers, indicating that viewers do, in fact, perceive images gleaned from crisis news report as threatening. Finally, the data show additional frowning activation during these segments. The findings of the study should shed new light on the evolutionary basis of news viewing and extend the classic surveillance function of news through the application of physiological measurement techniques and elaboration of a social-biological perspective on the news."
2004-0103,Assessing needs through the study of online support sites.,Paper,Assessing needs through the study of online support sites.,"The needs of individuals in the context of life threatening illness is of relevance for health practioners who treat such individuals. Research has emphasized the development of measures, whether self-report or interview-based, that reliably and validly capture a description of the needs individuals face when confronting an health crisis. Yet all measurements restricts the domain of what is captured through areas covered and questions asked. Unobtrusive measures, generated by the individuals provide an important complement to standardized approaches. This paper addresses this by considering what can be learned about the needs of patients and families through an examination of participant patterns of interaction within one online support group."
2004-0104,Assessing the Everyday Efficacy of Interpersonal Skills,Paper,Assessing the Everyday Efficacy of Interpersonal Skills,"This study examines the commonsense methods by which the efficacy of interpersonal skills is assessed. Analysis focuses on the teaching of a technique called ""mirroring"" in which ""what I hear you saying to me"" prefaces a repeat of the prior turn. I show how features of the technique and the lesson's interactional organization draw attention to mirroring as an object of scrutiny and commentary. Attention then turns to proponents' justifications for implementing mirroring in marital problem solving. However, it is shown that mirroring-confirmation sequences, unlike insertion sequences, are unresponsive to the prospective relevancies of initial actions with respect to pending next actions. An analysis of a learner's rejection of mirroring is shown to be based on a comparative analysis in which tacit knowledge of a conversational genre served as a benchmark against which the technique was found to violate norms of sequencing. The implications for the design of interpersonal training are explored."
2004-0105,Assessing the Relationship between the Formal Mission Statement and Organizational Members Interpretations of Mission,Paper,Assessing the Relationship between the Formal Mission Statement and Organizational Members Interpretations of Mission,"Organizational mission is the purpose, strategy, values, and behavioral standards of an organization. It is often stated in a formal mission statement. Employees develop their own interpretations of mission that are critical to their ability to operate effectively in their organizations (Eisenberg & Reilly, 2001). These interpretations influence what employees perceive as appropriate behavior, and impact overall organizational functioning (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). Most research concerning mission has focused on executives and formal statements. This study begins by examining the possible association between employees interpretations of mission and the formal mission statement. It then examines factors influencing who in the organization is more likely to interpret mission similar to the formal statement. Results show employees at higher levels of the organizations hierarchy are more likely to interpret organizational mission consistent with the formal statement. Employees in different functional work groups are also likely to have different levels of overlap."
2004-0106,Assessing the Use of Mental Illness References During Prime-Time Television,Paper,Assessing the Use of Mental Illness References During Prime-Time Television,"The media are believed to be a source of contemporary beliefs and attitudes toward people with mental illness and television is cited as an important source of information about mental illness. In the absence of real world experience with people with mental illnesses, people may rely on the media for their perceptions of those who have mental illnesses. Only a handful of studies have examined media depictions of mental illness and those studies are dated and limited in generalizability. In the pilot study presented here, we use content analysis to examine the use of mental illness references (diagnostic, clinical and colloquial) in prime time television programs to which children are likely to be exposed. Similar to previous research, we find that depictions of mental illness are frequent, negative and likely to contribute to mental illness stigma. These findings show that mental illness references are more frequently used to refer to a persons inherent personality, rather than a persons actions or a situation. Findings also suggest the trivialization of mental illness through frequent use of colloquial references in association with humor. The use of mental illness references in particular (in contrast to a character with mental illness) may be particularly influential because of their frequency of occurrence in television programs and their subtlety."

Associational membership as a source of social capital has not received adequate attention in recent communication research, compared to interpersonal trust and other measures of social capital. This study extends the current debate on the relationship between social capital and mass communication by examining the links of associational membership to use of local newspaper, interpersonal communication, entertainment media use, and volunteering in community activities among 308 African Americans and 328 Caucasians in a large metropolitan area, and 349 Caucasians in a small city/rural area. The findings show that interpersonal communication and local newspaper use positively predicted associational membership in both African Americans and Caucasians, whereas the effect of entertainment media use was negative, when demographic variables were controlled. Associational membership also mediated the effects of local newspaper use and interpersonal communication on volunteering, but entertainment media use had an independent and negative effect. Also explored were differences between large metropolitan areas and small cities in availability of media outlets and people's patterns of use of news media and interpersonal communication."
2004-0108,A Stakeholder Approach of Organizational Effectiveness: A Case Study of a Public University in Hong Kong,Paper,A Stakeholder Approach of Organizational Effectiveness: A Case Study of a Public University in Hong Kong,"Most organizations strive to succeed and success, in most cases, is measured in financial terms (how high the stock is, earnings, profit margins etc). The majority of performance measures for assessing organizational effectiveness, therefore, is limited to financial evaluation and emphasizes the products (e.g., media placement) over processes (e.g., agreement building in conflict) and outcomes (e.g., conflict resolution and avoidance of further crisis) (J. Grunig & L. Grunig, 2001, p. 3). Relying primarily on these financial measures, however, is problematic. When the sole criterion for success is how much money is made or saved, other elements that contribute to organizational effectiveness are often ignored. This neglect can have negative consequences: employees may be exploited, the environment damaged or consumers harmed. In the long run, it rarely pays to simply focus on financial measures. This paper first examines characteristics of an organization and relates them to organizational wealth, organizational effectiveness, relationships, reputation, evaluation of effectiveness, and the value of public relations. It, then, provides a baseline model of organizational effectiveness from the stakeholder perspective. Finally, it tests the model by conducting a pretest to explain how students, employees, and community residents evaluate the effectiveness of a public university in Hong Kong."

Analysis suggests that both services covered the Bove incidents similarly, downplaying the broader context of corporate capitalism and the global movement to resist it while elevating Bove to be a key representative of the movement. At the same time that they anointed Bove as a French icon (contributing to ""Bovemania""), the wire services constructed a comical caricature of him, which ultimately discredits the activists and the movement he represents."
2004-0110,A Study of 9-11 as a Media Event,Paper,A Study of 9-11 as a Media Event,"This study assesses the influence of viewing the tragedies of September 11th on live television. More specifically, 2000-2002 American National Election Study (ANES) panel data is used to test competing theoretical claims for potential media effects on generalized interpersonal trust. The first hypothesis stems from a cultivation-based argument that the tragedies of September 11th reflect the ultimate display of the mean world, resulting in a negative direct effect on trust. A second potential influence stems from Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). This theoretical rationale points to viewing the tragedies generating an increase in patriotism which then leads to higher levels of generalized interpersonal trust. This combination of effects points to the live viewing of the 9-11 tragedies having a positive indirect influence on trust. The competing effects are evident in the data, and both results exist after accounting for the influence of pre-2001 levels of generalized interpersonal trust on the criterion variable."
2004-0111,A survey of Magazine Professionals Practices & Attitudes Towards Ethical Standards of Images,Paper,A survey of Magazine Professionals Practices & Attitudes Towards Ethical Standards of Images,"This study surveyed The American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) to examine what are the current ethical standards employed by magazine professionals when dealing with images as well as how they prefer to inform readers about the presence or absence of digital enhancement or alternation. Fewer than four in 10 would alter or enhance an image to improve its readability and clarity. Respondents only favored changing photos to alter color. However, despite the declines in media credibility and the expectation among readers that publications would indicate when a publication has been doctored, few of those surveyed supported the use of photation marks, marks similar to quotation marks, to indicate that a photograph has not been doctored beyond minimal standards. Most of the respondents supported using the term photo illustration or that there should be no indication of any kind"
2004-0112,A Theory of Messages,Paper,A Theory of Messages,"The idea of message provides an ontological basis for the study of communication because of its central role in the primordial act of communication, i.e. messages link all of the other elements of the communicative act. While messages have been an important part of discussions about communication for the past 50 years, there has been little systematic treatment of the concept and almost no theoretical development of the role played by messages in the communication process. Instead the field has widely swung between competing views that have emphasized the senders intentions, the receivers interpretative processes, and other social and cognitive elements instead of focusing on messages themselves. This paper develops a preliminary theory of messages by synthesizing our existing knowledge about messages, examining disputed elements of the concept and exploring new ways of thinking about messages. It is contended that previous discussions about messages have been limited in their view of what forms messages can take, have failed to acknowledge the central relationship of messages to other parts of the communicative process, have not recognized the substantive existence of messages, have minimized the force and resulting effects of messages, and have failed to recognize the relationship of messages to meaning and reality. An understanding of the nature of messages that results from this discussion is expounded in a series of 11 propositions that form the heart of a theory of messages."

The study concludes that structural format constraints, key institutionally situated actors, and predominant social scripts interact to limit political idea-viewpoint diversity in media programming."
2004-0114,A Transnational and Poly-centered Localilty as the Conceptual Framework to Study the Immigrant Press,Paper,A Transnational and Poly-centered Localilty as the Conceptual Framework to Study the Immigrant Press,"Globalization has brought challenges to the traditional conceptualization of the sense of belonging between people and places. This paper takes up social theorist Ulrich Becks (2000) notion of place polygamy as the theoretical departure to study the immigrant press in a global era. For Beck, the word global should be understood as in several places at once, or translocal (p. 47). In other words, immigrants should be understood as multi-locals rather than rootless tourists (Bauman, 1998). However,what is the role of the immigrant press in the process of narrating and constituting such a place-polygamy? The question has not been seriously examined. This paper argues that the immigrant press plays an active role in forming such a new sense of belonging and proposes a new conceptual framework to study it."
2004-0115,"Attention, Motivation, and Visual Perception: What Pictures, Television, and the Body Can Tell Us About Visual Awareness as a Dynamic System",Paper,"Attention, Motivation, and Visual Perception: What Pictures, Television, and the Body Can Tell Us About Visual Awareness as a Dynamic System","Those attempting to understand the human visual system often look at vision removed from the emotional and motivational state of the agent. It is argued here that this approach is likely to miss fundamental underpinnings of the system. Vision is part of a dynamic system that informs the mind about the world in response to the bodys current motivational and attentional state. As approach and avoidance systems are differentially active in the agent, different features of the visual world become salient or fade into the unnoticed background. It is this embodied connection with the world that defines visual awareness. As a predator enters the visual field, for example, the attentional set narrows as the defensive motivational state recasts visual awareness for current needs. Peripheral objects are relegated to irrelevance, while detailed surveillance of the predator is crucial. This is a change in awareness, as the raw sensory input has not altered. Rather than a central executive informed of current emotional states, the entire nature of visual awareness and what information is communicated from the visual world transforms as part of an embodied dynamic system."
2004-0116,Attitude and Norm Accessibility and Cigarette Smoking,Paper,Attitude and Norm Accessibility and Cigarette Smoking,"Attitude accessibility, that is, the ease with which attitudes can be retrieved from memory, has been shown to predict behavior. An accessible attitude is more likely to result in attitudinally consistent behavior than a less accessible attitude of the same valence. The present research extended the research on attitude accessibility by examining the role of the accessibility of normative beliefs in predicting behavior, on the assumption that accessible beliefs concerning social rewards and punishments would similarly improve behavioral prediction. Participants reacted to computerized prompts that measured reaction times to the attitudinal target (cigarette smoking) and to the subjective norm for cigarette smoking. Attitude and norm accessibility accounted for significant variability in smoking behavior beyond that accounted for by traditional measures of attitude and subjective norm."
2004-0117,Attitudes Toward Access to Public Records: A Test of Power Expression Protection Hypothesis,Paper,Attitudes Toward Access to Public Records: A Test of Power Expression Protection Hypothesis,"The power expression protection hypothesis states that individuals who possess the greatest social capital in a society are the most likely to support free expression because they have the least to lose by doing so. This hypothesis is based on consistent demographic trends over the last 50 years of research on public opinion toward media rights, which indicate that the more educated, the middle-aged, and males tend to be most supportive of free expression. The purpose of this study was to examine whether demographic variables included in the power expression protection hypothesis are supported when the focus of media rights is not expression or content. The focus of media rights in this survey was on support for press access to public records. A statewide random survey of 402 adults found that education was positively related to support for press access; and gender and age each interacted separately with education in predicted ways. Income was slightly related to support for press access. Results indicate partial support for the power expression protection hypothesis, but further study is needed."
2004-0118,Attribute Agenda-Setting and Its Consequences,Paper,Attribute Agenda-Setting and Its Consequences,"By combining a random digit dial telephone survey of 417 residents of Austin, Texas metropolitan area and a content analysis of a local newspaper, Austin American Statesman, this study replicates prior research conducted on the attribute agenda-setting, and examines the consequences of agenda-setting effects in the context of the 2002 Texas gubernatorial and U.S. senatorial election. A series of rank-order correlations and regression analyses support for the central proposition of attribute agenda-setting theory, and further suggest that attributes positively (or negatively) covered in media will be perceived positively (or negatively) by the public, which eventually influences the publics attitude towards each candidate in a positive (or negative) direction. This supports the prediction that news coverage can prime the publics attitude so that it reflects the attitude in the media. Additional analyses indicate that this priming effect is a consequence of agenda-setting effects rather than a direct effect of media exposure."
2004-0119,Attribute Agenda Setting and the Media: Measuring exposure as a contingent condition,Paper,Attribute Agenda Setting and the Media: Measuring exposure as a contingent condition,"The current study measures the impact of media exposure on voters evaluation of presidential candidate attributes during the 2000 New Hampshire presidential primaries. Moving beyond previous research that established media exposure as a contingent condition of agenda setting, the study measure the variables impact at the second level of agenda setting, more specifically, on the publics agenda of attributes. The results of the study point to a significant relationship between media exposure and candidate attribute evaluation. The study discusses research implications and calls on future research to empirically measure other agenda setting contingent conditions at the second level of the process."
2004-0120,Attribution vs. compassion: the city of Chicago's response to the E2 crisis,Paper,Attribution vs. compassion: the city of Chicago's response to the E2 crisis,"This case study examines the City of Chicagos crisis communication response to a nightclub tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people. Two important concepts in crisis communicationattribution and compassionare examined. City of Chicago spokespersons attempted to shift blame for the crisis, concentrating on messages of attribution rather than messages of compassion. Editorial writers in the two Chicago major daily newspapers, newspaper columnists, and members of the public criticized the City of Chicagos crisis communication efforts. The negative reviews of the citys efforts may have damaged the reputation of the city administration. The case serves as a lesson to those handling crises. Although blame shifting may or may not be advisable from a legal standpoint after a crisis, public relations practitioners should be mindful that messages of compassion must be of paramount concern in post-crisis communication."
2004-0121,A Two-way Symmetrical RoadHow Corporate Image Affects Public's Decision Making,Paper,A Two-way Symmetrical RoadHow Corporate Image Affects Public's Decision Making,"This study examines corporate image from a two-way symmetrical approach and explores how such a symbolic relationship may exert an impact on publics beliefs, attitudes, and behavior toward an organization under both normal and crisis scenarios. The results of the study revealed that a corporation presenting an image congruent with public expectation could win public approval in normal conditions. In the event of a crisis, however, image congruency may protect the company via an indirect route. The most interesting finding was that given the image congruency, publics behavioral intention toward the corporation seemed to remain consistent regardless of situational changes."
2004-0122,Audience Discourse on Marital Discord in a Docudrama in Korea:An Analysis of Bulletin Board System Messages,Paper,Audience Discourse on Marital Discord in a Docudrama in Korea:An Analysis of Bulletin Board System Messages,"Grounded on critical approach, this paper examined the BBS discussion forum of the weekly docudrama serial Bu-Bu Clinic that deals with various issues of conjugal conflicts in Korea, and assessed how the BBS participants interpret the sources of micro and macroscopic domination in marriage. The study was conducted through observation during the first three weeks of February 2003. The data collected through observation suggest that wife faces three economic, social, and cultural contradictions in relation to the source of domination in marriage in general. These contradictions include (1) historically constructed stereotypical role of husband and wife, (2) its persistent economic, societal, and cultural reproduction and distribution in society, and (3) its unconscious collective acceptance of the pattern of patriarchal ideology as natural. As a result, this study reveals that the unbalanced power structure of gender in marriage has been constructed, reproduced, and embedded in the interrelated contexts of economic, social, and cultural contradictions in society."
2004-0123,Audience Interest in Webcasting Adoption: An Explication of Technology Fluidity Theory,Paper,Audience Interest in Webcasting Adoption: An Explication of Technology Fluidity Theory,"Webcasting, hailed by some as the last frontier of the Internet era, has thus far been trekking sluggishly along its diffusion curve at 7 percent (Morrissey, 2003). Even though a tremendous adoption growthtriggered by the increased broadband connections to Internet user homesdid occur during this past year, little is known regarding who the early adopters may be, the reasons why they adopt webcasting and what types of content will be most viable for adoption.
This study examined the potential factors that could help predict webcasting adoption. In particular, it utilized several theoretical elements to explore audience interest in adopting broadcast video streaming via webcasting; it also assessed user interests in accessing local webcast programming.
A national sample of 454 Internet users was interviewed in a telephone survey. Study results provided strong support for the proposed theoretical framework that integrated the theories of technology fluidity, adopter innovativeness and media substitution."
2004-0124,Audience-making and Economic Change--- An institutional inquiry into the ratings history of Taiwan,Paper,Audience-making and Economic Change--- An institutional inquiry into the ratings history of Taiwan,"In Taiwan, there were at least three kinds of ratings number being used for the exchange of advertising money. Although different data caused transaction inconvenience, the coexistence of these three ratings practices was maintained by the particular transindustrial structure. The analysis of the media-ratings-advertising relationship in such a particular case could highlight the production and circulation of the audience commodity. The history of the ratings industry and economic crises in Taiwan were interwoven. Almost all the ratings firms or new ratings practices were set up in the wake of economic hard times. Ratings activity, as Meehan (1984) reiterated, was not an exercise of social science but a business venture constrained by cost effectiveness, productivity, and profitability. Economic hard times might stimulate the need for different ratings practices, whereas specific ways of ratings production, like other kinds of commodity production, were shaped by corporate resource, transindustrial structure, market competition, state regulation, informational and technological availability."

The interviews were conducted to investigate audiences' understandings of the boundaries, nature, realism, and pleasures of the programming category. A central element defining reality programs was the perception that the behavior of the cast members was reflection of their wills and personalities and that it had consequences in terms of the outcome of the show. These factors also contributed to perceptions of the shows' realism. Participants reported enjoying the programs because of their humor and their unpredictability, which seemed to contribute to the creation of suspense and to greater involvement. Implications for further research are discussed."
2004-0126,Audience Research Trends in Mainland China,Paper,Audience Research Trends in Mainland China,"This is the first time for Chinese scholars to use quantitative methods to explore the trends of audience research in Mainland China by analyzing research articles in three major journalism and communication academic journals. The author analyzed research approaches, research methods, medium of focus and theoretical frameworks in these audience research articles from 1985 to 2002. Unlike the finding derived from analysis of mass communication research articles in major international journals, most of research articles used qualitative methods. Chinese scholars tended to employ behaviorist and structural approaches to study audience. Research articles that dealing with broadcast and print media exceeded any other media, while studies on Internet users are becoming more and more. Chinese scholars began to develop theories in recent years. The future study will continue based on analysis of other research materials and comparison with audience research articles in leading international journals."

These arguments for autonomy are combined and studied to ascertain their impact on: 1.) the contribution of communication to strategic management, and, 2.) the enactment of an ethics counselor role by public relations. This research examines autonomy in communication at two global organizations through 43 interviews, observation, and document analysis. Factors influencing and contributing to autonomy are discussed. Autonomy was found to be necessary for optimal contribution to strategic management and acting as ethical counsel in the public relations function."

Most contemporary outreach efforts are strategically planned to build and maintain relationships with a variety of publics. While many of these corporate efforts require little from participating publics, as in cause-related marketing programs in which participants need only buy a product, a phenomena emerging in corporate fundraising encourages significant involvement from participants. The current study is a follow-up to an earlier research project  a case study of the Avon Breast Cancer 3-Day Walks. This paper focuses on what happens to the corporate sponsor/participating public relationship when a corporate outreach effort has problems. It is theoretically founded in a cultural-rhetorical perspective of public relations.
As I was finishing first case study, Avon announced it would withdraw as sponsor of the Breast Cancer 3-Day Walk, but fulfill its obligation to the remaining 2002 Walks. Two months later it announced a new fundraising event  the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer  a two-day walk strikingly similar to the 3-Day. This announcement was followed by the collapse of the 3-Day producer, which threw the remaining three 3-Day Walks for 2002 into limbo. The uncertainty surrounding the remaining Walks in the time between Pallottas collapse and an ultimate decision by Avon and Pallotta that the Walks would go on, created a running dialogue among participants on several online bulletin boards. This study is a qualitative analysis of that dialogue and the corporate communication that took place at this time."
2004-0129,Baltic Telecommunications: The European Union's Wireless Interest,Paper,Baltic Telecommunications: The European Union's Wireless Interest,"Along with seven other Central and Eastern European countries, the Baltics will in only six months time likely gain acceptance into one of the worlds boldest experiments in cooperative politics. As the Baltics begin to renew ties with their European neighbors, as well forge new alliances with former Cold War era foes, a myriad of social, economic and political considerations await them. This will require facile administration of, among other elements necessary for a successful transition, wireless communication technologies. In the spirit of shrugging off all that represented Soviet domination, the Baltics States have embraced wireless technology to pave the way for the next communication paradigm, adopting the GSM standard as required for EU inclusion. As European wireless communications becomes ever more powerful on the global front, it bears investigating without judgment how the EU benefits from these new countries joining. This paper will illustrate how although joining the European Union will have a clear and positive impact on the Baltic States, the EU itself stands to gain equally much, if not more, from direct investment in open markets of the Baltics nascent wireless communications industry."

Secondly, it is also proposed that the most constructive way to analyze a communications policy is to unpack the logic behind it. Thus, when that logic has been ascertained, it becomes the framework within which the constituent features and underlying values of a policy can be specified, evaluated, and integrated. These propositions are made, defended, and critiqued on the basis of the assumptions often invoked to promote and justify investment in telecommunications as well as information and communication technology (ICT) in developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa."

It finds that The New York Times stories have centered on the dilemma of Chinas one party market economy, delineating a transitional China marked by rapid economic growth and social changes, yet besieged by serious social conflicts. With both a negative side and some positive signs, China is seen as a land of crisis and opportunities. This paper argues that The New York Times coverage of China indicates a subtle change in tone and in the way of framing, with a more neutral and objective stance as well as a more pluralistic perspective. All these suggest a tendency towards change in mainstream US media portrait of China."

For this purpose to meet, this paper redefines third-person effect beyond perceptual error and explores the sociological aspect in Davisons original thought of third-person effect (e.g., Who are the comparison others?). In addition, by exploring motivational and cognitive underlying process and illustrating theoretical linkage between perceptual component and behavioral component of third-person effect hypothesis, this paper suggests potential consequences of third-person effect at the societal level."

This focuses on the inner, psychological or cognitive processes of an individual, which is intrapersonal in nature. This paper argues that by shifting the goal-oriented and formal conceptualization of persuasion (and compliance-gaining) to a broader view of interpersonal influence which stresses outcomes and to more informal means of influence including relational context and nonverbal messages, research and theory in this field can be vastly expanded in scope, thus capturing human influence behaviors more comprehensively. In particular, it indicates ways in which relationships and social or situational structures serve to persuade others or add to the persuasive force of verbal messages in ways not previously added into the mix by persuasion research."

Johnson sold the then 20-year old Black Entertainment Television to Viacom Inc. This sale hoisted Johnson into the billionaires club while simultaneously laying waste to one of the few Black-owned media entities. Before America and its scholars had time to fully appreciate the impact of the sale and ponder its legacy, Johnson won his 2003 bid for the new Charlotte professional basketball franchise. His establishment as the first Black owner swept virtually all critical attention from BET to celebrate Johnsons inclusion, (and by extension, all of Black America), into the worlds exclusive club.
Yet, the triumph and tragedy of BET continues to exist as the unexplored space of Black Americas American Dreams as rooted within the promise of capitalism, black business development, and cultural relevance. Specifically this paper explores the history and legacy of capitalism and black business as exemplified by Black Entertainment Television in order to begin deconstructing the contemporary strategy of melding capital to representation and culture."
2004-0135,Big-screen TV and Arousal: An Exploration of the Effects of Television Screen Size,Paper,Big-screen TV and Arousal: An Exploration of the Effects of Television Screen Size,"Prior research suggests that television screen size affects a variety of viewer responses, including arousal level. The present study attempts to replicate these findings for participants viewing violent content, and demonstrates some potential consequences of a heightened arousal level. Participants were exposed to violent television programs on a small-, medium-, or large-screen television. Arousal was measured with both self-report measures and heart rate. Results showed that heart rate was lowest when participants viewed violence on a small or large screen. Furthermore, participants viewing on a small screen were able to most accurately judge the number of people hit by bullets in the program. These findings are used to argue that heart rate is a measure of parasympathetic arousal, or attention. It was also found that heightened arousal transferred to a secondary stimulus, increasing participants positive attitudes toward a proposal for highway construction. The findings are discussed in terms of the limited capacity approach to information processing and excitation transfer theory."

In so doing, it offers a theoretically informed way of empirically analyzing white press practices in a critical manner. Steady consumption of white mainstream news production can distort the analysts view of the world; but some of the distortion can be eliminated through a turn to the black press that both reveals limits of the kind of world offered by the white press and suggests ways to see clearly beyond it. Failure to appreciate the value of the black press as an instrument of critique may well explain why some media analysts have not wielded a sharp enough pen in their critical assessment of the white press."

Drawing on previous arguments that blogs are a new form of journalism, this project uses a form of textual analysis to more specifically assesses the ways in which blogs contribute to our understanding of new genres of news in the 21st century. Findings suggest that the blogs create a sense of credibility and authority through those characteristics that are the anti-thesis of what we have long associated with mainstream news: through emphasizing their lack of institutional status, through rejecting objectivity, and through a symbiotic relationship with audience contributors."

Council members have multiple commitments to themselves, their fellow council members, their constituency and other social organizations. Humor provides a way to address these multiple, and often conflicting, needs in a manner that is acceptable within the context of the public meeting.

Consider the vote at the July 2000 meeting of the Boulder, Colorado City Council regarding the pet guardianship issue. The Council doggedly analyzed this agenda item many hours into a lengthy meeting. The issue to replace the name owner with guardian was embedded in almost 40 pages of ordinance revisions, yet that single word change had ignited the attention of the public and medianot always favorably either.

When the Council debated the practicality of a nomenclature change from pet owner to pet guardian, not surprisingly, humor surfaced in many ways."

A stratified random sample of 114 programs (228 news stories) broadcast in 1972-2002 was coded for story topics, settings, themes, prosocial messages, and primary message attributes. Results of a nonfrequency content analysis indicate that portrayals of altruistic behaviors, such as helping, sharing, caring, and cooperation, composed the most prevalent group of story themes. During the entire period under study, the programs consistently employed the strategy of featuring prosocial content without any contrasting antisocial behavior. Analysis suggests that the three-decade success of ""News Six"" is based on a creative partnership between students, parents, teachers, community representatives, and television professionals in promoting community integration."

Phillips hired an all-women staff to run the station, as such it existed seventeen years. At a time in post-war United States when womens voices were once again considered unacceptable for radio airwaves, this station nonetheless operated under the premise that listeners wanted to hear womens voices.

In this paper I discuss the disjuncture between the women of WHER having literal on-air voice, while at the same time lacking political voice (or agency) in the radio industry and larger society. Using critical historiography and analyses of WHER records, I investigate the quality and notion of womens voice in radio by looking at womens roles in early radio broadcasting, the development of womens programming, the context of broadcasting in the 1950s, and the gendered discourse around the voices of WHER. Ultimately I argue that while the staff of WHER may not have articulated a feminist agenda, the station activities can be seen as a proto-feminist endeavor."

The paper focuses on the building blocks for developing a winning educational program, and calls attention to two particular aspects of learning and development  developing a spike in industry sector/practice area and improving communications skills."
2004-0143,Building Trust: Examining Direct and Interactive Influences of Social Integration and Local TV News Viewing,Paper,Building Trust: Examining Direct and Interactive Influences of Social Integration and Local TV News Viewing,"Building upon the vast compilation of academic work that has risen from the theory of social capital, this paper seeks to further explore two concepts central to this strand of research: social and interpersonal trust. A primary goal of this project is to emphasize the theoretical differences between these two types of trust a distinction that has been blurred in past work and to empirically demonstrate that social trust of an abstract collective other is significantly different from interpersonal forms of trust that are derived from more direct, personal interactions. Analysis of data collected from a large, national survey sample suggests that social and interpersonal trust have unique relationships with a host of situational and social orientation variables. Results from this study also reveal that the relationship between local television news use and various forms of trust is not uniform, but variable and nuanced. The ability for social orientation variables, such as community attachment, interpersonal communication, and informal socializing, to act as moderators that enhance the relationship between local television news attention and certain types of trust is also documented. On a larger scope, the results of this study suggest that it might be useful to continue to include multiple measures of interpersonal trust in studies that seek to uncover relationships between media use and participatory outcomes."

Sensation seeking should predict participants engagements in intercultural experiences. Alternatively, sensation seeking may affect dyadic relational outcomes. In this study, sensation seeking did not significantly predict participants engagement in intercultural encounters, intercultural partnerships, international friendships, or international travel. Yet, partners levels of sensation seeking correlated with participants perceptions of workload to complete an intercultural partnership program and their relational reports. Undergraduates who matched their partners sensation seeking level expected positive experiences with future intercultural communication. Implications for international training programs are discussed."

Bush and the Media: Getting to War The Invasion of Iraq
The runup to a full-scale U.S. military attack on Iraq  shock and awe -- provided an unusual and ideal test the effectiveness of a parsimonious content analysis methodology designed to determine when a national leader made or would make a decision to go to war. As W. Ben Hunts work that is the model for this study anticipated, editorials in The Wall Street Journal clearly ramped up war fever with not only the number of get to it, George editorials but also with the language. Critical editorials advised/urged/demanded Bush to get on with the second phase of the long-planned remaking of the Middle East -- taking out Saddam Hussein. The paper links several aspects of post-Cold War, postmodern American life -- low levels of knowledge, use of poll data throughout society, declining news consumption and others -- to paint a picture of a newly vulnerable society, one willing  polls would indicate  to listen to and follow clear, perhaps simplistic, policies even to the point of a pre-emptive strike on a small nation that many could not locate on a map.

Content analysis found that adolescents predominately utilize publicly available avatars depicting drawn images of Caucasian human forms. Specifically it was found that females adopt postures that indicate subordination to others, while males display psychological withdrawal from the actions around them. The influence of gaming and fantasy is seen in male avatar selection."
2004-0147,Can a Robot be Perceived as a Developing Creature?,Paper,Can a Robot be Perceived as a Developing Creature?,"This study (N = 40) tests the effect of long-term artificial development of AIBO on users feelings of social presence and social responses toward AIBO. The experiment was a 2 (Developmental capability: Developmental vs. Fully Matured) X 2 (Number of participants: Individual vs. Group) between-subjects design. The results showed that the developmental capability factor had significant positive impacts on feelings of social presence and social responses toward AIBOas measured by social attraction, physical attraction, lifelikeness, para-social relationship, buying intention, and the enjoyment of the interaction. The number of participant factor, however, did not affect social presence and influenced only the last three social responses variables. No interaction between the two factors was found. The results of series of path analyses show that feelings of social presence mediate participants social responses toward AIBO. Implications of the current study on robotics, the CASA (computers are social actors) paradigm, and presence research were discussed."
2004-0148,Can a Television Series Change Attitudes about Death?: College Students and Six Feet Under,Paper,Can a Television Series Change Attitudes about Death?: College Students and Six Feet Under,"This study examined the effects of viewing ten episodes of the television series Six Feet Under to assess whether such programming could influence college students attitudes about death and dying. Students were administered the Death Attitude Profile-Revised, the Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale, and the short version of the death Threat Index, prior to and after viewing. Significant changes were found on a number of measures, and factor analysis suggests exposure to the series led to an increase in conceptual differentiation and more precision within death-related concepts. These results are similar to the effects of didactic death education courses."
2004-0149,Candidate Web sites and candidate press releases: Agenda setting in the 2002 Texas gubernatorial election,Paper,Candidate Web sites and candidate press releases: Agenda setting in the 2002 Texas gubernatorial election,"This study had two central goals: to replicate prior research conducted on the agenda setting effect of candidates political advertising on the media agenda and to contribute much needed research on the agenda setting influence of the candidate press release at both the issue level and the attribute level. Breaking analysis into two time periods, a total of 72 press releases were downloaded from the candidates Web sites and compared with 107 newspaper articles. Through human-coder content analysis and using cross-lagged correlation analysis, results highlighted that only the incumbent Rick Perry was successful in setting the media issue agenda. The challenger Tony Sanchez was influenced by the media when developing his issue agenda and was also unable to transfer his agenda on Perry to the medias agenda on Perry. At the substantive attribute level, both incumbent and challenger Sanchez were influential in framing the medias substantive agendas for themselves and their opponent. The candidate to media correlations for both ranged from .675 to .9, while three out of the four media-to-candidate correlations fell below the Rozelle-Campbell baseline. As hypothesized, the combined affective agenda of both candidates bore strong correlations to the medias affective agenda on each candidate. Measuring individual influence of candidate and opponent for affective agenda setting revealed that the opponent was more successful at setting the candidates affective agenda in the media than the candidate in setting his own affective agenda. These results confirmed the medias slant towards presenting more negative than positive coverage of political candidates."
2004-0150,"Can robots have personality?An empirical study of personality manifestation, social responses, and social presence in human-robot interaction",Paper,"Can robots have personality?An empirical study of personality manifestation, social responses, and social presence in human-robot interaction","The rapid development of robotic technology has gone far beyond the traditional industrial robots which rely on limited human-robot interaction techniques to the recent development of animal-like entertainment robots, which engage in significant peer-to-peer (human-robot) interaction and manifest a wide range of social features including personality. Personality is an essential feature for creating socially interactive robots and study on this dimension will facilitate enhance human-robot interaction. Using AIBO, developed by SONY, this study examines the personality dimension in human-robot interaction.
In order to test the hypothesis that people would not only recognize robots personality but also socially respond to such personality accordingly, a balanced, 2 (AIBO personality: introvert vs. extrovert) x 2 (participant personality: introvert vs. extrovert) between-subjects experiment (N=48) was conducted. We believe that with accurate identification of AIBOs personality types, the matched and mismatched personalities between robots and participants will make difference in participants perception of AIBO (i.e. AIBOs intelligence, pet-likeness, physical attractiveness, social attractiveness), perception of the interaction (i.e. enjoyable, interesting, fun, entertaining, boring(reversed coded) and exciting), their self bonding to AIBO, their likeability of it and their social presence. Implications of the current study on human-robots interaction and personality literature will be discussed."
2004-0151,Can U.S. Entertainment TV Programs InfluenceThe Culture Of Young Adults Overseas?,Paper,Can U.S. Entertainment TV Programs InfluenceThe Culture Of Young Adults Overseas?,"Shortly after the September 11 terrorist attack, the U.S. government began wondering what can be done to influence the attitudes toward the U.S. of the wary and sometimes angry Muslim youth abroad. During the month of November 2001, news reports revealed that the U.S. government, together with Hollywood executives, had determined that this objective could be achieved by:

1. Exporting such entertainment networks as MTV to the Muslim parts of the world;
2. Establishing American AM-FM radio stations specifically targeting Muslim youth; and
3. Beaming American television programs via a newly established satellite-based television network that will compete with Al-Jazeera, a TV network that became very visible after September 11 due to its ubiquity in the Arab world.

This paper asks: Can imported TV programs influence the local audiences who watch them? If so, then what is the process of influence that is at work? And who are the audience members most likely to be influenced by the foreign TV shows?

This paper presents the results of an integrated theoretical model stemming from a research program devoted to this very topic."

As a thought piece, the article raises many questions about how, why, and what our human ancestors were up to when they created the images. Comparisons between the cave images and modern-day forms of visual communication are also made in the hope of understanding these early images."
2004-0153,Challenges for the future of educational media,Paper,Challenges for the future of educational media,"In recent decades, one of the most prominent uses of media in the public interest has been found in the production and distribution of educational media for children. As technologies continue to grow and change with meteoric speed, electronic media present opportunities for delivering substantive educational material to children in new and innovative ways. However, to achieve their potential in the future, these media will need to overcome a variety of challenges. This paper draws upon the existing research literature to discuss three classes of challenges that will need to be overcome in the future: (1) access (e.g., physical access to hardware, cultural accessibility of content), (2) design (e.g., usability, effective design of convergent media), and (3) use (e.g., encouraging use, matching design to constraints of the settings in which material will be used). Future implications for both production and research are discussed."
2004-0154,"Charismatic Skill, Media Legitimacy and Electoral Success",Paper,"Charismatic Skill, Media Legitimacy and Electoral Success","There is growing interest in how much a political candidates media skills, sometimes referred to as charisma, are critical to their electoral success and political survival. According to one hypothesis, the effects of media skills might be so strong, that actors who do not posses media skills quickly vanish from the political arena. However, while many believe that media skills are an important aspect of getting elected, few have actually tried to measure their effects. Part of the reluctance no doubt stems from methodological difficulties in measuring them. In this study we look more directly at the media skills that are likely to play an important role in the electoral competition and suggest a new methodology for measuring such skills. Findings are presented that show that media skills can have an important impact on long-term electoral success of Israeli members of the Knesset."
2004-0155,Children's and Parents' Emotional Reactions to Kidnapping Stories in the News,Paper,Children's and Parents' Emotional Reactions to Kidnapping Stories in the News,"This study assesses emotional responses to child kidnapping stories featured in the news. We conducted a random telephone survey of 182 parents of children between the ages of 5 and 17, asking them about their childs reactions to such stories as well as their own reactions. Children below the age of 13 experienced more fright-related feelings and were more concerned for their personal safety than adolescents were. Children who were heavy viewers of TV news also were more frightened. Parents rated themselves as more upset by the stories than their children were. Parents emotional responses and coping strategies were more prevalent among those who had paid close attention to the high-profile media cases and those who regularly viewed TV series about missing persons. The findings are discussed in terms of cultivation theory and in light of developmental differences in how children process information."

This paper begins to examine the communication emerging within this voluntary association that explains Chinese-ness. What does it means to be Chinese in a non-Chinese society, in a diverse Chinese group with mixed familial arrangements? Can an organization help to bind together its members from various Chinese heritages and to also bridge the cultural gap between members and the non-Chinese dominant society? Can an organization remain ethnically based in an ever-evolving ethnic soup?"
2004-0157,Citizen Kane as Genealogy,Paper,Citizen Kane as Genealogy,"Citizen Kane is a film which from its release has provoked conflicting interpretations. The two leading critical views on Citizen Kane, which appear to be unreconcilable, may be called the enigma interpretation (in which the main character remains a mystery at film's end) and the Rosebud interpretation (in which Kane's personality is ""explained"" by his early separation from his mother) (Carroll, 1989).
This paper will demonstrate how Michel Foucault's concept of genealogy yields insight into Citizen Kane. After explicating Foucault's idea of effective history, I will compare it to the two interpretive views of the film, and consider how Foucault's ideas apply to a proposed resolution of the conflict between the two readings of Citizen Kane."
2004-0158,Civic Education Messages: Do High School Texts Promote Collective Political Participation?,Paper,Civic Education Messages: Do High School Texts Promote Collective Political Participation?,"Recent trends in American political life have resulted in a renewed interest in civic education as a remedy for the generation gap in political participation. Our research contributes to such efforts by exploring the types of participatory messages conveyed to high school students in three widely used American civics textbooks. Analysis of these texts informational content, real-world examples and suggested activities reveals students are exposed to few messages about collective means of participation. Even when collective messages are presented, they are given less emphasis and described in less detail than individual political acts. These findings lead us to conclude that American civics texts are not up to the task of reinvigorating an apathetic generation. They fail to present and model the collective skills students need in order to learn how to wield political influence."
2004-0159,Click on Democracy: Will the Internet Bring Democracy to China?,Paper,Click on Democracy: Will the Internet Bring Democracy to China?,"In this paper, I would like to discuss the democratic effect of the internet in the Chinese context. My research questions include the following: will the internet help China attain democracy or is it going to deter Chinese democratization, and even strengthen the authoritarian rule? What factors can explain this role of the internet? Can the Chinese experience be generalized?
I believe that these research questions are both important and relevant for the following reasons: first, this study will not only fill the gap in the current cyber-democracy literature, which lacks the theoretical analysis on the internet and democratization, but will also enrich the literature of Chinese democracy. Secondly, China is a very good and valid case for cyber-democracy study. The giant scale of the internet development provides a solid and sufficient base to study the effects of the internet. However, China is still adopting a tight authoritarian rule and is regarded as a typical non-democratic state. These characteristics combined make China a sound case to examine the relationship of the internet and democracy.
My hypothesis is that in the short term, the internet has limited influence to promote Chinese democratic process and is used to solidify the governments rule. But in the long term, the internet has the potential to facilitate China in achieving greater democracy. I divide the paper into four sections. The first section is the literature review section. I review cyber-democracy literature in general and literature of the internet and Chinese democracy. I draw theoretical basis to support my hypothesis and also point out the deficiencies in the literatures. The second section is the reality and practical analysis portion. I discuss four parameters that influence the effects of the Internet on Chinese democracy, viewing both the problems and prospects for the Internet to promote democracy in China. Based on the reality analysis, I draw a conclusion in the third section to support my hypothesis. I argue that in the short term, the Internet has a limited influence to promote Chinese democratic process, whereas the Chinese government is relatively successful in using the Internet to solidify its power. But that is not the end of the story. Prospectively, the Internet has unfulfilled potential for facilitating China in achieving greater democracy. This potential is getting released gradually along with the new development of those social parameters. In the fourth part, I offer the limitations of this thesis and provide grounds for further research."
2004-0160,Co-Constructing Extensive Accounts: Japanese Speakers Practice With English Speakers,Paper,Co-Constructing Extensive Accounts: Japanese Speakers Practice With English Speakers,"Previous studies suggested that Japanese speakers perceived American English-speakers as offering detailed accounts in situations in which they considered it appropriate to give an expression of regret and a brief explanation. The analysis of a conversation in which a Japanese and an English speaker engaged in accounting practices reveals, however, that the English speaker did not construct her detailed accounts alone. Instead, the Japanese speaker co-constructed the English speakers extensive accounts by not explicitly honoring them and by using continuers. The paper suggests that Japanese speakers view of American English speakers as providing extensive accounts may be formed and reinforced in interactions such as the one analyzed here without their being aware of their own influence on English speakers behavior."
2004-0161,CODE PINK Alert: The World Wide Web at Work in the Public Sphere,Paper,CODE PINK Alert: The World Wide Web at Work in the Public Sphere,"Within the framework of public sphere theory, this study analyzes the role of the Internet as a technological tool and space for political participation in a democracy. This analysis looks at the relationship between activism and technology through an examination of a web-based activist group, CODE PINK, a self-identified womens movement for peace. This study is in keeping with research that serves the public interest in terms of two key themes identified in the International Communication Associations call for papers: 1) media and democracy, and 2) communication gaps.
The following article reports a discourse analysis of CODE PINKs website and email newsletters, along with newspaper reports that discussed this groups activities. The analysis found five main functions of the Internet in this context: (1) to develop intrapublic consensus; (2) to improve group cohesion; (3) to provide members with an indigenous medium (Squires, 2002); (4) to mobilize group action; and (5) to facilitate access to the broader public sphere. These five functions constructed a foundation of public credibility (Ku, 2000) for CODE PINK, illustrating that the Internet can operate as a tool and as a space for counterpublics."

It found that (1) media were respondents primary sources of SARS-Related Information rather than interpersonal channels; (2) media were rated as more believable sources of SARS-Related information compared to interpersonal channels; (3) physicians were regarded as the most believable source of SARS-Related information among interpersonal channels; (4) TVs relative credibility about SARS-Related news coverage was evaluated as the highest one among media; (5) media use was a significant predictor of respondents perceived absolute credibility of media (newspapers, radio, magazines, and the Internet) about SARS-related news coverage if TV news was excluded; and (6) there were respectively significant differences on respondents perceived absolute credibility of TV, newspapers, radio, magazines, and the Internet between male and female respondents."
2004-0163,Communicating/Collaborating: A Longitudinal Network Analysis,Paper,Communicating/Collaborating: A Longitudinal Network Analysis,"This study focuses on collaboration, a relatively new form of organizing that brings together participants from multiple and often competing organizations to work together on a finite project. Utilizing a communication-based model of collaboration (The Bona Fide Collaboration Model) this study follows two collaborations from their inception to completion. Employing new statistical approaches to social network analyses the study investigates task communication and resource exchange relationships that emerge among the collaborative participants. Results indicate that collaborations are characterized by highly embedded relationships; the multiple contexts in which collaborations are embedded significantly impact the dynamics of the collaborating group itself. Second, collaborations are characterized by non-hierarchical structuring, with no centralized individual directing the collaborative project. Third, the observed connections among the participants are highly interdependent and turbulent. Communication patterns are unstable, shifting as participants respond to constantly changing task and resource requirements. The pragmatic implications of these findings are discussed."

2004-0165,Communicating Knowledge: Articulating Divides in Distributed Knowledge Practice,Paper,Communicating Knowledge: Articulating Divides in Distributed Knowledge Practice,"Working together has always been a challenge, but recent trends in who we work with, about what, and across what regions, cultures, disciplines and time zones have conspired to increase the complexity of team work, and in particular the complexity of knowledge work and communication across knowledge divides. Over the past four years, I have been working with colleagues on examining the challenges, problems, and practice associated with distributed knowledge, with particular attention to the way distributed, multi-disciplinary teams communicate and collaborate in the co-construction of knowledge. In coming to understand distributed knowledge practices, we have been struck by the many kinds of divides and constraints that impinge on any collaborative, multi-party endeavor. This paper explores the nature of distributed knowledge work as well as the interplay between knowledge, practice and technology. By examining practices, it is possible to recognize and articulate the constraints that hinder collaborative processes across knowledge domains. Borrowing the concept of asset specificity from organization theory, and affordances from the psychology and technology literature, I suggest that in order to understand work and communication problems for multi-party teams, attention needs to be paid to the knowledge-based asset specificities that can constrain work, as well as to the affordances that may expand the ability to work together across knowledge divides."
2004-0166,Communicating ongoing social problems: A case study of human trafficking,Paper,Communicating ongoing social problems: A case study of human trafficking,"This research considers whether institutional forces inhibit communication of social problems to the public. Human trafficking, or the movement of humans across borders for profit, is increasing throughout the world. Human trafficking serves as a case study to expand understanding of how certain social problems reach or fail to reach the public agenda. This research draws from the agenda setting, gate keeping, social movement and public opinion literature. A content analysis of English-language newspaper articles in 2002 contrasted American and international press coverage. Findings suggest that human trafficking is covered infrequently in the American news, and that the nature of the issue limits story coverage. Unfortunately, without public recognition and support for resources to find solutions, the problem of human trafficking will likely continue. How to best communicate ongoing social problems within institutional constraints remains an important question, requiring further analysis."
2004-0167,"Communicating Organizational Change: the role of information, communication climate, and uncertainty on readiness for change, results from three cases",Paper,"Communicating Organizational Change: the role of information, communication climate, and uncertainty on readiness for change, results from three cases","The only constant factor within organizations is the continuous change efforts of these organizations. Globalization, deregulation, privatization, mergers, advances in technology, business process redesign are only some of the reasons for organizational change. Although there is an enduring interest in (internal) communication during organizational change, there is still little or no empirical research upon the topic. In this paper I will present results from three case studies where information about the change, the communication climate during organizational change, and insecurity are related to readiness for change. The results of these three cases show that the research model, in which a influence of information, and communication climate on readiness for change is suggested and a mediating influence of uncertainty gets large support in all three different cases. With this empirical support we can unravel more of the mystery about communicating change, which can guide practitioners as well as academics in further understanding communication processes during organizational change."
2004-0168,Communication and Broken Windows: Graffiti Debates,Paper,Communication and Broken Windows: Graffiti Debates,"The Broken Windows theory, attributing urban decline to signs of disorder, has been used to implement clean up strategies on the streets of cities. Based on the Broken Windows theory, signs of disorder such as graffiti are perceived to signal lack of control in a community. This theory has spurred debates about ways to create vital public spaces and about the meaning of vitality. The debates, in turn, play a role in policies aimed at both public spaces and behavior in public places, resulting in implementation of laws that directly affect communication. This paper is part of a larger work that explores the ways in which people talk about graffiti in downtown Olympia, Washington. A textual analysis of a local newspaper and notes of a community forum are presented. The results of a review of published materials reveal common patterns in deliberation about the governance of public space."
2004-0169,Communication and political conflict. The effect of deliberation on attitudes towardws others,Paper,Communication and political conflict. The effect of deliberation on attitudes towardws others,"Deliberation is widely acknowledged as an important precondition of the viability of liberal democracy. However, so far there is only little empirical research on the validity of the claims made by theorists of deliberative democracy. This paper aims to investigate the social dimension of deliberation, or what Robert Dahl (1989) calls enlightened sympathy. This orientation includes respect for other citizens and their political positions even if one fundamentally disagrees with them. While most of the research on deliberation has focused on the consequences of deliberation on the quality of individual opinion, enlightened sympathy and respect are concerned with the interactive dimension of deliberation. Our study is based on a survey among American students. We find that communication across lines of political differences enhances individuals respect for supporters of the opposing party, while communication in homogenous environments promotes hostility towards political opponents. The finding applies particularly to face-to-face encounters in interpersonal communications, whereas the role of the mass media remains dubious."
2004-0170,Communication and Revolution: The role of Radio Venceremos in El Salvador (1981-1992),Paper,Communication and Revolution: The role of Radio Venceremos in El Salvador (1981-1992),"This paper examines the relationships between communication and revolution through the particular case of Radio Venceremos in El Salvador. I address three research questions: What are the conceptual elements of a clandestine radio? What were the specific characteristics of the role of Radio Venceremos? And what are the interconnections between communication and revolution? The data collected included the analysis of the Foreign Broadcast Information Services archive 1981-1992 (FBIS); and a personal communication with one member of the historical team of this station. The conclusion emphasizes the contribution of this clandestine radio to the promotion of public information and communication spheres in the midst of the terror and violence. Finally, I argue that genuine revolutions are fundamentally communication revolutions, because communication processes mediate the sociocultural matrices, the public spheres, and the articulations with peoples daily life; and revolutions transform boundaries, and possibilities of public, mediated, and interpersonal communication processes and practices"
2004-0171,Communication Between Physicians and Patients: Expanding Expectations and Predicting Patterns,Paper,Communication Between Physicians and Patients: Expanding Expectations and Predicting Patterns,"Communication within the physician-patient interaction is acknowledged to have both objective and subjective components. The objective component relates to talk about a patient's symptoms and the structure and function of tissues and organs. The subjective component relates to conversation about a patient's beliefs and emotions and about structural and organizational aspects of care. The current study examines over time patterns of nonverbal reciprocity and compensation patterns between physicians and patients in communication behaviors related to the subjective component of discourse. Results suggest a pattern of reciprocity, or similar patterns of communication behaviors, in nonverbal behavior consistent with rapport building and in verbal discourse related to talk about beliefs and emotions. Results suggest a pattern of compensation, or patterns of communication that become less similar during the interaction. Implications for communication and treatment are discussed."
2004-0172,Communication experts attitudes towards external communication with a social dimension,Paper,Communication experts attitudes towards external communication with a social dimension,"Communication experts of 107 large, business-to-consumer companies in XXXX completed a questionnaire concerning (1) their firms practice of external communication with a social dimension, more specifically the use of support for good causes as a theme in external communication, and (2) their attitudes towards it. Data were analysed with specific attention paid to the distinction between cause related marketing communication (CRMC) and other forms of cause related external communication (CREC). The majority of the investigated companies supporting good causes do communicate this externally. However, only about half of them engage in cause related marketing communication. Respondents have more positive and less critical attitudes towards CREC than towards CRMC, regardless of use of CRMC.
Furthermore, GLM-models revealed (interrelated) effects of the respondents gender, age, hierarchical position and the corporate use of CRMC on attitudes towards external communication with a social dimension. On the basis of these results, the paper concludes with a number of recommendations regarding the need for further research into corporate attitudes and objectives concerning these matters."

A positive change in economic status alone is evidence of success. This study builds from the premise that communication is key to development and that American Indian tribal government departments can be considered in the context of the theories of development communication.
By using Q Methodology, this development communication study examines perceptions of tribal employees toward development communication and interprets characteristics of development communication partners. Three attitudinal types  symbolically named Fortress Builders, Abode Builders, and Bridge Builders  were analyzed and interpreted. Through the perceptions of tribal employees in Health, Education, and Housing, paths to change begin to emerge  the paths to development communication that employees are willing to take."
2004-0174,Communication in group negotiations: The influence of shared cognition and shared social identities,Paper,Communication in group negotiations: The influence of shared cognition and shared social identities,"This paper examines the relation between shared cognition and shared social identity, and the influence of these two variables on negotiation productivity. Three studies showed that both shared cognition and identification with an overarching group are associated with better negotiation outcomes. Moreover, clear links exist between the development of shared cognition and shared identity (Study 1). Stronger identification before negotiation was associated with the development of shared cognition during negotiation (Study 2). Conversely, a direct manipulation of shared cognition resulted in greater identification (Study 3). Thus, as predicted by self-categorization theory, shared social identity can be both the product of, and precursor to, the development of shared cognition (Turner, 1991), with communication functioning as the interface between the two."
2004-0175,Communication in the Public Interest,Paper,Communication in the Public Interest,"In the cycle of national elections, when politicians publicly announce their presidential candidacy, the media cover that announcement and also generally provide a candidate profile. By October 1, 2003, 10 possibilities for the democratic nomination for President of the United States in Election 2003 appeared in the major media. This poster demonstration focuses on the initial news stories of candidacy notification. For the candidate the public announcement not only sets the tone of a serious political endeavor, but also a chance to apply for federal funding. For journalists the announcement proves not only newsworthy, but demonstrates agreed-upon professionalism in the construction of this bit of news reality. The research goal of this poster was to determine conventional coverage plans (a norm for such political news), new or different patterns of news reporting, as well as coverage plans that appear engineered by journalists' reactions and critical assessments.
This research examined the patterns of how two of the most influential newspapers in the U.S. (New York Times and Washington Post) covered presidential candidates announcements and subsequent candidate in-depth profiles. In studies on campaign coverage, little has been done on the initial candidate announcement for the office. This research addresses several points on the early stages of the media's coverage of presidential candidates like similarities in coverage of the announcement, repetition of themes within the texts, influence each others coverage, journalists' assessment of a persons candidacy, and idiosyncrasies or anomalies found in the coverage of both the initial announcement and the profile stories.
This poster demonstration will show that a plan of news coverage is routinely brokered by both media outlets and prospective presidential candidates; that not only do the New York Times and Washington Post influence other media outlets, but they also influence each other's profile coverage of the candidates; and that these two media outlets employ coverage plans based on tradition, innovation, and ideological perspectives."
2004-0176,Communication planning for NASA's Office of Planetary Protection: Participatory Strategy and Audience Research,Paper,Communication planning for NASA's Office of Planetary Protection: Participatory Strategy and Audience Research,"The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Planetary Protection has a long-term initiative under way in communication research and planning. Planetary protection is the term used to describe policies and practices that are intended to prevent 1) contamination of extraterrestrial environments by microbial Earth life (""forward contamination"") and 2) contamination of Earth's environment by possible extraterrestrial microbial life (""back contamination""). NASA's planetary protection office has long recognized the importance of communications in accomplishing its goals and objectives. With solar system exploration missions advancing into the era of sample return and with the science of astrobiology changing assumptions about the nature and boundaries of life, the planetary protection office is expanding its communication planning efforts and taking first steps toward implementation. The Planetary Protection Office aims to ensure that its scientific, bureaucratic, and other constituencies are fully informed about planetary protection policies and procedures and prepared to communicate with a variety of public audiences about issues relating to planetary protection. NASA is engaged in preliminary planning for the world's first mission to return samples of martian surface material to Earth, and officials believe that advance planning for communication about the science, technology, and possible risks associated with such a mission is in the public interest. This paper will describe NASA's ongoing planetary protection communication research efforts, focusing on development of a participatory communication strategy to enable broadest possible public participation in planning and development of solar system sample return missions and Earth-based sample receiving facilities."

Besides major aspects of the Internet that have been scholarly investigated within 9 years, the comparison with previous thematic meta-analysis and major trend from ICTs related journals and new media handbook were also added to illustrate a linkage of national and international research regarding to the Internet. This study found that uses and gratifications was the most frequently theoretical framework used in Internet studies in Thailand. Meanwhile, little investigation is made into the issues of barriers of use and unequal access to the Internet."
2004-0178,Communication Research in the Public Interest,Paper,Communication Research in the Public Interest,"In the cycle of national elections, when politicians publicly announce their presidential candidacy, the media cover that announcement and also generally provide a candidate profile. By October 1, 2003, 10 possibilities for the democratic nomination for President of the United States in Election 2003 appeared in the major media. This poster demonstration focuses on the initial news stories of candidacy notification. For the candidate the public announcement not only sets the tone of a serious political endeavor, but also a chance to apply for federal funding. For journalists the announcement proves not only newsworthy, but demonstrates agreed-upon professionalism in the construction of this bit of news reality. The research goal of this poster was to determine conventional coverage plans (a norm for such political news), new or different patterns of news reporting, as well as coverage plans that appear engineered by journalists' reactions and critical assessments.

2004-0179,Communication Theory: Creative Strategies for Project Based Learning,Paper,Communication Theory: Creative Strategies for Project Based Learning,"This paper will discuss creative strategies for the undergraduate instruction of communication theory. The strategies will attempt to activate the learning process by way of group mini-projects. Students will present their projects or actively participate in their projects during class time. Most of the projects involve group preparation. This type of instruction helps to facilitate learning for students with learning disabilities.

Here are two brief examples:

1. Agenda Setting  Students will record three to five news programs. (ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, FOX). They will then answer the following questions:
A. What are the top stories?
B. How is the information presented?
C. How much time is given for each story?
After answering the questions, the students will discuss how each news program set the agenda. They will discuss similarities and differences.

2. Dead Level Abstracting  Divide into groups of four. Each group will receive 5 cards. Each card will have a word listed on one side: JUSTICE, FREEDOM, PEACE, BIRD, or AIRPLANE.
A. Two students will be chosen to draw pictures (on the back of each card) which represent the words listed.
B. After the students have drawn the pictures, the other two students will then attempt to guess what word the figure is representing.
The class will then discuss why some words are easier to depict than others."
2004-0180,Communicative and Contextual Dimensions of Supervisor/Subordinate Negotiation Episodes,Paper,Communicative and Contextual Dimensions of Supervisor/Subordinate Negotiation Episodes,"Although supervisors and subordinates must often negotiate to clarify work expectations and role boundaries in organizations, little research has addressed the communicative or contextual dimensions of these workplace discussions. Building upon research in integrative negotiation, this study examines the effect of formality and relational tone on three communicative dimensions: elaboration, directness, and mutual concessions. Two hundred seventy-one employed undergraduates completed survey questionnaires involving a recalled supervisory negotiation episode. Formalized negotiations were found to involve greater elaboration and concessions, while a personalized relational tone was related to directness. The implications of this study and future directions for research are discussed."
2004-0181,Communities Against Runway Expanson: A case study in contesting dominant news frames,Paper,Communities Against Runway Expanson: A case study in contesting dominant news frames,"This paper discusses the news framing of a recent plan by the Massachusetts Port Authority to construct a new runway at Boston's Logan International Airport. Designed to increase flight capacity by 30 percent, the proposed runway was enthusiastically supported by the Boston business community and the Republican governors administration. Initial news coverage of the issue largely emphasized the purported economic and efficiency benefits that the runway would bring to the region, downplaying the negative environmental impacts it would cause to the working class and minority communities abutting the airport. In an example of Hallins theory of elite consensus, when political elites began to be divided on the issue, news coverage expressed more critical and diverse points of view. Particular attention is paid here to the organizing and media work of Communities Against Runway Expansion (CARE), a coalition of Boston area residents that actively challenged the dominant framing of the runway issue by engaging in traditional grassroots organizing enhanced with new communication technologies. CAREs communication strategies were a crucial factor in the breakdown of elite consensus among city and state political players and the widening of political debate."
2004-0182,Community and Personal Mediated Communication,Paper,Community and Personal Mediated Communication,"This paper has three purposes: first, to review theoretical and practical aspects of the concept of community that may be relevant to a better understanding of relationships between mediated communication and community; second, to explore how personal mediated communication may be affecting the creation, processes, and fates of communities; and third, to consider how the power of mediated communication technologies might alter traditional theories of communities. The paper begins with a review of the concept of community, discussing positive and negative perspectives on the relationship between mediated communication and community. Then the paper examines mediated communication, especially the Internet and mobile phone technology, and their potential impact on social relationships within communities. Next, the paper considers the prospect of virtual mobile communication-based communities becoming an effective source of social capital. Interwoven with these considerations are suggestions for modifications in traditional community theory-building in light of these new technologies. Mobile phones are a special focus because already so much of the world's population are using them, and the number of users and the extent of their use are expected to continue to grow rapidly."
2004-0183,Comparing Cultures with Metaphors in American and German Ads,Paper,Comparing Cultures with Metaphors in American and German Ads,"Culture and language are tightly intertwined. Metaphors are ubiquitous in language and cognition and are based on culture. As social artifacts reflecting culture, advertising provides the opportunity to compare metaphors across nations. The goal of the paper is understand how and why metaphors are used and how they differ in different countries. Using a content analysis of American and German magazine advertisements, variations in metaphor usage are examined.
Findings provide examples for how culture is reflected in language and symbols. The study shows metaphors are used in headlines to capture attention in both countries. However, metaphors are used differently throughout American and German advertisements and employed strategically for their most effective use.
The study is important in the context of globalization and the debate for whether or not culture is important in advertising. The exploratory project provides theory in culture, language, metaphor, and advertising and offers a guide for further research in culture."
2004-0184,Comparing self report to latency to respond on political attitude questions with socially desirable outcomes on an Internet-based survey,Paper,Comparing self report to latency to respond on political attitude questions with socially desirable outcomes on an Internet-based survey,"This study compares self report to latency to respond data for political attitude and behavior questions in a questionnaire administered on the Internet. The efficacy of the latency measure is tested by examining subjects answers to questions that have socially desirable outcomes, such as Did you vote in the last presidential election? In this example respondents are known to over report voting on surveys, even thought they know their identity is anonymous and their responses are confidential. One way to sort out those who give a socially desirable response to such questions that are not valid could be to look at their latency to respond. This study sets out to look at that proposition by examining both self report and latency to respond to political survey questions with socially desirable responses.
An instrument was posted on the Internet which included questions about political participation, and attitudes. Media exposure questions also were included. A standard set of questions tapping into respond political self efficacy and four questions taken from the original Crowne Social Desirability questions set also were included.
A program named SOS embedded in the Web document that contained the instrument activated a clock when the subject mouse clicked a start button at the top of the screen at the beginning of each question. Subjects read the question and clicked a radio button for the appropriate response. They then clicked on a button at the bottom of the page, which stopped the computer=s clock and advanced the document to the next page.
Making the causal leap from latency to truthfulness in self reported data to socially desirable questions is based on the assumption that not telling the truth takes longer than telling the truth; that assumption is supported by the data reported here, and data that will be included in the full paper."
2004-0185,"Compensation Systems, Organizational Culture, and Organization Attraction",Paper,"Compensation Systems, Organizational Culture, and Organization Attraction","ABSTRACT
Attraction-Selection-Attrition Theory (Schneider, 1987) predicts that individuals are attracted to organizations in which they perceive that their values and personalities fit with the organizational culture. Although scholars have speculated that compensation systems can signal organizational cultures, limited research has tested this notion. To investigate the impact of compensation systems, we conducted an experiment in which undergraduates reacted to scenarios describing a company that distributed salaries and benefits based on either seniority or on merit. As anticipated, we found that relative to seniority based compensation systems, the cultures of organizations relying on merit were perceived to be more aggressive and reward-oriented, although the latter effect was confined to the distribution of salaries rather than benefits. With regard to attraction to the organization, we found that a persons exchange orientation was positively related to attraction to the organization regardless of its compensation system. A persons communal orientation was not significantly related to organizational attraction. Finally, individuals were least attracted to organizations that distributed both salaries and benefits based on seniority relative to those using a mixed compensation distribution system or one based entirely on merit."

The ability to recognize early and understand the success or failure of these technologies will therefore become increasingly important to general managers, information technology (IT) departments, economists, and researchers of diffusion. Existing theory related to the diffusion of information technology provides a solid foundation from which to analyze the potential of an innovation to be adopted widely within a community. However, the review of the diffusion of Macromedias plug-in technologies reveals complications introduced by Internet software that are not currently considered in existing IT diffusion theory. This analysis frames these phenomena, which, if not properly accounted for, can provide an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the factors affecting an innovations diffusion.
In doing so, an overview of the formation of Macromedia and the World Wide Web is provided, followed by a chronological outline of events crucial to the products diffusions from their introductions through the year 2000. A review of the existing literature relevant to the diffusion of information technology innovations then follows, proceeded by the framing of the phenomena presented by the diffusion of Internet software as seen in the case of Macromedias plug-in technologies."
2004-0187,Concept Keys: A Pragmatic Approach to Skill Acquisition and Behavioral Competence,Paper,Concept Keys: A Pragmatic Approach to Skill Acquisition and Behavioral Competence,"This paper examines an innovative method of teaching basic skills necessary to effectively produce and receive messages while reducing the potential for misunderstandings. Concept Keys leverages the established educational concepts of chunking and priming into a learning support system that enables students to integrate information into their memory and into their skill base. As educators, developing such methods is paramount to student success. Likewise, success beyond college depends heavily on basic speaking and listening skills. Whether a student continues within academia or enters the workforce, s/he must possess the skills necessary to communicate in a competent fashion. By first looking at the relevant literature on the ability to teach basic speaking and listening skills and extending research in the areas of memory and cognition, a method is proposed for the educational arena that has been tested and preliminarily validated as an appropriate, yet innovative, way to teach the skills necessary to become a more effective communicator. Example exercises and ancillary classroom materials are also presented."

To this end, we first discuss the past content analytic research in this area, noting weaknesses in the previous investigations. Then, we offer our conceptual definitions of prosocial and altruistic actions, our focus on context, and the sampling frame employed. The paper concludes by discussing limitations of our coding scheme as well as directions for future research."

But Extending U.S. Jurisdiction Over iCrave TV?: The Effects Test of International Jurisdiction over the Internet,"This paper argues that the fundamental question, in the wake of new types of international disputes over the Internet, is what would be the most reasonable way of deciding international jurisdiction over a Web site when free speech is at stake. The exploration of the issue of personal jurisdiction throughout offline and online cases in the United States led a judgment that the effects test can be an appropriate legal framework of international jurisdiction over the Internet when free speech is at stake. The applications of the effects test to the Yahoo! and the iCraveTV cases led to the conclusion that these cases were decided incorrectly."
2004-0190,Configuration of Chinas Telecommunications Regulatory Reform Influenced by the Accession to the WTO,Paper,Configuration of Chinas Telecommunications Regulatory Reform Influenced by the Accession to the WTO,"From 1980s on, policies and regulations in telecommunications have had enormous change. International organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) are believed to have played an important role in promoting the deregulatory rationale and in governments policymaking process. Legally binding rules of the WTO should have influenced the member countries domestic telecommunications industry and policies. However, questions arise when we assess the effect of an international regime, such as the WTO, on domestic development and policy choices as well as the implementation of the rules and principles of the regimes. Institutions and institutional enforcement in individual member countries become important factors in determining if the country actively embraces the rules or operates in a way that effectively constitutes non-tariff barriers to competitors.

The accession of China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001 marks an important milestone in the telecommunications regulatory and industrial structure reform in China. With the accession to the WTO, the highly protected sector has opened to foreign competitors. Drawing upon new institutionalism and international regime theory, this paper studies the telecommunications policy reform in the context of Chinas unique political and social culture. The authors suggest that Chinas accession to the WTO have exerted (and will do so) an effect on Chinas telecommunications policy and to a certain degree re-shaped the sector and the regulatory institutions. However, the study also suggests that the impact will vary and will depend on the institutional endowment of the country, the institutional political culture in the country, and if powerful and effective institutional barriers prevent China from fully enforcing its WTO agreements. The paper concludes that while joining the WTO may have an impact on Chinas telecommunications sector, it will have a limited impact given its internal constraints, which can be accounted for with new institutionalism and international regime theory."
2004-0191,Conflict as a Driving Force of a European Public Sphere,Paper,Conflict as a Driving Force of a European Public Sphere,"The history of European integration is said to be a history of war and conflicts, and it is indeed an old sociological argument that conflict and integration are two sides of the same coin. This study aims to empirically test the often stated hypothesis that conflict can contribute to the emergence of a European public sphere. Thereby it is assumed that the better a Europeanised public sphere fulfils the two democratic functions of transparency and validation the more it will contribute to the process of Euro-pean Integration. A systematic analysis of the impact of conflicts draws theoretically on sociological deliberations regarding the integrative force of conflicts. Empirically this paper is based on a content analysis of newspapers in Austria, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. A quasi-experimental design allows the comparison of cut-outs of national public spheres during a time of routine politics and during a time of political conflict. The selected conflict is one of the most fundamental conflicts in the recent history of European integration, the so called Haider conflict. In spring 2000 14 EU state leaders imposed sanctions on Austria as consequence of the governmen-tal participation of the populist right party FPÖ with Jörg Haider as chair. The analy-sis shows that the conflict has (partly) improved the function of transparency in all countries under study but at the same time has diluted the function of validation. In conclusion, the case of the studied conflict shows that not every conflict adds value to the routine of European Integration."
2004-0192,Conglomerate Rock: The Music Industry's Quest to Divide Music and Conquer Wallets in the Online World,Paper,Conglomerate Rock: The Music Industry's Quest to Divide Music and Conquer Wallets in the Online World,"This investigation examines how the conglomerated music industry is using new technology to divide access to music through different online subscription services. By dividing access to exclusive music, the music industry hopes to increase its revenue in light of recent global sales declines. As a result of this recent development, this paper argues a divide is being created between consumers who can afford access to music and those who cannot. Theory on new media and technology described through utopian and dystopian terms is used to inform this study while a political economy perspective is used to analyze data. Ultimately, the decisions the music industry is making now will radically alter the manner in which music is purchased, delivered and consumed in the future."

Our results show that Internet access and online campaign exposure are significantly associated with these important political variables. Several of the associations between Internet access and exposure with political efficacy, knowledge, and participation are detectable even when taking sociodemographic variables, party identification, partisan strength, political interest, and several other media exposures variables into account."
2004-0194,Console video games and global corporations: Creating a hybrid culture,Paper,Console video games and global corporations: Creating a hybrid culture,"This paper argues that the contemporary console video game industry is a hybrid encompassing a mixture of Japanese and American businesses and (more importantly) cultures to a degree unseen in other media industries, especially in regard to U.S. popular culture.

Although popular culture has always been a business, the video game industry demonstrates how interlocked these areas are, and how the global and the local are the fabric from which they are constituted. The particularities of the video game industry and culture can be recognized in the transnational corporations that contribute to its formation and development; in the global audience for its products; and in the complex mixing of format, style and content within games.

As an exemplar of this process, the Japanese game publisher SquareEnix is the focus of this case study, as it has been successful in contributing to global culture as well as to the digital games industry through its glocal methods. That achievement by a non-Western corporation is indicative of the hybridization of the digital games industry, and it is examined here as one indicator of the complexities and challenges, as well as future potentials, of global media culture.

Understanding not just SquareEnixs games, but its business practices and role in the global video game industry, provides an important reading of that global media culture, an understanding not available through the examination of media products."
2004-0195,Constructing a Nation Online:Tamil Nationalism and the Internet,Paper,Constructing a Nation Online:Tamil Nationalism and the Internet,"The role of the Internet in the construction of online national identity is a growing topic for research. The Internet offers a new context for negotiations of identity and community. In particular it offers minorities and diasporic communities a new space for communication and self-representation, enabling them to challenge physical and cultural boundaries and restrictions. This paper will look at how the Tamil separatist movement of Sri Lanka, spearheaded by the violent militancy of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE),has used the Internet and its international network of support, including dispersed members of its militant network and the globally dispersed Tamil Diaspora, to create a virtual Tamil nation online. The paper will describe in exhaustive detail the online network of the Tamil Movement, and the virtual nation of Eelam that expatriate Tamils have constructed. The paper will then examine how the Tamil militants and their diasporic supporters have used the new media and communication technologies to build a Tamil nation and a Tamil national identity on the World Wide Web. In doing so the paper hopes to highlight the role of New Media Technologies in the negotiation of ethnic and cultural self-representation and outline new avenues for communication research that draw on diverse academic spheres from terrorism research and Diaspora studies to research into issues of nationalism and identity."
2004-0196,"Constructing an 'evil genius': Through the news frame, Osama bin Laden looks like Dr. Fu-Manchu",Paper,"Constructing an 'evil genius': Through the news frame, Osama bin Laden looks like Dr. Fu-Manchu","Osama bin Laden was framed in news media reports from 1999 through 2002 as an evil genius with near mythic abilities, knowledge, intellect and power, and as having a strikingly charismatic presence in his videos. This paper examines the news rhetoric and concludes that bin Laden was constructed as an archetypal ""evil genius"" very similar to the fictional villain Dr. Fu-Manchu, a Victorian horror novel character. Equally plausible depictions of bin Laden as insane, idiotic or lucky were practically non-existent. The motives for framing bin Laden as an evil genius include: to help the government explain their failure to apprehend him; as a way to make him more understandable to news audiences who easily understand fictional arch-villain characters; to help news audiences understand the devotion of his followers; and evidence of Orientalist stereotypes of Asians as tyrannical and vicious."
2004-0197,Constructing Cosmopolitan Identities in Media Use: Cross-cultural Viewing Pleasures of Television Fiction Audience,Paper,Constructing Cosmopolitan Identities in Media Use: Cross-cultural Viewing Pleasures of Television Fiction Audience,"The compelling popularity of transnational television fictions among youth in various societies has raised concerns regarding young peoples culturally specific experiences in consuming cross-border television programs. This paper explores how various cultural resources are appropriated by young audiences in their media consumption, and the unique viewing pleasures young audiences derive from watching imported television fictions. Drawing from qualitative in-depth interview data with 53 Taiwanese teenagers and young adults, the study found that the pleasures young audiences derive from watching imported television fictions come from five major dimensions: (1) the appreciation of fashion commodities; (2) the acquisition of linguistic capital; (3) the search of utopian love; (4) the virtual travel in the fictional world; and (5) the aspiration of modern lifestyles. The study suggests that young audiences actively make use of the symbolic commodities and cultural practices disseminated via popular transnational television fictions, and exercise their cultural imagination to construct cosmopolitan identities in their media use."

These questions are explored through the discourses and practices of the Japanese International Co-operation Agency (JICA). In-depth interviews, documents and videos inform this analysis. Findings describing programs implemented by JICA in East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East suggest that those areas perceived as more culturally distant , particularly those aligned with Islamic communities, are more likely to focus on womens sexuality and more likely to consider women as passive victims than those in more culturally proximate areas."
2004-0199,Consuming rebellion: Quiz shows and counterculture in the sixties and seventies,Paper,Consuming rebellion: Quiz shows and counterculture in the sixties and seventies,"In the three years following the quiz show scandals the broadcast industry restructured quiz shows by redefining them as game shows, entertainment forms with low cultural prestige. The genre was generally removed from prime-time, its stakes significantly reduced, and the required knowledge became less demanding. The industry thus engaged in a conscious effort to rescue the genre from its scandalous connotations and set the stage for new types of game shows which would emerge in the 1960s and 1970s. These shows increasingly adopted consumerism and gambling as the center of their competition. Their visual style was colorful and flashy, and the shows frequently emphasized the participation of members of the studio audience in the games. Since the genre had been moved to daytime and redefined as game shows, it increasingly incorporated knowledge of trivia and everyday life. Women emerged as the new primary audience for shows such as Let's Make a Deal, Supermarket Sweep, Shopping Spree, Treasure Hunt, and The Price is Right. While these shows relied on a problematic equation of women with consumerism, trivial knowledge and low culture, they also lacked a clear articulation of cultural authority and hierarchies of knowledge. Thus, they constitute a liminal space which responded to the contradictory cultural environment of the 1960s and 1970s."
2004-0200,Content Analysis of the Draw-A-Sketch Task (DAST-S) for High-Risk Sexual Situations,Paper,Content Analysis of the Draw-A-Sketch Task (DAST-S) for High-Risk Sexual Situations,"Abstract

This study evaluated the utility of the Draw A Sketch Test-Situation (DAST-S), a new, nonverbal memory-based assessment of high-risk situations in evaluating risky sexual situations among 515 drug offenders. We examined the usefulness of this task in generating stimuli associated with risky sexual behavior and used two methods (respondents labels only vs. holistic coding in a traditional content analysis) to evaluate content productions. This new idiographic nonverbal task was used for the production and coding of relatively spontaneous content associated with high-risk sexual situations among individuals in court-ordered drug diversion and treatment programs. Drawings from the sketch task were used to obtain high frequency cues of risky sexual behavior and to obtain prototypical scenes of risky sexual behaviors. Findings indicated that, of the respondents who included a drug label in their sketches, none drew a condom, and only one respondent who included alcohol also drew a condom. The holistic coding method produced a greater number of sketches containing alcohol and drugs than analysis of sketch labels alone. Results of the content analyses provided information on the salience of different cues associated with risky sexual behaviors."
2004-0201,Contesting Narratives of Workplace Maternity,Paper,Contesting Narratives of Workplace Maternity,"Our paper situates discourses and practices of workers, paid work, and wellness within contemporary organizational imperatives. Through a case study of a woman whose ability to work was compromised by complications associated with pregnancy, we show that maternity in the workplace is connected with deviance, sexuality, the feminine, unreliability, illness, and disability. To promote change, organizational and health communication researchers must construct multiple creative narratives about pregnancy in the workplace and maternity leave that decenter the master narrative and replace it with stories rendering bodily variation as normal."

The paper maintains that despite important similarities, the two museums reflect opposing perceptions of the Holocaust: while the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum represents the Holocaust as an American story that bears American and universal lessons, the Museum of Jewish Heritage - a Living Memorial to the Holocaust presents the Holocaust as a Jewish story that bears Jewish lessons."
2004-0203,Contextual Effects and Community Engagement:,Paper,Contextual Effects and Community Engagement:,"A growing body of literature on communication and community emphasizes contextual effects, often with limited methodological correspondence to their theoretical arguments. The present study empirically tests the multi-level nature of community engagement by performing hierarchical linear modeling, which assesses both individual-level and community-level effects and variances. This study examines whether the effects of the individual-level variables on participation differ across communities, and if so, which community-level variables explain such variability. We find that individuals residential tenure and home ownership, sociability, life satisfaction, and local newspaper have a positive influence on engagement. The data also reveal that the effects of variables at the individual-level differed across communities. In addition, we find cross-level interaction effects, which indicate that in communities where average homeownership is higher, the effects of certain individual-level variables - life satisfaction, sociability, and local newspaper reading - became stronger. Notably, the non-significant effect of national newspaper reading at individual-level becomes significant where residents have a higher level of national newspaper readership (community-level). Implications of the results, important issues for studies in contextual effects, and future directions are discussed."

A Case Study of U.S. Medias Representation of al-Jazeera,"This paper addresses the issue of western representation of pan-Arab networks and their images in the wake of 9-11 through a case study of U.S. medias representation of al-Jazeera.
Postmodernist theorists categorized the emergence of al-Jazeeras images on western media as part of the global phenomena of media contra-flow (defined as non-western media flows which counter the previously established one-way information flow from western to non-west countries). Furthermore, the argument goes that al-Jazeeras might refine the traditional wartime news reporting angle of U.S. media, thus bringing the Arab aspect to American newsroom. By contrast, political economist such as Chomsky argued that U.S. media is using al-Jazeera for American propaganda purposes.
To address this debate, my research analyzes elements such as U.S. anchors contextualization of al-Jazeeras images, issues of inter-cultural translation, image selection and cases where U.S. media ignored newsworthy images that were broadcast on al-Jazeera.
In this paper, I argue that contemporary global intercultural communication discourse needs revision with the emergence of wartime news contra-flow, and, in turn, I suggest a few alternatives.

Previous research examining the effects of cues and synchronicity has not been able to examine the complete array of these factors in groups, as asynchronous full-cue systems were unavailable. 142 participants in groups of 3 or 4 engaged in collaboration over 5 weeks to develop oral reports, which were presented as part of their grade in a communication course. The results indicate it is best to use low cue media for task-based interactions. Those using low cue media felt their partners were more credible, reported more social attraction, less uncertainty and more involvement in the interaction and perceived their partners as more involved in the interaction. Synchrony had significant effects on person perception as well, with synchronous media being preferred, though it influenced fewer variables. People interacting with synchronous media felt increased social attraction and self reported involvement, although they felt more uncertainty. There was not a significant impact of synchrony on perceived involvement or credibility. The implications of these results for users and designers of media systems are discussed."
2004-0206,Converting Communication Swords to Commercial Ploughshares: A Comparative Study of American and Russian Regulation of Electronic Signatures.,Paper,Converting Communication Swords to Commercial Ploughshares: A Comparative Study of American and Russian Regulation of Electronic Signatures.,"The regulation of electronic signatures in the United States and Russia was analyzed within a post-Cold War policy transfer perspective. The aim of the study was to determine how both countries conceptualized electronic signatures within their respective political and e-commerce regimes. Since any significant regulation of the Internet has global ramifications, we wanted to establish whether American and Russian regulations governing electronic signatures adhered to the norms promoted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), which strives to harmonize international commercial law. It was found that the United States has wholeheartedly embraced UNCITRALs electronic signature principles, while the Russian Federation has adopted a nationalistic posture that differs significantly from UNCITRALs globalist principles. This finding goes counter to the policy transfer perspective which holds that in international communication, policy diffuses from powerful economic and political centers to the periphery of poor and emerging economies."
2004-0207,Coping Styles as Predictors of Television Viewing Motives in Crime Victims,Paper,Coping Styles as Predictors of Television Viewing Motives in Crime Victims,"Psychological research has indicated that people dealing with criminal victimization may do so in three ways: by coping actively, avoidantly or by seeking social support. From a uses and gratifications perspective, this study hypothesizes that coping styles are reflected in crime victims' motives to watch television. It is expected that victims develop motives for watching television that are analogous to the way in which they cope with their criminal victimization. To test this hypothesis, 215 crime victims completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire containing the Coping Strategy Indicator, a television viewing motives scale and several control measures. Hierarchical regression analyses offer significant support for the proposed hypothesis. Perspectives for further study are outlined."

Drawing Upon Personal Resources
Research suggests that romantic relationships can be particularly distressing when relationship standards are not fulfilled (Baucom, Epstein, Rankin & Burnett, 1996b). Discovering the many possible coping strategies used by partners in dating relationships is the first step in understanding how people deal with unfulfilled standards. The second step in understanding how people cope with unfulfilled standards is to begin exploring the coping resources that individuals draw upon in such times of stress. This investigation was conducted to explore the coping strategies people use when reacting to unfulfilled standards. In the first study, 26 coping strategies were generated. Then, in the second study, the results suggested a ten-factor solution: punishing, clarifying, reframing, self-disparaging, modeling, discussing, exiting, seeking social support, escaping, distancing and using humor. In addition, it was discovered that each of these sets of coping strategies was linked to two personal resources, relationship locus of control and self-esteem."

The current study will build on bias literature, to evaluate whether or not a new type of corporate bias exists in the coverage of America Online in Time magazine and whether or not ownership interests impacted how coverage of America Online was framed in Time magazine."
2004-0210,Corporate Philanthropic Activity and Corporate Financial Impact:,Paper,Corporate Philanthropic Activity and Corporate Financial Impact:,"The goals of this study were to learn the duration and the pattern of the long-term effect of philanthropic giving on the corporate bottom line, and to learn whether the duration and pattern differs among industrial sectors. With reference to duration, using regression analysis, the study found that in eight of the ten sectors, the positive economic impact of corporate philanthropic giving on corporate revenue began in the year after the giving occurred and lasted at least six years. In one additional industrial sector, the impact of corporate philanthropic giving on corporate revenue was not realized until three years after the giving occurred, but then lasted at least another three years. In the final sector, the regression analysis did not show a significant a significant impact of corporate giving on corporate revenue. With reference to the pattern of the impact that corporate philanthropic giving has on corporate revenue, for the eight sectors where there was a six-year duration of impact, the study showed that in six sectors giving had a significant and consistent impact on revenues from year to year. In the other two sectors the impact fluctuated greatly but was always significant and positive during the six years. Furthermore, by sixty regressions analyses, the study found that dividing the companies into industrial sectors was important to operationalization because the results showed significant differences from sector to sector related to duration and the pattern of impact on revenue."

Behind this is the policy change that gives rise to market restructuring and regulatory reform. I argue that in Chinas telecom policy-making, coporatization, not liberalization or privatization, more accurately defines the new policy trend. To understand the forces behind the policy change, I propose that the relative resources the Ministry of the Electronics Industry (MEI) possesses as against the Ministry of the Telecommunications and Posts as well as the MEIs efficiency in translating its resources into influence and favorable policy outcome define the policy change in Chinas telecom sector."

This computer-based experiment first replicates the findings of a previous study that voters with an initial candidate preference expose themselves primarily to negative information about the preferred candidate but develop more positive evaluations of their candidate. We then tested the hypothesis that recipients counterargue against negative information about the preferred candidate and thus use these messages to reinforce their pre-existing preferences. The paper discusses the implication of these results for research on the effects of negativity in political campaigns.

Moreover, this paper explores how these two trigger events would influence the ways in which mainstream newspapers identify the constituencies that are undertaking surveillance and/or intruding privacy.

Informed by the research on framing analysis, this study also investigates newspaper ideology as a possible factor that influences how the trigger events lead to a change in the actors that are identified by newspaper articles as undertaking surveillance and/or intruding privacy. The trigger events and a newspapers endorsement of George W. Bush in 2000 elections were significant predictors of the change in the tendency of the newspapers to identify government institutions as undertaking surveillance. The trigger events were also found to have led to a decrease in the tendency of the newspapers to focus on private institutions as invading privacy and/or undertaking surveillance."
2004-0214,Crafting Cultural Resonance: Imaginative Power in Daily Journalism,Paper,Crafting Cultural Resonance: Imaginative Power in Daily Journalism,"If references to myth and ritual in the study of journalism are to be taken seriously we may read, even in daily news, important truths about good, evil and much else that culturally constitutes our world. This study takes up the question of what exactly we are reading when we claim to be reading news-as-culture in this way. Scholarly conventional wisdom now holds news to be realities constructed within conceptual frameworks that make certain facts salient while suppressing others and thereby promote certain political and moral evaluations while hindering others. If these frames are to effectively construct reality, however, they must resonate with what writers and readers take to be real and important matters of life. Paralleling salience as an effect of selectivity in fact gathering and emphasis in news writing, this study argues that frame resonance is an effect of those same professional practices when accomplished with eloquence. As with the devices of framing itself, the devices of frame resonance are found in the recurring narrative structures and rhetorical strategies of news texts. In this study, continuing coverage by many newspaper of a particular news story provides the opportunity to study the figurative language that for multiple journalists on multiple occasions just seemed to work in the telling of that story. The story examined here, a poignant death and its aftermath, exemplifies three resources for the journalistic crafting of frame resonance - all of which point to the ultimate source resonance in the complexities of human desire."

Examining a mid-Missouri Spanish-English monthly newspaper, Adelante, the project began by identifying a readership population through conducting a survey. Then, the researcher conducted two focus groups to understand why the participants read bilingual media. Both the survey and the focus groups indicated that a wide variety of individuals read Adelante primarily for the same reason: the papers bilingual format. As one of a few studies on bilingual media, the project provides insights into an increasingly common and significant form of mass media."
2004-0216,Credibility Seeking through an Inter-Organizational Alliance,Paper,Credibility Seeking through an Inter-Organizational Alliance,"This study illustrates the dynamics of an inter-organizational relationship during a confrontation crisis. Specifically, the relationship between MeritCare health system and the Mayo clinic during the fen-phen crisis is analyzed as a case study. MeritCare identified a link between fen-phen and valvular hear disease; however, the hospital staff was concerned that they lacked the credibility and experience needed to make their findings public. Consequently, MeritCare initiated an inter-organizational partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The relationship was successful in generating the media attention needed to create a confrontation crisis about the use of fen-phen. Eventually, the drug was withdrawn and banned by the FDA. MeritCare benefited during the crisis from including its public relations staff in all major decision-making, planning, and coordination activities. The case study further suggests that successful inter-organizational relationships have, at their core, an understanding of the primary objective for the partnership. The study also suggests that inter-organizational relationships might be enhanced by negotiating the role of each organization prior to establishing the relationship."

After controlling for a number of factors, results revealed that local news exposure, attention to crime news, and trust in the accuracy of television news was positively related to concern about crime. In addition, higher network news exposure and more trust in television news accuracy led to endorsement of the perception of Blacks as intimidating. Finally, results revealed that heavier consumption of Blacks overrepresentation as criminals on local television news and attention to crime news are positively related to the perception of Blacks as violent. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."
2004-0218,Crisis Storytelling: Fishers Narrative Paradigm and News Reporting,Paper,Crisis Storytelling: Fishers Narrative Paradigm and News Reporting,"This essay examines the ways that popular American news magazines, such as Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report, use specific types of narratives to cover notable crises. These narratives unfold in predictable patterns regardless of the specific crisis. Two positions are taken. First, using Fishers discussion of the narrative paradigm as a foundation, the rhetorical implications of narrative use in meaning formation are established. Second, using open coding methodology, it is proposed that there exists evident types of narratives during crisis coverage and that these narrative types form patterns regardless of the specific crisis being covered. Following the discussions of narrative as tools for meaning formation, Fishers narrative paradigm, the data and methodology section lays out the procedure by which narratives were coded and identified. The essay concludes with descriptions and examples of the narrative types and charts displaying the results of the open coding process."
2004-0219,Critical Laughter: New Trends in Israeli Holocaust Representations,Paper,Critical Laughter: New Trends in Israeli Holocaust Representations,"Critical Laughter: New Trends in Israeli Holocaust Representations

This paper explores current changes in Israeli collective memory of the Holocaust via an analysis of several prominent popular cultural works. It focuses on the television satire: The Chamber Quintet but also includes short stories by author Etgar Keret, the satirical section of the local Tel Aviv weekly newspaper Ha'air. All of these texts earned critical praise and gained considerable popularity. Becoming increasingly visible throughout the 1990s, they offered subversive and challenging interpretations of traditional Israeli Holocaust commemorations.
The cultural role of these works can be understood by situating them in relation to two trajectories: The first is a historical-sociological trajectory that deals with the development of Holocaust commemoration in Israel. The paper traces the contemporary dynamics of this trajectory by focusing on the role of the Israeli third generation as a rising and significant present-day voice.
The second trajectory deals with the conflict between popular cultural practices and the conventions of Holocaust remembrance. For example, the mere fact that TV shows are always a part of a flow of entertainment that is frequently interrupted by commercials necessarily secularizes any representation of sanctified subjects such as the Holocaust.
Combining these trajectories reveals a dialectical discourse that connects prior voices with new modes of Holocaust representation in popular culture. Such a synthesis retains the previous concern with memory preservation but stresses individual experience rather than collective lessons. As a result the Holocaust increasingly becomes an Israeli story about the present rather than only a Jewish story about the past."

This paper locates questions of power in the unfolding world of global media. We argue cultural hybridity as a process of negotiation and re-appropriation in the global-local meeting is marked by political and economic interests. Originally produced in UK, the show Who Wants to be a Millionaire, with its cultural ethos of individualism and open market, reached Indian cable television at a time when the nation was opening up to embrace liberal economic policies. Western liberal values were accommodated within the Indian milieu, in Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Hindi reproduction of the show. By drawing correspondences between cultural hybridity witnessed in the show and the political economic transformation taking place in the region, we argue that questions of power spill over from regulatory policies and debates on media ownership to primetime television menu. What then, are the implications of the changing mediascape for developing economies in the global media?"
2004-0221,Cross-cultural Adaptation of U.S. Expatriates in Singapore,Paper,Cross-cultural Adaptation of U.S. Expatriates in Singapore,"The present study examines the intercultural adaptation experience of U.S. expatriates in Singapore, drawing mainly on Kims (2001) theory of cross-cultural adaptation and Berrys (1989, 1994) theory of acculturation. Three key dimensions of Kims theory are used to analyze the sojourning experiences of 20 expatriates in Singapore: host social communication, ethnic social communication, and environment. A total of 20 U.S. expatriates in Singapore and 5 Singaporeans were interviewed to reveal partial support of the two theories of study. The emergence of a white privilege syndrome explains the distinct departure in the cross-cultural adaptation process of the U.S. expatriates from common assumptions in the adaptation and acculturation theories of Kim (2001) and Berry (1989, 1994)."

Cross media partnership newspaper Web sites with a print medium partnership was found to be the highest at 79 percent, followed by television (49 percent) and radio (20 percent). The results showed that cross media partnership had a significant effect on technological convergence of the Internet newspapers. The newspapers with cross-media partnership had a much higher level of convergence than those that did not engage in cross-media partnership. There was no relationship between newspaper size and level of technological convergence. Advancement in technological convergence of the Internet newspapers was found to be unrelated to the level of content updatedness of the newspapers. The implications of cross media ownership / partnership of the Internet newspapers and technological convergence that changed news content delivery and presentation are also discussed."

The result of this paper analyzing CRS issues presented and interactive features utilized on 100 leading Korean corporations' Web sites shows that the stage of utilizing the Web as an interactive medium by Korean corporations remains rudimentary. In particular, focusing on the difference of Chaebol and non-Chaebol companies with regard to CSR issues and interactivity of the Web, this study reveals that Chaebol companies presented more ethical CSR issues to reduce existing negative images and utilized more interactive features on the Web than non-Chaebol companies. Further, this study revealed that the more CSR issues are presented on the Web, the more interactive features are utilized."

The main purpose of this study is to theoretically and empirically explain the implication of having quality Internet connectedness in the context of production and reproduction of social inequalities. The findings based on structural equation model analyses suggest that there are structural patterns in which quality Internet connection of adolescents is a outcome of dynamic interplays of human capital (parents SES), social capital (ease of getting Internet related helps), and cultural capitals (expectation of usefulness of the Internet in future lives)."

The current study proposed an interactive, infinite choice, continuous time Prisoners Dilemma to test for cultural differences in conflict negotiation. Each participant was placed in either an individualistic or collectivistic category based on ethnicity. They were paired with either an individualistic or collectivistic opponent. The goal for each participant was to maximize his/her individual branch profits while simultaneously preventing the group from suffering. Overall cooperation was higher with an individualistic opponent than with a collectivistic opponent. Also, collectivistic participants cooperate significantly more with an individualistic opponent than with a collectivistic opponent."

Cultural variations such as power distance, individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity, and uncertainty avoidance are expected to incline different audiences to different types of messages.
Utilizing two of Hofstedes (1991) cultural dimensions, power distance and individualism/collectivism, this study content analyzed 33 subsidiary Web pages of the top 100 Fortune global corporations. The sampled pages all have presences in three diverse cultures, the U.S.A., China, and France.
The results showed that the U.S.A. Web pages showed more evidence of power distance than either French or Chinese Web pages, a reverse of what was expected. There was no significant difference in evidence of individualism among the three subsidiaries Web pages. A positive relationship was identified between the power-distance scale and the individualism scale."
2004-0227,Cultural Identity Tensions in a Post-Acquisition Organization,Paper,Cultural Identity Tensions in a Post-Acquisition Organization,"This study examines the problems associated with cultural integration in the aftermath of a corporate acquisition. Based on focus groups and one-on-one interviews with members of a post-acquisition organization (PAO), the results revealed three identity tensions used by organization members to reconcile conflicting pulls toward identification and disidentification: collaboration/competition, assimilation/autonomy, and consensus/command. Findings indicate that members across the four sites of the PAO reconciled these identity tensions differently, resulting in greater levels of disidentification at the two sites that had been acquired by the larger organization, than at the other two sites which had been long-standing locations of the acquiring organization. Implications are discussed relative to cultural and identity issues during periods of organization merger and acquisition."
2004-0228,Cultural Policy and the Debate over Low Power FM Radio in the United States,Paper,Cultural Policy and the Debate over Low Power FM Radio in the United States,"Between 1998 and 2001, a citizen-generated policy proposal called for the implementation of a Low Power FM (LPFM) radio service in the United States. This proposal led to fierce debates within the FCC, among civic and industry leaders and in the engineering community that repeatedly spilled into the trade and popular press. The debates over establishing LPFM in the United States present an opportunity to discuss some of the promise and limitations of cultural policy studies in the US context. In this paper I provide an brief case study of the regulatory developments surrounding LPFM, including an analysis of the institutions, individuals, and civic groups involved in this process and how the provisions of the policy changed over time. These changes eventually disillusioned the original petitioners, but did not result in a scrapping of the policy, but rather a shift in who benefited from it. I focus particular attention on the role of FCC Chairman William Kennard as a contradictory figure who nonetheless carried of the reformist spirit behind LPFM. As an example of what Bennett has called a cultural technician, Kennard seized an opportunity to correct what he saw as a lack of diversity on (and access to) American airwaves. However, his experience could be called a cautionary tale for the pitfalls he found in that zone where culture, policy, and media collide. Drawing together the ideas of Thomas Streeter, Tony Bennett, and Jim McGuigan, this paper considers the range of influences on this policy process and identify what seem to me to be crucial points within it, when decisions about rhetorical lines of attack and acceptable compromises undermined LPFMs chances of becoming a vibrant, alternative site of broadcasting."
2004-0229,Cultural Resistance and Economic Intervention: An Examination on Human Right Discourses,Paper,Cultural Resistance and Economic Intervention: An Examination on Human Right Discourses,"When facing the overwhelming trend of globalization, some post-colonial nation-states, or the so-called Third World countries, desire to be incorporated into the capitalist world-system on the one hand, but resort to their national culture to resist global intervention on the other. The meanings and contents of a national culture are thus mediated, appropriated, and continuously reshaped in this current global conjuncture by the struggle between the local and the global. I want to navigate through human rights debates to conceptualize the relationship between the local and the global because existing human rights issues could be seen as one of the most globalized discourses to operate at the intersection of claims of universal values and the specifics of a local culture. Moreover, human rights are not just instrumental mechanisms, but tensions around ethnic and nationalist identities. Human rights are involved in defining the self in opposition to the other, a debate embedded in the history of nationalism, colonialism and postcolonialism. Therefore, I want to examine the discourses of human rights to explore the tension between the universal and the particular, tradition and modernity, and the national/local and the global. I argue that the return to local culture is a response to the uneven distribution of globalization. But the cultural resistance emerged from the local in fact facilitates the expansion of global capitalism. Particularly, ethnicity is a stage manifesting the struggle of these two forces. And, finally, the local (nation-state) as an agent is still unavoidable and imperative."

The ways in which cultural values are embodied in the educational systems of the two countries, mainly higher educational institutions, are examined. The project also discusses how these differences in the cultural profile and in the educational institutional structures can find their reflection in the daily use of verbal and nonverbal behaviors in the classroom, namely in the use of immediacy behaviors by teachers and students representing the above linguocultural communities."
2004-0231,Culture as Kaleidoscope: A New Lens for Studying Cultural Identification in Global Teams,Paper,Culture as Kaleidoscope: A New Lens for Studying Cultural Identification in Global Teams,"This study proposes the metaphor of culture as kaleidoscope as a lens for articulating the multi-faceted culture of global teams. Drawing on identification theory, the paper examines the complexity of cultural identification within global teams and the implications of multiple identity targets for team interaction. The findings are based on an ethnography of a global software team spanning locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America that consisted of in-depth interviews, focus groups, document and email analysis, and participant observation. The global team of study was differentiated by national culture, which proved to be the strongest identity target, as well as multiple microorganizational allegiances. Other dimensions of culture, such as the shared engineering functional culture, helped to unify the team. The weakest identification was with the team itself, due to the existence of competing identity targets and the salience of the non-permanent identity of team members. This study contributes an important new way of examining cultural complexity as mediated by technology in global teams."
2004-0232,Culture-bound or Culture-free?: A Content Analysis of Internet Advertising in Korea and the U.S.,Paper,Culture-bound or Culture-free?: A Content Analysis of Internet Advertising in Korea and the U.S.,"This study intends to test the idea that advertising reflects cultural values through advertising appeals in a predictable manner. Hall and Hofstedes cultural values are employed as theoretical frameworks for comparing cultural values reflected in Internet advertising in Korea and the United States. Their cultural value systems were related to the modified version of Pollays advertising appeal system.
The results from a content analysis of 600 advertising websites shows some similarities in the use of primary appeals, but when the ads were examined within the theoretical frameworks, a clear pattern of dissimilarities were observed between Korean and U.S. Internet advertising. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the theoretical frameworks and their linkages with advertising appeals in visualizing a broad representative picture of cultural differences in Internet advertising. However, the mixed results of the study suggest that neither a perfectly standardized nor a specialized approach yet exists in Internet advertising. The author speculates that several factors may explain why neither of these ideal-type advertising strategies prevails in Internet advertising: strong medium-specific characteristics, the time lag to adopt innovative technology, integration of the world economy, and changing values within a single culture."
2004-0233,Customization and Cognition: Exploring the Role of Individual Differences in Web Portals,Paper,Customization and Cognition: Exploring the Role of Individual Differences in Web Portals,"The growing number of MyX.com sites, which can tailor to specific user-centered needs, has prompted several scholars to suggest that customization may be one of the most importantand definingelements in Web-based communication. Despite the benefits offered by customization, most users choose to stay away from customized Websites. One possible explanation for users reluctance to customize online content may be related to their varying levels of cognitive or intrinsic motivation. The present investigation explores this issue in the context of customized Websites. Specifically, it employs an experimental design to examine how an individual difference variable such as need for cognition (NFC) may affect individuals information-processing of customized content. All individuals (N = 60) in a between-participants experiment were assigned to one of three experimental conditions. Using the customization feature of the Yahoo! portal, three different versions of the MyYahoo Website were created to reflect three conditions, namely low, medium, and high levels of customization. After participants' exposure toand experience withthe Website, their perceptions of the Website were elicited via a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. The results show that an individual difference variable such as NFC can influence information-processing of online message content. Theoretical implications are discussed."
2004-0234,"Cyberspace, Power and Globalization",Paper,"Cyberspace, Power and Globalization","The call for greater equity in world distribution of access to information and communication technologies is hardly contentious. But pious endorsement of the concept by western corporations and politicians posts red flags. Whose interests does the digitization of information, communication serve primarily? Strategies for any global reform should address the structure of the existing world economic order, whose outstanding feature is U.S. dominance - dominance of global business in general, of communications in particular. U.S. dominance of global communications is part-outcome and part-cause of a dialectical interplay between several macro-structural trends. These include Americanization of business practice and culture, commercialization, 'competitivization' (a temporary form of competition induced by new technologies or other market openings), concentration, convergence, deregulation, democratization, digitization, fusion (the merger of 'common carrier' and 'gatekeeper' models of communication), and internationalization. Together, these stake out the evolution of the communications industries over the past quarter century. The paper assesses how the communications media, including computing and the Internet, contribute to a new form of 'globalization' that is a defining feature of our age. The interplay between media and globalization is a direct expression of U.S. strategy for world dominance."

In particular, the juxtaposition of the discourses that circulate in reference to men and women in EDM culture unveils reasons why women are represented in minute numbers at active levels of EDM scenes. By active levels I am referring to the occupancy of high profile positions, including those of promoters, DJs, and producers of EDM. Consequently, this paper argues that EDM is gendered in ways comparable to other pop music cultures. Women are generally left out of music discourses and are most often depicted as fans or dance floor participants. The goals of this paper are three-fold. First, I address the ways in which pop music discourses continue to be gendered. Second, this paper examines the non-transgressive nature of EDM communities via a brief history of the evolution of EDM culture. Third, mainstream media discourses are examined and discussed in contrast to women centered EDM spaces that exhibit women's current efforts to intervene and carve out a space for themselves in this male dominated scene."
2004-0236,Dancing About Architecture: Popular Music Criticism and the Negotiation of Authority,Paper,Dancing About Architecture: Popular Music Criticism and the Negotiation of Authority,"This paper addresses the impact of the culture divide on the establishment of critical authority through the examination of popular music critics. In-depth interviews with music critics illustrate some ways in which the popular culture critics experience might be distinguished from that of high culture critics. If criticism has the ability to elevate the status of the object it evaluates, this paper argues that, in the case of popular criticism, the cultural object has the ability to lower the status of the critic. It suggests that, lacking the formal training characteristic of higher critics, popular music critics must establish their cultural authority by consistently displaying their qualifications  proficiency as a writer, breadth of knowledge, and studied judgment regardless of personal preferences  through their work. Likewise, it analyzes how aspects of the roles, relationships and resources managed by popular music critics can potentially create obstacles to the establishment of cultural authority in the realm of the popular."

The goal being to determine if there is a congruence between the position taken by African news organizations and the consensus amongst African leaders and the public to seek a peaceful solution.
Research found that the sub-Saharan African media urged the Bush administration to be patient, not attack Iraq and to allow diplomacy to take its course. As they advised Bush to refrain from war, they also called upon African leaders and institutions to resist the drive to use force. The sub-Saharan media contended that if the Americans and the British carry out the attack on Iraq without UN sanction, it would create hostility and increase animosity against the United States in the Middle East, Africa and worldwide. They argued as most of the African stated an attack would inflame religious intolerance, and swell terrorist attacks and violence worldwide. They also contended it would lead to weapons proliferation, destabilize world economy and eclipse the focus on Africas crippling problems like AIDS, the debt burden and trade issues."
2004-0238,Deconstructing weblogs: An analytical framework for researching online journals,Paper,Deconstructing weblogs: An analytical framework for researching online journals,"The current piece proposes a multi-disciplinary framework for analyzing weblogs through the lens of technology, communication, and psychology. Weblogs are often likened to online journals where the content posts are arranged in reverse chronological order on a Web site. Weblogs can be personal or professional. As of October 2003, Perseus reports that there are at 4.2 million hosted weblogs on the Internet (Perseus, 2003). Weblogs are different from Web pages in style and voice (Blood, 2002) and therefore must be analyzed in a different fashion than normal home pages, threaded discussion lists, online chat text, etc. The authors suggest that weblog researchers employ a three-pronged framework by looking at the mode, content structure, and function of a weblog. Each of these three constructs includes a typology for analysis. Further suggestions for ways to analyze weblogs allow for a quantitative or qualitative approach, including investigations of the virtual proximity of network nodes and content analysis. The researchers call for future research to investigate the motivation of webloggers and impact of weblogs on readers. The formation and use of this analytical framework provides researchers with a baseline guide for analyzing weblogs and supports a multitude of prospective research questions or hypotheses."

The main assumption of this paper is that the complexities of the changing world and power differences have not been incorporated sufficiently into the study of cultural interactions. Most studies on Mexican culture tend to be based on fixed profiles of national cultures.
In this paper I propose a simple idea about a very complex topic: the nature of the Mexican culture related to work and the transformations that have been occurring during the last twenty years. The first part provides the theoretical framework on which this study is based. The second part provides a brief introduction to the predominant narratives in the academic discourse regarding the values and behaviors of Mexicans. Thereafter, there is an analysis of some changes that have taken place in Mexican society. The last part provides some elements that can be incorporated to understand better the complexities of Mexican cultural identity and everyday practices."
2004-0240,Decorating power: A textual analysis of homeowner agency in Trading Spaces,Paper,Decorating power: A textual analysis of homeowner agency in Trading Spaces,"This paper explores the hit interior decorating series Trading Spaces as a crucial text in the developing genre of reality television programs emphasizing transformation. Viewed as a self-improvement text, the program is ostensibly empowering; room transformations are viewed by participants and designers as an opportunity for self-expression and status elevation. Textual analysis reveals that the shows formathomeowners leave their living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms in the hands of neighbors and a designer who redecorate the room without letting the owners in on the surpriseemphasizes a struggle for control between the homeowner/participants and the professional designers. In this analysis, interior decorators are considered as bricoleurs, exorcists, and authorities on good taste. This research indicates that because the show supports designers as the ultimate authorities, the text is also potentially oppressive for viewers and participants alike."
2004-0241,"Decoupling Pacing and Information: An Embodied, Dynamic Account of Visual Perception and Memory",Paper,"Decoupling Pacing and Information: An Embodied, Dynamic Account of Visual Perception and Memory","Human visual processing does not occur in a vacuum. Instead it unfolds over time and reflects the motivational goals of the agent. The visual system picks out emotionally relevant stimuli from the world, and these stimuli are processed differently. As the brain prepares the body for action, motivated attention is directed to relevant objects in the world. These processes are not separable, but rather reflect a unified embodied cognition. When visual information is mediated, the body still responds, and cognition of emotionally charged topics changes, too. This paper outlines a dynamic, embodied approach to visual processing of mediated stimuli, outlines brain structures suggesting such an approach, and reports the results of an original experiment testing dynamic, embodied processing of affective pictures. Here time (pacing) is varied only in terms of speed of presentation, and amount of information is held constant. Results offer strong support for the dynamic, embodied approach. Pacing and affective content negatively affect recognition sensitivity. Further, affective content exhibits a curvilinear relationship on recognition sensitivity and response latency, suggesting that the more motivated attention is engaged, the more performance suffers. Finally, this lack in sensitivity performance appears driven by false alarms, suggestive of a narrowing of attentional focus during times of heightened physiological arousal. This finding is consistent with the architecture of the primate visual system."
2004-0242,Defensive Processing of Alcohol-Related Social Norms Messages by College Students,Paper,Defensive Processing of Alcohol-Related Social Norms Messages by College Students,"In an effort to reduce dangerous drinking by college students, many colleges and universities nationwide are choosing to employ social norms marketing campaigns. This study evaluates the persuasiveness of messages typically produced by these campaigns. It was hypothesized that students response to social norms messages would vary by their current drinking behavior (as a proxy for their ego involvement level). This proposition was tested with data collected from a sample of college students at a large public northeastern university (N=151). The findings demonstrate that, as expected, non-drinkers (low ego involvement individuals) were not affected by typical social norms messages, whereas moderate drinkers (who have higher levels of ego involvement that are sufficient for processing such information objectively) were positively affected by the same messages, and heavy drinkers (highest level of ego involvement) not only rejected these messages but also polarized their drinking-related beliefs following exposure. The implications for the design of future social norms marketing campaigns are discussed."
2004-0243,"Defining the Digital Divide From Below: Local Initiatives in Austin, TX",Paper,"Defining the Digital Divide From Below: Local Initiatives in Austin, TX","This paper analyzes federal, state, and local initiatives intended to address the digital divide from 1995-2000, focusing on how these initiatives developed in the city of Austin, Texas. The principal goal is to see how the digital divide was defined at the local level, in contrast to local responses to national and state initiatives and funding. Several kinds of institutions are examined, schools, libraries, community technology centers, workforce training centers, community centers, and churches, as well as larger organizations, which created city-wide network support, financial support, training opportunities, Web page design support, etc. for a variety of these specific institutions.
This paper addresses the following research questions. First, what aspects of the digital divide were of concern to which local actors? Second, to whom where these issues targeted? Third, Austin seems to have developed a specific focus on social/cultural capital, combined with public access to the Internet, envisioned by several departments at University of Texas, combined with grassroots activism, and city financial support that created a very locally-specific environment to address the digital divide. How did this focus on social/cultural capital influence the current telecommunications infrastructure in Austin? The data suggests that the unique combined leadership and vision of grassroots activists, the city government and the University of Texas at Austin created an environment within which solutions to the digital divide could be realized. This research can be valuable to local leaders and policymakers who are interested in creating sustainable infrastructure to bridge the digital divide."
2004-0244,Defying The Law In The 19th Century: Journalistic Culture And The Source Protection Privilege,Paper,Defying The Law In The 19th Century: Journalistic Culture And The Source Protection Privilege,Washington correspondents developed a canon of not disclosing the identities of sources during the 19th century. More than a dozen correspondents suffered confinement rather than expose sources to congressional committees. The canon was not based on any notion that the law granted them a privilege of shielding sources. A study of refusals by journalists to reveal the names of sources to Congress concludes that the behavior of the correspondents was a result of a combination of socialization within their news organizations and peer influence.
2004-0245,Degrees of Patronizing Elderly People: An Intergroup Context,Paper,Degrees of Patronizing Elderly People: An Intergroup Context,"This study examined patronizing communication in the law enforcement/civilian intergroup context, complementing previous research designs in this area with additional of degrees of patronization, varying the patronizer by manipulating physical appearance, and also by varying the person who is patronized by including two distinct subtypes within a vignette. By examining patronizing communication in these expanded ways, this study aimed to determine which variables in verbal (language) and nonverbal (appearance) communication may most likely yield effects in an interaction, and thus maintain negative stereotypes. In this vignette study, 426 students rated a conversation in which an older person was patronized, or not patronized, at two degrees of magnitude by a police officer. Appearances of the patronizer/ee were factorially varied. While degree of patronization was linearly related to attributions afforded both social targets, it was predictably negative for the patronizer, yet surprisingly positive for the recipient. Results are discussed in terms of the Communication Predicament of Aging (Ryan, Giles, Bartolucci, & Henwood, 1986) and Communication Enhancement of Aging (Ryan, Meredith, MacLean, & Orange, 1995) models, and directions for future research are explored."
2004-0246,Democratic Authoritarianism and the Censorship of the Press:,Paper,Democratic Authoritarianism and the Censorship of the Press:,"Democracy and authoritarianism are incompatible. But Singapore Government uses democracythe fact that it is an elected governmentto defend its authoritarian press censorship. This paper examines the arguments for democratic authoritarianism sympathetically and explores its irrationality by looking into how it works in Singapore and its implications for press censorship.
To Singapores leaders, it is authoritarianism driven by democracy or democratic authoritarianism. For long, it has been offered as a strong defense for the authoritarian practice of press censorship in Singapore. As an elected government, they can censure both the local and foreign press in whatever way they want. They argue that what they want to do is acted on behalf of the people for the sake of public interest. And it is to counter this modern variant of authoritarian thinking on the press that this article is devoted. In the following, the irrationality of this political belief and its application in press censorship will be explored. The second part of this article will reconstruct and present the arguments of democratic authoritarianism based on the thinking of Singapores leaders. Then the third part will call into questions its conceptual assumptions and empirical validity by looking into how it is worked out in Singapore and its implications for democracy and freedom of the press. It will be shown that the democratic authority informed by democratic authoritarianism is neither democratic in nature nor that the authority they enjoy is deserved. It does not represent democracy, but democracy betrayed."
2004-0247,Democratic Participation and Public Access Broadcasting: Caller Perspectives on Election Call,Paper,Democratic Participation and Public Access Broadcasting: Caller Perspectives on Election Call,"There has been much recent discussion about the changing nature of 'the public sphere' with the relatively new genre of RealityTV being viewed as a space in which the public can at least perform, if not always engage in meaningful debate. This paper considers the perspectives of callers to a political talk show  Election Call  in terms of why they call in, what they think about their interactions with politicians and how they regard the programme's potential to constitute a public sphere. It looks at the gendered aspects of caller experiences and beliefs in order to tease out if gender has any influence on the public's practice of politics in this particular context. The programme  Election Call  is a BBC production which has been broadcasting since 1974, going out simultaneously on radio and TV (and the web for 2001), in the days immediately preceding the British general election. I argue that whilst callers (both women and men) mostly felt positive about the experience of appearing on the show and having the opportunity to put their point of view, and believed that Election Call fulfils an important democratic function, women especially were much more negative in their assessment of their interactions with politicians, believing that it continues to be difficult to get a straight answer out of those elected to serve and represent us."
2004-0248,Designing Time: The Retro-Forward Logic of Mod Style,Paper,Designing Time: The Retro-Forward Logic of Mod Style,"In the 1960s, Mod style presented a new design for living. Ironically, for all the aspirations toward the future that Mod 1960s style conveyed, Mod was also influenced by nostalgia for past visions of modernity. The reemergence of Mod imagery from the late 1970s onward is part of a cultural echo that continues to affect people of the post-sixties generation and perpetuates an interest in the style. Today, in everything from film, music, fashion, and advertising, Mod continues to be an evocative subcultural and commercial style impulse. Mod's retro-forward logic coupled with its continued circulation through pop culture suggests more than just a subcultural lifestyle choice or a now classic pop style. With roots in the word modern, Mod was and continues to be the stylistic embodiment of the quest for utopia through modernity's many material offerings."
2004-0249,Determinants of Gender Inference and Its Effects on Informational Social Influence,Paper,Determinants of Gender Inference and Its Effects on Informational Social Influence,"The present experiment investigated (a) what determines individuals inferences about their anonymous partners gender in text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) and (b) how the gender inference moderates informational social influence. In a 2 (participants gender: male vs. female) X 2 (knowledge bias: sports vs. fashion) X 2 (language style: male vs. female) X 2 (partners character: male vs. female) between-subjects experiment (N = 333), participants played a trivia game with an ostensible partner. Although people tended to derive the partners gender primarily from gender-typed language style and knowledge bias, interactions emerged concerning character representation: The gender of randomly assigned characters affected womens, but not mens, gender attribution to the anonymous partner, especially when the gender cues from other channels were somewhat ambiguous. A path model confirmed that gender inference led to differential assessment of partners expertise in a gender-laden task, which in turn determined conformity to partners suggestions."
2004-0250,Development and Validity Testing of the Risk Communicator Style Scale,Paper,Development and Validity Testing of the Risk Communicator Style Scale,"This study developed and validated the Risk Communicator Style Scale (RCSS). The RCSS is based on the technical and democratic models of risk communication described by Fiorino (1989). This study found a problem with Fiorinos original conceptualization of technical risk communication. Fiorinos original conceptualization of technical communication equated the use of scientific and statistical information with low affective instruction, which was not shown to be statistically meaningful. The study proposed that Fiorinos terms (technical and democratic) were not as meaningful for communication scholars, so the terms scientific and affective risk communication were implemented. The study concluded that the revised scientific factor is a reliable and valid scale for measuring the extent a risk communicator uses scientific and statistical information. The study examined the predictive validity of the RCSS using variables common in instructional communication: nonverbal immediacy, communication clarity, receiver apprehension, satisfaction, and perceived credibility. The scientific factor correlated negatively with receiver apprehension, but positively with perceived communicator competence. The affective factor correlated positively with risk communicator nonverbal immediacy, risk communicator clarity, personal satisfaction (cognitive, behavioral, and affective), and perceived risk communicator credibility (competence, caring/goodwill, and trustworthiness), and negatively correlated with receiver apprehension."
2004-0251,Dialogic Development and the Elusive Digital Divide: European Union's Alliance for Information Society in Latin America,Paper,Dialogic Development and the Elusive Digital Divide: European Union's Alliance for Information Society in Latin America,"With a dual understanding of the digital divide  as signifier for uneven IT access and use, but also for re-mapped political and economic boundaries in the Information Age, this paper examines the discursive construction of the term as introduced by the European Unions Alliance for the Information Society with Latin America (@lis). The juxtaposition of the need to bridge the digital divide with calls for liberalization of Internet markets prompts a peculiar conceptualization of the phenomenon itself  as a knowledge rather than an access gap, and as a result, poses certain questions about the ways in which power and control are re-articulated via such development programs. Drawing on a Marxist framework that exposes the exclusionary dimension of liberalization policies, I point to the emergence of a hybrid discourse, where the digital divide is simultaneously addressed and produced. Specifically, I suggest that, while @lis responds to the issue of an international digital divide, its intended modus operandi harbors the possibility for domestic divides, and therefore, the reproduction of inequalities in local contexts."
2004-0252,Diaspora television and cultural identity: A case study,Paper,Diaspora television and cultural identity: A case study,"With the dramatic increase of the Chinese population in the United States, Chinese language diaspora media have undergone a considerable growth. They served the Chinese community by providing news and entertainment from home and connecting new immigrants to the host society. Furthermore, the existence of the diaspora Chinese media has its political and cultural implications in that those media not only offer the Chinese community a channel to refute the problematic mainstream discourse portraying the Chinese as the model minority but also provide a space in which the Chinese community constructs its own distinctive cultural identity. More specifically, the Chinese language media play an instrumental role in building the diaspora Chinese community and a transnational cultural identity. A case study on KSCI-18, a multilingual television based in Southern California broadcasting programs in Chinese was presented to show how the diaspora television relates host country to home country in the context of the diaspora community and, in doing so, helps establish a new type of cultural identity that transcends the traditional boundaries of states, political orientations, and ideologies. The use of a common language facilitates the construction of this identity."

Part I of this ongoing study contributes to the latter with an experiment investigating whether African Americans and Whites are differentially affected by racial priming of Black criminal stereotypes. Results suggest that this may be the case, though the small sample of African Americans thus far limits the analysis concerning the group. Racial schemata appear to become more accessible for both Whites and African Americans when primed by either a mainstream or Black news source, though there seem to be differences between them. Whites are more likely to infer guilt when primed; however, the current sample size of African Americans hinders establishing whether they are more likely to rate others as more culpable. This article describes how existing priming and stereotyping theories support the studys framework, provides some insight into the outcomes; and proposes future directions for this topic. Implications of the results are also discussed."
2004-0254,Different Masks in the Cyber Dragon World,Paper,Different Masks in the Cyber Dragon World,"This paper examines different Internet regulations in four Chinese societies, especially the gay website regulation. China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, have different political systems, ideologies and views toward the role of law in society, although Confucianism exists in all four societies. These differences are reflected their differences as in their Internet regulations. While Singapore and China use law more to protect and serve government needs or protect the public interests than to provide services for individual interests. Hong Kong and Taiwan take an opposite approach. Moreover, Hong Kong and Taiwan allow commercial service providers to flourish, letting market forces decide the level and quality of Internet services, instead of putting implementing censorship on the Internet. Conversely, China and Singapore have made no secret of trying to control the Internet and to filter what their citizens can see. Compared to prosperity of gay websites in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the gay websites in Singapore and China continue the fragile but steady march out of the closet encumbered by outmoded ideas of social control. Furthermore, we can see that it is a crucial difference for the Asian model of the gay movementmore Confucian, more moderate, and less rebellious. Even it is very strictly-regulated in Singapore and China, the two governments are pragmatic and they succeed in their policies because they impose strictures on gay users who then develop their own self-censorship. However, the effectiveness of attempts to control the Internet is questionable. The self-regulation approach is practical and effective and might be the only solution. It might also be the case that for China and Singapore, the future trend of the Internet regulation should focus placing more responsibilities on ISPs, regardless of public interests or economic development."
2004-0255,Different Sides of the Same Coin: Mixed Views of Public Relations Practitioners and Journalists for Strategic Conflict Management,Paper,Different Sides of the Same Coin: Mixed Views of Public Relations Practitioners and Journalists for Strategic Conflict Management,"A Web survey of 641 public relations practitioners and journalists showed that the source-reporter relationship between public relations practitioners and journalists is conflictual, involving stratagems on both sides of the relationship. Discriminant function analysis simultaneously showed the mixed views of public relations practitioners and journalists on two dimensions of conflict and strategy. Both professions disagreed, displayed false dissensus and inaccurately predicted each other in the source-reporter relationship. The perceived conflict between the two professions appeared to be a strategic choice since their inaccurate prediction or false dissensus is greater than their disagreement.

Practitioners have a tendency to be accommodative or cooperative, while journalists are likely to be in the opposite direction. Whereas practitioners are concerned about the relationship as their strategic choice, journalists are oriented to the conflict as their strategic approach, although both are constrained by many contingent factors within their own organization."
2004-0256,Diffusion of innovations as a theoretical framework for telecenters,Paper,Diffusion of innovations as a theoretical framework for telecenters,"ABSTRACT Local information and communication resource centers, usually called telecenters are springing in developing countries with the objective of bringing the benefits of new communication technologies to the rural poor. Rural telecenters are calling the attention of academic and non-academic researchers, but to this date there is no theoretical framework to help understand the process of diffusion and adoption of these centers by the local communities. This paper uses diffusion theory to provide a conceptual framework for telecenter research and practice. After briefly reviewing the core of the theory, this paper focuses on the three aspects of diffusion that are most pertinent for telecenter application: (a) the perceived attributes of innovations, (b) the communication aspects of the diffusion process, and (c) the consequences of innovation adoption. The paper concludes with a summary of the implications of diffusion theory for telecenter research."
2004-0257,Digital Must-Carry and Competition in the Video Marketplace,Paper,Digital Must-Carry and Competition in the Video Marketplace,"Since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the digital television allotment in its Fifth Rule and Order (FCC, 1997), the debate regarding digital must-carry has been intense without any reconciliation between broadcasters and cable operators. In this regard, this study investigates whether or not the governmental interests in the transition to digital television satisfy the guidelines of the intermediate scrutiny and digital must-carry is narrowly tailored, especially focusing on the governmental interest of promoting fair competition in the video marketplace. This study uncovers that the digital must-carry is difficult to pass the constitutional muster because the rationale of the government intervention for promoting fair competition has been weakened due to the rapid economic and technological changes in the marketplace. Therefore, the digital must-carry rules would not only violate the First Amendment rights of cable operators but also hinder fair competition between the two industries."
2004-0258,Disclosing and Responding to Cancer 'Fears' During Oncology Interviews,Paper,Disclosing and Responding to Cancer 'Fears' During Oncology Interviews,"We examine video-excerpts from routine oncology interviews to reveal how patients demonstrate and doctors respond to fears about cancer. Vocally and visually, embodied impacts of dealing with uncertain and dreaded consequences of cancer are apparent. Attention is drawn to how patients fears are exhibited in the midst of volunteering narrative information about their medical history and experience of symptoms. When addressing good and potentially bad news about their condition, fears get enacted as patients extend their answers beyond matters raised by doctors in prior questions. Criteria are offered for identifying trepidations about cancer within interactional environments involving doctors questions, patients elaborated answers, and subsequent responses by doctors. It will also be made clear that doctors examined only minimally acknowledge or ignore patients' exhibited anxieties, moving instead to redirect or even shut down patients concerns in pursuit of biomedical agendas."
2004-0259,"Discursive Re-embodiments: Latina Femininity, Sexuality and Domesticity in News Coverage of Cuban American Women",Paper,"Discursive Re-embodiments: Latina Femininity, Sexuality and Domesticity in News Coverage of Cuban American Women","Underlying the political and legal coverage over Elián Gonzalez's immigration status is a story ideologically driven by symbolic concerns over family, home and nation, a story ultimately framed by the media as a transnational family conflict. Not surprisingly it is a family conflict reported through the lives, bodies and voices of Cuban and Cuban-American women. Consequently, the Elián coverage is informed by a gendered discourse, a set of textual and visual practices where the female body and womens ideological position within the private sphere of the family and the home are central. Through a qualitative analysis of the Elián news coverage this essay explores the gendered discourse of Latina femininity, sexuality and domesticity as represented through the voices and bodies of Cuban and Cuban American women  in particular, the key figure of Marisleysis González, Eliáns U.S. born second cousin and media-dubbed surrogate mother. While this article does emphasize the U.S. coverage of González, I argue that the representational politics that surround Marisleysis cannot be understood in isolation from but rather in relation to those that surround the storys other main women. Thus, the analysis begins by examining Elisabeth Brotons, Eliáns mother, as a source of gendered signification. Analyzed together, the news coverage about these women allows them to function as a site of cultural contestation, as disorderly bodies that challenge dominant gendered archetypes about Latina femininity while simultaneously recuperating marginalizing discourses of Latina women."
2004-0260,Discussing Taboo Topics on Television: The Relationship between Topic Avoidance and Parental Mediation,Paper,Discussing Taboo Topics on Television: The Relationship between Topic Avoidance and Parental Mediation,"This study is an endeavor to connect mass communication research regarding parental mediation of television with interpersonal research concerning topic avoidance in adolescence. A total of forty-four families (mother, father, and adolescent) participated in this study. The results indicated that adolescents reported a negative correlation between topic avoidance and discussing violent television programming with both parents. For the adolescent, as topic avoidance increased with either parent negative mediation about violence decreased. For the topic of sex, a negative relationship between topic avoidance and parental mediation was found for the father only. Furthermore, mothers engaged in more negative mediation of sex and violence than fathers regardless of the adolescents gender. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
2004-0261,Discussion and Participation in the Wake of 9/11: Panel Analysis of Lagged and Concurrent Relationships,Paper,Discussion and Participation in the Wake of 9/11: Panel Analysis of Lagged and Concurrent Relationships,"This paper examines the relationship between citizen communication and civic participation. Past research has theorized that political discussion encourages participation by providing exposure to public affairs information and interpersonal pathways to civic recruitment. Others suspect that discussion is a consequence of participation, with experience anchoring attitudes and encouraging expression. Merging these perspectives, we hypothesize a set of relationships in which the size of interpersonal discussion networks explains change in levels of political participation and frequency of political talk, with these two variables reciprocally related to one another. To overcome the limitations of cross sectional studies, hypotheses were tested using panel data from a community survey. Testing for both lagged and concurrent effects, our results suggest that discussion network size is antecedent to civic participation, whereas more frequent political talk is an outcome of participation. We also observe concurrent effects between changes in levels of participation and changes in frequency of discussion."

A controversial topic on which many people have strong preexisting opinions was discussed in a group decision-making context. Unlike previous research on common and unique information, this study found no support for the common information bias. Also, this study found no support for the hypotheses that groups containing members of an opinion minority would utilize and value unique information more than groups with no opinion minority. In addition, minority members use of common information and level of persuasion were not found to be related. Minority members were found to value both common and unique information more than majority members. The role of neutral members versus non-neutral members was also explored. While neutral and non-neutral members did not significantly differ in their valuation of information, non-neutral members were found to utilize more information, both common and unique, than neutral members."

However, conceptual ambiguity remains concerning the features delineating justified from unjustified violence, the relationship of perceived justification to attributes of the source and target of violence, and the underlying psychological processes responsible for subsequent aggressive behavior.
The current research develops a logic explicating processes through which appraisals of justification are based on equal exchanges, moderated by dispositional and motivational concerns. An experiment based on this logic exposed 225 college students to a violent film clip using a fully crossed 3 X 3 design varying perpetrator disposition (liked, disliked, neutral) and motives for violence (sanctioned, unsanctioned, unknown). The results indicate unjustified acts of violence committed by that liked characters may strongly contribute to attitudes that facilitate aggressive behavior."
2004-0264,Distinguishing between Trust and Distrust in Organizational Contexts,Paper,Distinguishing between Trust and Distrust in Organizational Contexts,"Organizational theorists have shown renewed interest in the role of trust both within and between organizations. Much of this renewed interest stems from the realization that rational models of human behavior fail to account for some of the relational and social dynamics of organizational life. The levels at which trust functions within the organization are many: (1) coworkers' trust of each other, (2) employees' trust of supervisors or higher-level managers, (3) managers' trust of their staff, (4) workers' trust of the organization, (5) trust between partners in an alliance, and so forth. Contemplation of the many levels of organizational trust has given rise to the notion that perhaps trust and distrust are not simply opposite ends of a single continuum. Theorists have suggested that, particularly within the organizational context, parties may simultaneously trust and distrust other parties. The research reported here questions the validity of contemporary theories of trust that suggest that trust and distrust should be considered distinct dimensions rather than bipolar opposites of a single construct."

Developing countries and civil society organizations have been unable to wield sufficient influence in these conferences to engender policy outcomes that meet their socio-economic and development goals (CTO, 2003, Cogburn, 2003). This study explores the international civil society sectors involvement in the World Summit on the Information Society, and evaluates the impact of its computer-mediated communication (CMC), participation levels, and policy perspectives on conference outcomes. Using qualitative data from participant observation, interviews, and archival research, the study finds significant and diverse CMC activity within the sector, high participation rates, a coherent socially-oriented ICT policy perspective, but limited overall influence on conference outcomes. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the global governance of cyberinfrastructure and the information society."

Scholars suggest that in the process of appropriation art lends some of its cultural aura to the advertisement, which becomes aesthetically charged. A few qualitative studies suggest that not only does appropriation result in the advertisement gaining some aesthetic value, but it also results in the artwork losing some of its original aesthetic value. This study proposes an empirical test of this contention. A 2 (familiar/unfamiliar artwork) x 3 (portrait/landscape/history genre) x 3 (art/advertising/neutral context) within subjects experiment found that overall, art images placed in an advertising context are indeed evaluated as less aesthetically and financially valuable than the same images in a non-advertising context. Appropriated familiar artworks were judged as more aesthetically valuable than appropriated unfamiliar artworks. There were no differences by genre of appropriated artworks."
2004-0267,Does deliberative democracy work? A state of the field,Paper,Does deliberative democracy work? A state of the field,"The theoretical literature on deliberation is now quite large. Recently, a small but growing number of researchers have begun to put the claims of this literature to empirical test. Others have sought to integrate its claims with literatures in public opinion, social psychology, and cognitive science, To date, however, little work has been done on deliberation as an actual discursive exchange. In this paper, I accomplish several things. First, I report my own data on the discursive practice of deliberation within National Issues Forums (NIFs), a deliberative model used by thousands of community groups across the country. Second, I situate my study within the broader theoretical and empirical work on deliberation. Third, I integrate theory and empirical research on the relation between deliberation and political participation. Finally, I summarize the wisdom gained across several fields of study to provide a snapshot of the state of the field and a platform for reflecting on likely directions for future research."
2004-0268,Does Interacting with Media enhance News Memory? Automatic vs. Controlled Processing of Interactive News Features,Paper,Does Interacting with Media enhance News Memory? Automatic vs. Controlled Processing of Interactive News Features,"Interacting with online news is quite unlike the passive reception of news via traditional mass media. By constantly calling for user action, interactive news segments compel greater user involvement and are therefore more likely to be processed consciously rather than automatically and also lead to better encoding of news information. These propositions were investigated in a within-participants experiment by measuring clicking activity, heart-rate and memory as a function of the degree of interactivity embedded in a news segment. Hypotheses derived from enactment paradigm and limited capacity model were tested. Results show that greater the number of interactive features in an online news segment, higher the clicking activity, greater the heart-rate deceleration following the use of an interactive feature, lesser the recall and higher the recognition of story details. Theoretical implications are discussed."
2004-0269,Does Mood Have An (Important) Impact on Attitudes and Persuasive Message Processing?,Paper,Does Mood Have An (Important) Impact on Attitudes and Persuasive Message Processing?,"The purpose of this study was to test the importance of mood in affecting attitudes and message processing. Past scholars (Mackie & Worth, 1989; Mitchell, 2000) argued that mood and message quality interact such that happy persons are more easily persuaded than sad persons. This effect has been elusive at times, and others have found only weak evidence of such an effect. This study investigates such an interaction and also attempts to uncover moderating variables. A 2 (sadness, happiness) X 3 (strong, moderate, weak message) X 2 (high, low involvement) X 2 (favorable, unfavorable topic) independent groups design was employed. Participants received a mood induction through watching a videotape and then completed a questionnaire containing a persuasive message. Message quality and topic accounted for the vast majority of variance for attitudes and message processing. Mood had very little effect."
2004-0270,Does News Coverage of Tobacco Control Issues Influence Youth Smoking?,Paper,Does News Coverage of Tobacco Control Issues Influence Youth Smoking?,"The Florida Tobacco Control Program (FTCP) has reduced youth smoking rates substantially since the programs inception in April 1998. No studies have examined the extent to which newspaper coverage of the FTCP has contributed to these declines. In this manuscript, we examine the amount of FTCP newspaper coverage in Florida newspapers and assess the impact of FTCP newspaper coverage on the implementation of tobacco control policies and smoking behavior among teens. Results demonstrate that the FTCP has generated substantial coverage throughout the program, and a significant portion of this coverage has focused on activities and programs by Students Working Against Tobacco (SWAT). Results also provide evidence that FTCP newspaper coverage, particularly coverage of SWAT, was responsible for a portion of the observed declines in current smoking and cigarette consumption. These findings highlight the importance of public relations and media advocacy as part of public health communication programs and suggest that community groups contribute to reductions in smoking rates in part by generating news coverage of activities and programs."
2004-0271,Does virtual space come precoded with meaning? Location around the body in virtual space affects the meaning of objects and agents.,Paper,Does virtual space come precoded with meaning? Location around the body in virtual space affects the meaning of objects and agents.,"Virtual environments used in augmented reality systems potentially allow designers to place virtual objects and agents anywhere around the moving body of the user. Research on the neuropsychology of 3D space and communication research on proxemics suggests that locations in space may differ in how they a processed by the brain, and that such differences affect information processing. This experiment explored the effect of spatial location on meaning, specifically the semantic connotations of objects. This experiment directly explores the effect of egocentric spatial location of an agent, a virtual 3D head and a neutral golden sphere, on the semantic connotations attributed to the object. An abbreviated four-item scale derived from Osgood and Sucis semantic differential index was used to measure semantic connotation. The virtual sphere or head model was presented randomly in one of 10 locations in egocentric space, that is locations in space defined by location relative to the body of the user. The locations differed along the axis around the body: left-right, above-below and close-far. Results indicate that spatial location changes the semantic connotations of objects and agents. The perceived urgency, relevance, aggressiveness, and superiority of objects and agents systematically varied with distance from the user, agency (face versus sphere), and to lesser degree whether the item was on the left or right of the user. The height of the object did not have an effect. The results are interpreted in terms of the neuropsychology of perception. Implications for the design of virtual environments are assessed."
2004-0272,Do families use the V-Chip? A field investigation of the V-Chip mandate,Paper,Do families use the V-Chip? A field investigation of the V-Chip mandate,"Evaluated family use of the newly mandated V-Chip technology. A yearlong quasi-experiment with 150 families with children between the ages of 7 and 10 was conducted in which one group was given V-Chip equipped television sets along with training and information on how to use the technology (n=58), another group was only given V-Chip equipped television sets (n=52), and a third group was monitored over the course of the study for technology acquisition and use (n=40). The experimental manipulation was masked by informing participants that the study was about general family life and that the television was compensation for participation. Findings revealed that 33 of the 110 families attempted to use the V-Chip over the course of the study. Nine of these families had it successfully engaged when we visited the families homes at the conclusion of the study. Another 14 families engaged the V-Chip but opted to turn it off. And 10 families attempted to use the V-Chip but were thwarted by the technology. While training and information influenced attempts to try the V-Chip, these endeavors were not related to sustained use. Results suggest that access to supervisory technology alone is an insufficient indicator of adoption and use. Rather, family media supervision is better understood through the context of the family system."
2004-0273,Dogmatism revisited: A validation study,Paper,Dogmatism revisited: A validation study,"Dogmatism represents an individual difference in cognitive style characterized by closed-mindedness. The concept of dogmatism has received a great deal of research attention in such topics as information selection, information processing, message selection, and the source-message distinction. Shearman and Levine (2003) pointed out limitations and psychometric problems of the scale, updated the dogmatism scale, and provided tentative evidence for construct validity. The present study examines two types of validity of the scale; construct validity and concurrent predictive validity. The correlation analyses between theoretically related scales provided stronger evidence for the construct validity. The updated dogmatism correlated positively with dominance and submission, and negatively with perspective-taking and empathic concern. As predicted, the updated dogmatism correlated negatively with the ratio of con reason generation to pro reason, while it did not correlate with the linguistic markers for dogmatism, or the generation of distributive conflict strategy selection. The predictive validity of the scale was only partially supported."
2004-0274,Doing empathy and sympathy: Caring responses to troubles tellings on a peer support line,Paper,Doing empathy and sympathy: Caring responses to troubles tellings on a peer support line,"Conversation analysis of 53 emotive responses to caller troubles tellings on a peer support line resulted in description of 7 different methods for expressing empathy/sympathy: assessments as marked acknowledging; naming anothers feelings; expressing ones own feelings about anothers trouble; sharing a similar experience of similar feelings; sharing ones own hypothetical reaction; formulating the gist of the trouble; and using an idiom. These methods vary in terms of types of emotive reactions, depth of understanding of the callers situation, ability to normalize the others feelings, and intimacy of shared similar feelings. Only two methods--sharing similar experiences and sharing one's own reaction--fit all four functions and can be seen as both empathic and sympathic, demonstrating strong understanding of the callers situation and expressing congruent feelings."
2004-0275,Do Liaisons Have a Role in Teams? Examining the Influence of Liaisons,Paper,Do Liaisons Have a Role in Teams? Examining the Influence of Liaisons,"This study focuses on three areas as an organizing framework for the literature review: (a) teams, liaison role, and network position, (b) communication structure and Media Richness Theory (MRT), and (c) performance and communication structure and Media Richness Theory (MRT). Through the examination of set of 11 intact teams across 12 organizational boundaries, we examined the influence of network structure and media richness on team performance. Much of the prior research on teams addresses intraorganizational efforts; this limits the generalizability to settings outside of the organization under study. In this instance, team members shared professional similarities, such as job type, education and training, but differed in their geographic proximity, organizational affiliation, and organizational configuration. The consistencies in the patterns of team interaction uncovered here suggest that interorganizational collaboration can be effectively modeled and explained in a similar fashion to more traditional team-based structures.
Ultimately, this investigation examined team-based interaction from three distinct, yet interrelated perspectives. By combining network structure, individual and team communication behavior, and several team and individual outcomes, it was demonstrated that (a) network structure influences general team-based characteristics and interaction; (b) that team leaders tend to use more rich media to manage the team process; and (c) that the use of more rich media enhances team performance at several level"

Addressing the Challenges of Teaching a Discussion Based Online Course,"This paper discusses an interpretive study of the challenges of teaching a discussion based online course about the history and social implications of the telegraph, telephone, and Internet. Blackboard e-Education software was the course platform. Students enrolled were traditionally aged undergraduates majoring in communications, public relations, and business who ranged from sophomores to seniors. Data were collected using online participant observation, Blackboards automated tracking of students usage of the course website, and online surveys. Data were analyzed for insights regarding the factors affecting student participation, collaborative learning, and academic integrity. Suggestions are provided for structuring discussion based online courses."
2004-0277,Dramatized Political Narratives and Belief Change,Paper,Dramatized Political Narratives and Belief Change,"The article examines the role of narrative transportation in the persuasiveness of televised political narratives. While previous narrative transportation research has dealt with printed narratives of a general nature, this experiment deals with televised narratives of a political nature. Transportation was proposed as a mechanism whereby narratives with a political message can affect political beliefs. Subjects were divided into two groups based on level of transportation, and transportation was manipulated by using instructions. Subjects in both groups viewed an identical short excerpt from the program The West Wing. High-transportation led to more story-consistent beliefs, but had no discernible effect on beliefs about government actions and policy in the real world."
2004-0278,"Dueling Prophets:The Return of Prophetic Dualism to Foreign Policy Rhetoric After September 11, 2001",Paper,"Dueling Prophets:The Return of Prophetic Dualism to Foreign Policy Rhetoric After September 11, 2001","This paper examines the rhetoric of President George W. Bush in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Based on a model developed by Wander for studying Cold War rhetoric, the study concludes that Bushs rhetoric marked a return to prophetic dualism as the dominant argument in U.S. foreign policy toward terrorism. Bush characterized those committing the attacks as evil, and hijackers of the religion of Islam. In contrast, he offered a vision of America as a godly nation, with a mission to rid the world of evil. Rather than the old dualism of the Cold War, where the enemy was godless, those sponsoring the attacks proclaimed they were doing the will of God. Bushs dualism contrasted two prophetic visions, with the enemy viewed as having misused its religious tradition, while the United States was fulfilling its mission."
2004-0279,Effective Communication in Virtual Adversarial Collaborative Communities,Paper,Effective Communication in Virtual Adversarial Collaborative Communities,"Virtual communities are increasingly important in society. Communication is one of their defining characteristics. Effective communication helps to achieve common goals, but is often hard to achieve in virtual communities in general. However, in adversarial collaborative communities, there are many additional barriers. In these communities, not only the matching of objectives, but also of interests is complex. We study a case of an adversial collaborative community of which the common goal is to author reports to assess the amount of true consensus on forestry policies. We use discourse ethics theory to find a set of communication norms that are prerequisite for making communication in adversarial collaborative communities as effective as possible. These norms can be used for the design and diagnosis of communication systems. This can contribute to communication in virtual adversarial collaborative communities becoming more effective."
2004-0280,Effective Computer Text Design to Enhance Readers Recall,Paper,Effective Computer Text Design to Enhance Readers Recall,"This study investigated the effects of two different computer texts on readers recall with three content types (Blocked Constructs, Ordered Constructs, and Detail Layered Constructs) based on individuals different working memory capacities. The findings indicated that the format and content types influence how well information was remembered among readers. Participants with low working memory who read traditional scrolling text produced better recall scores than those who read the paged hypertext in all three content types. However, for those with high working memory capacity, the results came out differently depending on the content types."
2004-0281,Effectiveness of Consensus Information in Advertising,Paper,Effectiveness of Consensus Information in Advertising,"This study explores the effectiveness of consensus information claimed in advertising under different purchase decision situations. It does this by examining individuals with different genders, levels of susceptibility to interpersonal influence, and need for closure. In experiment one, female participants are shown to generate higher purchase intention when ads feature consensus claims as opposed no consensus claims. Male participants, on the other hand, are shown not to express different levels of purchase intentions when being exposed to these two types of ad content. In experiment two, the effectiveness of ads featuring consensus cues is enhanced when a group (vs. personal) purchase decision is involved, but only for individuals with a high susceptibility to interpersonal influence as opposed to low. In experiment three, the effectiveness of ads featuring consensus cues is shown to be superior when a group (vs. personal) purchase decision is involved, but only for individuals with a high need for closure as opposed to low. In clear contrast, in experiments two and three, the interaction between individual differences (susceptibility to interpersonal influence and need for closure) and purchase decisions on purchase intention is demonstrated to be insignificant when advertising does not feature consensus information."
2004-0282,Effectiveness of Positive and Negative Reinforcements in Humor Advertisements Targeting Heavy and Moderate Drinkers,Paper,Effectiveness of Positive and Negative Reinforcements in Humor Advertisements Targeting Heavy and Moderate Drinkers,"This study examined the effectiveness of positive and negative reinforcements in drinking-related advertisements that use humor appeals. A posttest-only group experiment was conducted with 116 participants aged from 12 to 48. Participants drinking styles (heavy vs. moderate) in relation to the message effect were investigated. It was found that moderate drinkers exhibited a higher level of intention to change their drinking behavior in the negative reinforcement condition than those in the positive reinforcement condition. However, no significant condition effect was found among heavy drinkers in terms of their intention to change their drinking behaviors."
2004-0283,Effect of communication medium and motivation on deception detection,Paper,Effect of communication medium and motivation on deception detection,"The present study reports an experiment that examines the role of communication medium and liar motivation on deception detection. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two dyadic communication conditions, text-based instant messaging or face-to-face, and to one of two motivation conditions, high or low. Participants engaged in a discussion of four topics, in which one participant was deceptive during two topics and truthful during the other two. No main effect of communication medium or motivation level was observed. However, an interaction effect suggests that highly motivated liars interacting in an instant-messaging medium were the most successful in the deceiving their partner. This result is discussed in terms of the potential advantages to the liar offered by text-based media."
2004-0284,Effect of Growing Internet Newspapers on Circulation of Print Newspapers in the U.S.,Paper,Effect of Growing Internet Newspapers on Circulation of Print Newspapers in the U.S.,"An Internet survey of publishers and online editors found that growth of the Internet newspaper yielded a slightly negative effect on print newspapers' circulation. The findings suggest that the smaller the newspaper, the larger effect the Internet newspapers had on the print newspapers. Small and medium-sized print newspapers showed obvious decreasing circulation since 1990 while the declining trend was not evident for large newspapers. The readership of the Internet newspaper had been considerably growing since 1995. However, scale of the circulation decline of print newspapers did not show evident replacing effect of the Internet newspapers. About half of the publishers and online editors did not regard the Internet newspaper as a major factor that reduced readership of print newspapers."
2004-0285,Effects of Ad Likeability in a 10 year perspective,Paper,Effects of Ad Likeability in a 10 year perspective,"Analyses of copy test scores of 3,000 TV commercials showed that Dutch commercials were not evaluated as very likeable in the period 1992 - 2001. Over time, commercials were perceived as more amusing, but less interesting, less convincing and less personal relevant. Time also had a small negative influence on unaided ad recall and recommendation. Despite these negative tendencies, the predictive value of the four different ad likeability dimensions (entertainment, relevance, clearness and pleasantness) on advertising effectiveness remained stable over time (no interaction effect of year was found). Regression analyses further showed that the ad likeability dimensions related strongly, but differently, to ad memory and the other advertising effects. While the 'entertaining qualities' of commercials were especially important for explaining processing effects, 'relevance' mattered most for changing someones opinions. Finally, the moderating influence of product type on the relationship between likeability and effectiveness was small, but significant for ad memory."
2004-0286,Effects of An Intercultural Communication Course on Students' Ethnocentrism Levels in Post-9/11 America,Paper,Effects of An Intercultural Communication Course on Students' Ethnocentrism Levels in Post-9/11 America,"Since the attacks on the United States' World Trade Center two years ago, the need for multicultural understanding has become greater than ever. A longitudinal study was conducted using survey data collected over the eight years. The data were analyzed to determine whether ethnocentrism levels of students are effected by an intercultural communication course, and what the long-term impact of September 11, 2001, has been. Results suggest that courses on intercultural communication do have a positive impact on reducing ethnocentric bias. However, events since the attacks seem to have contributed to the maintenance of higher ethnocentrism levels in students than prior to the attacks."

At this website, people fill out a questionnaire and receive computer-tailored advice on sensible alcohol use. The drinktest is based on the Transtheoretical Model and the Attitude-Social influence-Efficacy model. One hundred and three respondents participated. After filling out a pre-test questionnaire, they took the test and read the advice. A posttest followed to establish the effects of the drinktest on behavioral determinants and stage of change. The relative importance of determinants in different stages was also assessed. The drinktest influenced stage of change and awareness of being a role model for others. Results indicate that campaigns addressing this role model function can be effective. Differences in determinants across stages were investigated for the precontemplation and contemplation stages. Results were in line with the earlier found Æ-shaped pattern in Dutch research on smoking cessation. Injunctive and descriptive norms were found to discriminate between excessive and moderate drinkers."
2004-0288,"Effects of Cooperative Learning Sessions on Communication Apprehension, Academic Achievement and Class Satisfaction Among College Students",Paper,"Effects of Cooperative Learning Sessions on Communication Apprehension, Academic Achievement and Class Satisfaction Among College Students","This study examines whether communication apprehension (CA) can be reduced through cooperative learning (CL) sessions among college studentsif so, (1) under what conditions and (2) whether such effects would last beyond the semester. We hypothesized that (1) because of its non-coercive nature, CL would reduce CA levels effectively, but only after enough number of CL sessions for students to feel comfortable with the CL methods as well as with their small group members; (2) students with initially higher level of CA would show greater amount of CA reduction; and (3) the effects of CA reduction would persists six months after the CL sessions are over. We also hypothesized that the multiple number of CL sessions would be positively associated with academic performance and class satisfaction. Experiments were conducted with 372 undergraduate students from the three introductory astronomy classes: control group class (no CL session), limited number (twice) of CL sessions class; and sufficient number (nine times) of CL sessions class. The results showed: (1) CA was significantly reduced after the nine CL sessions for a semester, (2) CA reduction was more evident among initially higher CA students, and (3) CA reduction effects were intact after a half year later. Compared with the control group classes, academic achievement and class satisfaction were higher for extensive CL session class, but not for the limited CL session class."
2004-0289,"Effects of General Presidential Campaigns on Voters, 1980-2000",Paper,"Effects of General Presidential Campaigns on Voters, 1980-2000","We used National Election Studies (NES) data from the six most recent presidential campaigns to ascertain the effect of campaigns on issue knowledge, evaluations of the Republican and Democratic candidate, issue salience (the number of issues used to evaluate the two candidates) and character salience (the number of character traits used to evaluate the two candidates). The analysis correlated the days passed in the campaign with levels of the dependent variables. Results show that campaigns are capable of, but do not necessarily, affect each of these variables. Furthermore, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents usually exhibited different effects. Effects related to policy (issue learning, policy salience) occur more frequently in voters than effects related to character (character evaluation, character salience). Implications for campaigns, and the study of campaign effects, are discussed."
2004-0290,Effects of Image-Issue and Positive-Negative Scene Orders in Broadcast News,Paper,Effects of Image-Issue and Positive-Negative Scene Orders in Broadcast News,"The purpose of this study was to see if the order of image-issue scenes and the order of positive-negative scenes in a broadcast news story produce different influences on viewers memory, attitudes, and voting intention. The two different orders of image-issue and positive-negative scenes were independent variables while free recall, recognition memory, attitudes toward candidates, and voting intention were the dependent variables for this study. An experiment with broadcasting news stories about political candidates was carried out.
Two main discoveries were made in the in this study. First, no main order effect of the image-issue and positive-negative scenes was found. This illustrates that the order of two attributes does not influence viewers in broadcast news, perhaps due to primacy and recency effects. Second, interaction effects were found on attitudes and voting intention. When the order of image-issue scenes and the order of positive-negative scenes were considered together in the analyses, significant interaction effects were found. Those stories that had positive image scenes produced higher attitudes and voting intention than those stories with positive issue scenes regardless of order. Candidates image was the most important criterion against which people made judgments."

Students watched one of 12 clips selected from 3 different horror movies. The indicated their emotional & evaluative responses to the clips. Those results were used in ANOVA models with individual difference measures, sensation seeking and Enjoying Frightening Films. Results indicated that individual differences do play a role in mediating viewer emotional and evaluative responses."

In a 2 (participants gender: male vs. female) X 2 (partners character: male vs. female) X 2 (partners confidence: high vs. low) mixed-design experiment, participants played a trivia game with an anonymous partner. Experiment 1 showed that when the partners confidence was presented in quantitative form, its effect on conformity was more pronounced among men than among women. In Experiment 2, when the partners confidence was verbally expressed, however, the effect was reversed: Women displayed greater vigilance to the partners confidence than did men. In both experiments, the partners gender, inferred from randomly assigned gender-marked characters, did not affect perceived competence of the partner nor the susceptibility to informational social influence, casting doubt on the Expectation States Theory predicting the attribution of greater competence to men than to women."
2004-0293,Effects of Insightful Disclosure within Computer Mediated Support Groups,Paper,Effects of Insightful Disclosure within Computer Mediated Support Groups,"Past research indicates that written expression about emotionally traumatic events is associated with physical and mental health benefits, and this study examines how insightful disclosure within a computer-mediated support group for women with breast cancer affects breast cancer related concerns, emotional well-being and self-reported physical well-being. Using a word counting program that analyzed proportion of words related to various linguistic dimensions, this research examined words written within a computer-mediated support group for women with breast cancer. Surveys were administered at pre-test, two months, and five months in relationship to receiving access to the computer-mediated support group. Insightful disclosure improved emotional well-being and reduced negative mood but did not influence breast cancer related concerns or self-reported physical well-being. Implications for improving psychosocial interventions for people with health concerns are discussed, and future research objectives are suggested."

2004-0295,Effects of Multimedia and Sensationalism on Processing and Perceptions of Online News,Paper,Effects of Multimedia and Sensationalism on Processing and Perceptions of Online News,"What effects can be expected from the inclusion of multiple modalities, in terms of information processing and perception of online news? How can sensationalism reflected in news stories moderate the effects? This study examines whether multimedia enhancements have a positive impact on the processing and perception of news information. A 6 (Modality) × 2 (Story Type) mixed design experiment (N = 118) was conducted, with Story Type as within-subjects factor. Findings suggest that people tend to recall news stories with visual elements better than they recall news stories with just verbal elements. Furthermore, this was much clearer in the context of sensational stories, compared with non-sensational stories. Findings also suggest that video and audio clips embedded in news sites can enhance perceived credibility of the news stories and foster positive attitudes toward the news site."

Findings from a 2 (product presentation type) x 2 (placement context) x 2 (context matching) x 3 (interactivity) factorial design suggest that 3D online product presentations and advertisements have positive advertising effects when highly interactive, but they are moderated by an interaction between contextual website content matching, placement type and degree of interactivity."
2004-0297,Effects of Rumination and a Task on Selective Exposure in Stressful Situations,Paper,Effects of Rumination and a Task on Selective Exposure in Stressful Situations,"This study examines the influence of response styles to stress (high ruminators vs. low ruminators) and a consideration of an upcoming task (with task vs. without task) on entertainment choices in stressful situations using diary measure for three consecutive weekdays. Sixty-seven college students reported their daily stress levels and the presence or absence of a task right before watching television. They also reported ratings of major attributes of the programs to which they were exposed. Results revealed a significant interaction effect between response styles and a task across most of the attribute variables. High ruminators without a task, under stressful conditions, exposed themselves to exciting and involving programs, but those people with a task chose less exciting and less involving ones; Low ruminators without a task, under stressful conditions, exposed themselves to slightly relaxing and less involving programs, but those people with a task chose more exciting and involving ones. The results suggest that entertainment choices in stressful conditions take several distinct forms leaning on the interaction between rumination and a task."

A relatively novel experimental design is used to investigate the hypotheses. Results suggest that the vendor characteristic of reputation is important in influencing e-tailer trust, and that the content of privacy assurances do not impact trust or disclosure."
2004-0299,Effects of Survey Question Order on Reports of Political Interest,Paper,Effects of Survey Question Order on Reports of Political Interest,"Questions typically asked in public opinion surveys were placed in six survey versions that differed in their question order. Each of 147 experimental subjects responded to three of the six versions, each at a different time. Supported were the hypotheses that (1) political interest self-reports would be relatively high when subjects experienced no prior difficulty answering political questions; (2) interest would be relatively low when subjects experienced prior difficulty answering political questions, and (3) interest would be relatively moderate when subjects experienced prior difficulty answering political questions but when an excuse for knowledge difficulty was readily available. Not fully supported was the hypothesis that interest would be relatively low when subjected experienced prior difficulty answering political questions and when an excuse for knowledge difficulty was only remotely available. Implications for these findings for the design and analysis of public opinion surveys are discussed."

A priming methodology was also used to examine whether cultivation effects could be reduced or eliminated under priming conditions, and whether the possible minimization of television effects on beliefs could influence peoples subsequent behavioral intentions about sex. The results indicated that priming moderated the cultivation effect such that the television effect on beliefs showed the greatest in the no-priming condition but was dampened in the source and relation priming conditions. However, the resulting effect of television on behavioral intentions was not eliminated through the use of priming. Implications for the psychological process of cultivation effect and the measurement issues are discussed."

Two experiments were conducted to explore the effects of persons sex and seating arrangement on subjects perceptions of leadership. Results conflict with prior findings indicating gender bias against women: Subjects chose a person shown seated at the head of the table as the leader of a group regardless of that persons sex. Findings indicate that perceptions of leadership might be changing, with the nonverbal cue of seating arrangement serving as a more important heuristic in the determination of a groups leader."
2004-0302,"E for Accuracy! Comparing Survey, Diary, and E-tracking Methods of Measuring Internet Use",Paper,"E for Accuracy! Comparing Survey, Diary, and E-tracking Methods of Measuring Internet Use","Considerable debate exists over the accuracy of self-reported media use measures. This report compares three methods for studying Internet and computer use: online surveys, diaries and e-tracking. This study was conducted with undergraduate students from two universities. Participants were asked to (a) complete a survey (b) keep a diary over the course of one day, and (c) download Internet software which logs all Internet related activity. All methods assessed how frequently they engaged in Web surfing, information seeking, entertainment activities, email sending and receiving, and on and off-line video game playing. Results indicate that e-tracking estimates of Internet use are consistently lower than diary and survey estimates."
2004-0303,"E-Government in Singapore: Demographics, Usage Patterns, and Perceptions",Paper,"E-Government in Singapore: Demographics, Usage Patterns, and Perceptions","E-government in Singapore is an extensive project that has been sanctioned by a series of policy initiatives and programs and is widely considered an exemplary effort. This national survey (n=1,016) explored several key aspects of users and non-users of the Internet and government websites in Singapore. The findings provide fresh evidence of the digital divide, as well as how perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and on-line privacy and security concerns affect levels of government website use. The study also compared the use of government websites with the use of off-line sources and non-government websites for eight kinds of information, eight services, and three types of political participation. Reasons for people not adopting e-government were investigated, as was the likelihood of future adoption. Finally, the implications of the study and future research directions are addressed."
2004-0304,"E-Health Networks: Expectations of Centralization, Experiences of Decentralization",Paper,"E-Health Networks: Expectations of Centralization, Experiences of Decentralization","By the end of 2002, around 60 percent of the U.S. population used the Internet; two-thirds of those used it to seek healthcare information. Given this growing adoption and use of the Internet for seeking health information, support, and care, this paper explores four analytical themes about e-health and the Internet: (1) there has been substantial resource commitment resulting in the creation of many useful centralized services (some commercial, some governmental); (2) however, despite their utility, perceived and actual inadequacies of these services have stimulated disparate groups to create their own compensatory, decentralized and local networks of health information resources. In both centralized and decentralized Internet health resources, though, there are still many issues to be resolved, such as (3) reconfiguring physician/patient relationships in light of new technology, and (4) creating socially sensitive e-health services that are also socially equitable in terms of accessibility."
2004-0305,Election Campaigning Online. German Party Web Sites in the National Election 2002,Paper,Election Campaigning Online. German Party Web Sites in the National Election 2002,"German party Web sites in the National Election 2002 are examined over time by an integrated quantitative analysis of functional, formal, and content-related aspects. In order to prove whether common features of election campaigning are replicated online, the analysis is theoretically guided by the normalization hypothesis of cyberspace which believes in a transfer of real world features of politics to the Internet. Results provide empirical evidence of a limited normalization of German e-campaigning: As hypothesized, German party Web sites primarily serve information functions while neglecting interactive features. Yet, no overall gap in professionalism is found between major and minor parties, although minor parties lack visibility in the World Wide Web. Finally, online campaigning is dominated by a high amount of self-referential issues but lacks both the expected degree of personalization and characteristic differences in communication styles between incumbents and challengers."
2004-0306,Election Outcome and Topic of Political Campaign Attack,Paper,Election Outcome and Topic of Political Campaign Attack,"This study investigates the relationship between topic of political campaign attack and outcome of presidential elections. Using data from seven messages forms (primary TV spots, primary debates, primary direct mail brochures, nomination acceptance addresses, general TV spots, general debates, and general direct mail brochures) from 89 candidates spanning 14 campaigns (1948-2000), this study uses content analysis to determine whether a candidate=s proclivity to attack on policy or character influences election outcome. Overall, winners are likely to attack on more policy, and less on character, than losers. This effect is consistent, significant in all seven message forms, although the effect size is fairly modest."
2004-0307,Electronic Collaboration: Use and effects of collaboration technologies in organizations,Paper,Electronic Collaboration: Use and effects of collaboration technologies in organizations,"In this paper, we investigate the use and effects of collaboration technologies, or ICT applica-tions that support communication, co-ordination, co-operation, learning and/or social encoun-ters. We study the use of three of such technologies (electronic calendaring, virtual offices and an intranet) in order to test our theoretical model. This theoretical model is partly based on Monge et al.s (1998) work on ICT and collective action, and distinguishes communality and connectivity as important collective goods which can result from the use of such technologies. On the basis of Davis (1989) Technology Acceptance Model we identify factors influencing the extent to which and way in which such technologies are use: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and ex-perience. Furthermore, we make an important distinction between individual use and collective use.
Our empirical results confirm that the use of collaboration technology leads to benefits in terms of both communality and connectivity, and that the collective use of such applications is an essential prerequisite for these benefits to be realized. The use of collaboration technologies is determined by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and users experience with the technol-ogy. Our models thus support our theoretical arguments, but also augment them, since they shed new light on the relationship between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, communality and connectivity. Perceived ease of use contributes to perceived usefulness in the sense that it determines the extent to which users can create a collective information base (communality), which in turn not only directly determines perceived usefulness, but also indirectly via connectivity (the increased ease of reaching relevant contacts)."
2004-0308,Elite Asian newspaper coverage of agricultural biotechnology,Paper,Elite Asian newspaper coverage of agricultural biotechnology,"This is possibly the first cross-national study on media coverage of agricultural biotechnology in Asia using quantitative content analysis of elite newspapers. Specifically, we analyze elite newspaper coverage of the issue in China, the Philippines and Hong Kong and assess how differences in journalistic values, roles and practices influence coverage of the issue. Using quantitative content analysis, we compare the thematic focus, journalistic tone and news sources used in three English-language dailies ""of record"" - China Daily (China), The Philippine Daily Inquirer (Philippines) and The South China Morning Post (Hong Kong) - for the five-year period from 1998 to 2002. Our findings suggest that elite Asian newspaper coverage of the issue is influenced both by local journalistic values and practices as well as universal characteristics of science news coverage."
2004-0309,E-mail as a dialogic element in the symmetrical two-way model of public relations,Paper,E-mail as a dialogic element in the symmetrical two-way model of public relations,"The symmetrical two-way model of public relations is based on the mutual exchange of meaningful messages between the organization and a community. Organized communities are increasingly using computer-mediated communication (CMC) to develop and deliver their messages. A particular CMC technology is selected by a community based on the useful attributes of the technology, including those attributes that will support the communitys viability and capacities. E-mail can provide a dialogic loop in public-consultation processes, but it must be laid over the communitys requirements for enhanced viability and strengthened capacities. It is argued that as a dialogic element in a symmetrical two-way public relations model, e-mail may be used to strengthen the following interaction elements of a community: access, cooling off mechanisms, interactive broadcasting, breakout and reassembly, and memory. A case study is considered to illustrate the potential of e-mail for enhancing public-consultation processes."
2004-0310,Embedding the Truth: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Objectivity and Television Coverage of the Iraq War,Paper,Embedding the Truth: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Objectivity and Television Coverage of the Iraq War,"This paper reports on a cross-cultural analysis of television coverage of the 2003 Iraq War that seeks to assess and understand the dimensions of objectivity in the news during wartime. A total of 1,820 stories on five American networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel) and on the Arab Satellite channel Al Jazeera were included in the study. The study assessed bias on two levels: tone of individual stories and the macro-level portrait of the war offered by each network. Results showed that at the story level the overwhelming number of stories broadcast by Al Jazeera and the American networks other than FNC were balanced. Yet the data also revealed a strong bias in support of the American led war effort at FNC, and important differences in how the various networks covered the war. Also, broadcasters showed a war devoid of blood, dissent, and diplomacy, focusing instead on a sanitized version of combat. Overall, the study found evidence that the news norm of objectivity is defined in large part by culture and ideology more than events, as the norm would imply. The study also explored in detail the coverage of embedded reporters to assess their objectivity and compare their coverage to other types of reporters, especially unilaterals with whom they shared the battlefield."
2004-0311,Embedding: Two-Way Symmetry or sham Accommodation? An Assessment of its impact on Xinhua Agencys War Reporting,Paper,Embedding: Two-Way Symmetry or sham Accommodation? An Assessment of its impact on Xinhua Agencys War Reporting,"The research assessed the impacts of the Pentagons embedding strategy upon the war reporting of the embedded reporter from Chinas Xinhua News Agency in the Iraq War. Results showed that the reporter completely relied on the military sources, and the official agenda was effectively transferred to the journalists reporting, manifest by the finding that most stories placed messages from official source in the lead. A high percentage of the news stories and photos put the U.S. military in a humane and heroic light. It is argued that embedding has the appearance of the Two-Way Symmetrical Model and the nature of Contingency Theory. It appeared to be mutually beneficial but in fact fake accommodation."
2004-0312,"Embodying the Nation: Gender, Violence and Memory during the Partition of British India in 1947",Paper,"Embodying the Nation: Gender, Violence and Memory during the Partition of British India in 1947","This paper examines literary and ethnographic accounts of the violence (torture, rape, abduction, murder and suicide) committed by Hindu and Muslim men against Muslim and Hindu women respectively during the partition of colonial India into the two separate nation-states of India and Pakistan. I argue that these acts of violence were acts of symbolic communication that relied on a metonymic equivalence between women's bodies and national territory to produce the boundaries of the two newly formed nation-states. Furthermore, this communication was possible only through the reduction of women to sexualized bodies and through the silencing of womens voices and agency both in the acts of violence and in post-partition nationalist histories. I look at three aspects of how womens bodies became the site of symbolic communication during partition: first, womens bodies as the site where religious/communal honor was maintained or lost; second, womens bodies as the symbol of the pollution of communal identity; and, third, womens bodies as the terrain on which national and religious boundaries were drawn. Through an analysis of these three aspects I show how the construction of a masculine nationalist identity is possible only through the social and historical abjection of womens voices, and suggest that attention to these voices allows us to articulate a more nuanced sense of the relationships between memory, history, violence, gender and embodiment in constructions of nationalist identities."
2004-0313,Emerging Cuban-Americans in Miami: How Newspaper Discourses Produced an Ethnic Identity,Paper,Emerging Cuban-Americans in Miami: How Newspaper Discourses Produced an Ethnic Identity,"Newspapers, among other forms of media, are a forum for representing and constructing a unified imagined community. How a newspaper accomplishes this amidst ethnic conflicts over language is the focus of this study. Miami, in particular, has been a key site for such language struggles as some English speakers feared the increasing prominence of Cuban-Americans and Spanish in Miami. Through a discursive analysis of how the Miami Herald represented ethnic relations, this study shows that Cuban-Americans emerged as Americans for the first time precisely through the discourse that attempted to position them as foreigners."

I study English photographer Samuel Bourne's phtographs of India taken during his various sojourns over a seven year period (1863-70). I argue that Bourne's photographs say as much about the imaginations of imperial culture and identity politics - in this case, Englishness - as they do about the spaces and peoples pictured within their frames. Bourne's photographs fulfilled the 'civilizing mission' of post-mutiny English ambition: presenting an India which was pictorially subsuming with a fascinating past but ready for British domestication."

Thirty six Web sites of local Community Network projects were evaluated in order to explore how local communities employ the new technology, how they utilize opportunity of the Internet, and how they perceive the new technology. In addition, State of Texas funded Community Network project provides ideal setting for this particular research in exploring the implications of public policy on the diffusion of the new communication technology."
2004-0316,Engaging the Electronic Electorate: The Effective Presentation of Online Political Information,Paper,Engaging the Electronic Electorate: The Effective Presentation of Online Political Information,"The internet has been hailed as a medium suited to increase citizen information about politics, but research has not yielded design features that effectively engage and attract interest in political information among both the young (who are generally politically disinterested and more familiar with the internet) and the old (who are more politically interested but less familiar with the internet). This study posited and tested three models for the presentation of online political information that encourage engagement among both the young and the old. The study tests the appeal of three models of online presentation: 1) single-page side-by-side comparisons, 2) simple economical designs, and 3) streaming-video of political advertisements accompanied by fact-checked reviews of the advertisements (ad watches). Conducted over the 2000 and 2002 campaign seasons, it included a 944-person experiment, data from the National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES), a nationwide rolling-cross-sectional survey, and a newsroom intervention in 10 major media markets, data from a survey conducted in three of those markets, and focus groups conducted in two of those markets."
2004-0317,Entertaining Terror: Popular Entertainment and the Politics of Mediated Terrorism,Paper,Entertaining Terror: Popular Entertainment and the Politics of Mediated Terrorism,"This paper explores the relationship between popular entertainment and the political. In order to do that, it asks the following questions: What is the relationship between popular culture and the geopolitical world in the aftermath of the Cold War? What does popular culture tell us about terrorism? What, according to popular culture, are our collective fears after the Cold War? Can popular culture respond to the foreign policy-makers? Did popular culture anticipate the complex of issues that led to the evens of September 11? To answer these questions I first provide an explanation of the emergence of the discourse of terrorism and the role of Hollywood in the construction of that discourse. Next I concentrate on one specific film, The Siege (1998), as a text of popular culture produced in the years between the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the events of September 11, 2001. I argue that popular culture engages the political on its own term."
2004-0318,Entertainment-Education and Social Change: The Communicative Dynamics of Social Capital,Paper,Entertainment-Education and Social Change: The Communicative Dynamics of Social Capital,"Abstract

This study explored processes of social change initiated by an entertainment-education radio program in India, Taru, which lead to certain socially desirable effects in four villages in Bihar state. Data was collected primarily in the form of in-depth individual and focus group interviews, participant-observation, and description of a participatory theatre production. We discovered that a media program facilitates social change by stimulating the development of social capital in communities. Social capital was displayed through the development of: (a) relationships based on trust, (b) norms of reciprocity, and (c) communication networks. The existence of social capital in the four villages we examined contributed to educational programs for lower caste children, the improvement of community health, the stopping of a number of child marriages, and the promotion of gender equality. We also discovered; however, that social capital can initiate forces of both support and resistance toward social change. Furthermore, negative social capital may contribute to excluding certain people from participation in pro-social action, restricting individual freedom, placing excessive demands on group members, and downward leveling norms. Future research is needed to develop more fully our understanding of the range of positive and negative community effects produced by social capital. Continued work is needed as well to gauge the implications of sparking social change through media programming."
2004-0319,Entertainment Experience in News Consumption,Paper,Entertainment Experience in News Consumption,"Hypotheses on emotional reactions to news were derived from Zillmanns model of affective responses to fictional drama. Participants in a web-based experiment field in Germany read two news stories that were manipulated in a 2 x 2 design to vary affective disposition toward main characters, as well as the perceived likelihood of a negative outcome. Measures of suspense, reading appreciation, lingering interest for continued coverage, and information evaluation were collected.
As hypothesized, a positive disposition toward protagonists and a perceived high likelihood of a negative outcome increased suspense while attending to news. A positive disposition also led to higher reading appreciation, more lingering interest, and better information evaluations."

One major criticism of Goffman, however, is that he is atheoretical. This paper explains first, why some authors say Goffman has no theory, and second, summarizes one of the major strands of his theory, explaining how relates to the study of communication behavior. Briefly, it is proposed that the concept of social order provides the key to Goffmans theoretical assumptions, and that the relationship he proposes between the social order and the interaction order has particularly significance for those who study language and social interaction today."
2004-0321,Ethical Considerations of Public Relations Practitioners,Paper,Ethical Considerations of Public Relations Practitioners,"This study conducted the first empirical testing of Baker and Martinsons (2001) TARES test of ethical consideration factors for public relations practitioners. The TARES test is composed on five, interconnected parts: Truthfulness of the message, Authenticity of the persuader, Respect for the persuadee, Equity of the appeal, and Social Responsibility for the common good. Results indicate that the TARES test is better suited for a three-factor configuration based on Days (2003) definition of moral knowledge, and that ethical consideration levels differ based on age, education, gender and political ideology."
2004-0322,European Integration and National Agenda-setting,Paper,European Integration and National Agenda-setting,"While agenda-setting research is closely associated with studies within the nation state, this study attempts to open up this approach, taking into account the new political structure of the European Union. We aim at answering the question whether the media agenda is gradually becoming more influential with respect to the political agenda, as a result of the ongoing transfer of decision-making authority from the national to the European level. Additionally, as a first indication of European influence on the agenda-setting pattern, we look for the distribution of European actors and national actors prominent in news coverage. French parliamentary debates and articles from two French national daily newspapers in the period 1998-2002 were collected to reconstruct the political and media agenda on the issues of agriculture, drugs and immigration. These issues represent policy areas with varying levels of national versus European decision-making competence. The analysis indicates a slight shift in the balance of agenda-setting powers, resulting in an increased influence of the media agenda. Two out of three issues, drugs and immigration, meet our expectations, both with respect to agenda-setting relations and type of actors relevant to news coverage. The conclusion of this study should on the one hand be that some inconsistencies in the results call for further research; on the other hand , the results are promising enough to revise the way in which agenda-setting is approached, not only in the European context, but also in a variety of situations in which multi-level governance is present."
2004-0323,Eurovision Song Contest - How Do News Factors Influence the Audience Votes?,Paper,Eurovision Song Contest - How Do News Factors Influence the Audience Votes?,"Since 1998, the audience votes at the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), a major annual TV event, have been cast via Televoting. Undoubtedly, the quality of the songs and singers is the central explanatory factor for its success. From a communication studies point of view, the remaining variance is more interesting. It can be explained by characteristics of, and relationships between the participating countries. These factors point to news value theory. Until today, news factors have been applied to journalistic and recipients news selection. In this study, they are used to explain ESC votes as interactive audience behavior. Three hypotheses are examined. H1: the higher the political/economic/cultural status of a country, the more points its song receives. H2: the closer two countries, the more points the national audiences administer to each other. H3: songs from next door giant countries receive fewer points from their (smaller) neighbors than expected. All hypotheses are confirmed partially."
2004-0324,Evaluating a Contextual Model of Responses to Relational Uncertainty Increasing Events,Paper,Evaluating a Contextual Model of Responses to Relational Uncertainty Increasing Events,"Research spanning two decades has produced an assortment of discrete findings about how individuals manage relational uncertainty. In an effort to organize that work, the current investigation formulates and tests a contextual model of communication about events that increase relational uncertainty within courtship (N = 475 events). This study examines intimacy as a feature of the distal context and appraisals and emotions as features of the proximal context. As expected, intimacy coincided with positively-valenced behaviors (H1). Appraisals also explained variance in behaviors (H2), especially attentional activity, valence, obstacle, power, and legitimacy. With some exceptions, emotions predicted behaviors: anger and fear corresponded with approach behaviors (H3a, H3c), sadness corresponded with avoidance behaviors (H3d), and happiness and jealousy corresponded with negatively-valenced behaviors (H3b, RQ2). Emotions did not mediate the association between appraisals and behaviors (H4); rather, intimacy, appraisals, and emotions were all unique predictors (H5). The discussion examines how knowledge can accumulate by assimilating features of the distal and proximal contexts."
2004-0325,Evaluating Three Potential Models for Theorizing the Medium,Paper,Evaluating Three Potential Models for Theorizing the Medium,"An emerging concept in recent legal scholarship is the idea that architecture or the medium of cyberspace serves as a regulatory force. While scholars have recognized the role of the medium, there has been little development of a theoretical perspective for studying the medium. In this article, we evaluate three models for how the medium regulates. The first theory we consider is Lessigs model of what things regulate. This model shows how architecture interacts with other regulatory forces such as law, social norms, and the market. The second theoretical framework is Orlikowskis structuration model of technology, which stems from organizational communication research. The third model we consider is Actor-Network Theory originating within technology studies. Our conclusion is that the Actor-Network Theory shows some promise in theorizing how the medium regulates."

Previous studies have reported that LPD greatly increased the rate of donation, although at the cost of decreased amount of donation (e.g., Fraser, Hite, & Sauer, 1988). In order to maintain a high donation amount with a high rate of compliance, social proof (SP) strategy was employed. The current study, therefore, included four conditions (i.e., control condition, LPD, SP, and LPD/SP combined) to examine the effectiveness of these soliciting messages on the rate of compliance and the amount of donation money both in the survey experiment and the field study. Some theoretical explanations for LPD and SP strategies are provided. The LPD and SP strategies used in combination obtained the highest rate of compliance compared with the other conditions in both studies. The results of message effect on the donation money were not entirely consistent across studies with diverging methods. The implications of the current study were discussed."
2004-0327,'Everyone in journalism steals from everyone else'. Routine reliance on other media in different stages of news production,Paper,'Everyone in journalism steals from everyone else'. Routine reliance on other media in different stages of news production,"Journalists' use of other media is regarded one major reason for several dynamic processes within the media system. These processes sometimes result in 'feeding frenzies' or 'pack journalism'. But reliance on other media is not only relevant in non-routine situations like major political scandals, but also believed to be a standard procedure in everyday journalism. But although there is a lot of anecdotal evidence from participant observations, some fundamental questions have remained unanswered so far. Some of the most important of these questions are addressed in this paper. In its theoretical part, different types of interaction among journalists and the reasons why other media are so important for journalists are discussed. In its empirical part, the paper answers the following research questions: (1) How much time do journalists devote to the use of other news media? (2) How important are other news media in different stages of news production? (3) How important are other news media in comparison to other news sources? (4) Which individual and organisational variables have an impact upon journalists? use of other media and their assessment of the importance of other media?"

This synthesis of these broad theoretical areas is divided in to subsections of agenda setting, second-level (attribute) agenda setting, agenda building, information subsidies, and framing. The result of this exploration is a discussion of the implications that these theoretical perspectives have on the strategic practice of public relations and the continuing research efforts thereof."

An analysis of newspaper coverage between January 1994 and March 2003 was conducted in order to determine the relative salience of marijuana in the media before and during the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign (NYAMC). Lexis-Nexis searches were performed to collect the relevant data. Using a process of successive filtration, every article primarily about marijuana between January 1994 and March 2003 was identified (N=73,109) as well as articles in subcategories of marijuana news such as youth use of marijuana and police-related marijuana. Examination of such data revealed little variation overall across this time period in the number of articles related to marijuana and no incremental changes associated with the timing of the Media Campaign. Moreover, results revealed that news media attention to news categories arguably more related to the Media Campaign such as youth use of marijuana and non-arrest related marijuana has also remained relatively constant since 1994. These findings would suggest that other sources in the socio-cultural environment, as represented here by the news media, are not echoing Campaign messages."
2004-0330,Examining the Extra-Text: A Call for Paratextual Analysis,Paper,Examining the Extra-Text: A Call for Paratextual Analysis,"This paper examines the need for media and communication studies to engage in more paratextual analysis  analysis of the secondary texts that increasingly surround media texts. Ads, previews, interviews, merchandise, reviews, Internet discussion, and so forth, the paper argues, frequently play important roles in constituting and constructing what we come to know as the media text. Yet, amidst media and communication studies more familiar subjects of text, audience, producer, and industry, paratexts have too often eluded careful study. As such, a theoretical argument is made regarding the airlock function of paratexts, as it is suggested that they stand between audience and texts, guiding and mediating our interactions with the text itself, sometimes even rendering consumption of this text itself as unnecessary or itself secondary. Then, as case study and illustration, Star Wars action figures are briefly examined, as these toys control over textual meanings of the films is examined."
2004-0331,Examining the influence of interaction goals on interface and person perception,Paper,Examining the influence of interaction goals on interface and person perception,"As people use text based media to communicate with others, it becomes increasingly important to understand the implications of using these systems to fulfill various communication goals. Computer media have been used to fulfill many different goals that range from socializing with friends and family to cooperating on projects with colleagues. Technological determinists have argued that the features of the technology determine the outcome of the interaction, which would indicate that examining the features of the medium would determine the outcome of the interaction. Social determinists, on the other hand, argue that social norms and rules influence how media are, and should be used. This project examined the influence of interaction goal (social or task based) on peoples perceptions of one another and on the medium. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 114 participants assigned to either a social goal or task-oriented goal for a text-based computer mediated interaction. Results showed no significant influence of interaction goal on either peoples perceptions of media appropriateness or on their perception of the mediums ability to provide a connection between people (social presence). However, there was a significant influence of interaction goal on person perception. Participants in the social condition reported more involvement, communication satisfaction, credibility, and reduced uncertainty than those in the task condition. While the fact that peoples perception of the medium did not vary by goal by itself could support the predictions of technological determinism, the influence on person perception indicate that peoples perceptions of media appropriateness are socially determined. The theoretical implications for these findings for users and designers of media systems are discussed."

Perceived source credibility variables might affect the outcome of these appeals. The present work extends Wittes Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) (1992) by addressing how source credibility interacts with strength of fear to influence reactions to fear appeals. Specially, this research explores the influence of source credibility on the impact of persuasive fear appeal promoting traveling warning and taking vaccine to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."
2004-0333,Examining the Link Between Sexual Entertainment and Sexual Aggression: Presence of Adult Businesses and the Prediction of Rape Rates in Florida,Paper,Examining the Link Between Sexual Entertainment and Sexual Aggression: Presence of Adult Businesses and the Prediction of Rape Rates in Florida,"The Supreme Court of the United States has considered the constitutionality of anti-nudity legislation passed by municipalities or states that have relied on the negative secondary effects doctrine as justification. Most recently, in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., the Court again held that municipalities have the right under appropriate circumstances to pass anti-nudity ordinances on the assumption that nudity causes adverse secondary effects such as increases in sex crimes. The purpose of the present study was to systematically examine whether rates of rape and other crimes are associated with the presence of adult businesses in each of the 67 counties of Florida once other variables known to be related to crime are controlled. Three kinds of crime are examined: Index crimes, rape, and domestic violence. In addition, three measures of adult businesses are included: the total number of adult businesses that offer some form of live nude or semi-nude entertainment, the number of such businesses that provide nude entertainment, and the number of nude dancing clubs. In the case of the crimes of rape and domestic violence, zero order correlations between all three measures of nude entertainment and rates of rape and domestic violence were essentially zero. In the case of the relationship between Index crimes and nude entertainment, there is evidence of a significant correlation between these variables. The statistically significant correlations between measures of nude entertainment and Index crimes disappear when other variables are considered. The results of this study show that a causal link between nude entertainment and secondary effects as measured by crime rates at the county level is extremely improbable."
2004-0334,Expanding the Horizon: Using the Cellphone as a Mass Medium,Paper,Expanding the Horizon: Using the Cellphone as a Mass Medium,"This study suggests that the cellphones capacity to deliver voice, text, video, graphics, and Internet access interactively makes it increasingly used as a mass medium. Based on a survey in a midsize Southeastern U.S. city, the study found that cell phone users use their phones for surveillance, diversion, news and information communication in addition to voice calls. The extent to which one would use the cellphone as a mass medium is influenced by the level of perceived benefit, the number of phones they have, and the enhanced services to which they subscribe. Theoretically, the results support the model of media choice and use, as well as the activation model  people who use their cellphones for one purpose likely will use it for others."
2004-0335,Expanding the Theory of Normative Influences: The Role of Ambiguity and Identity,Paper,Expanding the Theory of Normative Influences: The Role of Ambiguity and Identity,"Recent conceptualizations of the influence of perceived norms on health behaviors point to the need for differentiating descriptive from injunctive norms. It has been suggested that individuals group identity, outcome expectations, and perceptions of injunctive norms moderate the relation between descriptive norms and behaviors. This paper expands on this model by testing the influence of two additional moderators: self-identity and ambiguity. The model was tested through a survey (N = 719) conducted among incoming college freshmen. As predicted, the interactions between each of the two moderators and descriptive norms were significantly associated with intention to consume alcohol. Overall, our model was able to predict 65 percent of the variance in intention to consume alcohol. Implications for health campaigns are discussed in terms of the necessity of including not only descriptive norms, but also the moderators of descriptive norms in norms-based anti-alcohol interventions."
2004-0336,"Exploring Assorted Beliefs, Doubts and Legends Regarding Quantitative Teaching Evaluations",Paper,"Exploring Assorted Beliefs, Doubts and Legends Regarding Quantitative Teaching Evaluations","In spite of fairly universal condemnation, quantitative teaching evaluations are commonly used to assess teaching effectiveness and, by extension, as a basis for administrative decisions regarding promotion, tenure and annual raises. Nevertheless, considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that structural factorsoften beyond the control of the instructorinfluence student ratings of professors and classes. In an attempt to determine the relative influence of structural factors on teaching evaluations in the field of communications, this paper reports the analysis of more than 6,000 student ratings across three mass communication-related departments at a large Midwestern university. Using confirmatory factor analysis, this study finds that structural factors account for approximately ten percent of the variance, and that three factors in particular are consistent predictors of student ratings across five subscales assessing the overall quality of the classroom experience for students."

Overall students describe positive perceptions of their relationship with the university. The best indicator of this positivity was satisfaction. Students also perceived the university to have a commitment to diversity, but were neutral about whether or not the university has a deep commitment to diversity."
2004-0338,Expressive Production of Religion through Virtuality: Theorization of the Internet as a Medium for Religious Expression,Paper,Expressive Production of Religion through Virtuality: Theorization of the Internet as a Medium for Religious Expression,"Two of the most widely discussed subjects in the virtual space might be politics and religion, which has been tabooed to discuss in real space. People express their religious beliefs, values, and meanings through the Internet utilizing the benefits of relative anonymity and less social responsibility, associated with the Internet technology. The technology does not only provide people with religious symbolic resources but also with a public space in which they articulate the religious meanings they have made out of interactions with cultural resources. Therefore, in addition to Hellands two uses of the Internet for religious purposes (information about and participation in), this paper suggests another use: expressing. It explores conceptual and methodological issues to theorize the potential of the Internet for religious expression. The religious expression on the Internet should be understood in relation to the project of the self in late modernity as a reflexive strategy employed by people to deal with late modernity. The technology fits well with the contemporary religious landscape, represented by reflexivity, subjectivity, and autonomy. Based on the discussions, this paper suggests directions for the study of religious expression on the Internet: (1) The meaning making process needs to be revisited with consideration of the Internets distinctive stage of articulation; (2) Religious expression should be examined with the interest in community, which is based on the understanding of the network culture provided by the technology; (3) Ethnographic research is called for, which can achieve the contextuality through relational approach between online and offline interactions."

In light of this debate, this 2 x 2 experiment presented participants with news stories about government efforts to restrict the civil liberties of an extremist individual or group (news frame) advocating for a cause either supported or opposed by the respondent (cause predisposition). Results indicate that willingness to take expressive action was greatest for individual-framed stories about a cause opposed by the respondent, and for group-framed stories about a cause supported by the respondent. This study underscores the conditional nature of media framing effects."

Using secondary data for 28 sampled Asian countries, this study tested seven hypotheses about the impact of various factors on the Internet growth. The findings show that the Internet penetration is related to a countrys wealth, telecommunication infrastructure, urbanization and stability of the government, but not related to the literacy level, political freedom and English proficiency."
2004-0341,Faculty hiring and the accepability of online degrees,Paper,Faculty hiring and the accepability of online degrees,"A national survey was used to assess the acceptability of a job applicant's qualifications that include online coursework. The questionnaire was sent in response to academe position ads listed in the Chronicle of Higher Education and was returned by102 hiring committee chairpersons. The questionnaire described three applicants who earned degrees through a ""traditional"" institution, a ""virtual"" institution, and ""mixed"" coursework. The respondents were asked to select one applicant for the position and provide written explanations.
The applicant with a traditional degree was preferred in two different hiring scenarios when compared to equally qualified applicants holding a""virtual"" degree or a ""mixed"" degree (98 percent and 74 percent repsectively). A binomial test showed that the selections could not be attributed to random chance (p< .0001). A qualitative analysis of the written comments revealed six categories of importance; student interaction, socialization, mentoring, lab experiences and institutional quality. Written comments were generally unfavorable towards online degrees and online courses taken in core subjects. Respondents perceived online coursework to be less acceptable and of lower quality.
Although there are many benefits to online programs, the results of this study should signal a red flag to those pursuing advanced degrees -- exclusively or in part -- through online courses. The quality of online courses are not perceived to be comparable by employers in the academe because of the lack of socialization, mentoring and face-to-face experiences. These factors should be carefuly considered as points to address by insitutions offering online courses and by doctoral candidates pursuing a higher education."

This study examines factors that influence students to communicate openly with their parents about their credit card usage. A survey (N = 639) of students in four states identified five factors significantly associated with communication about credit cards. Three factors are positively related to communication: students' dependence on parents for advice and information, openness of the family's overall communication, and students' dependence on parents for financial assistance. Two factors are negatively related to openness: students' level of debt and their level of dialectical tension about openness and closedness."

In particular, it investigated whether these correlations were affected by family communication patterns and perceived levels of social support in families. Results indicate a profound impact of conversation orientation and conformity orientation of families on parental discipline and perceived social support. In addition, result indicated a small association between parental discipline and relational violence and a direct effect of opportunity to nurture on relational violence in adult childrens romantic relationships. Contrary to expectations, perceived family social support did not moderate the correlations between parental discipline and relational violence. The implications of this study for our understanding of family communication in general and of parental discipline in particular are discussed."

2004-0345,"Father, Brother, Bride: An Exploration of Roman Catholic Masculinities",Paper,"Father, Brother, Bride: An Exploration of Roman Catholic Masculinities","In the current priest sexual abuse case, debate has repeatedly addressed priestly sexuality. Although public discourse looks to role constraints on priests (marital status, sexual orientation, biological sex) to explain the crisis, this study problematizes the enactment of Catholic masculinity. This paper argues that the church is indeed a gendered organization in which multiple masculinities are enacted. Literature on the gendered nature of organizing is the backdrop against which structures and processes of Roman Catholic gendering are deconstructed. Deconstructing the masculinity of Roman Catholic leaders creates a space in which a series of paradoxical masculinities can emerge, be named, and be unpacked.

Such an analysis of Roman Catholic gender problematizes a static, totalizing view of masculinity, and thus broadens the literature and thinking about how multiple masculinities enact organizing. Rather than presenting Roman Catholic gender as essentially paternalistic or managerial (possible categorizations on extant masculinity typologies), this paper argues for a more complex organizational gendering. Specifically, four masculinities emerge as organizational leaders enact power, catholicity, sexuality, and visibility. The first masculinity, consensual submission, is enacted as leaders manage contradictory issues of power. The second masculinity, hierarchical brotherhood, emerges at the nexus of catholic and episcopal structuring. The third masculinity, hermaphroditic asexuality, is seen as priests confront paradoxes of Catholic sexuality. The fourth, constrained public presence, is evident where Roman Catholic priests manage visibility, or the public-private continuum."
2004-0346,Fear and Loathing in the Heartland: How Communication Affects Young Adults' Perspectives on the Anniversary of 9-11,Paper,Fear and Loathing in the Heartland: How Communication Affects Young Adults' Perspectives on the Anniversary of 9-11,This study examines the patriotic attitudes and behaviors of young adults on the anniversary of 9-11. What are the roles of mass media and interpersonal communication upon displaying a U.S. flag and commemorating the 9-11 anniversary? How do these behaviors relate to different cognitive and affective dimensions of patriotism? Do the media contribute to feelings of fear and worry about the continuing war on terrorism? A quasi-experimental study of 525 young adults (ages 18-25) conducted on the one-year anniversary of 9-11 investigates how young adults are coping with the first war of their lifetime. This study attempts to expand upon previous research by examining patriotism as a dynamic component in the political socialization of young adults.
2004-0347,Feedback Delay Effects in Video Monitor Communication,Paper,Feedback Delay Effects in Video Monitor Communication,"Rhythms have long been recognized as playing a role in physiological function. Nonverbal communication researchers have studied the role of rhythm in organizing social interactions. Communicators use language cues to coordinate their utterances but also perceive nonverbal cues in order to synchronize their behaviors. When engaged in interaction communicators will synchronize and eventually enter similar cycles. Research into synchronicity of behavior has presented mixed and often contradictory results with some researchers arguing that synchronization occurs with intense negative interactions while others argue that it happens when teams are achieving great performance. Based on social cybernetic theory, more recent approaches have defended that synchronicity is a necessary property for good interactions and that its valence is defined only by its content. Thus, the more cooperation that an interaction requires, the more synchronicity it needs, and communicators will try to automatically provide that. This laboratory study tested if disruption in synchronicity through the manipulation of feedback delay would disrupt communication and affects perceptions of social presence. Dyads (N = 17) interact in two conditions, one with delay and one with another. Results showed that social attraction was affected by feedback delay but no effects were found for communication satisfaction or involvement. Delay manipulation also did not affect social presence, but a continuous measure of perceived synchronicity was able to predict social presence. These results provide some evidence that feedback delay may affect communication variables but further work is needed to clarify the strength and mechanisms of this influence."

Using social constructionist and feminist theory, this paper analyzes their talk about a main character, Joey, who is consistently labeled as assertive or strong, characteristics that would seem to challenge patriarchal roles for women. However, when the television text that helped generate this talk is examined in the light of these theories, the characters behavior and the ways in which the viewers attended to her, although discursively constructed one way, cycle back to perpetuate patriarchal female identities."

Based on ethnographic work on television reception among the lower caste community of Balmikis, who traditionally work as sweepers, this paper explores the gender politics of cultural globalization. The Hinduization of Dalit women through the growing redefinition of the national-popular and television-led cultural globalization promotes a gender politics that fosters genteel middle class ideologies of domesticity, consumption as well as family and community affiliation. Television, in short, plays an important role in suturing the New Economic Order of globalization, and the New Domestic Order of family and community alliances. In this context, I explore how Balmiki women conceptualize and deploy their agency and citizenship within the new alliance of state, media, community, and capital."
2004-0350,Finding the organization in the communication: Discourse as action and sensemaking,Paper,Finding the organization in the communication: Discourse as action and sensemaking,"This article discusses two ways in which language and discourse have entered the conception of organizing, i.e. as communicative activities of agents (conversations) and as discursively based interpretations defining agents, purposes and organizations (texts). Conversation, framed within a material/social and a language environment, is the site where organizing occurs, and where agency and text are generated. As text, in turn, language environment frames conversations and reflects the sensemaking practices and habits of interpretation of organization members dealing with their immediate material/social purposes. Using a senior management meeting as an illustration, the article discusses these two levels of apprehension of the language-organization relationship and argues that a dynamic view language and organizing must account for the processes linking both sides of the organization-language relationship."
2004-0351,First- and Third-Person Perceptions of HIV/AIDS messages and HIV/AIDS prevention in Zambia,Paper,First- and Third-Person Perceptions of HIV/AIDS messages and HIV/AIDS prevention in Zambia,"Preventing the spread of HIV and promoting HIV testing has become paramount to the survival of Africa nations such as Zambia. Communication campaigns to prevent the spread of HIV and to promote testing are abundant, yet not enough Zambians have adopted the promoted behaviors, and as a result, the spread of HIV continues to rise. Researchers must examine how individuals respond to campaign messages within a cultural context to inform the use of such campaigns in promoting health behavior change. This paper examines the extent to which HIV prevention and testing behaviors are predicated on the perceptual gap, which is the difference in the estimated impact of messages on the self versus others. The behavioural hypothesis of the third person perception suggests the perceptual gap is a better predictor of peoples behaviors than their exposure to media messages. In a collectivistic culture, the notion of the third person perception and the behavioural hypothesis take on particular importance. In a study of the impact of HIV/AIDS messages on 344 Zambian college students, I examine first- and third-person perceptions of HIV/AIDS messages, focusing on the differences in the estimated impact of the messages in Public Service Announcements (PSAs) versus those presented within a local serial drama. I also examine the perceptual gap, message exposure and other important health behavior change concepts as predictors of condom use and intentions and HIV testing and intentions, examining sex differences. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Exploring the Relationship between Generations of Immigration and Ethnic Media Dependency in a Chinese Immigrant Community","Each wave of immigration brings with it the need for a specialized press and other forms of ethnic media. Many immigration scholars in the U.S., however, have paid little attention to the overall communication environment where newcomers gain information to adapt. The fact that first-generation immigrants often speak a language other than English also prevents researchers from making insightful comparison across generations. This study draws upon Communication Infrastructure Theory and attempts to delineate the relative importance of ethnic media in the communication infrastructure where immigrants reside. Looking into a Chinese community in Los Angeles, this study found that immigrants depended on different types of ethnic media to fulfill a variety of goals. In addition, different generations of immigrants showed different levels of ethnic media dependency even after demographic variables were controlled."
2004-0353,First Person and Social Distance Effects of Anti-Smoking Radio PSAs,Paper,First Person and Social Distance Effects of Anti-Smoking Radio PSAs,"This experimental study examined non-smoking college students and tweens (9-12) first person effect judgments perceptions that media affects self more than othersfor anti-smoking radio PSAs. In addition to finding first-person effects for both age groups, a social distance effect was found. Participants rated best friends as being more likely to be influenced by anti-smoking messages than other members of their age group. The effects of message pacing and arousing content on recognition memory for message content, ratings of personal impact, and first-person judgments were also assessed. Although overall first-person and social distance effects did not differ between age groups, message pacing and arousing content did have different effects on college students and tweens. The theoretical implications of these findings and implications for health communication mediated messages are discussed."

Survey, focus group, and content analytic methods are used to examine common significations of ""South Central"" and ""Westside"" in public discourse. Focus group and survey data respondents identified the ways in which geographical referents are given meaning in Los Angeles South Central and Westside urban communities. A content-analysis of the Los Angeles Times confirms that South Central and Westside residential areas are signified to establish a symbolic landscape that draws upon dominant urban narratives of race and class to give identity to geographic places and residential locales in Los Angeles."

The present study anticipates a continuing program of research into kirtan by providing an historical background to this practice, an anecdotal account of a kirtan event, and a preview of prominent themes to be explored therein. The overall study is theoretically interdisciplinary, and involves the use of a variety of methods including participant-observation (within formal and informal instructional and performative settings where chant-in-kirtan is prominently featured), close examination of audio and video recordings (of actual interaction in those settings), insights from interviews with participants, and introspection into the authors subjective experience both as a student and a leader of chant-in-kirtan.
This research aims to account, in both theoretical and practical terms, for Indian chants growth in popularity among Westerners (as a dynamic contemporary instance of cultural cross-pollination), and especially its reputed potency as a modality of self-help. Of particular interest is the claim that chant-in-kirtan affords practitioners the opportunity for self-forgetting, hailed across the worlds wisdom traditions as an experience associated with genuine, sustained happiness."

Literature dealing with media stereotypes within advertising and music television has suggested that females and minorities are underrepresented in comparison to White males. This study analyzed 210 countdown music videos and compared contemporary male and female video figure depictions across three music genres over a 7-month period. The majority of music video studies have analyzed lead singers; however, in this research, all primary and supporting video figures were examined.
Results indicate that White male primary figures appeared more often than female primary figures and Black primary figures across rock, country, and hip hop videos. There was a statistically significant relationship connecting distinct musicvideo genres and primary figure ethnicity. No statistically significant age differences were found between male and female video figures; however, one measure of centrality and dispersion is noteworthy: 78.9 percent of primary video figures were between the ages of 18 and 34."

I argue that women who wrote letters to the editors struggled with a considerable amount of tension and contradiction built within themselves due to the gap between cultural promises and reality. They struggled between a hunger for mainstream acceptance and, simultaneously, contempt for the mainstream. Their desire to be part of mainstream and participate in domesticity did not always turn out to be what they aspired. At the same time, however, they could not really choose a radically different path for various reasons, such as a fear of being ostracized and a lack of financial independence. Inclusive domestic containment permitted the expression of restlessness and tension in the mainstream womens magazine, but womens discontent had to remain personal grumbles  not a social problem that had to be publicly addressed and solved. Nonetheless, the Journal provided one way for women who led isolated lives in suburbs and thus lacked a supportive network of kin and friends to form an imagined community. The struggle over womens proper place in the late 1940s and 1950s failed to initiate a new definition of womens identity, but it foreshadowed the dissolution of domestic containment and provided a framework that became the seed of the womens movement in the 1960s."

Using a cascade framework from the Communication Matrix (McGuire, 1985, 1989), we tested effects of reminder cards, message format, argument quality, and mailer types on indicators of reception, processing, and response. Systematic combinations of these variables were mailed to randomly selected fire fighting units in the US. Fire chiefs were contacted by phone to complete a survey within the next month (Experiment 1 N = 2,000, 44 percent completion; Experiment 2 N=600; 77 percent completion). Results showed highest reception rates (~50 percent) with one reminder card and the standard government, low graphics format and that greater reception produced stronger intentions. Processing was stronger with the standard government, low graphics format and processing was correlated with more positive attitudes and intentions. Response indices were favorable (>4 on 5 point scale) under all conditions. Outcomes are interpreted within the framework of a communication cascade model."

A lack of monitoring system in the Internet allows practically anyone with some knowledge of Web design to be an information provider. Accordingly, questions arise as to how individuals assess credibility of online health information and under what conditions online health information can contribute to promoting individuals health. To address these questions, the present study examines the effects of source credibility on perceived credibility of online health information as well as health-related outcomes; specifically, the source credibility effects were tested with a for-profit company as health information Web sites sponsored by commercial sources far outnumber those sponsored by non-commercial sources (e.g., government source). The findings highlight the importance of source credibility in generating positive consumer responses to the health information. Even for-profit corporations yield favorable outcomes for public health promotions if they are perceived as credible in the eyes of consumers. Consumer involvement with health issues appeared to moderate the effects of corporate credibility. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."

The findings, based on a content analysis of 442 stories from 8 newspapers, suggest a strong peace journalism framing. Two important factors shaping the news framing of the conflict, and support for the war and for the protagonists in the war (Americans/British and Iraqis) are religion and sourcing. Newspapers from the non-Muslim countries have a stronger war journalism framing, and are more supportive of the war and of the Americans/British than the newspapers from the Muslim countries, which are more supportive of the Iraqis. Stories produced by foreign wire services have a stronger war journalism framing, and show more support for the war and for the Americans/British than stories written by the newspapers own correspondents."
2004-0361,Framing as a historical concept,Paper,Framing as a historical concept,"In their search for universal psychological processes, scholars of media framing & public opinion tend to assume that the most important thing to learn from a frame is how it affects individual opinion formation. In this paper, I review historical work on nineteenth century American political culture and analyze news frames of the 1860 presidential election to show that this assumption is historically specific. Today, citizenship is widely understood to be a process of private information consumption and independent judgment. In contrast, nineteenth century Americansincluding newspaper editorsassumed that participation, not judgment, was the ultimate purpose of citizenship. News frames were developed with this goal in mind. More specifically, the form of news frames reinforced a sense that political culture consisted of a broad, partisan conversation. By framing the election as a conversation, newspapers imaginatively opened the process to the participation of ordinary people. Analysts of media frames may learn three things from this exercise. First, that the psychological processes they connect to modern news frames are rooted in a particular political culture, and not generalizable across time. Second, by focusing so closely on the psychological dimension of media frames, scholars inadvertently reproduce the historical conditions of their work. Finally, attention to historical context provides more resources to reformers interested in changing the way that news media currently frame the political process."

Based on covers one year before and one year after September 11, 2001, the findings reveal that unlike the U.S. and issues about it, those for Asia and Europe were 1) limited to their internal consumption and 2) provided just as limited an external exposure. The paper concludes that the framing of news and regions becomes a cue for purportedly locally shared identities, which, in turn, are shaped by images produced by an otherwise American institution such as Time. Thus, it reveals the need to examine efforts at supposed regionalism by multinational corporations that hold sway over transnational spheres."

Here we present the results of the first part of the project, an analysis of media coverage of hate crime from 1990 to 2000. We analyze coverage of hate crime in the Washington Post and New York Times to begin to understand the information that is available to readers of mainstream news. Specifically, we examine the frames and causal attributions offered for making sense of hate crime. As a point of comparison, we also analyze coverage in the Washington Blade, the gay newspaper in Washington DC, to understand how the gay community frames this issue. One test of whether mainstream media help their audience to see anti-gay hate crime as gays do is to see if they invoke the same frames as the gay press. We find that the gay press is much more likely to cover hate crime across the decade. Readers of the Washington Blade are much more likely to encounter articles dealing with hate crime than readers of either the Washington Post or New York Times. For the Mainstream papers, substantial coverage only comes with the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard. On the other hand, the Post and Times do include many of the same frames invoked on behalf of hate crime legislation. The perspective of the gay community in this respect is present in mainstream coverage."

Results show significant differences not only in coverage between different media systems (U.S and Britain vs. China), but also between identical media systems (U.S. vs. Britain). Reasons for these differences and theoretical implications were explored.

2004-0368,Framing Through Morality Metaphors in Clinton's 1992 TV Ads,Paper,Framing Through Morality Metaphors in Clinton's 1992 TV Ads,"In contemporary American politics, metaphors serve as media frames and rhetorical foundations from which candidates can shape public perceptions. In this study, I explore the Clinton campaigns television advertising spots in 1992 through an analysis of linguistic, conceptual and contextual metaphors. Clintons campaign focused on the state of the economy, yet how he turned that practical agenda into a moral crusade is the subject of this paper. I argue that the Clinton TV spots utilized conceptual metaphors to structure a dominant frame of morality. Within that frame, metaphor clusters frame his opponent George H. Bush as immoral, the American public as morally indignant, and both Clinton and the American public as morally strong."

Analysis also indicate while the news coverage of an English newspaper emphasized guilt in the September 11 attacks by showing visual messages that humanized the victims, it de-emphasized the bombing of Afghanistan by showing images that focused least on the victims and more on aid, patriotism arsenal and weaponry, thus framing the Afghan war in a technical frame. On a similar level, the news coverage of an Arabic newspaper emphasized guilt in the Afghan war by showing photographs that humanized the victims. It de-emphasized the September 11 attacks by showing visual messages that focused least on the victims and more on material destruction and planes crashing into the buildings, thus also framing the terrorist attacks in a more technical frame."
2004-0370,French or Foe? Media Routines and the Fueling of Anti-French Sentiment,Paper,French or Foe? Media Routines and the Fueling of Anti-French Sentiment,"This study explores the role of media routines in the public opinion/foreign policy process. It maps the Freedom Fries story in both the print and broadcast media in order to investigate how one seemingly non-story became global news and helped create a public mood or environment inhospitable to the French. In this context the example illustrates how the media act as a force multiplier. The results of this study reveal that while this story on its own is not very significant, via its repetition it takes on a life of its own and becomes bigger than it really is. The ramifications of this repetition will unfold in due time, but one can already witness via the articles a public mood rife with anti-French sentiment. One can hypothesize that in this context the media have an enabling effect. As Bush and his administration have hinted in recent stories in the New York Times that France will receive some sort of punishment for its stance on the Iraq war, if an unfavorable economic policy, for example, were to be put in place, the mood has already been created in the public to support such a policy."

It was found that as a result of historical and socio-cultural realities, the French press generally framed relations between African Americans and the white majority as tainted by the so-called problème noir (the black problem). The morally problematic subordinate status of people of African descent in the United States, a democracy, which proclaims that all men are created equal. The French periodicals studied concluded that though public discrimination against African Americans had disappeared, and that the lot of blacks had changed for the better, there were still some areas where the more things changed, the more they stayed the same."
2004-0372,From Autonomy to Agency: Reconceptualizing First Amendment Theory,Paper,From Autonomy to Agency: Reconceptualizing First Amendment Theory,"Although little scholarship focuses directly on the First Amendment, targeting speech law could be one way to foster spaces for diversity. As feminist scholar Wendy Williams has noted: We (feminists) are at a crisis point in our evaluation of equality and women andperhaps one of the reasons for the critique is that, having dealt with the easy cases, we (feminists and the courts) are now trying to cope with issues that touch the hidden nerves of our most profoundly embedded cultural values. One answer to this ""crisis point"" is to find new ways of thinking about and analyzing free speech cases. Specifically, this article establishes partial agency as a viable alternative to liberal-based autonomy. This new conceptualization of agency brings to the surface the way in which power operates through speech. Once partial agency has been established, I explain the relationship between power and discourse in post-structural feminist terms. Finally, I show how these theoretical shifts implicate a different analytical framework for free speech cases."

The paper analyzes postings to the Well conferences, the on-line groups that served as incubators and testing ground for the term virtual community, revealing how this concept was culturally shaped by the countercultural ideals of Well users and how the tension between individualism and communitarian ideals was dealt with. The overarching conclusion is that virtual communities act both as solvent and glue in modern society, being similar to the small group movement."

In this context, youth consumer culture began to be represented in a very different pattern in media content from the mid-1990s. I intend to demonstrate how media discourse about youth consumer culture was constructed over time mainly in relation to the change in economic dimension. Main argument is that such a recent phenomenon that in media content, young people are called individualistic and autonomous consumers and distinctive consumption patterns are emphasized is closely related to the process through which the new logic of consumption has been established in South Korea during the post-Fordist era. In this research, using discourse analysis, I analyze newspaper content about youth consumer culture in South Korea during the 1990s."

Following an explication of a repertoire of emergency situations, including common universal as well as security-related emergencies, data are presented regarding the respondents perceptions of emergencies and their use of the mobile phone in such situations. Data indicate differential perceptions of the respondents own use of the mobile and the use by others. Data also present the uses made by the respondents in connection with terror attacks as one of the most severe kinds of emergencies. Mobiles are used in these situations to exchange information with loved ones and friends and to a lesser degree to provide emotional support. The paper ends with a brief discussion on the use of mobiles in emergencies within the general context of the nature and meaning of mobile communication."

The behavioral component of the third-person effect also has received only scant research attention and has seen little theoretical development. This study used multiple items to measure optimistic bias as a general psychological tendency and employed the Theory of Reasoned Action to illuminate the behavioral hypothesis. A survey on the issue of Internet pornography found that optimistic bias influenced third-person perception both directly and indirectly. The behavioral hypothesis was not supported; nevertheless, the TRA framework offered important insights into the sub-processes of influence in the perception-behavior relationship. Further analyses also showed that perceived effect on self was what really mattered in both third-person perceptions and their behavioral consequences."

In 1999 a scientific communication in the science journal Nature on the effect of genetically engineered corn pollen on Monarch butterfly larvae spawned a media event that is now considered to be a watershed event in the American publics consciousness regarding this technology. What was different about the media presentation of this research information that it had such an effect? The Nature article, its accompanying press releases and resultant newspaper coverage were analyzed using the theories of frame setting and rhetorical analysis. This article describes the movement of science information and the way in which science knowledge is translated between science and media. How is information framed? What language is used? How do the media accommodate scientific content?"

We argue that during summer and autumn 2002 President George W. Bush extended the September 11 crisis through emphasis in public communications on internal ""homeland"" security and an external ""war on terror""discourses into which Iraq was carefully inserted over time. These strategic communications allowed the president to dominate U.S. news content, helped Republicans gain control of Congress, and propelled the United States toward war with Iraq. Our analysis shows that Bushs emphasis on three themes in combination with a particular ordering of discourse facilitated a seamless evolution from a focus solely on Homeland Security legislation to one that highlighted the dangers of Saddam Husseins Iraq without substantive changes in the accompanying arguments. We also analyze U.S. news coverage during the same dates, revealing that news media closely followed the presidents messages and points of focus about these topics."

U.S. Congressional Attempts at Internet Regulation,"Though the Internet has been envisioned as a frontier for free speech, attempts to regulate this channel of communication not only exist, but seem to be increasing. Given its potential for both good and bad, the Internet has proven to be a volatile subject for policy makers. Initial research indicates that, in the United States, Congressional discussions about Internet regulations have been fairly bipartisan. This research catalogues proposed Internet regulation from the 104,105, 106, and 107 U.S. Congresses. We have coded and categorized these bills then analyze them in order to provide a framework for patterns of sponsorship and levels of partisanship and bipartisanship. We conclude that there is a high level of bipartisan and nonpartisan activity in Internet-related legislation and that, though the arguments from policy makers may differ, the goals of Internet regulation  especially in some specific areas like privacy and e-commerce  are the same."

Bangladeshi journalists gave prime importance to and most often performed the function of providing timely and accurate information. Other functions related to maintaining a democracy (evaluate and examine policy, for example) were rated next in importance while those related to developing the country were rated least important but still above average in importance. For all functions, there was a discrepancy in perceived importance and actual frequency of performance, which was lower. A comparison of actual factors that these functions coalesced into with ""theoretic"" factors proposed by Ramaprasad and Kelly (2003) found some support for the theoretic factors."

Lycra and spandex have replaced long skirts, and female professional players now have been acknowledged for their strength and athleticism on the courts. Yet, despite changes on the court, the language used to describe women tennis players has not completely broken the gender gap: Sports writers still comment on the femininity, attire, and personal lives of female tennis players while remarking on male tennis players' power, strength, and endurance on the court. This study used textual analysis to study media coverage of women tennis players over the last three decades, finding that sportswriters continue to use race and age as means of delegitimizing female players' ability on the courts. Furthermore, several female players tended to be framed as failures on the court because of the missteps in their personal lives."

2004-0384,Gateway Behaviors: Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Health Communication Programs,Paper,Gateway Behaviors: Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Health Communication Programs,"International public health programs are moving towards integration of programs away from disease-specific vertical programs. From a communications perspective, this means programs must address a variety of health behaviors  from using insecticide impregnated bednets to HIV testing to family planning -- that are influenced by cultural, social and economic conditions. The behaviors are inter-related in ways that have not been studied. Yet program managers must decide where to place more emphasis and allocate resources. It is simply not feasible to develop separate health and communication programs for each of the many behavioral outcomes. In the interest of both efficiency and effectiveness, we looked for interventions that can have broad impact, across multiple health areas.

This paper explores the concept of gateway behaviors: positive health behaviors that may trigger other positive health behaviors. We present two gateway behaviors models. Model 1 examines the relationship between two behavioral outcomes such as use of family planning services and use of maternal and child health services. Model 2 shifts from gateway behaviors to gateway factors and proposes two types of factors which result in multiple behavioral outcomes. Model 2s general gateway factors include womens education, control of income and power; resiliency; and social capital. The health specific gateway factors include communication (public, peer, and spousal); health self-efficacy; and perceived quality of health services. Evidence for each of these factors is discussed, including data from the 1998-99 India Demographic Health Survey which partially supports the gateway concept. Recommendations for future research are presented."
2004-0385,Gender-Based Violence and Womens Reproductive Health in Jamaica: A Communications Perspective,Paper,Gender-Based Violence and Womens Reproductive Health in Jamaica: A Communications Perspective,"Violence against women, whether physical, mental, sexual or otherwise, is widespread world wide and has been commonplace throughout history and spans all ages, classes, and racial groups. The UNFPA (2002) reports that more than 60 percent of women worldwide have been abused at some point in their life.

In the Caribbean, the most prevalent forms of gender-based violence include wife beating, rape and incest all of which have dire consequences on women, regardless of age. These consequences include the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS, unplanned pregnancies, and other complications that affect their physical and psychological well-being.

This study explores the situation, impact of gender-based violence on reproductive health in Jamaica and the existing gaps in addressing the problem in this age of HIV/AIDS epidemic. As we approach ten years after the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), it is important to reflect at the gaps in the implementation of the Plan of Action.

Data for this study are gathered qualitatively through naturalistic inquiry including participant observation, in-depth interviews, note taking and review of existing documents published and unpublished. Key findings indicate that a combination of social, cultural, economic and political factors contribute to the existing violence. Reproductive health programs have also not addressed men as an important stakeholder in womens health. These factors are reinforced by the lack of policies, legal or administrative system that condemns or punishes gender-based violence."

This paper uses the concept of charisma as an analytical tool for understanding discrepancies in achieving celebrity in the food television world. It is argued that the concept of charisma has been traditional linked to the performance of masculinity and this thus works against women gaining a more prominent voice in media. The cable channel the Food Network is analyzed as a case study to examine how charisma is realized differently by female and male program hosts and how this ends up foregrounding the talents of elite male chefs over the caring, female, domestic cooks. This has implications for womens entry into various public spaces, not just television."

Abstract


This content analysis examined six months of crime reporting in a local newspaper, focusing on the gender of criminals and victims. Types of offenses, criminal motivations, prominence and sensationalism were also measured. The study found that while the chivalry hypothesis was supported when female criminals committed nonviolent crimes, it did not apply to women who committed violent crimes. In fact, women who violated gender norms received harsher media treatment than nonviolent female criminals and their male counterparts. Also, men and women collaborating in crime received more prominent coverage than when males or females acted alone in criminal pursuits."

Abstract

Two experiments examined the effects of gender and rational thinking style on the relative weight accorded base-rate and non-base-rate explanations for increasingly positive and negative trends depicted with frequency data. Experiment 1 revealed that men judged base-rate explanations to be more important than non-base-rate explanations for both positive and negative trends, but women showed the same proclivity only for negative trends. High rationals judged non-base-rate explanations for negative trends to be less important than did low rationals. When Experiment 2 participants spontaneously generated explanations for the trends, proportionally more high rationals than low rationals adduced base-rate explanations for negative trends, but no rationality differences emerged for positive trends. No gender differences were significant. Results are discussed in terms of gender differences in the utilization of available base-rate cues, and highly rational individuals propensity to use based-rate data to explain away threatening trends to buffer themselves from anxiety and depression."

Four types of organizations were studied: public relations consulting firms, corporations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. Data were collected from 127 public relations professionals using a survey questionnaire based on the Excellence study. In addition, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted and organizational publications analyzed.

The data revealed that the four generic principles studied are applicable in another culture. In Singapore, public relations has a lower status compared with advertising or marketing. Public relations is also not used as a strategic business tool and professionals do not practice strategic public relations in the city-state because of lack of proper training, among other things. Thus, although Singapore has emerged as an Asian Tiger the public relations profession has not developed as much as one would like."

Through a survey sent out to 1200 such organizations across the United States, this paper gauges the sense of organization that online participation is said to be evoking. The results point to a substantial difference in the reports of improvement and frequency in certain empowering and resource-building activities by Internet users and non-users. Those non-profits that use the Internet report improvement and increased frequency in such activities as accessing information of key importance to their mandate, coalition building, shaping government agenda and generating awareness, while only marginal advances are reported in mobilizing for civil disobedience or interacting with mainstream media."
2004-0391,"Girls Rule!: Gender, Feminism, and Nickelodeon",Paper,"Girls Rule!: Gender, Feminism, and Nickelodeon","Nickelodeon is a powerful commercial cable network of television, internet activities, toy manufacturing, and video production. The network has been recognized by both industry professionals and media scholars as one of the most successful innovations in cable programming, especially in terms of its representation of girls as strong, intelligent lead characters. This paper examines Nickelodeon as an important producer of childrens culture, and situates Nickelodeon programming within the larger cultural context of girl power"" and Third Wave feminism. Focusing on entertainment programs Clarissa Explains It All and As Told by Ginger, and Nickelodeons non-fiction childrens news program, Nick News, this paper argues that Nickelodeon offers its youth audience a contradictory message about social and cultural empowerment, and about citizenship itself. The media context of girl power, combined with the increasing recognition of adolescent girls as both powerful citizens and consumers, offers what at times looks like a radical gesture in terms of disrupting dominant gender relations. However, we can also read the mainstream embrace of girl power as a restabilization of particular categories of gender, so that this radical challenge moves toward the entrenchment of conventional gender relations. Nickelodeon captures these tensions, incorporating them as a specific thematic discourse for their programming."

A theoretical model inspired by Appadurais disjuncture hypothesis, which stipulates that global flows of communication move autonomously of each other and reinforce regional/local identities, is tested empirically on an international voice traffic dataset. Spatial-statisical measures (global and local versions of Morans I) indicate that countries that share the same linguistic (English, Spanish, Arabic or French) or civilizational (Catholic, Islamic, and Buddhist-Hindu) background are more likely to be each others telecommunicative neighbors and that this tendency seems to have increased over time (1989-1999)."

It has been faulted for a number of problems afflicting societies and credited for the benefits it bestows upon others. Those opposing globalization usually place blame on America as the primary force behind the phenomenon. This paper looks at global brands, a potent symbol of globalization representing a countrys economic and cultural might, to determine if America is indeed the driving force behind globalization. Using data from Interbrands 2003 Most Valuable Global Brands survey, the results show that American brands overwhelm other countries brands in sheer number and in brand value. In addition, American brands represent a cross-section of global industries and are positioned strongly in the information/technology fields thus indicating that American brands may well continue to dominate in the future."

The issue is not if European stories are domesticated to fit national news bulletins, but how events are domesticated, and what meanings are made from these by the programmes producers. The results indicate that viewers are offered different images of Europe during the week 15-21 November 1999, and that the journalists play active roles in constructing themes which link together different types of news stories about Europe into stories about us. The Swedish we was characterised as a moralising global villager, slightly superior but willing to adapt to the outside world, the Danish We appeared as an anxious and conscientious European, trying to do its share, despite its reservations on EU cooperation. The British We was characterised as the engaged international humanitarian who prefers to keep a distance from time-consuming Euro-squabbles."

Policymakers are addressing societal concerns such as privacy, freedom of speech, and intellectual property protection with code-based solutions. While scholars have noted the role of code, there is little analysis of the various features or characteristics of code that have significance in regulating behavior. This paper examines four universal governance characteristics that policymakers may use to ensure code comports with societal concerns. The characteristics are transparency, defaults, standards, and obligatory passage points. For each characteristic, we discuss the salient regulatory issues for manipulating code. Additionally, we provide normative proposals for modifying some characteristics, such as defaults. In sum, our analysis should aid policymakers seeking to manipulate code to ensure that code comports with our societal values and addresses our societal concerns."

Findings indicated that grandmothers appear prone to PSD, but also grandmothers seem more likely to communicate overall. By contrast, grandfathers were perceived as strategic when using PSD. Grandparents (across genders) experiencing decrement appear more likely to use PSD for control. On the positive side, the young adult study participants seemed to be open to grandparents' PSD. These findings shed light on how and why grandparents use PSD, and suggest implications for intergenerational interaction and the care of older persons within the family."

Through Kristeva's concept of intertextuality, I show how both the history of the actor and some of the most crucial questions of Italian internal policy traverse the text, situating Benigni as an engaged Left Wing comedian. In particular, I argue that, innovating within the genre of Italian TV political satire through a Bakhtinian carnivalesque coexistence of antagonistic voices and stylistics registers, Benignis performance directly addresses pressing political issues, such as the unsolved question of a growing communication monopoly and the related threat of media censorship. I conclude that the inherently dialogic structure of Benignis monologue clearly advocates the democratic coexistence of different political realities and a constructive dialogue between them."

News making is not random but patterned and socially conditioned systems for the reproduction of knowledge, which fits well with the existing power structures in U.S. society. Especially given the growing power of the corporate mainstream media in the United States, this research examines the ideological functions of news medias ""classifying out the world"" (Hall, 1978) and ""definitional control"" (Schiller, 2000). It explores the systematic news framing process, in which some occurrences are selected, given meaning, and made more salient. This study analyzes U.S. newspapers framing of the AIDS situation in Africa, in relation to drug patents there, within the context of widespread global information imbalances. The relationship between Africas AIDS situation and international regulations on drug patents is highly significant, due to the fact that formerly colonized countries are largely excluded from the benefits of scientific innovations due to the reinforcing of a ""postcolonial hierarchy,"" in terms of both world information flows and economy.
This research conceptualizes public health, specifically Africas AIDS -- the site of more than two-thirds of the worlds HIV-infected people -- as a social and historical construct bounded by postcolonial globalization. By applying such critical concepts as ""hegemony"", intellectual authority, ""habitus,"" and ""symbolic power to news framing analysis, this work examines how the AIDS-drug patent issue has been culturally and socially constructed through news discourse. It criticizes the ways in which such news reporting in mainstream U.S. newspapers depicts these complex issues and compares this reporting with alternative medias treatment of those issues."

As co-production increasingly becomes a recognized lifestyle for technology users, industry will have to change the way new technologies are produced and marketed worldwide. I argue that the TIVO digital video recorder (DVR) is being co-produced by a small but committed group of loyal home DVR enthusiasts, who use online forums to disseminate hacking tips, in order to modify this new technology. I discuss how the DVR industry has responded to user innovations through designs that allow them to re-assert control over the technology. Industry has failed to recognize the culture of co-production among DVR enthusiasts by working to subvert the network potential of new technology."

Since the advent of the Internet, some researchers have studied whether the same results are found in the new medium with content analysis of Web advertising. Contradictory answers from these studies prompted this study to question if there is a still significant cross-cultural difference in the new medium, or if the unique characteristics of the Internet override or dilute the cultural borders, with theoretical bases of Hall, Hofstede and McLuhan.
The present study also focused on a little-developed field, the cultural differences in online political strategic communication. The authors examined which theories can be applied to the new medium, using samples of twelve U.S. senator home pages and twelve Korean legislator home pages. In contrast to much previous research, this study demonstrated a need to separate the theories of Hofstede and Hall for online communication. Hofstedes individualism--collectivism distinction was not found, but Halls high- and low-context communication theory and McLuhans media technological determinism were powerful in many parts of the online political strategic communication of the U.S. senators and Korean legislators."
2004-0404,Harry Truman's reluctance in going public for national health insurance,Paper,Harry Truman's reluctance in going public for national health insurance,"Harry Truman was the first president to publicly advocate for a national health insurance program. However, he was reluctant in ""going public"" on this issue, in taking his case directly to the public, through the media. He faced enormous opposition from the American Medical Association, which mounted a multi-million dollar public campaign to defeat the proposal. Conservatives in Congress tied up any legislation that would enact the proposal. Public opinion, particularly early on, was mixed on national health insurance. For any chance of success, Truman would have to leverage public opinion to move Congress, and to counteract effects of the AMA campaign. This study found that, in general, Truman did not avail himself of the strategy of going public in his fight for national health insurance. Six Truman addresses were analyzed. His three main addresses, devoted solely to this policy, were sent to Congress in written form. In releasing the second of these, Truman held a media event that garnered significantly more coverage for the policy than did his first release. This was the only significant use of the strategy of going public found in the almost four years analyzed. In his final address, proponents were urging him to go to the radio with a speech on his proposal. Truman did not do this. He was steady in his advocacy for national health insurance; but this study concludes that, given the tremendous opposition, and more immediate priorities, Truman chose to not over-expend political capital on this issue."
2004-0405,"Health Movements, State Initiatives, and Community Mobilization:",Paper,"Health Movements, State Initiatives, and Community Mobilization:","This paper stems from research related to a forthcoming book with Indiana University Press titled, The Birth of the Global Non-Smoker: California, France, Japan. It examines three anti-smoking campaigns in the context of globalization and practices of liberal and neo-liberal arts of government in the late twentieth century. The paper focuses on the California case to look at what happens when a relatively homogenous environmental and health social movement sponsors a state health promotion campaign that not only entails extensive collaboration between civil society organizations, experts, and policy bureaucracies but also involves attempts to expand the original citizen base of the movement to wider communities and populations. It investigates modes of collaboration between different social actors, the inflection of health promotion strategies by interpretations of epidemiological data and by social marketing strategies, and the structure of the public media sphere and how it segments and amalgamates citizens and community members."
2004-0406,Hedging the frame: Toward a post-structural journalism,Paper,Hedging the frame: Toward a post-structural journalism,"The Thai currency crisis of 1997 was one of the earliest and most prominent global currency crises of the post-structural era, yet the mainstream financial press did not address issues of transnationalism and globalization in its coverage. Following a critical review of framing theory, this essay presents a textual analysis of financial news coverage of that crisis by The Financial Times of London. Frederic Jamesons concepts of cognitive mapping and the struggle for representation are considered as ways to understand how journalism might cover a post-structural world."
2004-0407,Hegemony and Theorizing in International Communication,Paper,Hegemony and Theorizing in International Communication,"The present paper critically examines theorizing in international communication. The hegemony that is characteristic of theorizing in international communication is used as a premise to critique discourses of informatization and Global Information Infrastructure that are but discourses sustaining global power relations. We start the present paper with a brief introduction to theorizing in international communication, followed by a discussion of the politics and class interests of theorists that detract any systematic inquiry and theorizing in international communication. In the context of this background a critical political economy perspective is used to analyze the discourses of informatization and the Global Information Infrastructure (GII), which end with a conclusion that questions the theorizing effort within international communication and communication in general."
2004-0408,Heuristic-Systematic Message Processing and the Effectiveness of an Intervention Video on Female Body Image,Paper,Heuristic-Systematic Message Processing and the Effectiveness of an Intervention Video on Female Body Image,"An experiment was conducted to determine the effect that message processing types, heuristic versus systematic, have on the effectiveness of an intervention video. The goal of the video was to change sociocultural beliefs and beliefs about media production, media realism, and media motives pertaining to the portrayal of female bodies. As predicted systematic processing had a greater influence on changing media beliefs than heuristic processing. In addition, it appeared that body satisfaction might act as a suppressor of both processing types on changing media beliefs. The video was ineffective at changing sociocultural beliefs. Recommendations for future health research were also noted."
2004-0409,High Recall and Low Recognition of Interactive Ads: A Limited-Capacity Exploration,Paper,High Recall and Low Recognition of Interactive Ads: A Limited-Capacity Exploration,"Does interacting with online advertisements influence the cognitive processing of ad information? While interactivity is a much-touted aspect of Web advertising (there's even a Journal of Interactive Advertising), not a single study till date has manipulated the level of interactivity in ads and experimentally determined its effects. The present investigation is an effort to address this limitation in the literature. All participants (N = 48) in a 3 (Interactivity: Low, Medium, High) x 2 (Animation: Animated, Static) x 2 (Ad Shape: Banner, Square) fully-crossed factorial within-participants experiment were exposed to 12 news-article Web pages, with one ad in each of them. Following their exposure, their free recall, cued recall, and recognition memory for ad information were assessed. Results showed that high-interactive ads result in better recall but poorer recognition than medium-interactive ads. Animated ads fared better than static ads on cued recall, while banner ads were recognized better than square ads. Several significant two-way and three-way interactions were also obtained. Interpretation of results based on the limited capacity model proposed by Lang (2000) suggests that animated square ad in the medium-interactivity condition is the point of cognitive overload, and increasing interactivity beyond that point is likely to degrade encoding of ad information."
2004-0410,Hillbilles v. Hollywood: How an Advocacy Group Influences a TV Network's Programming Decisions,Paper,Hillbilles v. Hollywood: How an Advocacy Group Influences a TV Network's Programming Decisions,"When CBS announced its hick hunt for a rural family to move into a Beverly Hills mansion and recreate the Beverly Hillbillies sitcom of the 1960s, using the new reality television genre rather than actors, a small, new non-profit advocacy organization called the Center for Rural Strategies, responded with a print advertising campaign and web site against the reality proposed in the new show. Why would CBS, the number one network in prime time and flagship of media empire Viacom (Fabrikant, 2002), care about what a few rural people thought about a show which was only in very early production stage? The purpose of this paper is to better understand how the advocacy campaign got CBS attention. The rural activists believed the CBS version of their reality was too damaging to rural people to go forward without a fight and struck the network in dual markets (Picard, 1989), through both consumer and advertisers channels. This paper will explore how the advocacy efforts of the Center for Rural Strategies introduced additional risk in CBS program portfolio. A content analysis methodology was used to more deeply under both the quantity and quality of the new coverage during the first three weeks of the campaign as a way to understand the impact of the campaign on CBS."
2004-0411,Home Language vs. Social Language,Paper,Home Language vs. Social Language,"Speaking the language of ones origin has symbolic importance for maintaining ones ethnic group identity. Drawing from sociopsychological and sociocultural perspectives, this study seeks to explore the linkages between language use, socialization, and cultural identity development in Chinese American adolescents and young adults. In particular, the phenomenon under study is the perceived benefits and costs of bilingualism in second-generation Chinese American children, who are between 12 and 21 years old. Through in-depth interviews and participant observation, this study not only confirms some previous research findings on bilingualism and biculturalism but also provides new insights in the intercultural communication field. Based on the comparison of different responses from the adolescent group and the young adult group, this study identifies a possible pattern about the process of identity development from adolescence to young adulthood. It is likely that as the adolescents move toward a more mature stage of young adulthood, their internal motivation for maintaining cultural identity becomes salient and the perceived benefits of bilingualism become more significant."
2004-0412,Homosexuality and Homophobia: Toward a Causal Model of Asexuality,Paper,Homosexuality and Homophobia: Toward a Causal Model of Asexuality,"The goal of the study was to present a general causal model of asexuality as related to other elements of sexuality (homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual) and belief structures. We used Belief Systems Theory (Hamilton & Mineo, 1996, 1999) and the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1954) to explain the impact of homophobia, religiosity, female gender, and positive relationships with gay male, lesbian, and bisexual individuals on homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual elements of sexuality, and, ultimately, on asexuality. A predominantly self-categorized heterosexual sample of college undergraduates (N = 244) was used in the study. Six elements of sexuality emerged: bisexuality, gay fantasy, gay convergence, gay act, straight fantasy, and asexuality. Homophobia and the gay act element of sexuality had a positive effect on asexuality. Female gender and positive relationships with gay male, lesbian, and bisexual individuals decreased homophobia, whereas religiosity increased it. Female gender also increased ones likelihood of becoming bisexual, whereas religiosity decreased it. Finally, straight fantasies had a negative effect on asexuality."
2004-0413,Hong Kong consumers evaluation process in the China Airlines Crash,Paper,Hong Kong consumers evaluation process in the China Airlines Crash,"The increasing globalization of business has revived the attention to the issues of culture in the public relations context. As such, public relations research and practice should call for crisis communication that is culturally-specific. In view of (1) the potential prosperous China market in the near future and (2) the continuous acceleration in the number of organizational crises in Hong Kong, the present study adopts a qualitative approach to examine Hong Kong consumers evaluation process in an organizational crisis, namelythe China Airlines crash. Thirty-one face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted. Using grounded theory as the analysis method, the present study discovers a two-staged evaluation process in Hong Kong consumers. Stage one was characterized by participants causal attribution process; whereas stage two centered at the evaluation of the organizations crisis-handling. Participants evaluation of organizational crisis handling was shown to be equally significant in affecting their causal attribution, perceived wrongfulness of the organization, final conceptualization of the organization, and final judgment. All in all, participants engaged in active, hierarchical, in-depth evaluation process of an organizational crisis. Several findings suggesting possible unique socio-cultural phenomena were discussed."
2004-0414,How Digital Technology Met Utopian Ideology: Revisiting the First Hackers' Conference,Paper,How Digital Technology Met Utopian Ideology: Revisiting the First Hackers' Conference,"In the early 1980s, computer hackers were widely depicted as anti-social and potentially criminal. By the mid-1990s however, they had become liberated information workers, freelance designers of digital networks that were, like their builders, said to be countercultural and revolutionary. Most scholarly accounts have ascribed this transformation to the popular distribution of digital technologies. This presentation however, shows that shifts in popular understandings of the Internet and its creators came about primarily through face-to-face instances of what sociologist Bennett Berger has called ideological work. Drawing on archival records of the 1984 Hackers Conference, it shows how an influential group of computer programmers, cultural entrepreneurs and technology journalists re-envisioned computers and their creators in terms of American countercultural ideals. The paper thus develops a model for thinking about the ways technologists and cultural agents collaborate in shaping popular perceptions of emerging technologies."
2004-0415,How peer influence mediates media influence on adolescent sexual behavior,Paper,How peer influence mediates media influence on adolescent sexual behavior,"Previous studies of media effects on adolescent sexuality have primarily focused on the direct effects that were explained by social learning theory or cultivation theory. This study examined an alternative model to explain that peer influence mediates media influence on adolescent sexuality. This model uses the perceptions of the influence of mass media on others as a key element to bridge media exposure, perception of peer norms and teenagers personal sexuality. It argues that perception of peer norms is the consequence of presumed media influence on peers and that perception, in turn, influences adolescent sexuality.
Data came from a paper-and-pencil survey with 213 late adolescents of 18 or 19-years old. Results generally supported the model. The findings show that: 1) adolescents attend to sex-related media and believe their peers attend to similar media content as themselves; 2) adolescents anticipate influence of the sex-related media content on their peers, and a corresponding increase of their peers sexual permissiveness; 3) perceptions of media influence on peer norms regarding sexual issues led adolescents to become more sexually permissive; and 4) the permissive sexual attitudes of adolescents predict the possibility for adolescents to engage in sexual activities."
2004-0416,How to Evaluate an Organizations Crisis-Preparedness: Development and Application of an Index,Paper,How to Evaluate an Organizations Crisis-Preparedness: Development and Application of an Index,"The purpose of this study is to develop evaluation criteria, the so-called crisis management index, that can gauge integrated crisis management capability. In particular, while most crisis management factors and models have been devised in western countries, no full-scale crisis management index outside the western hemisphere has been developed so far. The index developing process for evaluating South Korean corporations crisis preparedness can showcase how to integrate broad concepts already developed in the literature and in unique business situations in each country. The study deployed multiple research stages that allowed the study to sufficiently reflect the characteristics of crisis management. First of all, the study developed index items by embracing content validity through three research stages such as extensive literature review, in-depth interviews and professional audits. The dimensions of the index items were finalized through factor analysis. The finalized index dimensions include the organizational management strategy factor, the execution and communication factor, and the organization system and cultural factor. The index items developed for evaluating the organizations crisis-preparedness were applied to South Korean corporations and implications based on their index scores were discussed."

Neurological Hemispheric Dominance as a Discriminator of Behavioral Affection Responses,"This experiment tests the effects of brain hemispheric dominance on young adults behavioral responses to conversational partners shifts in nonverbal affection. Thirty-two individuals identified as having standard (left-brained) hemispheric dominance and 32 individuals identified as having anomalous (right-brained) hemispheric dominance interacted with trained confederates who manipulated their nonverbal affection behaviors during eight-minute laboratory interactions. Participants behaviors were coded from videotapes of the laboratory sessions. The findings indicated that, regardless of hemispheric dominance, most participants matched the behavioral changes of the confederates. Moreover, those with standard dominants showed stronger patterns of matching for increases in affectionate behavior, but not for decreases. Participants and confederates sexes both exerted moderating effects."
2004-0418,ICT Convergence and the Digital Divide: The Story of Malaysia and Singapore,Paper,ICT Convergence and the Digital Divide: The Story of Malaysia and Singapore,"Scholars have pointed out that three major innovations have given the impetus to an ongoing transformation of our economic and social environment. These historical and technological changes were the swing of electronic industries to digital technology, the large-scale marketing of personal computers and the advent of the Internet. These three changes interacted to produce Information Communication Technology (ICT) convergence and the evolution of industrial society towards an ""information society"". Cheaper transmission of information via many more communication outlets as a result of convergence will mean that ICTs will be used in increasingly many other ways by governments, commercial systems and society that had previously not been possible. So, does this mean that with advent of the age of convergence, increases in the variety of ways the same information can be access will result in the reduction of the gap in the digital divide? This paper explores the extent of convergence in Malaysia and Singapore, two countries located in South East Asia and the nature of the digital divide in both countries."
2004-0419,ICTs in the war against HIV/AIDS in Asia,Paper,ICTs in the war against HIV/AIDS in Asia,"In a short span of less than 30 years, the advent of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has brought about many social changes in contemporary societies.ICT capability has come to be seen as a vital factor in enhancing socio-economic development efforts.This is timely as many developing and middle income countries are now faced with new sets of problems in health care. Not only do they have to battle the usual problems of providing equal healthcare to all and disease eradication but there are also additional problems such as the containment of rising costs of healthcare. Thus, governments and healthcare practitioners are increasingly turning to ICTs in order to improve the efficiency of information exchange, resource distribution and integration of service capacity as studies have shown that as much as 40 percent of health care consists of information exchange.These advantages that ICTs provide have been extremely useful in the areas of infectious and communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS where healthcare workers in countries with a high incidence of HIV/AIDS are already benefiting from the Internet and e-networking. This paper is a discussion on how ICTs have been used in Asia in its battle against HIV/AIDS across nine Asian countries."
2004-0420,Identifying Determinants of Young Childrens Brand Awareness,Paper,Identifying Determinants of Young Childrens Brand Awareness,"The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the development of brand recognition and brand recall in early childhood, and (b) the relative influence of child-related (i.e., age, gender, socioeconomic status) and environmental factors (i.e., television, parents, peers) on childrens brand recognition and brand recall. We presented 196 children between 2 and 8 years of age with a series of brand logos. Childrens ability to recognize brands started significantly earlier than their ability to recall the same brands. Television viewing was a significant positive predictor of childrens brand recognition but not of their brand recall. Parental brand awareness was positively related to childrens brand recall, whereas childrens susceptibility to peer influence was related to their brand recognition."
2004-0421,Identity of newspapers,Paper,Identity of newspapers,"This article offers an instrument for describing identity of a newspaper and opens a discussion regarding the quality of a newspaper as a socius. Identity is articulated through uniqueness and the identical. Identity is operationalized through three kinds of properties: external properties, relational properties and action properties. This yields to an instrument that has been applied to four Dutch regional newspapers. The application of an instrument that measures identity, results in a description of a newspaper as a socius. The uniqueness of each of the four newspapers is expressed in external properties, in the status being given to regional news and in attention for specific information. But the identical aspects of identity exceed the uniqueness. We end this article by discussing the possibilities for regional newspapers to maintain and perform out of their own unique identity. The circumstances, in which regional newspapers have to operate, do not seem to be too promising in this respect."
2004-0422,Ideological Framing: A Comparative Analysis of South and North Koreas Newspaper Coverage of International Conflicts,Paper,Ideological Framing: A Comparative Analysis of South and North Koreas Newspaper Coverage of International Conflicts,"This study examines some of the important framing patterns in the two Koreas terrorism coverage in the U.S., and consequently, reveals how the media framing in the two Koreas is influenced by the dominant ideology in each country.

Theoretically, this study suggests that the relationship between a dominant ideology and media framing patterns has been used in both countries news coverage as a means to channel political ideology into the public and society. The results show that the Cold War frame can modulate the manner in which the media covers terrorism in the Post-Cold War era. The results, however, illustrate the apparent differences in the overall symbolic patterns. It means that the framing of the media of the two Koreas can be expected to reflect and reinforce their own dominant ideology and national interests."
2004-0423,If You Dont Have Anything Nice to Say: The Effect of Systems Breakdown on Human-Computer Interactions,Paper,If You Dont Have Anything Nice to Say: The Effect of Systems Breakdown on Human-Computer Interactions,"This study examined the effect of system breakdown on the social responses exhibited by individuals towards computers, taking predispositions such as affinity seeking into consideration. While good implementations of technologies mimicking human characteristics can generate social responses, most technologies are susceptible to breakdowns. Does a breakdown make individuals more mindful of the fact that they are not working with a social actor? Do breakdowns make salient the idea that the computer is a medium and interrupt the users orientation toward the computer as a source? It was hypothesized that more social responses will occur in the no breakdown condition than in the breakdown conditions. Frustration emerged as a significant moderator between condition and politeness. Results indicate that computer breakdowns diminish affinity and politeness towards computers when frustration, involvement and investment were controlled. Affinity-seeking did significantly affect affinity for the computer but not politeness towards it."
2004-0424,I hate my teachers: Freedom of expression and public school students personal Web sites,Paper,I hate my teachers: Freedom of expression and public school students personal Web sites,"Students in the United States have been given increasingly greater access to technology in their public schools. While legislation has been focused on protecting children from Internet content, school systems and courts have been struggling with an even more difficult issue: students' use of the Internet (particularly the Web) as an expressive tool. In this paper, I examine a number of issues: the ways in which the Internet has changed the balance between schools and students' freedom of expression; the logic that courts have used to decide free-speech cases involving ""new media"" like the Web and e-mail; and how the very public nature of the Web and Web pages continue to blur the distinctions between on and off-campus behavior. I also explore how new technologies continue to challenge the existing case law in this area.

Part one of this paper focuses on the cases that provide the foundation for decisions regarding student expression in schools. Part two creates a framework for understanding the distinctions between these cases and discusses the current case law around student use of Web sites and e-mail for expressive purposes. Finally, part three analyzes the approaches schools and courts have taken in these cases, investigates the territory that the courts have yet to cover, and proposes several recommendations for resolving this complex issue."
2004-0425,Images in a Frame: A Look at the Visual in Health Narratives,Paper,Images in a Frame: A Look at the Visual in Health Narratives,"The paper seeks to consider the influence of a visual medium on the functions of health narratives. Sharf and Vanderford (2003) offer a frame of reference for considering the functions of health narratives: sense-making; asserting control; transforming identity; warranting decisions; and, building community. This essay will follow the same framework offered by Sharf and Vanderford, and for each of the functions, considers the influence of two sets of visual images. Images from the University of Pennsylvanias Confronting Cancer Through Art exhibit and the images offered by the American Cancer Society through their web page, cancer.org were intentionally sought in an effort to provide contrasting points of view and to provide a richness for analysis and discussion. The visual medium offers health narrative what Hariman and Lucaites (2002) describe as an actual mode of participation in what could be considered a health citizenry, and through that participation, an opportunity for emotional identification with those who suffer."
2004-0426,Immediacy and Communication Skills in Distance Learning,Paper,Immediacy and Communication Skills in Distance Learning,"Previous research on instructional communication has documented the dimensions of interpersonal relationships necessary for effective instruction. As yet, these factors have not been extensively tested in distance education courses, when teacher-student communication is mediated. This study provides an initial exploration of two factors (teacher immediacy and communication skills) in two DE environments -- a freshmen level composition class and a graduate business course. Results indicate that of all factors, teachers' verbal immediacy has the most significant effects on students' motivation to study and perceived learning."
2004-0427,Immediate Gratification: The close capture of gratifications,Paper,Immediate Gratification: The close capture of gratifications,"This paper discusses the relationship between various levels of media gratifications. It proposes both an analytic and an empirical differentiation between: (1) Gratifications expected, i.e. naïve theories held by media users about the capacity of different media channels (here: World Wide Web and television). This type of gratification is depicted by traditional survey methods of uses and gratifications research. (2) Gratifications sought and obtained measured directly in the situation. It is argued that conventional survey methods capture gratifications independent of the using situation. Therefore the respondent has to remember and generalize his/her usual media behavior. This might lead to an answering bias. We propose a situational measurement by using the Experience Sampling Method that induces self-observations at random points in time. This method depicts behavior and attitudes while using mass media. Results show that the situational measurement is helpful in understanding media gratifications and in predicting media behavior."

The current study focuses on the personality factors that determine the likelihood of adoption of a technological innovation. To that end, the study distinguishes between innate or global innovativeness and context specific innovativeness. An information processing model was tested where technological innovativeness was purported to be indirectly influenced by an individuals innate innovativeness, through its impact on communication and media use behaviors. The structural model was tested on the on two separate technology clusters, and partial support was found linking sophistication in information search, prior technology ownership to technological innovativeness."

This paper examines 37 U.S. newspapers identified by Editor and Publisher as making important changes to improve their overall newspaper quality. The kinds of changes the newspapers made were categorized into improvement and expansion of local news, redesign, increase in in-depth reporting, and increases in staff. We then linked both newspaper size and the types of change made with percent changes in circulation in the five, three, and one year before the Editor and Publisher award was made. These percent changes were compared with the mean change for each newspapers circulation size group. Results show the majority of these papers were beating the comparators. Staff increases and increase in size of the local news hole had the most consistent positive effect on circulation, although only daily, not on Sunday. Results are discussed in terms of media economics theory."
2004-0430,In a Different World: The Ethic of Care and Pragmatic Contradictions in Feminist Research in a Women's Prison,Paper,In a Different World: The Ethic of Care and Pragmatic Contradictions in Feminist Research in a Women's Prison,"Following the precepts of the ethic of care identified by Carol Gilligan (1982) and others, feminist communication researchers often play active roles in helping marginalized groups and communities to work for political and social justice. But in some contexts, no matter how caring we feel, feminist researchers run up against confounding pragmatic and ethical questions that challenge our efforts to create new ways of knowing and interacting. In 2001, the authors began teaching journalism classes at a state prison for women in the northeastern United States. Through a combination of teaching and research carried out according to the principles of care, we hoped to offer literacy, vocational and social benefits to the women serving time in the prisons minimum- and maximum-security units and to empower them to claim their own voices by writing, editing and publishing their own prison newspaper. Over the last two years, we have found the social construct of the prison to be a central player in our work, an entity intent on disrupting situations of caring and reciprocity whenever they occur. This paper uses participant observation and interpretive textual analysis to illuminate the multi-layered paradoxes that arise when feminist scholars pursue the ethic of care in a prison setting."
2004-0431,(In)attentiveness in Group Therapy Sessions: An Exploration of Goffmans Concept of Involvement,Paper,(In)attentiveness in Group Therapy Sessions: An Exploration of Goffmans Concept of Involvement,"This paper explores Goffmans (1963) concept of involvement, its many variations, and its signs in the ethnographic data of group therapy sessions of female clients in a drug and alcohol treatment program. The program counselors attempted to control the situational order such that the clients main involvement was displaying attentiveness to the group therapy session itself. The rules were emphasized to impose attentiveness as the main involvement. Clients who were deviant in their involvement received negative sanctions. Thus, this paper examines how clients displayed (in)attention and (dis)interest within the social occasion and how these displays were recognized, interpreted, and responded to by the group members."
2004-0432,Increasing the Participation of Non-dominant Cultural Groups in Public Dialogue: Development Communication Experiences in North America,Paper,Increasing the Participation of Non-dominant Cultural Groups in Public Dialogue: Development Communication Experiences in North America,"Cultural diversity in New Mexico, the United States and in Canada, coupled with the increasing movement of peoples around the world, presents communication scholars with many practical challenges in intercultural communication. The present study investigates, through a grounded theory methodology, communication structures that increase the representation non-dominant groups in public dialogue and decision-making processes of the dominant North American culture. Community members whose cultural background does not utilize the same values and ways of communicating as those which are predominant in North America are expected to assimilate to a process where the voicing of personal opinion is expected, where time constraints are more important than group cohesion, and where competition and the desire to win is valued. The findings indicate communication structures centered on relationship initiation, building and development, as being those that enjoy long term success. Issues that require further theorizing and investigation are also identified."

The model was tested using data collected from 13 intact work groups in 5 organizations via LISREL. The research strongly supported our hypotheses in the revised model, and partially supported the pattern of relationships found in earlier studies on individual action component of collective action models."
2004-0434,"Inequity, Attraction, and Relational Involvement in Workplace Friendships",Paper,"Inequity, Attraction, and Relational Involvement in Workplace Friendships","Equity theory indicates that people feel distress in the face of inequity in their relationships. In other words, people should be generally satisfied with equitable relationships and not satisfied with inequitable relationships. We applied this prediction by testing perceptions of liking and relational involvement in underrewarding, equitable, and overrewarding blended friendships, which involve both interaction of coworkers at work (task dimension) and outside of work (social dimension). Both liking and relational involvement were found to be lower in underreward and overreward situations versus equitable situations. However, whether the inequity was in the task dimension versus the social dimension of the blended friendship had only a small effect on liking and no effect on involvement. These findings are consistent with equity theory predictions, and can be applied in organizational settings as well as social settings."
2004-0435,Infants and Toddlers Attention to Television: A Home Observation Study,Paper,Infants and Toddlers Attention to Television: A Home Observation Study,"The aim of this home observation study was to investigate how young childrens attention to television content is influenced by program difficulty, program features, and age of the child. We presented fifty 6- to 58-month-olds with a 38-min videotape consisting of segments of the news, Sesame Street, Teletubbies, Lion King II, and a block of commercials aimed at children and adults. The videotape was divided into 64 scenes, which were analyzed on 36 auditory, visual, and content features. For each scene, we coded how much attention it attracted. Our results showed that attention to the scenes was influenced by program difficulty, program features, and age of the child. Among the 6- to 18-month-olds, Teletubbies attracted the most attention, whereas among the older age groups (19- to 35-month-olds, 36- to 48-month-olds, and 49- to 58-month-olds), Sesame Street, the childrens commercials, and Lion King II attracted the most attention."
2004-0436,Influence of Cigarette Promotion on Adolescent Susceptibility to Smoking: A Structural Equation Model,Paper,Influence of Cigarette Promotion on Adolescent Susceptibility to Smoking: A Structural Equation Model,"This study investigates the link between exposure to cigarette promotion and adolescent susceptibility to smoking. Using a structural equation modeling, the direct, indirect and total effect of exposure to and participation in cigarette promotion was assessed. The data used for this study were collected through a self-administered survey of 12,290 7th through 12th grade students in Tucson, Arizona in 1996 and 1998. Results show that participation in cigarette promotion has a direct effect on increased smoking susceptibility controlling for personal and behavioral factors. It also has a significant indirect effect on susceptibility via positive social images. This study supports the concerns that cigarette promotion contributes to the long-term process of accepting and internalizing positive images of smoking and to the eventual uptake of smoking among adolescents. As such, a more comprehensive restriction on cigarette promotion is warranted."
2004-0437,"Influences, Usage, And Outcomes Of Internet Health Information Searching: Multivariate Results From Selected Pew Surveys",Paper,"Influences, Usage, And Outcomes Of Internet Health Information Searching: Multivariate Results From Selected Pew Surveys","This paper analyses four major datasets from the Pew Project to answer two primary questions: What influences people to seek online health information, and what influences their perceived outcomes from having access to this information? Some aspects of the digital divide associated with general Internet usage are also associated with health seeking; however, they are fewer, less powerful, and in many cases no longer influences once they are considered in a multivariate fashion. More exposure to Internet usage (typically between years 2 and 3), and to other Internet activities, seem to be consistent factors explaining health seeking. Several individual health concerns, and seeking information about sensitive topics that might be difficult to talk about with others (including one's doctor) influence using the Internet for health information seeking. Social activities with friends and family foster more health seeking, indicating that Internet health information may be stimulated by or contribute to group social capital.
Outcomes from searching for Internet health information are predicted by health information seeking, other Internet activities, time since first going online, and number of specific health-related searches. Some of the social capital measures also influenced outcomes, such as group sociability, and participating in online support groups. Credibility, difficulties in gaining access to a doctor, looking for sensitive topics that are difficult to talk about, and making one's own diagnoses also played a role, depending on the nature of the outcome."
2004-0438,Informational Utility Effects on Selective Exposure to Good and Bad News: A Cross-Cultural Investigation,Paper,Informational Utility Effects on Selective Exposure to Good and Bad News: A Cross-Cultural Investigation,"Selective exposure to Internet news articles was hypothesized to increase with higher informational utility of the news, as defined by the informational-utility model. Consistent with the model, utility was defined according to the dimensions of magnitude, likelihood, and immediacy of consequences. Data were collected in different cultural settings to investigate the cross-continental robustness of the predictions, and both positive and negative news reports were examined, as the model pertains to reports on opportunities and threats. The computer-based experiment used a 2x3x2 design, in which utility intensity (low vs. high) and utility dimension (magnitude, likelihood, and immediacy) were manipulated. Country (US vs. Germany) was incorporated as a moderating variable. Exposure time to experimentally manipulated online news articles was unobtrusively recorded and used as a repeated measure. The findings show that increased informational utility, manipulated by dimension intensity, led to increased selective exposure to both negative and positive news, regardless of cultural setting."
2004-0439,Information Processing by E-mail: An Examination of Multiple Dimensions of,Paper,Information Processing by E-mail: An Examination of Multiple Dimensions of,"Electronic mail (e-mail) has become one of the most prominent communication media in the office. Today, substantial information is processed by e-mail. Organizations were traditionally viewed as information processing systems facing uncertainty. Yet, information processing in the contemporary office entails both uncertainty and equivocality reduction. Uncertainty can be reduced by an increase in the amount of information, whereas equivocality can be reduced by richer qualitative information. Building upon the concept of equivocality reduction, media richness theory was developed. The theory suggests that the characteristics of media determine the ability of equivocality reduction. According to the theory, lean e-mail can maximize performance only for less equivocal tasks. Yet, e-mail is also used for equivocal tasks in the actual workplace. In addition, e-mail has been increasing the total volume of communication. In this study, eight dimensions of communication satisfaction were examined among a total of 303 university employees considering the two critical dimensions of information processing: uncertainty and equivocality."
2004-0440,Information Reception Apprehension and Information from Technology Aversion: Development and Test of a New Construct,Paper,Information Reception Apprehension and Information from Technology Aversion: Development and Test of a New Construct,"In technologically advanced societies and cultures, information acquisition from information technologies is a part of daily life. Human, psychologically detrimental aspects of this process were examined. Previous measurement and research related to computer and information anxieties revealed some of the nature of the difficulties, as well as direct measurement concerns. The construct of Informational Reception Apprehension (Wheeless, Preiss, & Gayle, 1997) and existing scales provided the bases for developing a new foundation for measuring and assessing these difficulties. Long and short versions of a new Information Reception Apprehension Test for Information Technology (IRAT-IT)were developed and tested in relation to computers, Internet service, and time-on-line. Richer assessment of underlying difficulties drawn for a more receiver-oriented perspective resulted in reliable and valid scales that meaningfully related this type of information reception apprehension to information-from-technology aversive behaviors. Suggested use in technologically advanced and technologically emerging cultures was recommended."

The academic structure for creating and conducting applied community health communication research using current theoretical frameworks is explained. Three empirical projects, increasing community seatbelt use, examining conscientiousness and campus safety behaviors, and increasing cervical cancer screening among college women, are described in detail.
Suggestions for future interventions integrated with general health communication classes are explored. But the overarching outcome is that even with low financial resource significant change can be achieved in health related outcomes, while simultaneously introducing students to health communication and social science procedures."

An empirical study of the consequences of participating in MRULE, an innovative race relations program promoting interactional diversity is reported. A three-group quazi experiment (N = 164) was designed to assess how participation in the program affected salience, knowledge, attitudes and overt behaviors related to race. Results suggest that students in the program hold significantly more positive attitudes, express interracial behaviors more frequently, and possess more accurate knowledge regarding issues related to race in comparison to the control participants, and that these improvements were more than mere self selection. The implications of these findings are discussed."
2004-0443,Interactive E-Commerce: Promoting Consumer Efficiency or Consumer Impulsivity?,Paper,Interactive E-Commerce: Promoting Consumer Efficiency or Consumer Impulsivity?,"Previous research established that online shopping activity might be caused by impulse as much as by rational thinking about the conveniences of e-commerce. Certain interactive features of e-commerce sites, such as email alerts of special offers and clickable product arrays, may stimulate impulsive activity by undermining consumer self-regulation, but this connection has not been empirically verified. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to model the relationship of interactive e-commerce features to online buying activity with a sample of 175 college students. Recreational shopping orientation predicted the usage of interactive shopping features thought to promote impulsive purchases, increasing deficient self-regulation, and leading to increased online buying activity. Convenience shopping orientation had a direct impact on buying activity but it did not influence buying activity through the usage of convenience shopping features. However, Internet shoppers with convenience shopping orientations also utilized impulsive features, establishing a possible mechanism through which online shopping for convenience might become a lure for impulsive buying behavior. Overall, fifty-two percent of the variance in online buying activity was explained by this model."
2004-0444,Interactivity and Persuasion: Influencing Attitudes with Information and Involvement,Paper,Interactivity and Persuasion: Influencing Attitudes with Information and Involvement,"The recent arrival of interactive messaging/marketing units (IMUs), which allow Web users to navigate within an advertisement, begs the question: Does interacting with an advertisement enhance its persuasive appeal? How does interactivity compare with other structural features of online ads such as animation and ad shape? A 3 (Interactivity: Low, Medium, High) x 2 (Animation: Animated, Static) x 2 (Ad Shape: Banner, Square) fully-crossed factorial within-participants experiment was conducted to explore these questions. All participants (N = 48) were exposed to 12 news-article Web pages, with one ad in each of them. Following each Web page, they recorded their attitudes toward the ad and the product in it. Results show not only that the level of interactivity is positively associated with ad and product attitudes, but also that it interacts with animation and ad shape in complex ways to influence the persuasion process. Implications for theory and technology are discussed."
2004-0445,Interactivity in Society: Towards a Theory of an Elusive Concept,Paper,Interactivity in Society: Towards a Theory of an Elusive Concept,"Interactivity has been identified as a core concept of new media, yet despite nearly three decades of study and analysis, we scarcely know what interactivity is, let alone what it does, and have scant insight into the conditions in which interactive processes are likely to be consequential for members of a social system. This paper argues that the study of interactivity has been stunted by the lack of a coherent theory of interactivity to explain what the concept is good for and how the phenomenon operates in society. The analysis attempts to address this deficiency by critiquing three self-defeating tendencies and an erroneous assumption of interactivity research, then proposes five basic propositions around which systematic knowledge regarding interactivity in society may be built. In the spirit of bridging mass and interpersonal processes, a model of interactivity is proposed to initiate discussion about the concept as a cross-level and multivalent phenomenonone with both positive and negative consequencesand to spur more socially relevant research."

One of the weaknesses of research in this area is the lack of multiple cultural perspectives. Based on a pilot study (Arasaratnam & Doerfel, 2003) that involved 37 participants from fifteen different countries, a preliminary model of ICC was constructed. A second study was conducted to test the model. Data were collected using a survey instrument (N = 473) to evaluate each component of the model. ICC was evaluated using intercultural scenarios. Model testing was done using a series of regression analyses. The results mostly supported the proposed model of ICC. The implications of one of the first models of ICC based on multiple cultural perspectives, and directions for future research are discussed"
2004-0447,Intercultural encounters in the global transmission of news. Perception and production of cultural images,Paper,Intercultural encounters in the global transmission of news. Perception and production of cultural images,"Our society is suffused with news images and texts. This article explores the strategies of international news producers who work in the cultural space between the global and the national. It is found that international news producers have developed special competences in intercultural communication. They employ a reflexive hunch in their selection and production of international stories. Their competence of both knowing international affairs and knowing elements of identification themes of their receiving audience are essential in the framing of international news information and an important element in the process of translating international events to home audiences. Observation and interviews with 40 news producers at Japanese national broadcast stations explores the ability of news producers to use their cultural knowledge to frame international information. The choice of words and visuals in this framing process depends on international personal experience. It also depends on the national media environment, and on organisational and professional factors and actors. With a point of departure in previous communication models, the article proposes a new model that enables understanding of the perception and production of cultural images in international news mediation. The model takes the global, the national, the organisational and the professional levels of influence into account."
2004-0448,Intermedia Agenda-setting of Online Wire Service,Paper,Intermedia Agenda-setting of Online Wire Service,"This study examined the intermedia agenda-setting effects between online wire service and online major newspapers in South Korea in terms of four dimensions of newsworthiness and found that online wire service influenced the news agenda of major online newspapers. Four dimensions of newsworthiness were deviance, social significance, timeliness, and proximity. The amount of wire top stories used by each newspaper was 39.04 percent of 339 stories for the online Chosun Ilbo and 32.58 percent of 339 stories for the online JoonAng Ilbo. Two online newspapers followed the sources and tones of high newsworthy wire top stories without any further change, supporting the transmission of sources and tones from online wire service to online newspapers. This study also found that newsworthiness was a key predictor for the usage of wire top stories by online newspapers. The higher newsworthy wire top stories were, the more likely online newspapers used them."

Results showed that more than half of the press releases were used by the newspapers. Among these, nearly half were used in stories with headlines favorable to Saudi Arabia, half in stories positive to the country, and some quoted in front page stories. The majority of the press release was quoted for journalistic fairness. It was concluded that the press releases were used in a way favorable to the country. The possible reasons for the press releases high odds of entering the major press include the conflict nature of the event, Saudi Arabias capital-intensive campaign, and the synergistic effect of other campaign strategies. The findings and methodology of the research contributes to the literature of international media relations."
2004-0450,International Communication from Culture to Hybridity,Paper,International Communication from Culture to Hybridity,"ABSTRACT
International Communication from Culture to Hybridity

This paper examines the trope of hybridity in international communication. Hybridity emerged in the post-cultural imperialism malaise of the 1990s as a marker of a new pluralism ostensibly critical of the dominance perspective. The cultural imperialism thesis tended to focus on cultural homogeneity as a dimension of hegemony. In contrast, proponents of hybridity purport to focus on cultural fusion as a manifestation of pluralism. After addressing the use of culture in international communication and the interdisciplinary rise of the notion of hybridity, this paper revisits the correspondence between the homogeneity-fusion and dominance-pluralism. It concludes that an understanding of culture as synthetic, and not holistic, would be a heuristic development, but that hybridity is not necessarily post-hegemonic."
2004-0451,Internationalism In Times of Hate: Anti-Racist Campaigns in European Football and in the USA After September 11,Paper,Internationalism In Times of Hate: Anti-Racist Campaigns in European Football and in the USA After September 11,"This paper uses as its point of departure Iriyes conceptualization and history of internationalism to make the case that campaigns to discursively construct an internationalist ethic have become a popular means of responding to international crises deemed to originate in racial hatred and ethnocentrism. The two case studies being compared are those of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) and the American Ad Council. Iriye defines internationalism as an idea, a movement, or an institution that seeks to reformulate the nature of relations among nations through cross-national cooperation and interchange (Iriye, 1997, p. 3). The specific form of internationalism called cultural internationalism Iriye defines as a variety of activities undertaken to link countries and peoples through the exchange of ideas and persons, through scholarly cooperation, or through efforts at facilitating cross-national understanding. Cultural internationalists believe that such activities maintain international peace. Iriye says the phenomenon originated in the late 1800s in North America and Europe to counteract the seemingly endless preoccupation of the great powers with military strengthening and colonial domination. Its popularity as an ethic has steadily grown over the last 100 years, and the most visible examples of that include the League of Nations, the United Nations system, and the growth in a number of practices, such as international student exchanges and international professional associations and conferences. However, the persistence of international war and inter-ethnic violence and other forms of hostility show that internationalism is still very much a work in progress. For its supporters it is an essential ethic if there is to be world peace. It has been the theme of mass media and education campaigns created in the wake of racial conflict that has plagued European football in recent years and of those media campaigns in the United States after the 2001 terror attacks. However, this paper scrutinizes the dynamic of how these campaigns are conceived and executed to question whether the motivation for such projects is mass persuasion (conversion of a mass of people to the logic of internationalism) or mass symbolism (demonstrating to the mass public that the sponsoring entity is itself not racist). The paucity of academic effects research on mass persuasion campaigns to change racial attitudes, the haste in launching such campaigns, and the failure to base such campaigns on in-depth planning are among the factors isolated for careful attention. This paper is part of the second phase of a multi-year project on the role of strategic communication programs in international relations. The first phase ran from 1998 to 2002 and resulted in the book Global Lies? Propaganda, the UN and World Order (London: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2003)  the first comprehensive analysis of the origins and ecology of the United Nations' public information program conducted by a scholar independent of the United Nations Secretariat."
2004-0452,International Student Perceptions of US Teacher Self-disclosure,Paper,International Student Perceptions of US Teacher Self-disclosure,"Employing a phenomenological approach, eight international students were interviewed, both individually and in focus groups, to ascertain their experiences with and perceptions of native US teacher self-disclosure. Findings revealed that both verbal and nonverbal cues were indicative of self-disclosure for international students. Relative to other clusters (verbal, verbal + nonverbal), students relied more heavily on nonverbal cues alone in making inferences about the teacher. Speaker intentionality was attributed to nonverbal as well as verbal behaviors.

Students identified that both verbal and nonverbal disclosures affected their acquisition of concepts and motivation to learn. Self-disclosure was perceived to enhance teacher credibility as well as student-teacher relationships in the classroom. Implications are drawn for US native teachers of culturally diverse classrooms. Limitations of the current definition of self-disclosure are discussed and a definition that re-incorporates nonverbal is proposed."
2004-0453,Internet and the Uses of Uses and Gratifications,Paper,Internet and the Uses of Uses and Gratifications,"The objective of this study is to identify a small number of relatively homogeneous groups of Internet users, based on their usage patterns and thereby reconstruct underlying needs. Uses and Gratifications is used as a starting point for an online questionnaire (N=2424) that was conducted. Cluster-analysis and logistic regression were used for data-analysis. Results show that the internet users in our sample consist of a large group that more or less conducts the same online activities. Consequently it is difficult to distinguish between groups of people based on patterns of behavior. Also demographical and other characteristics do not lead to a clear interpretation of internet uses or underlying needs. This leads to the theoretical relevance of this research: we must question whether it is possible to deduct needs based on actual usage patterns. The lessons that practitioners such as service providers can learn from this is that Internet users are not as predictable as one might like them to be."
2004-0454,Internet connectedness and civic engagement: A multilevel approach,Paper,Internet connectedness and civic engagement: A multilevel approach,"The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between individuals Internet connection and neighborhood engagement (composed of neighborhood belonging, neighborhood collective efficacy, and scope of civic participation) from a communication infrastructure perspective (Ball-Rokeach, Kim, & Matei, 2002). This study introduces two new concepts: (1) individuals integrated connection to neighborhood storytelling network which is composed of local media connection, participation in community organizations and interpersonal conversation with neighbors about neighborhood; and (2) Internet connectedness measuring the quality of Internet connection. Based on telephone interviews with 585 residents randomly selected from a suburban city in Los Angeles County, we found that three groups based on Internet connectedness  high, low, and non Internet connectors  have different levels of scope of civic participation. The high Internet connectors participate in a broader scope of civic actions than the other groups. In terms of neighborhood belonging, low Internet connectors show lower level of neighborhood belonging than high Internet connectors and non connectors. There was no significant difference among the three groups in terms of collective efficacy. More importantly, this study found a clear interaction effect of Internet connectedness and integrated connection to neighborhood storytelling network on civic engagement. Among Individuals with higher level of connection to neighborhood storytelling network, Internet connectedness has a positive effect on each of the three civic engagement variables while it has a negative effect on them among those with lower level of connection to storytelling network."
2004-0455,Internet Law and Defamation,Paper,Internet Law and Defamation,"The law of libel, as applied to the Internet in Korea, is still relatively undeveloped, given the uniqueness of the Internet as the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed. The Internet defies national boundaries that traditionally governed publication, while challenging the distinction between public and private communications.
This paper examines Internet libel law in South Korea. Its working premise is that an in-depth analysis of libel law issues in cyberspace in Korea will likely add to a comparative outlook on mass communication law and regulations. The first part of the paper focuses on various libel laws of Korea, whether they relate directly or indirectly to defamation on the Internet. The papers second part is devoted to discussing several court cases, including the 2002 landmark case of the Constitutional Court, which involved cyberlibel. The last section of this paper offers the authors critical analysis of the Korean governments legislative and judicial experimentation with balancing freedom of expression with reputational interests in cyberspace."
2004-0456,Internet Privacy and Institutional Trust: Insights From a National Survey,Paper,Internet Privacy and Institutional Trust: Insights From a National Survey,"Marketers, media firms, other businesses and governments increasingly interact with internet users in ways that involve retrieval of information. Surveys conducted over the past few years indicate that a large majority of American adults is worried about websites taking information from them without their request. Resisting advocacy-group demands for government regulation, major organizations with stakes in the online world have insisted that self-regulation will work. They argue that members of the public should trust them to respect peoples information wishes as well as to help people learn how to protect their information privacy on their sites.
What does the U.S. public believe about the credibility of institutional actors when it comes to protecting information privacy online? This study addresses the question from a perspective developed by sociologists of environmental risk, using results of a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,200 adults who go online at home. A key finding is that these internet users believe that major corporate or government institutions will both help them protect information privacy and take that privacy away by disclosing information to others without permission. Equally curious is that a persons fear of losing control of personal information because of the web is associated positively with both a trust and a lack of trust that the institutional actors will protect their information. Our findings raise questions that reach to the core of the publics relationship to battles over the reality of the online risks and the assigning of blame for those risks."

In this paper, I take as my beginning point the self and describe how appropriate Internet behavior may improve the self and social in the physical landscape. In carving out what it means to have a healthy electronic identity  a digital self  versus an unhealthy electronic identity  a persona  I argue that there are appropriate ways to conceive the Internet, illustrate the role of technology in contributing to unhealthy electronic identity, and discuss how the Internet provides a forum for an unhealthy ethic of physical self to reinforce itself. I offer examples of digital self and personae and discuss how an electronic identity becomes a digital self, arguing that we must redefine what it means to be a liberated self."
2004-0458,Interpersonal Cognitive Differentiation and Romantic Jealousy Experience and Expression,Paper,Interpersonal Cognitive Differentiation and Romantic Jealousy Experience and Expression,"The present study examined interpersonal cognitive differentiation as an antecedent to jealousy experience and expression. Individuals with higher levels of cognitive complexity reported experiencing more affective jealousy and less cognitive jealousy, and reported responding to jealousy differently than their lower complexity counterparts. Specifically, cognitive differentiation was positively associated with jealousy responses that focused on the needs of both relational partners and negatively associated with five of seven jealousy responses that focused primarily on the needs of the jealous individual. Consistent with previous jealousy research, cognitive and affective jealousy experience predicted responses to jealousy."

This technique is comprised of a subtle, odd element in a typical scripted request, the disruption, followed by a persuasive phrase, the reframing. Based on the thought-disruption hypothesis (Petty & Wegener, 1999), we argued that its impact is generalizable across interpersonal selling situations and that disrupting a conventional sales script not only increases the impact of the new reframing, but also increases susceptibility to influence resulting from other persuasion techniques embedded in the influence setting. Two experiments provided support for our expectations. Exp. 1 (N = 80) showed that the DTR technique fostered compliance with both commercial and non-profit sales scripts. The results of Exp. 2 (N = 75) replicated this finding and supported the thought-disruption hypothesis: the impact of brand familiarity was larger under DTR as opposed to control conditions. The theoretical and practical implications will be discussed."

A 95-item survey, consisting of the FIRO-Behavior Scale developed by William Schutz in 1958 and a self-constructed Internet use scale, is administered to 100 students from the Communication Studies Research Participant Pool at a large midwest university. Findings show that Internet users with greater needs for inclusion are less likely to visit chat rooms and those with greater needs for affection are less likely to participate in online mating and dating services. The need for inclusion highly correlated with the need for affection. In addition, when assessing gender differences in the areas of interpersonal needs and Internet behavior, females scored higher in needs for inclusion and affection than males, and males reported greater information seeking motives online than females."

It reports on the conceptualization of interpretive complexity, and the operationalization of one aspect of complexity; differentiation. Elements of the Thought-Listing Technique and Domain Analysis were used to construct a method with which subjects verbalized thoughts concurrent with watching television news can be measured and analyzed. A small scale study was conducted to illustrate the method and assess its value. Results indicate that the method is able to discriminate between subjects with varying levels of differentiation of their interpretation of the news. Steps for improvement of the method as well as suggestions for implementation in future research are discussed."

Does relevance have the potential of alleviating this negative affect? Do they shape only attitudes toward the ad, or also perceptions of the Websites hosting them? A study (N = 44) was conducted to answer these questions, by investigating whether perceptions of Website credibility vary as a function of the type of interstitials present on a Website (pop-up vs pop-under) and their relevance to the Website content. Specifically, a 2 (Relevance) X 2 (Interstitials) between-participants experiment was conducted in order to determine perceptions of credibility of the Website and attitudes toward the ad. Results indicate that while interstitial type did not seem to have strong influence on evaluations of the ads and of the Website, their relevance played a crucial role in perceptions of both the ads and of the credibility of the Website hosting the ads."

As the nature of welfare transformed to include non-white recipients, the perception of welfare recipients as single ""worthy white widows"" was replaced by the ""lazy African-American breeders."" The purpose of this research was to examine how television news may have appropriated this negative image in its coverage of the major legislative change in the federal welfare system that took place in the United States during the 1990s. To conduct this research, news stories presented by the major U.S. television networks from 1993 to 2000 were examined. The analysis showed that news stories tended to depict the typical welfare recipient as being female and black. Furthermore, this black female was often shown as responsible for her welfare status, with little acknowledgement of structural forces or the environment in which she lives."
2004-0464,"In the Name of Public Interest: Communication, Mediation and Regulation on TV Violence in Canada",Paper,"In the Name of Public Interest: Communication, Mediation and Regulation on TV Violence in Canada","In this paper I will question the traditional ways researchers, particularly in the field of television research, think about links between society and its objects. Too often, researchers reproduce the old dichotomy between technological determinism and social determinism, even if they recognize an unsatisfactory and reductionist character of these modes of explanation. In spite of that, and due to the omnipresence of the media in our lives (and the fears that sometimes come with it), special cultural policies are built on the recognized expertise of the academic field and applied in the name of public interest. My central objective is to propose a special approach to mediation which allows us to go beyond the dualities and to interrogate differently the links between objects and individuals. Specifically, I will show how this approach gives us a new look on the old issue of television violence and a better understanding of what we call public interest."
2004-0465,"Intimate Expertise: Authority, Anti-Professionalism, and the Personal in Dr. Phil's Public Persona",Paper,"Intimate Expertise: Authority, Anti-Professionalism, and the Personal in Dr. Phil's Public Persona","When a professional uses the mass media to communciation with a large, non-professional audience, it raises special considerations regarding the assertion of authority. In this situation, the expert attempts to assert authority largely through the use of strategic self-identification. This paper examines how a particularly successful popular expertDr. Philasserts authority. Dr. Phils strategic self-identification is carried out with a consistent concern for always offering the audience a complimentary role assignment. He relates to the audience not so much as an expert who is above the audience, but as someone whose commonality with the audience puts him above all other experts. This can be seen in the ambivalent posture that Dr. Phil asserts vis a vis the profession of psychology. Though he stops short of completely rejecting the profession of psychology, he bases much of his authoritative self-presentation on the explicit rejection of professional routine. This opposition to professionalism is matched with strategies that play up the personal dimension of his relationship with his audience. Concluding note s suggest that this approach to authority offers a new way to understand the ascendance of a supposed ""therapeutic culture"". It also allows us to compare Dr. Phils rhetorical strategies with those of other popular psychologists. Finally, I suggest that the idea of ""media-derived authority"" has a particular relevance concerning the shape of the intellectual field."
2004-0466,Into Interactivity? How News Websites Use Interactive Features,Paper,Into Interactivity? How News Websites Use Interactive Features,"Forty three websites nominated for the Online Journalism Awards by the Online News Association in 2002 were content analyzed using a six-dimensional conceptualization of interactivity. The researcher placed special emphasis on the distinction between medium and human interactivity dimensions. Results show that the nominated websites used medium interactivity dimensions extensively but showed more resistance toward medium-human and human interactivity dimensions. However, overall, the websites displayed moderate to significant amounts of interactivity. While the human interactivity dimensions are still lacking and market forces still appear to dictate the decisions about how a website should or can be presented, the findings from this study suggest that the news industry is slowly sharing their control and power of news delivery with the audience."
2004-0467,Intramedia Mediation Effects in Political Communication,Paper,Intramedia Mediation Effects in Political Communication,"This study focuses on intramedia mediation and the indirect media effects that stem from relationships that exist among various forms of media use. These indirect effects are too often overlooked in the study of political communication. Combined 1992, 1996, and 2000 ANES data (N = 6006) is used to assess a mutually reinforcing, positive reciprocal relationship between television and newspaper public affairs use. This reciprocal relationship is found to exist, and, subsequently, each type of mass communication use is a significant mediator of the other as both relate to this studys criterion variable, voter issue knowledge. An analysis of intramedia mediation in coordination with the study of the direct effects of public affairs media use produces larger total media influences on the criterion variable. Thus, the study of intramedia mediation is an essential element to better understanding the diverse roles of media in a host of political communication contexts. Ramifications for these findings are outlined and future lines of research summarized."
2004-0468,"Inventional Capacity: Conceptualization, Operationalization, and Findings",Paper,"Inventional Capacity: Conceptualization, Operationalization, and Findings","Inventional capacity is the number of things a person can think of to say in a given situation. The concept is explained, and related to both traditional rhetorical theory and contemporary message production work. The bulk of the paper consists of eight studies, including five distinct data collections. Cumulated, the investigations show that inventional capacity is a cognitive ability variable. It is not related to likely trait measures, such as argumentativeness or verbal aggressiveness. It is associated with several measures of academic ability, two measures of creativity, and interpersonal construct differentiation. It shows little situational variability. Repertorial contents consist largely of argument-related items, and have roughly the same level of politeness from the beginning of the repertoire to the end. The self-rated usualness of the items is highest for the first-listed items, and declines through the series."
2004-0469,Investigating Cultural Differences in Advertising Creative Strategy,Paper,Investigating Cultural Differences in Advertising Creative Strategy,"This paper will attempt to explain how lacuna theory can be beneficial to international advertising research. The term lakune was brought up in Russia in the 19th century, however, it did not become a central concept until the next century. In the 1970s, J.A. Sorokin discovered the lacuna model and developed it within the framework of Russian ethno-psycholinguistics. Lacunas are gaps, holes, spaces in texts, which seem to hold a cultural specific piece of information. Non-members of cultural groups, encounter lacunas quite often. For example, when eating individuals display a certain etiquette. Perhaps, they will cover their legs with a napkin or maybe they will serve the person next to them before serving themselves. There are many ways of displaying etiquette within different cultures. Not everyone understands the etiquette mannerisms to be considered polite behavior. If one is formally educated then perhaps he or she will find the etiquette of another displeasing. When a non-member of a cultural group finds a situation, an object, or an activity to be unusual or strange then he or she has encountered a lacuna. The authors believe that lacuna theory could have a large impact on the future of international advertising research as it relates to creative strategy and decisions pertaining to the standardization vs. adaptation debate. The theory itself will first be explained, what will follow will be the classifications of various lacunas, and finally a recent lacuna study will be reviewed to showing the application potential of the lacuna model."

This study recruited twenty online chatters in Taiwan with at least 2-year online chatting experience as research targets and employed qualitative interviews to solicit information about online interpersonal deception. It found that (1) most interviewees reported that they once deceived strangers or intimate others online, and vice versa; (2) their motive of deceiving intimate others was reported only for fun whereas the motives of deceiving strangers were for fun and/or preventing himself/herself from being hurt mentally; (3) interviewees indicated they could detect others online interpersonal deception easily whereas their deceptions were seldom detected by others; (4) online interpersonal deception would not affect the relationships between people with an intimate social tie. However, the outcomes of online interpersonal deception between two strangers were associated with their attitudes about being deceived. Those who took online interpersonal deception seriously would like to stop chatting and took a revenge whereas people who chatted online only for fun would ignore the online interpersonal deception."
2004-0471,Investigating NASA's intergroup decision-making: Groupthink and intergroup social dynamics,Paper,Investigating NASA's intergroup decision-making: Groupthink and intergroup social dynamics,"On August 26, 2003 the members of the independent panel investigating the February 1, 2003 Columbia shuttle explosion released their report and recommendation to the public. The report focused not only on the physical cause for the accident, a large piece of foam that tore into the shuttle wing, it describes a dysfunctional intergroup culture of decision-making at NASA. The information made public through the investigation report, press and television interviews, and various other reports available through the media provides convincing evidence that NASA has a culture where groupthink flourishes. Groupthink is a term coined by Irving Janis to describe a phenomenon of faulty decision-making. This occurs when a group is deeply involved in a cohesive in-group and the members' striving for unanimity override their motivation to rationally appraise alternative courses of action. The evidence of an on-going culture of groupthink at NASA is investigated by comparing different reports produced through independent panels that reported on the Columbia shuttle disaster."
2004-0472,Involvement with Favorite Television Performers as a Predictor of Hopelessness and Loneliness among the Elderly,Paper,Involvement with Favorite Television Performers as a Predictor of Hopelessness and Loneliness among the Elderly,"The present study examined viewer involvement by investigating the relationships between identification, wishful identification, parasocial interaction, and interest and feelings of hopelessness and loneliness among a sample of elderly participants (mean age = 63 years). Results indicate that the elderlys favorite performers tended to be men appearing in contemporary fiction. Involvement intensity did not differ according to the [non]fictional nature of the performer or the performers genre, though respondents reported more involvement with female characters and stronger identification with performers in non-contemporary programs. Although participants identified with characters and desired to be like them, they were more likely to parasocially interact with and show interest in them. Interest in ones favorite performer and identification predicted feeling less hopeless, while wishful identification and parasocial interaction predicted feeling more hopeless. Involvement did not predict loneliness. Finally, frequency of exposure was not related to involvement."
2004-0473,"i-Reach, i-Influence? The Effects of Internet and Print News on Public Opinion Inferences",Paper,"i-Reach, i-Influence? The Effects of Internet and Print News on Public Opinion Inferences","Existing research reveals that both highly involved partisans and those who are less involved in an issue may infer public opinion from their assessment of the slant of news coverage and their assumption that such coverage has a substantial influence on others. To date, however, studies of the effect of perceived news slant have been limited to traditional mass media, with particular attention paid to assessments of newspaper and magazine news content. This experiment compared perceptions of the slant and reach of Internet and print news articles and examined their effects on estimates of public opinion regarding two U.S. environmental policy issues. While the perceived slant of news articles proved to be a robust predictor of public opinion estimates, support for an effect of perceived media reach was mixed. The discrepancy between Internet reach and exposure to Internet news reports suggests that the media reach assumption is oversimplified and needs to be deconstructed into reach and exposure assumptions."

Indymedia and Internet Traffic Reports,"This paper examines the Internet server traffic reports of 8 North American Indymedia websites from January to May 2003 in an attempt to address the question of audience research and alternative media. The traffic reports indicate a significant increase in traffic at all of these websites beginning in March 2003, the month when open hostilities broke out in Iraq. These results suggest a connection between Indymedia and mobilization. In addition, further research based on Internet server traffic reports is described and encouraged."
2004-0475,Is Bad Mood Good for Creativity? Testing The Flexibility And Qualified Hypotheses,Paper,Is Bad Mood Good for Creativity? Testing The Flexibility And Qualified Hypotheses,"Divergent thinking is an important component underlying creative performance. Although positive mood enhances divergent thinking, explanations for why the effect occurs differ as do predictions for the influence of negative affect. The flexibility hypothesis contends that positive mood promotes cognitive flexibility and infers that negative affect should be marked by cognitive inflexibility. The qualified hypothesis asserts that positive mood fosters a satisficing strategy and negative mood an optimizing strategy. These predictions were tested in an experiment. A positive or negative mood was induced in eighty-nine participants by a comedy film clip or a documentary of Nazi concentration camps, respectively. All participants completed a category-exemplar association task. Participants in the negative mood condition made significantly less errors than other participants when the exemplars were atypical to the category. No differences in error rates between the groups occurred when exemplars were typical. These results provide support for the qualified hypothesis."
2004-0476,Is It a Male or Female Thing?: Identification and Enjoyment of Media Characters,Paper,Is It a Male or Female Thing?: Identification and Enjoyment of Media Characters,"The relationship between viewers and media characters is a large part of involvement with the media. Understanding how individuals respond and perceive characters increases the understanding of their responses to entertainment in general. Research has shown gender to be a strong and consistent predictor in responses to entertainment in a number of areas including enjoyment and identification, which is one way in which characters mediate a range of media effects. But people have also been found to respond to various characters in different ways. The present study examined the effects gender and character role have on enjoyment and identification. The results suggest only a marginal difference in enjoyment of males and females based on the character role, but that gender plays a large part in differences in levels of identification."
2004-0477,Is Playing Games All Bad?Positive Effects of Computer and Video Games in Learning,Paper,Is Playing Games All Bad?Positive Effects of Computer and Video Games in Learning,"Despite the growing popularity of computer and video games, academic researches on games are somewhat limited. Among those existing studies, most of them are focused on the violence in games and its negative effects. Though is has long been acknowledged that computer and video games are beneficial in certain domains, there is no comprehensive study on the positive effects of computer games. In this paper, current literature on computer game effects, especially the positive effects in learning are reviewed. Classification of computer games is discussed. This review of positive effects of computer games is based on the classification of computer games by its purpose as for education or for entertainment. Positive effects of educational games cover the areas of learning, motivation, retention memory, spatial skills, utility for special groups, and cognitive abilities. For entertainment games, positive effects in training and academic performance are discussed."
2004-0478,Issue and Attribute Agenda Setting: Complementary or Conflicting Concepts?,Paper,Issue and Attribute Agenda Setting: Complementary or Conflicting Concepts?,"First level agenda-setting  involving media influence on an agenda of issues  and second level agenda-setting  involving media influence on an agenda of attributes  were tested simultaneously through a regression analysis. Media coverage was compared with responses from a telephone survey two months after the terrorist attacks of 9-11 to test two competing hypotheses: 1. A complementary hypothesis, in which first and second level agenda-setting appear together; 2. A conflicting hypothesis, in which first and second level agenda-setting appear in opposition to each other. Findings indicate support for both levels of agenda-setting. Strong support also was found for the complementary hypothesis. Exposure to general news (traditional agenda-setting) and exposure to a specific news topic (attribute agenda-setting) were related. Thus, exposure to one type of agenda  either an entire general issue agenda or an attribute agenda linked to an object in the news  does not interfere with exposure to the other type."

Three surveys are undertaken to test seven research hypotheses for the purpose of a cross-validation of research findings. The results suggest that symmetrical communication is inherently ethical. Moreover, symmetrical communication indeed contributes to several performance measures, which include favorable organizational reputation, positive media exposure, positive market performance, overall organizational effectiveness, conflict resolution, and crisis management."
2004-0480,Is There a Right to Private Inquiry in Interactive Media?,Paper,Is There a Right to Private Inquiry in Interactive Media?,"The advent of different forms of interactive media such as the Internet, digital video recorders, interactive television and video on demand calls into much of the policy options that have governed privacy in the physical world. This paper aims to discuss how the interactive media, especially in a legal environment that fails to provide a comprehensive protection for individuals informational privacy, threatens individuals right to receive, read, listen and watch anonymously. This paper starts with an overview of some of the methods (such as cookies, web bugs and watermarking systems) that institutions utilize to track individuals media consumption habits in interactive media. In this section, this paper also summarizes how data mining techniques are used to extract meaning from dispersed databases. Following this technological overview, the paper explains how anonymous inquiry is a corollary of freedom of speech. Then, the paper focuses on how legal subpoenas increasingly function as a method through which third parties gain ungranted access to information about individuals media consumption habits. This section will argue that recent developments in the legal environment, such as the Digital Millennium Copyrights Act of 1998 and PATRIOT Act of 2001 has a potential to diminish certain checks on institutions ability to have access to information about individuals content consumption on digital media."

We suggest that two features influence the accuracy of conversational memory: the type of relationship with whom a person interacts (friend or stranger), and the nature of the interaction (concordant or discordant). Two hundred and eight-eight females participated in this investigation. Each person completed a multi-stage procedure wherein they engaged in two five-minute conversations. One conversation occurred with a close friend and the other conversation was with a stranger; the order of these conversations was randomly determined. Manipulated conversational parameters dictated whether the participants engaged in a concordant or discordant interaction. After each conversation, participants were asked to recall as much information as they could about the conversation. Transcripts of the conversations and the recall statements were coded to assess conversational recall. Results indicated that contrary to our expectations, individuals recalled more accurately those conversations with strangers than with close friends. However, this investigation did not provide evidence for the assertion that conversational memory is influenced by the type (concordant or discordant) interaction."
2004-0482,Its a New World: Dealing with Uncertainty : Uncertainty Reduction Strategies among U.S. Immigrants from Asia,Paper,Its a New World: Dealing with Uncertainty : Uncertainty Reduction Strategies among U.S. Immigrants from Asia,"This study compared the use of active strategies of uncertainty reduction, as exemplified by the use of media and personal networks, vs. interactive strategies employed by new immigrants from high-context communication cultures to the United States. The research found that Asian immigrants, chosen as representatives of high-context cultures, use active or interactive uncertainty reduction strategies in a complementary manner. The determinant of choice of strategies of uncertainty reduction is perceived cultural similarity, with greater similarity leading to the use of interactive strategies, and active uncertainty reduction strategies being used in interactions with less cultural similarity. Interactive strategies for reducing uncertainty will actually increase this uncertainty rather than reduce it. Within active strategies, the media is employed as a source of information for reducing uncertainty about the local culture as well as information from friends or relatives."
2004-0483,Its Not What You Know: A Transactive Memory Analysis of Knowledge Networks at NASA,Paper,Its Not What You Know: A Transactive Memory Analysis of Knowledge Networks at NASA,"Much of the world was stunned into mourning on February 1, 2003 as the space shuttle Columbia was reported to have broken up over Texas. For many, that shock turned to indignation and outrage to learn that some people within NASA had information and concerns that did not reach decision makers. The incident raised haunting questions that kept repeating, how could this happen again? The ensuing investigation revealed that debris at liftoff was the cause of the crash, but the official report suggested that NASAs organizational communication was just as much to blame. This paper uses Transactive Memory Theory to argue that there were significant gaps between the knowledge networks of NASA organizational members, and those gaps impeded information flow regarding potential disaster. The paper concludes with extensions of theory and practical implications for organizations, including NASA."

The free agent metaphor is especially evident in our participants stories about the reasons they chose to become entrepreneurs. Here, they identify themes of autonomy, confidence, opportunity and self-expression. The constraints hidden by the free agent metaphor as evident in the womens description of their entrepreneurial experiences are gendered, and include discrimination, management and work-family balance issues. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of our findings for understandings of empowerment and studies of hegemony."
2004-0485,"I Want to be Like You: Entertainment Education, EPPM, and Health Education",Paper,"I Want to be Like You: Entertainment Education, EPPM, and Health Education","For the first time, designers created a radio serial drama to convey an educational message about HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia using the theory-driven components of extended parallel process model (EPPM, Witte, 1992). As a newer mode for delivering health messages, entertainment education presents new questions, specifically, how listeners reactions to the storys fictional characters affected their evaluations of HIV/AIDS as a threat and the recommended responses as efficacious. Listeners reports corresponded to EPPM: listeners who felt threatened by HIV/AIDS performed these responses if they believed in their efficacy and the responses efficacy. Without this belief, they berated the show and denied the threat. Listeners reacted to fictional characters in many ways; they report learning from them, having emotional reactions and affinity for them most frequently. Each aspect differently related to listeners assessments of threat and efficacy, often substantially. The reactions extended to all characters: positive and negative role models, even transitional characters."
2004-0486,Journalists as Peacekeeping Force?,Paper,Journalists as Peacekeeping Force?,"The current state of media coverage on wars and violent conflicts gave raise to interven-tionist concepts in public communication such as Peace Journalism and Journalism of Attachment. While being mostly based on epistemological realism as well as the assump-tion of strong, causal and linear media effects, those normative concepts disregard the recent state of research in journalism studies. This paper argues that efforts of main-taining quality in news reporting on wars have to emerge from 'inside' journalism, oth-erwise they would not be effective since in modern democratic societies journalism oper-ates as self-referential and self-controlling subsystem."
2004-0487,"Journalists in Conflict: Members of Contradicting Communities - Journalism, Patriotism and Professionalism at Times of Conflict",Paper,"Journalists in Conflict: Members of Contradicting Communities - Journalism, Patriotism and Professionalism at Times of Conflict","Covering violent conflict, when the journalist is a member of one of the parties in conflict, invokes a special inner-professional contradiction. In fact, journalists are members of two communities simultaneously: the professional community and the national one.
On the one hand, the professional community calls upon the journalist to tell a story that will be, or will have the appearance of, a factual, objective and balanced story. Although we know this cannot be fully achieved, these are the ideals of the (western) press.
On the other hand, the national community calls the journalist to take part in the conflict, to be its representative in the battle of images and sound bites, to be a weapon  to tell only the facts that are in favor of his nation, to tell an unbalanced, unobjective story.
In the article we examine the journalists' work in a situation in which they must confront this dual allegiance. The article looks into the role played by the Israeli media during the first days of the Al-Aksa Intifada in early October 2000. The discussion focuses on the coverage of violent clashes between the police and Israels Arab citizens, and analyzes how the main Hebrew television news stations and the major Hebrew dailies covered the unfolding events; it also refers to reports in American newspapers.
The article explores how in such events, journalists, as an interpretive community, as representatives of the grief and confusion of their national community, turn to the patriotic point of view. After establishing inner and outer discourses with their peers - and mainly with the politicians - they turn to more professional perspective, satisfying the norms and values of the trade."

From the days of colonialism, the Caribbean has been, among other things, a warm vacation spot for the European owners to retreat. As technology expanded the capabilities of advertising, as well as mass travel, the Caribbean image of sun, sea, and sand was circulated around the world. Most recently, particularly with the growing popularity of cruise ships, the international travel industry circulates selective images of the Caribbean. This paper looks at tourism and travel images generated from developed nations to market Third World countries, specifically, the Caribbean. Focusing on the depictions contained in Honeymoon magazine, Caribbean Travel Planner online, visiteurope.com and eurodata.com, this paper will illuminate the fact that the Caribbean has been encased in the myth of the unchanged, the uncivilized and the unrestrained, which feeds the pervasive sentiment that sun, sea and sand is all that this region has to offer. This paper therefore attempts to address certain questions. Do these images portray the reality? What do they indicate about the agenda of the international travel and tourism industry? Most importantly, what are the repercussions for the Caribbean countries themselves?"
2004-0489,Just the Organizing Scheme or More?: Levels of Analysis in the Study of News Content,Paper,Just the Organizing Scheme or More?: Levels of Analysis in the Study of News Content,"The concept of levels of analysis was often employed in the literature on news content as a useful organizing structure for the synthesis of various approaches, theories, and research findings. Instead of being used as a useful analytical tool, however, its utility has been limited to an organizing scheme. This study attempts to expand the utility of levels of analysis beyond the organizing scheme to actually test a specific theoretical proposition. As an illustration of this attempt, I apply a multi-level framework to the area of media coverage of foreign policy issues and present my own case study, in which I examined how the U.S. and South Korean news media covered their respective home governments policy positions toward North Korea in the context of the two U.S.-South Korean presidential summits of 2001and 2002, and in which I tested which of the two popular metaphors depicting media performance in covering foreign policy issues cheerleader or watchdogbetter characterizes the medias role in those summits. Whereas this study found significant national variations in the relative levels of news media support for and criticism of political actors and their policy positions, the patterns of those variations varied according to which summit stories were examined. Therefore, the results strongly suggest that the coverage patterns were too complex to fit a simple depiction, be it of the watchdog or cheerleader variety, of the relationships between government foreign policy positions and media coverage."

They mediate identity, social relations, public and private spaces, and social power. They should be designed with a critical awareness of the politics of visibility. This paper suggests criteria by which they might be assessed. Firstly ? do ubicomp environments permit individuals to claim a particular social identity in a particular social context? They should facilitate separable contexts and separable identifiers. They should permit subjects to mirror their own performances. Secondly ? do environments provide a public context from which to produce subcultural knowledge, and permit the formation of in-groups able to share insights and produce knowledge with each other? Finally ? do environments permit the public claiming of their resources? They should make their own workings visible and facilitate the public visibility of the various knowledges produced by their members."

Findings of this study indicate that both knowledge about politics and communication behavior account for variance in internal and external efficacy with statistical significance. People who are knowledgeable about politics and who are engaged in various communication activities to obtain political information are more likely than others to have high levels of political efficacy. However, knowledge about politics and communication behaviors are related to internal and external efficacy with varying degrees. Both measures are found to be more closely related to internal than external efficacy."

At the center of this cluster for many contemporary organizations is the notion of knowledge management, or KM. Our goal in this paper is to explore the concept of KM and its relationship to organizational communication. Specifically, we attempt to (a) define KM and its key components, (b) explain why it has become such an important issue for contemporary organizations, (c) suggest some important ways that KM relates to and can be informed by organizational communication scholarship, and (d) identify some key implications of organizational communication theory and research for KM practice."

Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate various theoretical arguments. Results revealed that Korean citizens exposure to negative images of the U.S. in the Korean media was directly linked to Koreans negative perceptions of the U.S. However, it was also shown that these perceptions were not always directly linked to Koreans evaluations of issues related to the United States. Thus, it was revealed that exposure to mass media coverage of the U.S. that includes negative imagery of the U.S. and Americans is not always indirectly related to Koreans anti-Americanism."
2004-0494,La Femme Nikita and the Ethics of Organizational Life,Paper,La Femme Nikita and the Ethics of Organizational Life,"A great deal of social criticism and philosophy treats ethics as the antidote to the moral deficiencies of popular culture. But this way of posing the problem cannot help us understand narrative as a mode of moral imagination in its own right. In modern societies, in particular, popular culture offers a widely circulated moral dramaturgy, often capable of ethical subtlety.

In order to demonstrate the possibilities of popular culture as ethical discourse, this paper analyzes the cable television series La Femme Nikita. It argues that Nikita offers a complex account of the ethical dilemmas of organizational life, a topic too little studied in television studies, organizational communication, or ethics. The paper notes three powerful, recurring themes in La Femme Nikitas portrayal of organizational ethics: the power of organizational socialization, the ethics of defiance in the face of organizational demands for loyalty, and the impact of organizations on family life."
2004-0495,Language and National Identity in the Era of Globalization: The Case of English in Switzerland,Paper,Language and National Identity in the Era of Globalization: The Case of English in Switzerland,"This paper examines the rise of English in multilingual Switzerland and its potential impact on Swiss national identity. In addressing the Swiss case, I argue that ""modernization"" theory masks the way in which the global spread of English can affect and perhaps even undermine national identity and linguistic diversity in Switzerland. I contend that despite significant shortcomings, multilingualism has survived and to a large extent even thrived in Switzerland precisely because that nation-state has legally and normatively codified the protection of linguistic particularism and established multilingualism as a basic component of its national mythology. Yet even state-sanctioned and officially codified multilingualisms deeply embedded in national mythology such as in Switzerland are potentially threatened by an incessant drive to ""modernize."" English, viewed by proponents and critics alike as having acquired the (ideological) status of the global language of ""progress,"" could very well supplant some of Switzerland's national languages in potentially dramatic and far-reaching ways. I conclude that if the Swiss wish to maintain their multilingual mythology and, by extension, their collective national identity, they had better take the time to reflect upon English's potential impact on their internal cohesion as a nation-state. They must do so, I argue, so that they might make an informed and concerted attempt to direct the ""flow"" of English in what some scholars have characterized as the Swiss multilingual national language ""laboratory."""
2004-0496,Language Attitudes and African American Vernacular English: New Directions for Research,Paper,Language Attitudes and African American Vernacular English: New Directions for Research,"This paper reviews research on language attitudes toward African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and also presents suggestions for future research in this area. Studies over the last 35 years show that in most instances, negative attitudes are expressed toward speech samples of AAVE, especially by European American listeners. Given the complex interaction of variables in the language attitude research setting, it is not clear exactly what is the object of such attitudes. It is suggested that researchers develop more dynamic research models that include greater sensitivity to predispositions of listeners. It is also noted that examining language attitudes in cases of standard/nonstandard comparisons may not be parallel to the case of Standard American English and AAVE, owing to the unique experience of African Americans among ethnic groups in the United States."

Anglo-accented speakers were evaluated more favorably across all dimensions, although the effect was attenuated for Hispanic raters. The reported linguistic landscape of the raters was also investigated to determine its role in predicting language attitudes. While this had no effect on Anglo raters, the linguistic landscape significantly affected Hispanic ratings; the more Spanish the perceived local climate (e.g., in terms of road signs, media available) the more favorably Hispanic-accented speakers were rated, whereas the more English their perceived landscape, the more Anglo speakers were upgraded."

It aims as well to assess the contribution such an endeavor might be said to make in terms of providing a deeper understanding of the complex relations of power that collectively, continually, and dynamically (re)constitute the human social world. I begin with an historical overview of the position of English within the Indian context. Next, I attempt to theorize the hegemonic position of English within India through the lens of postcolonial critical theoretical perspectives. I then move to address the dual question of: What might the case of English in India tell us about the global hegemony of English?, and, more specifically, What insight(s) might postcolonial critical theoretical perspectives provide vis-à-vis the latter phenomenon? I conclude by proposing a number of different potential studies examining the multiple dimensions of the global hegemony of English. All these studies, I believe, would benefit substantially from the analytical power of postcolonial critical theoretical approaches whose profound ability to identify and capture paradox provides important insight into human social phenomena which other approaches would either deny and/or miss."

'Governmental Gatekeepers' and Compliance,"This paper assesses prospects that new access to information laws will establish a citizens right to know in Latin America through an analysis of government document custodians' attitudes and behaviors in Mexico, the latest country in the hemisphere to adopt such legislation. The Mexican case provides a useful laboratory in which to explore the impact on compliance of factors beyond the formal content of access laws. The Mexican law as written is considered one of the best in the hemisphere in terms of broad access and workable enforcement provisions. However, no extra resources were allotted to government agencies for compliance with the law, the countrys traditional political culture is considered authoritarian and bureaucrats views on the uses of government information prior to democratization suggest an instrumental approach guided by a calculus of organizational incentives rather than one guided by support for either secrecy or access as a general principle. Our conclusions are that the biggest obstacle to robust implementation will not be a lack of resources or authoritarian cultural inertia. Instead, missing or unclear political will at the top of hierarchical bureaucratic organizations is the strongest potential obstacle to Mexicos emerging right to know. We believe this message will travel widely in the region."

Social cognitive theory was applied to provide insights into the potential impact of exposure to these images on audience members. Findings suggest that while advances have been made in terms of the quality of depictions of Latinos, many of these images remain tied to longstanding media stereotypes. In addition, the rate at which Latinos are portrayed on television remains dramatically below that of the real world population."

Instruction was provided as a regular part of classroom instruction in English language arts by seven regular classroom teachers. Statistically significant differences were found in three measures of students critical thinking skills as they analyzed a print alcohol ad. Students in the treatment group showed higher scores measuring the ability to identify target audience, to describe construction techniques used to attract and hold attention, and to identify the implied message subtext. Compared to the control group, students in the media literacy condition also had greater knowledge of the pre-production and post-production components of the advertising production process."

Are people with homophobic beliefs more likely to consume certain media such as political talk radio? Using Uses & Gratifications and Cultivation Analysis as the theoretical framework, the present study examines possible links between media usage and homophobic attitudes. Despite the general belief about medias powerful influence on politics and culture, our findings suggest that media usage has a very limited relationship with anti-gay attitudes. Instead, characteristics such as strong religiosity and lower education are better predictors of ones negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. The only significant media related factor to homophobia is a low incidence of newspaper reading."

Fantasy Theme Analysis, Ex-Employees' On-Line Discourse","In 2001, an online listserv exchange began among former employees of Americas largest business-to-business publisher, Reed Business Information, originally named Cahners Publishing Company. Using Symbolic Convergence Theory and fantasy theme analysis, I examined all twenty-two Ex-Cahn Newsletters from a thirty-month timeframe. Reference points span the country throughout the past forty years. Voices range from those of former mailroom workers to group publishers now in diverse life situations. Some had resigned; many were terminated. Through contributing to the newsletter, without corporate hierarchical structure, members construct a culture through collective memory and cathartic testimonial. Textual dramas relive the glory days of the company, its deterioration, employees difficult departures, personal triumphs, and an enduring sense of family. This analysis demonstrates the utility of fantasy theme analysis in interpreting online discourse, illuminates the voices of a submerged community, and shows that multiple rhetors, from diverse perspectives, can create a unified rhetorical vision."
2004-0504,Legitimacy and Intimacy: Factors Related to Health Influence Attempts,Paper,Legitimacy and Intimacy: Factors Related to Health Influence Attempts,"College peer relationships have been found to impact individuals lifestyle behaviors. Specifically, peer social influence is related to students alcohol use. Therefore, the present study investigates how and under what conditions social influence emerges among college students with regard to drinking behavior. To investigate this social influence we use Newell and Stutmans model of social confrontation. We find that relational intimacy, legitimacy of discussing the topic in the relationship, and attitudes about whether or not health decisions are an individuals choice are constructs that affect confrontation messages regarding drinking behavior. We found that health related beliefs and intimacy are related to legitimacy and decision to confront another. Intimacy and legitimacy are related to directness and elaboration of confrontation, and legitimacy and intimacy are related to attempts to reduce threats to the targets image."

This study examined whether the inclusion of metacommunication in video-mediated Door-in-the-Face (DITF) requests increased compliance rates. University students responded as to whether or not they would agree to one of four requests that varied in the use of the DITF strategy and metacommunication. No significant differences in positive response rates were found for either the use of metacommunication or the use of DITF strategy compared to control groups. The limitations of DITF theory in a low-immediacy technology context are discussed."

In a simulated living-room, participants watched a newscast while unknowingly being videotaped. Using the eyes on screen method to measure attention and recognition accuracy to measure memory, the studied showed that unlike live news, breaking news does increase attention and thus memory. Disgust stories garnered significantly greater attention than fear stories. However, this did not translate into increased memory. Fear stories were recognized significantly more than disgust stories. This study validates the industrys widespread use of breaking news in order to increase viewership. However, whether or not the story is then subsequently encoded into memory may be a function of the storys emotional content."
2004-0507,Living in Two Worlds: Acculturation of Thai Students in American University,Paper,Living in Two Worlds: Acculturation of Thai Students in American University,"Abstract (150 words)
To investigate how Thai students adapt themselves to student life in the US, this study explores the major barriers faced by Thai graduate students who strive for academic success. It examines social communication strategies they use to overcome those obstacles.
The research employs the in-depth interview method to collect data from ten Thai graduate students in a large public university. The analysis hinges on Berrys acculturation theory as it is the most useful approach founded on a social psychological perspective.
The results reveal that Thai students adjust themselves to the US environment in a particular pattern. They do not attempt to assimilate into American society as most immigrants do. In contrast, Thai students, as sojourners, learn American culture as outsiders. They tend to adapt their practices, only partly, within the US environment. Significantly, social communication activities, including interpersonal and mass communication, play vital roles in their acculturation within American society."

First, it employs a close textual analysis of the internet advertisements that encourage tattoo removal. These texts raise interesting rhetorical questions about the broader implications of tattoo removal in a contemporary American culture. The textual analysis of advertisements lead the paper to a puzzling finale in the tattoo removal process  a remnant of the original tattoo. Consequently, the second part of this essay suggests that fantasy plays a role in the audiences preference for a scar over an unwanted tattoo. The paper concludes by tentatively indicating the bodys ability to simultaneously serve as a location of the real and as the structure for fantasy."

Approaching news texts as important portals into the larger moral, economic, and social order, this article takes a cultural studies approach to examine the Times of Indias representations of the Miss World controversy. The newspapers colorful photographs of Miss Worlds organizers, sponsors, and beauty contestants resuscitated the hegemonic cultural politics of consumer modernity while the visual imaging of activist groups inscribed protesters within paradigms of delinquency and disorder. The crafting of news through objectivist signifiers of consent for Miss World legitimized the authority of state and consumer discourses, excluded the poor, and marginalized activists voices. News stories on Miss Worlds charitable support for handicapped children inserted institutions of global/local capital into sympathetic templates of Third World salvation. In concluding, the article situates my textual analysis within the economics and professional routines of media production and the discursive inheritances of colonialism."

No, Dislocal: How to Scale Up From Interactions to Organization","How can we describe and analyze the details of interactions while showing that they literally contribute to the constitution of an organization? While this issue is hardly new, it is our hope that our answer will prove to be original. We undertake this analysis using a concrete situation to illustrate how scaling up occurs through actions that first appear to be locally performed. To do so, we will introduce concepts that have been developed by Bruno Latour (1986; 1994; 1996; 1999) to depict and analyze how non-human entities tend to not only dislocate interactions, but also stabilize them. This bottom-up perspective will then enable us to show that interactions are never completely local. Instead, they are what we call, using a neologism, dis-local, that is, their local achievement always mobilizes a variety of entitiesdocuments, rules, protocols, architectural elements, machines, technological devicesthat dislocate, i.e., put out of place (Websters Dictionary) what initially appeared to be in place, i.e., local. Our analyses will show that the here and now is always contaminated by the there and then (whether in the past or future). However, and this is the main point of our argument, this there and then was or will be another here and now. We never leave the level of events and actions even as these events become linked to one another through space and time. Paraphrasing Latour (1993) while giving it a Derridian flavor, we could say that the immanent (micro) is always already transcendent (macro)."
2004-0511,'Lotto Millionaires are not like ordinary millionaires' Norwegian Lotto Commercials 1993 - 2002,Paper,'Lotto Millionaires are not like ordinary millionaires' Norwegian Lotto Commercials 1993 - 2002,"For ten years, the game of Lotto has been advertised in commercials in Norway. The 24 films show that people who have become millionaires by winning, do not pick up on upper class lifestyles, but rather spend their money to make some personal, individualistic dreams come true. These commercials have been successful in many dimensions. They contributed in detaching the Lotto game from the spheres of gambling, sin and danger, and constructed instead Lotto as innocent fun and excitement for ordinary people. The number of Lotto players increased significantly through the 90s. The Lotto commercials have played an active role in installing the concept of a Lotto millionaire in Norwegian language. This concept is now in use in the press and among politicians, as indicated in the Norwegian election debates in the fall of 2003. Lotto commercials have also been successful in competitions and have won prices at festivals in Norway as well as abroad.
This paper examines the Lotto commercials as expressions of popular culture. It discusses what constitutes advertising as popular culture, and argues that differences between commercials and other audiovisual texts like sitcoms, soap operas and films are diminishing. Successful commercials address their viewers like ordinary popular culture expressions do: they seek to be consumed with pleasure. Propaganda elements and overt efforts of persuasion are toned down. The viewers are given an entertaining story, open, compared to ordinary propaganda. Audiences have more room than in traditional commercials to construct meaning and experience pleasure in their own way."

Both globalization and media segmentation present citizens with alternative outlets for political information, in addition to those offered by the mainstream communication channels, which once dominated every nation state. In this paper, survey data gathered in Israel (n = 1122) are analyzed to examine the association between media skepticism and exposure. Findings show that skepticism toward the mainstream news media is indeed related to alternative news consumption; however, it is not related to consumption of alternative media exclusively. Results are discussed in light of theories of the public sphere."

Middle-aged males in both film and television were more likely to play leadership roles and wield occupational power than their female counterparts. In addition, as female characters aged in film, they were less likely to have goals. Although Americans 60 and older constitute 18 percent of the population, findings indicate that such individuals comprised only 8 percent of major characters in film and 4 percent of major characters in prime-time television."

This study compares Korean female reporters with male reporters on their source use patterns, the primary issues they cover, the general tone they adopt, and the frequency of covering womens interest stories.
Results show that female reporters quote more women for their stories, cover more soft, positive news, and write more stories for women readers compared to male reporters. Overall, the study finds that women reporters could be a factor in diversifying news content.
Issues of three large Korean newspapers published in six days in 2002 were randomly selected."
2004-0516,Making frames: Testing a framing-model of news production,Paper,Making frames: Testing a framing-model of news production,"The paper provides a theoretical and a methodical critique of studies on journalistic framing. From this, an elaborate framing model of news production is outlined: It meticulously defines journalistic frames (cognition) and media frames (coverage). Unlike previous research, we clearly distinguish between frame and schema, concurrently integrating both: A journalistic frame is defined as a consistent bundle of cognitive schemata, scripts etc., which emerge in newsroom discourse, exchange with other (media) discourses and influence news production. Thus, it is supposed, that journalists cognitions influence coverage ending up in corresponding media frames. We delimit our model from competing approaches of news produc-tion. Furthermore, we operationalize our constructs innovatively. Taking xenophobia as an example, we identified journalists cognitions in an elaborate and novel qualitative frame analysis and examined their impact on coverage in a quantitative framing analysis. Results for both are presented, proving how qualitative findings and quantitative data can be combined statistically."

In applying AIDA, I focus on a case study describing faculty senators sensemaking practices in relation to a university crisis thereby analyzing how faculty members socially construct a past event and the implications of this for discursively constructing decision-making and its norms. My broader purpose is to illustrate the utility of Action Implicative Discourse Analysis for describing the micro practices of organizational participants sensemaking as constituted by their naturally occurring talk."

Consequences of envy can be harmful on both the interpersonal level and the organizational level. Previous research shows envy to be related to a number of damaging behaviors.
The purpose of this study was to 1) determine what communicative responses people have to envy in the workplace, 2) determine the underlying dimensions of reactions to envy in the workplace, and 3) to determine the association between envy and the dimensions of envious reactions in the workplace. Factor analysis revealed five dimensions of reactions to envy in the workplace: attacking the envied person, motivation, less commitment, negative self-thoughts, and self-promotion. Correlational relationships indicated people with stronger envy in the workplace are likely to become less committed to their jobs and their organizations."
2004-0519,Mapping Racial Cognitive Constructs Using ZMET:,Paper,Mapping Racial Cognitive Constructs Using ZMET:,"Abstract
The difference in cognitive constructs communicated by black and white female students at a midsized Midwestern university was investigated. The Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) was previously developed for marketing research and in this study was adapted to study manifestations of organizational subcultures. The construct maps indicated that black and white students talk about their cognitive and emotional experiences at the university in both common and unique ways. The common constructs suggest that black and white students perceived a common organizational (university) culture. Four shared constructs (social scene, competition, academics, and stress) and one shared construct relationship (competition leads to stress) were identified as contributing to the overall university culture. The unique constructs suggest that black and white students are also part of distinctly different subcultures within the organization. The antecedents to the competition construct and consequences of the social scene construct result in two different construct relationships. In addition, different perceptions for the following constructs were also manifested: stress management strategies, body image, academics and feelings of attachment to the university. The results from this investigation suggest that the ZMET is a useful qualitative and quantitative method that can complement others traditionally used in organizational communication research."

The Chinese Media in Transition,"This study examines, distinguishes and discusses as grounded theory the changes of the past 20 years in the Chinese media system as a result of the economic reforms. While the media marketization challenges the current Chinese Party orthodoxy by initiating a redistribution of power and interests, this study argues that the western model of a libertarian press is hardly a possibility. With a convolution of the Party line and the bottom line, a Chinese media system is moving from totalitarianism to market authoritarianism. Building on the premise that previous western press systems based on the Four Theories and its updates have failed to fit the unique case of China, the authors propose new theoretical perspectives in studying media systems in transition."

A total of 74 college students from both China and the United States participated the survey. Thematic analyses revealed two major clusters (communication-focused and individual-focused) of desirable and undesirable characteristics in a potential mate. Findings are consistent with the previous research that the Chinese students prefer more family-related characteristics (e.g., to show filial piety to their parents) in a mate, whereas the American students prefer more individual-focused qualities (e.g., to be physically attractive and athletic) in a person they want to marry. At the communication level, more American students pointed out the importance of fun and humor in a mate, whereas more Chinese emphasized the importance of kindness in a mate. In addition, American students listed more individual-focused characteristics than Chinese students. Similar findings were also obtained regarding the undesirable qualities in a mate. Next, Chinese students were found to be more likely to seek advice from their parents than the American students regarding the decision in marrying a particular person. Lastly, there was no difference in the ranking of the importance of the parents approval in their decision of marriage. Limitations and future directions were discussed."

And yet, definitions of participatory communication supporting empirical research design have not been advanced. This paper represents the beginning of a program of research aiming to determine whether Habermass theory of communicative action can be useful in serving the need to find measures suitable for program design and evaluation. The paper reviews the theorys empirical claims and explores its methodological implications. It advances an operational definition of communicative action. And it reports an exploratory study designed to examine the properties of measures based on this operational definition. Findings of the study are promising, showing well behaved measures and a potential for predictive validity. Progress on scale design will be required. A program of continued methodological research is briefly outlined in closing."

The scale being developed is called the Motivation Activation Measure (MAM). Specifically, this study continues to replicate the result of the first study, attempts to build a smaller version of the scale, attempts to develop a version to be used with children, and continues the work of testing the reliability and validity of these measures. Thus, in this study the original MAM protocol was used to measure positivity offset and negativity bias on a sample of 81 college students. The results of the second study were compared to the results of the first study. In addition, a shorter version of the protocol was developed that we have called mini-MAM. The test retest reliability for the original measure and the mini version are computed and discussed. Finally, a third version of the measure was developed for use with children. Some items in the original scale could not be used as they were not appropriate for children. The new version, called youth-oriented or YO-MAM is also examined in relationship to the standard and mini sets. Results show that mini-MAM is a fairly reliable smaller version of MAM and seems to have about equal validity. In this sample of college students YO-MAM did not prove to be as reliable or as valid. However, because the scale items were chosen based on normative emotional ratings for children, it might not be expected to do particularly well with an older population. Current work is under way to further examine the reliability and validity of YO-MAM with a child population."

While scholars often measure the overt accommodation behaviors of others (i.e., linguistic and/or nonverbal convergence/divergence) there is a lack of knowledge pertaining to how often specific verbal and noverbal accommodation strategies combinations are used in conversation as well as interactants knowledge of reciprocated behaviors. In a 2 X 2 design (sex-male/female X role-interviewer/other) participants strategies of accommodation were observed and compared to self and other perceptions of being accommodated. Differences were observed based on the role of participant (conversational lead versus other) as well as sex differences of dyads (male-male, male-female, female-male, female-female)."

Abstract
Ample evidence exists suggesting that exposure to television and film violence (Paik & Comstock, 1994) and playing with violent video games (Sherry, 2001) contribute to increases in aggressive behavior; however, the magnitude of the effect ranges from small to moderate. In this study, we argue that in some cases, use of trait, rather than state aggression can serve to attenuate effects. We report the results of a study in which a trait aggression scale is reworded slightly to create a state measure. The state and trait scales are then compared in high and low aggression priming conditions. Results suggest that although both scales are reliable and both have construct validity, the reworded state aggression scale responds more to the high prime than to the low prime. More importantly, the reworded state scale also responds more than the original trait scale does. Therefore, minor variations in studies of media's effect on aggression, such as variations in scale wording, can serve to attenuate effects."
2004-0527,Measuring the Effectiveness of Anti-Drug Public Service Announcements,Paper,Measuring the Effectiveness of Anti-Drug Public Service Announcements,"Two experiments were conducted in order to validate a subjective measure of the effectiveness of anti-drug Public Service Announcements (PSAs). In the first study, adolescents ratings of perceived effectiveness were strongly positively correlated with favorable cognitive responses to the PSAs. That is, ads that were rated as relatively effective elicited greater net positive thoughts, whereas those perceived to be relatively ineffective generated fewer net positive thoughts. In the second study, the relationship between perceived effectiveness and several outcome measures was examined. Adolescents viewed either the effective (strong) videos, ineffective (weak) videos, or a control video, after which marijuana-related intentions, attitudes, beliefs, and other outcome variables were measured. Multivariate analysis revealed that the strong ads were most influential in favorably altering respondents subjective norms and normative beliefs about marijuana use, as well as self-efficacy with regard to refusing marijuana. The implications of this approach to assessing PSA effectiveness are discussed."
2004-0528,Measuring Time Teens Spend with Media: Challenges and Opportunities,Paper,Measuring Time Teens Spend with Media: Challenges and Opportunities,"This paper considers the challenges researchers face in attempting to measure the amount of time teenagers spend with media. After reviewing the disparate methods and measures that have been used in research incorporating time spent with media as a critical variable, it concludes that there is a lack of information about the reliability and validity of these measures and highlights the challenges that have faced researchers in this domain. In particular, the literature suggests critical questions about time: How it should be chunked?; How much time can pass before it can no longer be accurately recalled?; and How can respondents be cued to remember time spent with media? To address these questions, data from two exploratory studies are presented. Study 1, a self-administered questionnaire with 191 12- to 19-year olds, examines the correlation of an ordinal-level frequency measure with a continuous minutes per week measure and finds important differences within and across the media used by teens. Study 2, a survey of 24 13- to 17-year-olds in a focus group format, examines the correlation of responses to a cued-recall measure (the previous evenings TV grid) and a media use log (the previous evening in 30 minute time blocks). Respondents reports of time spent with television from the TV grid were more than double those from the media use log. The paper concludes with suggestions for researchers interested in developing media time use measures for adolescents and teens and lays out future research needed to address the challenges and opportunities of the new media environment."
2004-0529,Medea in the Media: A Narrative Analysis of Press Coverage of the Andrea Yates Murders,Paper,Medea in the Media: A Narrative Analysis of Press Coverage of the Andrea Yates Murders,"In western culture, mothers often have been described in dichotomous terms  as either creative and nurturing or hateful and destructive. Journalists rely on these old, familiar stories as they report the news, crafting articles that mirror cultural values about appropriate feminine behavior. This paper examines journalistic representation of motherhood by analyzing media coverage of a dark side of maternal behavior  infanticide. The author conducted a narrative analysis of press coverage of the murder trial of Andrea Yates, the Texas (USA) woman who drowned her five children. Analyses revealed the presence of two dominant narratives: the traitor and the quest. Yates was represented as a woman who betrayed her family, her community, and the institution of motherhood  although there were some cracks in this dominant narrative as news sources questioned the role Yates husband played in the childrens deaths. In the second dominant narrative, the court system was presented as the hero struggling to bring justice and order to a chaotic world. The author concludes that the Yates stories reinforce traditional notions about femininity  that women possess natural knowledge about how to be good mothers, that women are home-centered and child-focused, and that women find complete fulfillment in the domestic sphere. The author also suggests that American media culture is steeped in fairy tale notions that marriage and family mean happily ever after. Events that challenge this fairy tale are constructed as news."

We hypothesized that successful policy advocacy requires that news media should increase awareness of an issue followed by quiet negotiations to promote specific legislation in the absence of press attention. We used computer assisted text analysis to evaluate news coverage of underage drinking in the Baton Rouge Advocate and the New Orleans Times-Picayune between 1994 through May 2003.
We found considerable press attention to underage drinking (1,067 paragraphs from 665 stories) with peaks in 1997, 1998 and 2000. We focused on four specific policies to reduce underage drinking  banning minors from bars (mean of 2 paragraphs/month), zero tolerance for underage drinking & driving (2 paragraphs/month), increased alcohol tax (5 paragraphs/month ) and keg registration (18 paragraphs over 9+ years). For these policies, 35 bills were introduced and 5 were passed between 1997 and 2003. High press coverage was associated with all 30 unsuccessful bills. Four of the 5 successful bills received little or no coverage (including one that increased rather than banned minors access to bars). The fifth was a successful zero tolerance bill (21 stories) for which passage was tied to federal highway funding."

2004-0532,"Media, Anti-Americanism, and Support for the Iraq War in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East",Paper,"Media, Anti-Americanism, and Support for the Iraq War in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East","The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential impact of news coverage about the prelude to the Iraq War on international support for President Bushs decision to use military force in Iraq. The study is based on a survey conducted one week before the start of the war among 1,787 university students from six countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. It examines the impact of various cognitive and affective factors on support for the war, such as exposure and attention to national and US news abroad, attitudes toward Iraq and a possible war against Iraq, fears about possible consequences of a war with Iraq, and general feelings of anti-Americanism. The findings indicate that exposure to war coverage primarily influenced respondents fears about the possible consequences of a war with Iraq. These fears, which were also affected by respondents attitudes toward Iraq and the war itself, strongly influenced respondents support for US military action in Iraq. As predicted, the study also found that overall perceptions of the United States are primarily determined by respondents foreign policy preferences rather than their general feelings of anti-Americanism."
2004-0533,Media Attention and Exposure in Relation to Support for Agricultural Biotechnology,Paper,Media Attention and Exposure in Relation to Support for Agricultural Biotechnology,"This paper shows that attention to television news, science television and entertainment television are all significantly related to a composite measure of agricultural biotechnology support after controlling for demographics as well as self-reported biotechnology awareness, trust in institutions and perceived role of science. Interpersonal discussion and attention to various forms of newspaper content had no significant relationship to the dependent variable. These findings contradict previous commentary which suggested that no measurable relationship exists between communication variables and biotechnology support. It is also hypothesized that some biotechnology support may be an outcome of heuristic processing by survey respondents. A survey of television coverage of biotechnology and re-assessment of the relationship between biotechnology and environmental opinion are suggested."
2004-0534,Media-Broker Diplomacy: Journalists Turning International Mediators,Paper,Media-Broker Diplomacy: Journalists Turning International Mediators,"This work suggests a conceptual model to study journalists' involvement in international conflict resolution. The model, ""Media-Broker Diplomacy,"" represents an attempt to build an analytical tool that integrates and applies theories and models from both negotiation and communication. The model includes three variants: direct intervention, bridging and building confidence, and secret mediation. Each variant has different characteristics and each has contributed to conflict resolution in a different way. The model also includes four parameters: initiation and motivation, awareness, action, and consequences. The model's potential usefulness is demonstrated through several case studies mostly from Arab-Israeli negotiations. The findings raise difficult professional, practical, and ethical questions for negotiators, policymakers, and journalists."
2004-0535,Media Context and Advertising Effectiveness: Priming Ethnic Identification in Bicultural Individuals,Paper,Media Context and Advertising Effectiveness: Priming Ethnic Identification in Bicultural Individuals,"This study aims to understand how bicultural individuals are aware of their ethnicities in responding to ethnic cues in media context and, how their awareness of ethnicities through media influence their attitudes toward the ad embedded in ethnic cues. That is, this study assumes that bicultural individuals, who were socialized into two cultures (A and B), will respond favorably to the A ethnic related ad when exposed to an A ethnic message through media. Likewise, they will respond favorably to the B ethnic related ad when exposed to a B ethnic message.
I proposed that exposure to an ethnic prime caused bicultural individuals to respond more favorably to an ad that matched ethnic primes. These hypotheses were tested by looking for ethnic primes by ethnic ads interaction on evaluations of the ad. The results showed that the effects of the ethnic primes were marginally significant across all dependent variables."
2004-0536,"Media, 'criticism and social change': A Burkean approach to media studies",Paper,"Media, 'criticism and social change': A Burkean approach to media studies","Kenneth Burke offered an American perspective on strategies of domination and advanced a theory and methodology for integrating questions of communication and media into an analysis of culture (Hardt, 1992, p. 127). Burkes work is beneficial to numerous fields, including media, because of his interrogation of the use of language (Gusfield, 1989, p. 6). By analyzing the relationship among media, symbols and the development of culture, communication scholars can expand Burkes argument that the study of words and symbolic action was the most revealing, and therefore effective, exercise of helping expose and explain the problems of contemporary society and, among them alienation and hegemonic struggle (Hardt, 1992, p.126). An examination specified as such would involve analyses of production, reception and consumption of meanings by persons generated by mass-mediated texts for purposes of social change."
2004-0537,"Media, Democracy, and Propaganda: Coverage of the War on Iraq",Paper,"Media, Democracy, and Propaganda: Coverage of the War on Iraq","A study of the attitudes towards terrorism two years after 9/11 conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes found that most Americans held mistaken impressions on the U.S.-led war on Iraq. How could so many people have been so mislead in their understanding of the war on Iraq? This level of misunderstanding raises important questions about the prospects for democratic discussion and decision-making during times of war in the U.S. The blame for this state of affairs, I argue, falls on the corporate media system in the U.S. that is subservient, rather than adversarial, to elite interests. In this paper, I study media coverage of the 2003 war on Iraq and show that rather than serve the public interest and promote a diversity of opinions, the media instead over-represented the views of the Bush administration."
2004-0538,Media Discourse and 'Something of a Gap' between American and European policies toward the Middle East,Paper,Media Discourse and 'Something of a Gap' between American and European policies toward the Middle East,"This paper explores media discourse about policies toward the greater Middle East to gain insight in the differences between European and U.S. positions. The study examines coverage of foreign policy during three pivotal eventsthe peace process discussions at Sharm el Sheik in 2000, the U.S.-led victory over Taliban stronghold Mazar-i-Sharif in 2001, and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheneys trip to the Middle East in 2002in the London Times, Le Monde and the New York Times. The overarching question is how media discourse offers a framework within which policies can be both explained and made explainable to the public. Beyond study of bias and press-state relations, this study explores how media coverage of foreign policy can serve the public interest by providing the boundaries for talking about diplomacy in the Middle East. Findings suggest that how Middle East policy is discussed in the media is reflective and possibly constitutive of crucial divergence in the E.U. and U.S. approaches."
2004-0539,"Media effects in Voting and Polling: E-Democracy, Trust and Social Identity",Paper,"Media effects in Voting and Polling: E-Democracy, Trust and Social Identity","Internet voting enables citizens to vote from different places on various moments, and this is generally seen as one of the advantages that may positively influence voting turnout. However, social psychological theory suggests that social identity is dependent on the situation a person is in, and the voting decision (as well as other behavior) may be different depending on these different identities. If this is true, the outcome of a vote or opinion poll may be influenced by the deployment of Internet based media. Voters may also have different levels of trust in the various voting media, and this also may influence voting behavior. Findings from some field experiments with an e-voting system seem to corroborate these expectations."

We surveyed 193 undergraduate students at Makerere University in Kampala in June 2003 and asked, among other topics, about their media use patterns, their perception of cultural threats posed by foreign media, and their reasons for liking and disliking local and foreign media. We used a combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions. Consistent with previous studies, we discovered that the respondents preferred local media over foreign. But when we asked specifically about foreign media, they preferred Western media to Indian media even though they believed Western media posed a more severe cultural threat than Indian media. However, though there was a language barrier to comprehensive understanding, the respondents felt some cultural and political proximity to Indian films. We also found, again consistent with previous research, that respondents were active rather than passive media users. The respondents seemed particularly active when they expressed dislike for media. The respondents also raised concerns about domestic cultural dominance by the major language group in the country. The results suggest that the media imperialism thesis may be reconsidered to take into account complexities created by South-to-South media flow, but also intra-national concerns about cultural domination and subordination."

A sample for each genre was selected from weekly countdown shows in 2002. In response to the sizeable proportion of stereotypical images that occur in the backgrounds of videos, both primary and supporting video figures were assessed. A total of 210 videos were analyzed, however 158 male and 27 female primary figures along with 54 male and 55 female supporting figures were valid and assessed. This studys comparison of rock, country, and hip hop music videos revealed that overall females were depicted as more attractive, decorative, and sexualized than their male counterparts. Genre-specific trends were also revealed."
2004-0542,Media Trust Fund,Paper,Media Trust Fund,"This paper discusses compensation for innocent victims of physical harm or death allegedly suffered after media-incited mischief. The mechanism proposed is a media trust fund to provide resources for compensation. The paper discusses the Supreme Court's decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio and attempts to show that many cases have occurred but no court-ordered compensation has occurred. The paper also covers pending cases, including one involving the video game ""Grand Theft Auto."" But the paper also argues that the Brandenburg doctrine is necessary for freedom of expression to flourish. Thus the paper argues for an ethical solution -- a media trust fund into which media corporations would voluntarily pay to provide a ""kitty"" for compensation of injured persons."
2004-0543,Media Usage and Political Alienation Revisited,Paper,Media Usage and Political Alienation Revisited,"Political communication studies have produced conflicting results on whether media reliance has an alienating effect on citizens political participation. In comparison with many studies in existing literature, the present research utilized more and more precise measures of media, and examined more dimensions of political alienation. Contrary to the findings of a number of previous studies, present results showed that media reliance in general encouraged political participation. However, other variables such as education and personal cynicism played an equally or more important role than media usage or attention."
2004-0544,Media Use and Attitudes toward Asian Americans,Paper,Media Use and Attitudes toward Asian Americans,"Drawing upon insights from cultivation and uses & gratifications literature, and using surveys with a large national sample, the present study investigated the relationship between peoples media usage and their attitudes toward Asian Americans. Our findings show that public attitudes toward Asian Americans have improved between 1992 and 2002. Also, media use in general appears to have little impact on attitudes toward Asian Americans. Nevertheless, survey respondents are more likely to have a positive attitude if they watch morning TV news shows, but do not watch daytime talk shows. Other predictors of a positive opinion include a higher level of political interest and efficacy, a pro-equality stand, more education, a younger age, and a pro-African American view."
2004-0545,Meeting Time: Negotiating Organizational Temporality Through Meetings,Paper,Meeting Time: Negotiating Organizational Temporality Through Meetings,"In this paper we argue that group meetings are an overlooked structure in the current conversations regarding group and organizational temporality. Meetings are both instrumental and expressive social forms (Schwartzman, 1986) that are inherently temporal and communicative. Prior research on time has used meetings as the unit of analysis to study group interactions, but none has considered the unique position of meetings as a socio-temporal form and communication structure. Following the theoretical framework proposed by Ballard and Seibold (2003), we suggest that meetings both shape and are shaped by organizational members shared experience of time."
2004-0546,Mental Representations of News Stories,Paper,Mental Representations of News Stories,"How do people comprehend TV news stories? This research project applied research on mental models of text comprehension to peoples understanding of TV news stories. Specifically, the landscape model of text comprehension was tested to determine how well the model could account for peoples memory of a news story. Participants either read or watched a news story about a robot expo in Japan. The landscape model did a good job of predicting participants mental representation of, and memory for, the print version of the news story (R2 = .86). However, considering the fact that the landscape model was developed to explain text-based comprehension, the original model did not adequately explain participants representation of, and memory for, the visual story (R2 = .32). We expanded the landscape model to include visual representations of concepts by incorporating elements of Paivios dual code theory of memory. When visual representations were integrated in the landscape model, the model did an excellent job of predicting participants memory for the TV news story (R2 = .76)."
2004-0547,"Messages from Teens on the Big Screen: Smoking, Drinking, and Drug Use in Teen-Centered Films",Paper,"Messages from Teens on the Big Screen: Smoking, Drinking, and Drug Use in Teen-Centered Films","Smoking, drinking and drug use endure as popular yet dangerous behaviors among American teenagers. Films have been cited as potential influences on teens attitudes toward and initiation of substance use. Social cognitive theory suggests that teen viewers may be especially likely to learn from teen models who they perceive as similar, desirable and attractive. Yet, to date, no studies have systematically analyzed teen characters in films to assess the frequency, nature and experienced consequences of substance use depictions. A content analysis of top grossing films from 1999, 2000, and 2001 was conducted to fill in this gap. Overall, two-fifths of teen characters drank alcohol, one-sixth smoked cigarettes, and one-seventh used illicit drugs (N=146). Almost no differences existed between substance users and non-users with regard to physical attractiveness, socioeconomic status, virtuosity, or gender. Drinkers and drug-users were unlikely to suffer any consequences  let alone negative consequences  in either the short or long term. Characters were rarely shown refusing offers to drink or do drugs, or regretting their substance usage. Girls were more likely than boys to be shown engaging in multiple substance use activities (e.g., smoking and drinking). Overall, recent teen-centered films may teach teen viewers that substance use is relatively common, mostly risk-free, and appropriate for anyone."

Also, although media across the globe are widely discussing the newly emerged phenomenon - metrosexuality - there is almost no academic research on this phenomenon. Since metrosexuality and masculinity are so closely related to each other, this study aims to explore both issues in a global perspective.

This study focuses on Esquire magazine, one of the leading mens magazines that published accordingly in 11 countries. In order to investigate masculinity and metrosexuality across distinct cultures, we have used the Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and the United States versions of Esquire in the period of three alternating issues in 2003 as the samples for the content analysis. Apart from the content analysis of both editorial content and advertisements, we have also examined the cover models and men images in these magazines qualitatively."
2004-0550,Metro Websites as Urban Communication,Paper,Metro Websites as Urban Communication,"In the information age, the Internet offers cities new opportunities to communicate with their constituents at a time when metropolitan areas struggle with their community identity and cohesion. However, decisions to mount official websites may be based on attempts to stay technologically trendy and/or to fulfill bureaucratic responsibilities rather than an understanding of public and civic communication principles and practices. This study examined how official websites of the core cities in the top 50 metropolitan areas represented their cities to the public as a whole as well as how the cities communicated with their residents and visitors via these websites. A research paradigm was proposed to serve as the conceptual framework for empirical exploration, based on Musso et als (2000) dualistic model by expanding it to include a mass communication model. Study findings revealed that the vast majorities of all sample sites contained high frequencies of information links to reflect all major communication functions."
2004-0551,Michel Foucault and Confessions of Jewishness in Post-1967 Israeli Cinema,Paper,Michel Foucault and Confessions of Jewishness in Post-1967 Israeli Cinema,"In this paper, I examine the representations of religious identity in post-1967 Israeli cinema. More specifically, I explore the social and cultural conditions within Israeli society that made the discursive construction of Jewishness central to the struggle for power. In so doing, I will apply Michel Foucaults work in The History of Sexuality, Volume I on the incitement to discourse. Whereas in the previous, Statist dominated era, Israeliness was measured in terms of quasi-religious devotion to the state and difference was ascribed to those groups who refused to sublimate their traditional or religious definitions of Judaism to the Zionist cause, Israel in the late 1960s and 1970s featured a less hierarchical system of power, with less repressive measures imposed on difference, where citizenship was discursively compelled to confess itself through its relationship to its Jewishness and this, in turn, became the terrain on which power was struggled over. As with other institutions, the media became a site of struggle where Jewishness was both compelled to confess itself and where resistance could be mounted via these same techniques of power. The incitement to confess ones Jewishness became both a means of subjugation and a source of identity politics for those forced to confess. As in the Statist period, Mizrachi Jews were the primary targets of the confessional technique, though now, for the first time, orthodox Jews also began to be recognized and interrogated."
2004-0552,Microscopic Investigation of Long-Term Exposure to Movie Smoking on Young Adults,Paper,Microscopic Investigation of Long-Term Exposure to Movie Smoking on Young Adults,"Our research was a first attempt to investigate the impact of over-time, repeated exposure to movie smoking on young adults on a microscopic level. It unveiled the interrelationships between exposure to movie smoking and a set of cognitive, affective, and coasive constructs. Within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), 12 hypotheses were tested and two path models were developed. Our findings pointed out direct and indirect behavioral and psychological effects of long-term exposure to movie smoking on young adults. Specifically, long-term continual exposure to movie smoking was found to directly increase young adults smoking intention. Further, repeated exposure to movie smoking cultivates young adults' favorable attitude toward smoking, which in turn augments their intention to smoke. Extensive exposure to movie smoking desensitizes young viewers to the addictive nature of cigarette smoking. Those who are addicted tend to make situational attributions rather than self-attributions. Contributions and limitations were also included at the end of the paper."

Borrowing insights from cultural approaches to journalists as an interpretive community of storytellers, I examine the ways in which reporters and editors interpret their experiences in producing news narratives on September 11 for their audiences. Conducting a feminist and semiotic analysis of stories that appeared in the American Journalism Review, Columbia Journalism Review, Communicator, Broadcast and Cable, and Quill, the paper shows that journalists public memories of their work relied on masculine metaphors of military and sport, elevated the work of male anchors, and privileged empiricist tasks of knowledge production over complex processes of writing and framing. Critical commentary on news representations judge the Internet as a failure, construct Daniel Pearl as a heroic archetype of journalism, and reproduce Orientalist images of Muslim men. In conclusion, the paper urges mass communication educators to encourage their students to apply judicious critical thinking to the didactic discourses they encounter in trade publications."

Shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Congress authorized the President to take all action necessary to fight the war on terrorism. Shortly thereafter, the President issued an order authorizing the use of military tribunals to try alleged terrorists. Some civil libertarians and scholars have expressed concerns that the use of military tribunals provided in the Presidents order infringes on Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial. Far less commentary has centered on First Amendment implications of this Executive Branch initiative. Here, I consider some possible First Amendment implications of this initiative that must be monitored as the war on terrorism ensues. Specifically, I place traditional notions of the right of the public to see and the right of the media to cover trials in the context of wartime."
2004-0555,Mining the Internet plateau: Predicting adoption intention of nonusers,Paper,Mining the Internet plateau: Predicting adoption intention of nonusers,"This study serves as one of initial efforts to examine specifically nonusers of the Internet. In many developed countries the diffusion of the Internet has slowed down since the beginning of the millennium. Using data from a telephone survey (N= 415), this study attempts to profile Internet nonusers in Singapore to better understand what is happening at this plateau or flat part of the growth curve. In addition to providing a descriptive account of nonusers, the study uses the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behavior (TPB) to identify the possible determinants of nonusers future adoption of the internet. Findings indicate that in addition to demographic factors, individuals attitudes toward the Internet and their perceived control over the possible impediments of using the Internet all provided independent contribution to the prediction of expectation to enter online world in the future. However, no independent effects were found for perception of others usage of the Internet."
2004-0556,Mobilizing Social Capital: Internets Role in a Historic Rally in Hong Kong,Paper,Mobilizing Social Capital: Internets Role in a Historic Rally in Hong Kong,"The study examines the relationship between Internet use and political participation by focusing on the concept of social capital. However, rather than focusing on whether Internet use would increase or decrease social capital, the present study asks a different question and interrogate how Internet may enable people to mobilize social capital. The main contention of the study is that the Internet could contribute to political participation by providing an important non-intrusive communication channel that allows citizens to mobilize already existing social capital for political purposes. The empirical analysis will focus on the case of a historic rally that happened in Hong Kong on July 1st, 2003, in which 500,000 citizens participated. The findings show that using the Internet to share political opinions and information is related to an earlier decision to participate in the rally, to specific modes of participating in the rally, and to perceived importance of the influence of acquaintances. Political use of the Internet itself, in turn, is related to the size and strength of friendship network that people have. Overall, the main argument is supported by the findings. The implications of the analysis to the study of the relationship between Internet, social capital, and political participation are discussed."

This study looks at the relationship between family communication pattern, perceived media influence, media use patterns, and family rulemaking as reported by middle school and college students using a comprehensive medialog. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the ability of perceived media influence, family communication pattern, and current media use to predict home media rule making. The results suggest that these variables are limited in their explanation of family media regulation. As predicted, family communication pattern was a small but significant predictor of media regulation. The authors provide suggestions for further research."

The Effect of Message Framing, Mood, and Message Quality on Information Seeking Regarding Genital Herpes","The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of framing, message quality, and mood on risky decisions such as talking to a partner about genital herpes. College aged students are sexually active, but they do not share their sexual history with sexual partners (Lucchetti, 1999). Measures must be taken to understand persuasive strategies that can be used to such ends. A secondary purpose of this study was to examine two competing hypotheses. On the one hand it might be argued that individuals will, in all conditions, be persuaded by mood congruent information. On the other hand, mood repair advocates might argue an interaction between moods and frame such that sad individuals be motivated by mood incongruent information, and happy individuals be motivated by mood congruent information.
It was hypothesized in this study, however, a three-way interaction, taking message quality into consideration. Mood congruency, is predicted to be enabled in weak message conditions. When messages are strong, however, mood incongruency is expected to rule systematic processing.
These data are mostly consistent with the advanced hypotheses. Data are consistent with mood incongruence for both positive and negative thoughts. These data are consistent with the proposed interaction with efficacy. Importantly, these data indicate that negatively framed messages are effective at changing specific outcomes. In particular, susceptibility perceptions are increased when the message is negative. But, positively framed messages are effective at changing other outcomes. In particular, perceptions of efficacy are high when persons read a positively framed message."

The Dose-Effect Relationship Between HIV/AIDS-Related Mass Media Exposure and HIV/AIDS Knowledge and Behavior Outcomes,"Exposure to entertainment-education-based mass media messages has long been associated with positive behavioral change. Numerous studies have revealed how mass media can serve to disseminate information about family planning, HIV/AIDS and other health issues, as well as shape perceptions and behavior related to these issues. Far fewer studies, however, have examined the dose effect of communication campaigns  the extent to which exposure to multiple channels and messages can influence knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of the audience.
Using data from a large mass media campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi -- North Indian states with low prevalence of HIV -- this study examines the relationship between multiple doses of exposure to a TV and radio campaign on HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS related knowledge, perceptions regarding routes of transmission, and various behaviors, including interpersonal communications and protective behavior. Results from this study suggest that exposure to higher doses of media messages, within a single mass media campaign can significantly enhance knowledge, improve correct perceptions and encourage interpersonal communication related to HIV/AIDS."
2004-0560,More Than Just a Trend: Females Fighting for a Permanent Place in Popular Music,Paper,More Than Just a Trend: Females Fighting for a Permanent Place in Popular Music,"In this paper, I examine the role of women DJs and their positioning within electronic/dance music (hereafter, E/DM) culture. E/DM is an overwhelmingly male-dominated field and it would be difficult to argue that E/DM has one specific center; this paper demonstrates how all of its circles are drawn around men. For the most part, both academic and popular accounts of E/DM maintain the widespread notion that men are the sole creators in these scenes and tend to overlook the dynamics and causes behind this male dominance. Nonetheless, despite the privileging of male activities in these scenes and narratives that discuss them, women are increasingly penetrating these spaces. Despite being overshadowed by their male counterparts women in increasing numbers are taking up the roles of producers and/or DJs. As such, the goal of this paper is two-fold. The first half of this paper is concerned with exposing some of the ways in which popular music culture and E/DM circles specifically, work to maintain a hegemonic, masculinist space. My second objective is to draw attention to some of the strategies women in music have adopted in the recent past to carve out a space for themselves in various popular music genres."
2004-0561,Mormonism as Tourism: The Visual Construct of Sacred History at Mormon Temple Square,Paper,Mormonism as Tourism: The Visual Construct of Sacred History at Mormon Temple Square,"In this study, I bring together two paradigms in an effort to examine Temple Square (an LDS tourist destination in Utah) as a postmodern spectacle. One approach recognizes that religion is a socially produced construct that is sustained largely through discourse (both textual and visual) that may at times be resisted or contested by the intended audience. The other approach, drawn from material culture and museum studies, emphasizes the impact of popular myths on the presentation and success of museum discourse. When brought together in an analysis of Temple Square, we discover (beneath the dominant message) the taken-for-granted assumptions about religious history and reality among Mormon believers. We also gain a better understanding of the manner in which the discourse of museumness is used on the square as a means of reducing dialectic readings of the preferred message."
2004-0562,Motivations for and Family Communication about Organ Donation: Applying the Transtheoretical Stages of Change Model,Paper,Motivations for and Family Communication about Organ Donation: Applying the Transtheoretical Stages of Change Model,"Building on past organ donation research that has applied the transtheoretical/stages of changes model to decisions to donate organs and to talk to ones family about ones organ donation decisions, the present study looked at the role of possible motivations for donation as moderating factors between the traditionally used decisional balance (attitudinal) items and the outcomes measures of stages of willingness to donate and to talk to ones family about donation. The data indicate that altruistic motivations (to do good) predict positive decisional balance items, and fear of loss of body parts predict negative decisional balance items. Motivations related to self image do not predict either set of decisional balance items. Both positive and negative decisional balance items are predictive of donation stage, as is fear of loss of body parts. Stage of willingness to talk to ones family about donation was predicted by fear of loss of body parts, negative decisional balance items, and stage of donation decision. The data indicate not only directions for organ donation message designers, but also a broader applicability of the transtheoretical/stages of change model than has been offered in past research."
2004-0563,Motivations for Minyan Membership: Personal Narratives of Jewish Elders,Paper,Motivations for Minyan Membership: Personal Narratives of Jewish Elders,"Jewish ethnographers hold a rich tradition which emphasizes self-reflexivity(Kugelmass 1988). Following in this tradition, as a Jewish ethnographer studying a small group of Jewish elders, I play the dual researcher roles of the ""me"" and the ""not me"". These roles afford me a unique opportunity to study Jewish elders who have met for more than ten years on a daily basis for a morning prayer service and then breakfast. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with participants and narratives recorded. Four narratives are selected for narrative analysis in response to the question, why did you join this group ? Using Labov's (1997) technique, five types of narrative structures are identified within each narrative. The evaluation in each narrative is further analyzed, as well as the chain of events of causality and objectivity. These factors are used to interpret the narratives in terms of identity and meaning making. Though there are limitation to the study, the value lie in the opportunity for participants to be heard as well as my own desire to record a generation of Jews who hold traditional cultural and religious beliefs as these beliefs become more diffuse in following generations."

Approaching the question of a Uses and Gratifications approach, 69 people were interviewed from three different public discussion space types and asked what motives draw them to use the Internet as a medium for political conversation. The answer to the question of is complicated. Interview participants explained that they enjoyed the opportunity to express their opinions, read others opinions, learn about current events, and learn about themselves through their participation. They enjoyed participating because they met new people, found the conversations entertaining, and liked arguing with people whose views they disliked or despised. They also sited the technological benefits of talking politics online compared to talking politics face-to-face. They appreciated the anonymity and the social distance of the channel characteristics of text-based channels.

Korea","The aim of this study was to understand the motives for using the Internet, and its associations with users attitudes, social values, and relational involvement. Also, this study attempted to crossculturally compare the difference in the pattern of motives and the associations among three countries  the US, the Netherlands, and S. Korea. The design of methods was based on examination and revision of uses and gratification approach toward Internet users. Findings from factor analysis revealed that information seeking and Self-Improvement were the dominant and common reasons for using the Internet across three countries. The differences in the composition of motives in each country were also reported. Strong correlations across countries were found between all the motives and satisfaction of the Internet. Expectation and positive evaluation of the Internet were also important attitudes associated with Internet use motives. Postmaterialist value showed strong association with motives of information seeking and Self-Improvement. Community involvement was significantly associated with Internet use motives in Korean users."
2004-0566,Multicultural Discourse in the Finnish Journalism,Paper,Multicultural Discourse in the Finnish Journalism,"Multiculturalism is analysed as a discourse which overlaps institutions and genres. It is influenced by the socio-cultural context, but it also carries the potential for social change. The media play an essential role constructing and defining the discourse.
This paper analyses four cases of the Finnish mainstream media in which multiculturalism is either a theme or the motivation for a story. The media uses mainly three strategies in intentionally positive and multicultural journalism: 1) Secured Otherness. Distance and difference is highlighted, 2) Ethnic Reflection. The majority reflects itself, 3) Super-Finnishness. Stereotypically Finnish qualities are stressed.
Multicultural discourse has become more salient in the Finnish society since the 1990s. The media initiatives for more balanced reporting, however, are still connected to ideas of assimilation and racism. Strangers are either encouraged to become us or pushed back towards the sphere of indifference with stereotypical categories or exotic qualities. Multicultural initiatives in the mainstream media tend to reconstruct the managerial position of the White Finn in the nation instead of offering spheres for the political will of ethnic minorities."
2004-0567,"'My Name is Janice, and My Daughter is a Lesbian': Youth Homosexuality and the Lifetime Original",Paper,"'My Name is Janice, and My Daughter is a Lesbian': Youth Homosexuality and the Lifetime Original","The Lifetime Original The Truth About Jane is a highly rated, award-winning telefilm and one of the first U.S. TV movies concerning teen lesbianism. It presents what seems to be a healthy, normative understanding of adolescence, in line with broader, liberal parental discourses of youth homosexuality. I argue, however, that this narrative is complicated because it risks fixing lesbian and gay sexual identity in essentialist terms, something that may serve an ultimate purpose of assuring straight parents that gay and lesbian children will grow up no different than other children. The identity work of the title character, Jane, and her mother, Janice, is examined using Foucaults understanding of confession as a ritual of discourse, which provides the means of producing the truth of ones sexuality and reducing guilt but is always constrained by being compelled and adjudicated, in this case by a straight viewer. The analysis also focuses on key extratextual elements of the films production and reception, which include being promoted as part of a commitment on the part of Lifetime to address pressing social issues and being produced in the context of womens television and for an audience comprised mostly of heterosexual wives and mothers. I conclude by positing the TV movie as a regulatory scheme for mediating the representation of the American family, one that seems flexible and open to reworking the very notion of family by incorporating new conceptions of youth homosexuality but that ultimately contains the specter of deviant sexuality."

In this essay, the poststructuralist reading advances an analysis of the temporary fixings of masculinity, ethnic identities, and foodways. Specifically, this interpretation is focused on the functions of mysteries, secrets, and mastery in structuring the film text. Three food symbols of varying complexity are examined: spaghetti and meatballs, timpano, and frittata. The food symbols contribute to the emotional tone of the text and to defining social relationships. Three different masculine identities emerge from the characters moral attitudes toward Italian foodways and their varying levels of mastery. Lastly, the impact of the present-past hybrid text on interpretation is developed throughout the analysis."

Such journals are referred to as ""major international"" journals. This analysis of ISI-data revealed that the attribute international is not always appropriate. On the contrary authors and editors from the US dominate most communication journals. A regression showed that age of a journal and an explicit stated international mission lead to a higher national diversity, while internationality of the associated organization or impact of a journal had no impact. The results suggest (1) to distinguish clearly between national and international communication journals and (2) to enlarge the ISI sample of national and international communication journals."
2004-0570,National Security and Freedom of the Press in Hong Kong,Paper,National Security and Freedom of the Press in Hong Kong,"When Britain and the Peoples Republic of China negotiated Hong Kongs return to Chinese sovereignty, they agreed to a one country, two systems formula for governing life in the former British colony. The unusual deal gave autonomy to Hong Kong, allowing it to keep freedoms like the right of expression and the right of association, unfettered capitalism and a common law legal system. But the PRC insisted on a catch: at an unspecified future date, Hong Kong had to pass national security laws.
In February 2003, the Hong Kong government released draft legislation for laws including sedition, treason, theft of state secrets and subversion. Journalists, in particular, feared the governments reaffirmation of draconian colonial laws under the shadow of mainland China, where more than 30 journalists remain in custody, mostly on charges of subversion and theft of state secrets. Journalists worried about how these crimes would be defined in Hong Kong. Would the legislation be able to establish a clear line between publishing comments of dissent and committing acts of sedition and subversion? Do journalists ''steal'' a state secret if they publish a leaked government document? Would there be a continued separation between Hong Kong and the PRC when two systems protect one country? These questions remain unanswered. After a massive rally on July 1 of 500,000 Hong Kongers, including many journalists, the government rescinded the proposed legislation and postponed the process indefinitely. The government, however, vowed to complete its work. This paper examines the nature of the proposed legislation and the impact of the underlying issues on Hong Kongs famed freewheeling media."
2004-0571,Nationwide Newspaper Coverage of Genetically Modified Foods: A Community Structure Approach,Paper,Nationwide Newspaper Coverage of Genetically Modified Foods: A Community Structure Approach,"ABSTRACT
Agricultural scientists believe they can build better crops and livestock by enhancing the cells genetic makeup, crafting enhanced edibles called genetically modified foods (GMF). This study investigates how newspapers from different cities in the United States have reported on Genetically Modified Foods. Employing a ""community structure approach,"" this study sampled all articles 500 words or longer on the topic in a national cross-section of 21 newspapers in major cities (yielding 357 articles), exploring hypotheses linking different city characteristics and newspaper coverage of the topic. City characteristics included: percent professional/technical occupations, percent unemployed and value of farmland.

Using content analysis, a single score, Pollocks Media Vector, was calculated to combine prominence given to articles in newspapers as well as reporting direction (favorable, balanced/neutral, or unfavorable). Media Vector coefficients ranging from .434 to -.340 demonstrated clear national variation. Pearson correlations and regression analysis found privilege (high percent of professional and technical workers in a city or surrounding county) correlated with unfavorable coverage of GMF (r = -.766; p = .000), supporting a Violated Buffer hypothesis: The greater the proportion of privileged groups buffered from economic uncertainty, the less favorable the coverage of biological threats or threats to a cherished way of life. By contrast, the larger the vulnerable (in this case percent unemployed) population, the more favorable the coverage of GMF (r = .443; p - .022). Coverage in midwest/ central areas tended to favor GMF, while coastal papers generally opposed their development, growth, and consumption."

This study specifically examined the nursing role contradictions which emerged in team communication and identified the discursive processes by which nurses negotiate role tensions. Analysis of interview transcripts with 50 participants and observational field notes revealed three role dialectics that reflect over-arching issues of hierarchy, status, and professional identity that challenge nurses' communication in the healthcare team. Findings also identified the specific communication strategies nurses use to manage the role contradictions created in team interactions. Theoretical and pragmatic conclusions are drawn regarding the evolving role of professional nurses in healthcare teams."

Judging from small markets of new networks/broadcasters and hence their insufficient production budgets for originals, we can assume that they might be dependent on imported programming. Our research demonstrates that the U.S. fictional programming, which is offered by foreign-owned cable and premium networks, drives the average percentage of imported programming on the new networks/broadcasters."

The author discusses how Internet-based communication challenges some of the traditional assumptions underlying content methodologies. Because this new class of media has been primarily defined in terms of delivery protocol, and not in terms of the end product of the communication process, it has been confusing for researchers to produce discourse about its communication process.
Furthermore, the author identifies and discusses key differences in the structural attributes of Internet-based communication formats and concludes with suggestions concerning future directions for new media content research."

The design and predictions are based on Prospect Theory (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), Social Comparison Theory (Festinger, 1954; Wills, 1981), and other theory and research on framing. The article was framed either positively (e.g., using sunscreen keeps skin healthy) or negatively (e.g., not using sunscreen leads to skin cancer risk), and included a personal example (a healthy individual or one diagnosed with pre-cancerous skin lesions). Respondents completed measures of their social comparison orientation and perceived similarity to the exemplar. Dependent measures included risk perception, intent to use sunscreen, and planned SFP level. Compared to a control group, both the positive and negative frames increased intentions to use sunscreen. Mens planned SPF level was higher in the negative frame, whereas womens planned SPF level was higher in the positive frame. Social comparison orientation tended to reduce perceived risk in the negative frame (suggesting downward comparison), but tended to increase perceived risk in the positive frame (suggesting upward comparison). Respondents with a higher social comparison orientation reported less intention to use sunscreen and a lower planned SPF level. Similarity to the exemplar was associated with greater perceived risk, independent of the frame. Finally, perceived similarity was associated with greater intentions to use sunscreen and a higher planned SPF, but only in the positive frame. Interpretations of the findings and implications for risk communication are discussed."
2004-0577,"News coverage of social protests and the effects of photographic framing, issue, and prior attitudes",Paper,"News coverage of social protests and the effects of photographic framing, issue, and prior attitudes","A paradigm that frames most protests as police versus protesters and that generally deligitmizes protests has been identified in studies of news coverage of social movements. The current study used an experimental design to examine the influence of photographic framing, social issue, and prior attitudes toward protests and protesters in general on evaluations of protesters and social issues in the stimulus materials. Results indicated that evaluations of protests and protesters portrayed in fictitious news stories varied according to the issue and that visual framing affected those evaluations only for one issue. Prior attitudes toward protests and protesters were not predictive of evaluations of the protests or protesters portrayed in the news stories. Findings suggest the need to address possible nuances associated with the social issue as well as visuals alone when examining effects of news coverage of social movements and protests."

Data collected from four different mainstream newspapers over a four-month period. Textual analysis indicated that Turkish press embodied a victim blaming attitude and emphasized victims morality, their adherence to gender norms, their careless or provocative behavior, and even accused them of inventing the crime. The stories are developed in a paradoxical frame in which the narrative that males are only victims of their passion and obsession for women is juxtaposed with contentions hinted in the stories that signal male dominance in the society."

Although his is an important concern, we should consider whether it is sufficient for young people simply to participate, or if it is also important that they participate in an informed way.
Young people might be more likely to become informed if news were presented in a format that they found engaging. A number of news outlets have been designing news for the younger citizens of our democracy. This paper presents data from ten interviews with producers of news for young people. The findings provide an overview of what producers think young people want from news as well as ideas for creating more high quality news aimed at younger people.

Through observations of and interviews with an editorial board, and responses from 1643 survey respondents, an editorial boards thoughts about endorsements were compared with the actual use readers made of endorsements in order to assess whether the boards perceptions of the endorsements matched readers reality. In some cases, the board members' assumptions accurately reflected readers responses, but in others, their assumptions diverged from the survey results."

For the first time, psychological variables investigated in current experimental research, particularly the motivational concept of minimal and maximal goals (Brendl & Higgings, 1996), are operationalized in content analyses and measured in a medial context. Television news from four major German television stations as well as newspaper articles by two prestige papers within a one year period are examined. Content analyses are supposed to replicate prior findings and to build the data basis for cluster analyses used to specify typical formal and plot structures of news reports about immigrants. These reports are shown to a representative sample of German television viewers in order to learn more about recipients cognitive and affective processing of this information. Consequently, media effects can be measured on a direct behavioral level including attitude formation as well as viewers habits and behavioral routines."

However, several issues have lingered to hinder the comprehensive and clear understanding of the political learning process. The present study reviews chronic problems in political learning literature. Especially this study proposes the necessity of detailed measurements for independent variables (i.e., news exposure and political discussion) as well as a dependent variable (i.e., political knowledge). In addition, we test our hypotheses using data from an experimental design with an adult sample. Preliminary findings suggest these diverse and detail measures of the independent variables and dependent variable can produce surprisingly different results of political learning. In other words, our conclusion varies depending on the ways we measure the independent variables and dependent variable, which reemphasizes the importance of measurement issues in political learning."

Drawing on theories regarding writing processes and cognitive psychology, this essay proposes a model in which news writing is understood as a problem-solving process that relies upon story schemata constructed by individual journalists and stored in their long-term memory. The use of story schemata is influenced by a variety of social and individual factors, some of which may lead journalists to reject established schemata in search of novel or creative solutions to the problems presented by the task of doing news work. Empirical support for the model and suggestions for research are also considered."

The main focus of the study is to compare various direct and mediated channels in order to examine their use in building and maintaining relationships. Research indicates that newer communication channels may displace the use of more traditional communication channels. The current study examines this in terms of six forms of communication: face-to-face, telephone, email, instant messaging, on-line chat, and handwritten letter. Furthermore, past research on relationships has indicated that relationship characteristics and maintenance strategies differ depending on the type of intimate relationship considered. The current study examines relationship characteristics and maintenance strategies as they pertain to non-intimate relationships, specifically a close friendship and close family member. Questionnaire data were used to examine three research questions pertaining to media displacement, relationship characteristics and maintenance strategies, and communication media use. Findings indicate that displacement is not prevalent in that newer communication channels are not replacing traditional communication channels. Furthermore, relationship characteristics and maintenance strategies and communication channel use differ depending on the type of relationship considered. Specific findings are discussed."
2004-0585,"New Women At Risk: Pathologizing Bleeding, Eating, Birth, Distress, and Aging",Paper,"New Women At Risk: Pathologizing Bleeding, Eating, Birth, Distress, and Aging","This paper argues that hysteria shares numerous symptoms with other periods in western history during which womens bodies and behaviors of women have been pathologized. It tracks these similarities by deconstructing the symptoms ascribed to different disorders applied to women, including neurosis in the 1950s, personality disorders and post traumatic stress disorder in the 1980's, and in the latter 20th century, depression. Even while psychiatric literature describes depression as a disease that doesnt discriminate, this study argues that the psychiatric discourse works specifically to dub womens coping mechanisms and low productivity as dysfunctional. By drawing out the similarities among 20th century female disorders, the study contends that depression and depression-linked diagnoses have become normalized in the late 20th century. More, this cultural comfort with naming womens distress as disorder has allowed for new technologies of behavioral discipline to arise, namely activities of self-scrutiny, self-diagnosis, an appetite for psychopharmaceutical drugs and self-conducted treatments, and finally, new diagnosis created by mainstream media."

2004-0587,Non-Zero-Sum Gaze and Persuasion,Paper,Non-Zero-Sum Gaze and Persuasion,"Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) are simulations in which geographically separated individuals interact in shared digital space. Unlike videoconferences, which transmit direct video streams, CVEs naturalistically track actions of each interactant and then display those actions onto avatars, digital, three-dimensional models. Because an avatars actions are constantly reconstructed in real-time, interactants can transform their avatars nonverbal behaviors strategically. This paper examines non-zero-sum gaze (NZSG), a transformation in which a given interactants natural head movements are augmented by an algorithm that transmits his or her gaze directly at two people simultaneously. Furthermore, both NZSG gaze recipients perceive that they are the sole recipient of the gaze. In the current study, a presenter read a persuasive passage to two listeners. Results showed that participants did not detect NZSG. Moreover, females were more persuaded by NZSG than other gaze conditions while males recalled more verbal information from the passage than females. Implications for behavioral theories governing the influence of gaze as well as the design and applications of CVEs are discussed."

Online fans of the science fiction series Farscape have created the campaign with the goal of returning this cancelled show to production. Participants in the campaign are employing forms of online communication such as e-mail and World Wide Web pages as tools for mobilizing collective resources in what might best be called online fan activism. Prior research has depicted media fandom as a form of media consumption but has failed to explore the ways in which material structures the non-virtual world may affect the social and discursive resources at play in online communities. A political economy of online fandom activity is advocated, one that would take into account the ways that online fan groups tend to be productive media consumers, the way these groups may threaten to liberate these texts from the authority imposed by the media industries, and social nature of online fan groups involved in goal-centered social action."
2004-0589,Nothing Comes Between Me and My CPU: Smart Clothes in the Digital Enclosure,Paper,Nothing Comes Between Me and My CPU: Smart Clothes in the Digital Enclosure,"The promise of interactivity is quietly but systematically undergoing a downgrade that will require a lot less activity on the part of the user  and a lot more on the dispersed smart objects that will eventually populate their lives. According to the promoters of emerging forms of ubiquitous computing we wont have to remember details of conversations, directions, scheduling, or even our own consumer preferences, since smart devices embedded in our clothing will keep track of them for us. This paper reads the promotional literature on smart clothes through the lens of Benjamins discussion of fetishism and flanerie, considering the ways in which such clothes provide a mobile form of bourgeois interiority: a casing that allows the user to make an individualized impression on the world. The promise is one of comfort and convenience, which is offered in exchange for the ability to gather detailed information about consumers. Smart clothing realizes the phantasmagoria of the commodity world described by Benjamin  one in which the commodities embark on a life of their own, taking on the active role ceded by the pacified consumer. At the same time, one can recognize in the digitally encased-consumers the after-image of the flaneur (and the sandwichman) insofar as each participates in the work of being watched. The paper concludes with a discussion of the uncanniness of this re-emergent form of commodity fetishism and its relation to one of the recurring themes of the uncanny: the [digital] double."
2004-0590,Nunavut: DIY Cultural Identity and Inuit Television,Paper,Nunavut: DIY Cultural Identity and Inuit Television,"To date, much has been written on the development of northern broadcast policy in Canada and its continuing impact on Inuit access to modes of video production and distribution. This essay expands the discussion of Inuit broadcasting in Northern Canada to encompass actual texts, about which little have been written. Specifically, this essay will focus on Nunavut, a thirteen-part television series produced in 1994-95 by Igloolik Isuma Productions, an Inuit production company located in the north Baffin region of the eastern arctic. Nunavut is considered the first, and only dramatic series to be created entirely by Inuit. Set in 1945, the series has been singled out for its unique visual style and narrative structure. Given not only the complex history of broadcast policy in Canada, but also the ongoing cultural, economic and political struggles faced by Inuit over the loss of their language (Inuktituk) and traditional ways of life, ever-increasing unemployment and the battle to control their own political destiny, it is safe to say that Nunavut did not emerge out of thin air. I will argue that Nunavut emerges at a moment of profound potential change for Canadas northern Inuit population, as self-government and the creation of a separate territory of Nunavut in 1999 loom on the horizon. Most strikingly, I argue that Nunavut provides a site where Inuit can both learn and practice their cultural identities, and, by situating the series just prior to Inuit forced settlement by the Canadian government but after initial contact with white men, poses important questions regarding the type of self-government Inuit will choose to embrace in a newly formed territory in which they constitute the majority."

Methods: Thirty-seven older women were interviewed in-depth in their homes. Questions included: What do you like and do not like about growing old? and What would you attribute your long life to? Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded twice. Responses were classified into: financially independent/healthy, financially dependent/healthy, financially independent/not healthy and financially dependent/not healthy groups. Results: Average age was 77.7 years;50 percent were homeowners; 34 percent were subsidized housing residents; 58 percent lived alone. Declining health and limited financial resources reduced opportunities to pursue well-being in old age. Financially independent/healthy women enumerated multiple positive elements whereas financially dependent/not healthy women enumerated numerous negative elements about growing old. Financially independent/not healthy women and financially dependent/healthy women were limited by their lack of mobility and resources to pursue opportunities for well-being, respectively. The womens strategies for living long and healthy lives had both physical and mental elements. The most cited physical and mental health strategies were avoiding risk behaviors, having a positive outlook, maintaining relationships with family, friends and a divinity, and altruism. Conclusions: Health promotional efforts should consider the health and financial status of the individual. The unhealthy groups would benefit most from treatment interventions both for physical and mental needs. Financially independent/healthy women could benefit from preventive interventions since their concerns rested with future health deterioration."
2004-0593,'Old' Media into New: Theorizing Narrative Structures,Paper,'Old' Media into New: Theorizing Narrative Structures,"The hype about hypermedia's potential to disrupt, transform and overturn the prevailing 2,500 year old tradition in dramatic and fictional narrative is frequently prominent in utopian and deterministic discourse on new media in popular culture. This essay will consider theoretical writings by three critical thinkers who show the relationship between narrative structures in older and new media forms to be ongoing, complex, and contested.
Manovich (2001) uses semiotic theory to analyze what he calls the fundamental forms of new media, the database and the algorithm, in comparison to cinema. Landow (1997) looks at the relationship between hypertext and literary theory, and argues that the former manifests and actualizes many of the ideas of the latter. Murray (1999) writes on the potential for new media narrative from the perspective of a literary scholar, building on insights from, among much else, the 19th century novel and epic poetry narrative forms.
Perhaps the most important issue among many in considering how narrative structures are affected between ""old"" and new media is what is popularly called ""interactivity,"" or what Murray (1999) more meaningfully terms ""agency."" The impact on and meaning for narrative of increased user control over the order and direction of events, characters, settings, and other elements is an important theme for the three theorists considered here. Among the questions raised are how the pleasures, ideological uses, and other functions of older narratives will change with greater user agency, and indeed whether the new form can properly be called a narrative at all."

This study advances a new construct, online community experience (OCE) to enhance our understanding of customer interactions in such online product communities. The study proposes a research model that focuses on the impact of customers online community experience on their product-related perceptions and attitudes. The model also identifies the antecedents or determinants of customers online community experience. The research model was validated using data collected from a sample of 96 student subjects through a set of two questionnaires. Analysis of the study data using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique indicates strong support for the key study hypotheses. The paper discusses the study findings and their important implications for future research."

The authors argue that older people engage with computers in a context constituted by discourses positioning older people as declining in the ability to learn skills such as computing, but creating a burden on society if they do not. In this paradoxical context, participants identified emotional and material barriers, as well as negative consequences to computer use that are shaped by age and gender. Yet in the face of such challenges, many older people have taken up the challenge of computer use, largely to achieve the benefits of connectedness and mental stimulation. Their doing so may be seen as both reproducing and resisting oppressive discourses."

It conceptualizes online news media as interactive community bulletin boards, and evaluates their performance in informing and educating the public as well as building community linkage under crisis situation. Due to media censorship, online news media in Mainland China were under great constraints in reporting the epidemic at the early stage. Nevertheless, after mid-April, online news sites in Mainland China, along with their counterparts in Hong Kong and Taiwan, had fulfilled their roles of interactive community bulletin board by widely delivering warnings and advice about the epidemic. Among the three regions, only the online news media in Hong Kong were able to play an active role in community building and social cohesion. However, the role of interactive community bulletin board led the online news coverage skewing to brief, fragmented and non-analytical reporting."
2004-0597,Online Privacy and Security: The Discrepancy between Online Policies and Consumer Perceptions,Paper,Online Privacy and Security: The Discrepancy between Online Policies and Consumer Perceptions,"Online purchasing decisions critically depend upon the consumers willingness to trust the online merchant. Quite simply, if potential purchasers feel apprehensive about the privacy and security of their online transactions, they will not make purchases. As a result, online retailers (or e-tailers) not only must analyze carefully the security of their online purchasing systems, but they must also develop privacy policies to address consumer concerns. Equally important, online merchants must effectively communicate their policies to potential customers so as to allay their fears about providing information to the vendor. As communication researchers, we were skeptical that these posted policies directly and effectively addressed the critical concerns of online shoppers. We hypothesized that online privacy and security statements would be fraught with the language of system security and legal privacy protection rather than the language of consumer concerns. To test this proposition, we first surveyed 387 persons and elicited their online privacy and security concerns using an open-ended format. Next, we downloaded 500 privacy/security policies posted on the Internet by online vendors. Finally, in order to assess the degree of correspondence between policy language and the language of users themselves, we content-analyzed the texts from both samples and then constructed a perceptual mapping for each. Based upon a comparison of the two samples, and drawing upon script and schema theories, we offer recommendations for ensuring that online privacy/security statements effectively address consumers fears regarding the safety and appropriate use of their private information."
2004-0598,On the importance of feeling trusted: Exploring possible correlates of journalists perceptions of audience trust,Paper,On the importance of feeling trusted: Exploring possible correlates of journalists perceptions of audience trust,"A sample of Israeli journalists (n= 209) were asked whether they feel Israeli audiences trust the Israeli media in general, and whether their audience trusts the work of their news media outlet in particular. The correlates of these survey items are examined to explore possible sources and consequences of perceived trust for journalists. Results show that perceived audience trust is not correlated with most demographic and professional status variables. Perceived audience trust was correlated with journalists own trust in the Israeli media and with journalists evaluation of the audience. Perceived trust was also positively correlated with journalists identification with professional standards such as neutrality, verification and factualness. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed."
2004-0599,On the Relation between Three Conversational Forms and Attitudinal Accuracy Judgments,Paper,On the Relation between Three Conversational Forms and Attitudinal Accuracy Judgments,"An inherent component of communication is that speakers come to understand the views of each other (Heider, 1958). A question remains as to how accurate attributions are formed as a function of conversation. Based on pragmatic principles, predictions are developed regarding the attitudinal palpability of three conversational forms: perspective display (Maynard, 1991), candidate answer offers (Pomerantz, 1988), and verbal reinforcement (Insko, 1965). An empirical study assessed the predictions. Participants (N = 127) conversed with a confederate who employed one of these three forms. Results from a binomial test indicate that accurate attitudinal accuracy is associated with the perspective display and candidate answer forms, but not with the reinforcement sequence. Individual difference variables indicate that accuracy judgments do not vary by self-monitoring and attraction, but they do with involvement: low involvement enhances accuracy in contrast to high. These findings serve to refine a pragmatic model of conversational impacts on other perception."
2004-0600,Organisational structure of participatory media: Flirt FM: a case study,Paper,Organisational structure of participatory media: Flirt FM: a case study,"In this paper I address the issue of the role of volunteers in the management of community radio stations. Firstly, I use Habermas' theory of communicative action to derive a theoretical basis for a model of how volunteers should be involved. Secondly, I use this model to examine the case study of Flirt FM, an Irish student radio station. The AMARC community radio charter for Europe states that community radio stations ""operate management, programming and employment practices which oppose discrimination and which are open and accountable to all supporters, staff and volunteers"". Starting from this premise, I examine the theories of Jürgen Habermas, and derive six factors which I believe will assist us in examining whether structures do meet this requirement. The six factors are the existence of public spaces; volunteer morale; fair access for all; rationality of knowledge; solidarity of participants; colonisation by systems. I use these factors to examine the situation in Flirt FM, using a mixture of questionnaires, document review and interviews. I conclude that Flirt FM has few public spaces, resulting in low volunteer cohesion. Participation by certain groups is below expectations, though volunteer morale is generally high. I conclude by making recommendations that should help to improve the situation within the station."
2004-0601,Organizational Assimilation and Communication Technology Use,Paper,Organizational Assimilation and Communication Technology Use,"Studies of organizational members socialization information-seeking have focused on traditional channels for uncertainty reduction (e.g., face-to-face communication and traditional technologies like employee handbooks) and on the experiences of newcomers. This investigation extends organizational socialization research by examining a variety of socialization experiences (not just those of newcomers) and considering Advanced Communication and Information Technology (ACIT) as an additional channel for socialization-related information. This study explored the relationship between three channels for information-seeking (face-to-face communication, traditional media, and ACIT) and perceived socialization effectiveness. Predictors of employee selection and use of ACITs also were examined, including perceptions of media richness and social presence, and user responses to their technology experiences were assessed among 405 employees of four organizations. Face-to-face communication is the most important predictor of assimilation effectiveness, followed by ACIT use. Least important are traditional technologies. Media characteristics, as elucidated in two prominent theories of organizational communication technology use, predicted individuals selection and use of ACITs. Finally, a typology of members behavioral responses to feedback regarding their ACIT use was derived, which revealed that users respond by continuing current practices, supplementing the channel, discontinuing use, expanding use, or learning new uses-or implement a variety of these."
2004-0602,Organizational Culture as Revealed through the Analysis of Discourse: Micropractices of a High-Technology Public-Sector Team,Paper,Organizational Culture as Revealed through the Analysis of Discourse: Micropractices of a High-Technology Public-Sector Team,"Scholars have called for multidimensional approaches to communication research. In response, this paper offers an example where two approaches can be constructively combined: cultural analysis and analysis of discourse. Past approaches using both orientations have tended to foreground one approach or the other. The site of analysis is a high-technology, public-sector bureaucracy undergoing a planned change initiative. Part of a three-year study, this paper presents the results from cultural analysis using analysis of discourse to illustrate the moment-by-moment production of culture. The ultimate goal of gaining insight into organizational practices by combining these orientations is to explore new ways in which to apply communication research."
2004-0603,Organizational Image and Consequences of Information about Corporate Social Performance: A Cognitive Perspective,Paper,Organizational Image and Consequences of Information about Corporate Social Performance: A Cognitive Perspective,"While a wealth of studies consider or examine effects of corporate social performance on organizational image, few studies examine psychological processes that may mediate those effects. The current study employed an experimental design to begin to examine how previously formed, summary attitudes versus consideration of specific information about CSP affected intended behaviors toward organizations. In general, participants relied on summary attitudes toward stimulus organizations. However, when fear of making an invalid decision was stimulated participants were more likely to consider specific attributes of organizations (such as CSP) when making decisions about them. Possible implications of these findings for a broader understanding of organizational image and suggestions for future studies of cognitive effects of CSP are provided."
2004-0604,Our historians: the court and the FCC. Foreign ownership regulations and legislative history as a framing device,Paper,Our historians: the court and the FCC. Foreign ownership regulations and legislative history as a framing device,"While policy analysts are generally concerned with contemporary problems that they investigate via contemporary sources of information, most of them rely on legislative history to establish the purpose of legislation. Through the analysis of foreign ownership policy in the twentieth century, I demonstrate that conventional legislative history is best understood as a framing device, a purposeful representation of the past in the service of current policy objectives. Therefore, to fully understand the development of communications policy, researchers would benefit both from historical research about the origins of legislation and from investigating the development of its conventional legislative history. In our case, archival research directs attention to the security of the communications infrastructure as the primary rationale for the rules, whose lasting importance for the military departments illuminates continuity with the past. By contrast, the FCC's focus on propaganda as the main security rationale has contributed to a significant change: the deregulation of conduit media."
2004-0605,Overcoming Ethnocentrism: Exploring the Potential for Positive and Normative Theories in International Public Relations,Paper,Overcoming Ethnocentrism: Exploring the Potential for Positive and Normative Theories in International Public Relations,"While raising the problematic issue of applying normative theory to international settings, the current study examined multinational corporations (MNCs) PR practices by employing positive theory as an alternative theoretical framework for international public relations. Based on literature from a positive contingency theory of conflict management in public relations, we explored how MNCs are practicing public relations in Korea and what contingency factors impact MNCs stances in conflict situations. We accomplished this by interviewing CEOs and client leaders in leading PR agencies whose major clients are MNCs present in Korea.
Key findings from the current study are that fear factor plays a critical role in MNCs taking more accommodating stances under conflict situations with local publics. MNCs tend to move toward accommodation stances based on their fear of Korean media and local culture regardless of the presence of two-way symmetrical communications with publics involved. More specifically, accommodations seemed to occur from interactions between one-way communication (i.e., local publics claims) and MNCs fear of media or publics involved. This finding implies that one-way communication does not always result in advocacy as is claimed in Western cultures."
2004-0606,Overexposed: Issues of Public Gender Imaging,Paper,Overexposed: Issues of Public Gender Imaging,"Advertising is acknowledged as a source of ideas about the world affecting attitudes and behaviors. Estimates suggest the average consumer is exposed to 3,000 messages a day (Kuntz, et al., 1996; Lloyd, 1999). One medium, outdoor, is ubiquitous and any surface that can convey a message is a valuable commodity.
Researchers have analyzed advertising from a variety of perspectives, primarily focusing on the output of production, including symbolism and effects of texts. Gender issues, such as sex-role stereotyping in messages, are typically part of advertising content analyses. Rare in literature are studies that examine the social process by which advertising is produced. Surprisingly sparse are investigations about outdoor, a medium that cannot be missed in any view of public space.
This study centers in the social aspects of creation and production of outdoor advertising visuals. An integrated approach combines review of images with in-depth interviews of advertising practitioners. Issues of gender images are highlighted."
2004-0607,Parental Mediation of Childrens Video Game Playing: A Similar Construct as Television Mediation.,Paper,Parental Mediation of Childrens Video Game Playing: A Similar Construct as Television Mediation.,"Through an internet-survey of 536 parent-child dyads, the authors researched which mediation strategies parents used for their childrens (8-18 years) video gaming. As in previous research on television mediation, principal factor analyses revealed the same strategies for parents and children: restrictive mediation, evaluative mediation and conscious co-playing. Mediation was most strongly predicted by the age of the child and the game behavior of the parents. Furthermore, parents were more restrictive and evaluative when they feared negative behavioral and attitudinal effects. Parents who were inclined to game together with their children expected positive social-emotional effects of gaming. Playing inappropriate games mostly occurred when parents were not very restrictive."
2004-0608,Parents third person perceptions regarding the influence of television: Rebelde Way in Israel,Paper,Parents third person perceptions regarding the influence of television: Rebelde Way in Israel,"Using the framework of the third person effect, this study examines parents' perceptions of the influence of a youth-targeted telenovela, on their own versus other children. Survey data (N = 132) demonstrate that parents perceived the show to have greater impact on other children than on their own. Consistent with prior findings on ""the social distance corollary"" of the third person effect, the perceived influence of the show was stronger for children who were more socially remote from ones own. In addition, regression analyses show that parents who thought that the show had an influence on their own children tended to monitor their child's TV viewing. In contrast, parents concerned about the influence on other children tended to monitor and examine their child's choice of friends."
2004-0609,Participation in International Governance Regime by the Rest of the World: An Analysis of ICANN,Paper,Participation in International Governance Regime by the Rest of the World: An Analysis of ICANN,"This paper explores the participation, policy agendas, and effectiveness of representatives from outside of North America and Europe in ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)s processes. ICANN is an important and interesting example of how the Internet and e-commerce are creating new forms of international governance. ICANN is a private corporation, newly created at the end of 1998. How does the unique ICANN approach to an international governance problem affect the rest of the world (ROW) than the U.S.? Does the reliance on a private sector organization with some channels open to civil society participation make representation of ROW needs and interests easier or harder? How effectively have ROW actors participated in ICANNs regimes? What procedures and substantive policies would improve the benefits received by the ROW in the ICANN process? Relying on the case of South Korea for empirical evidence, the paper attempts to establish a general framework for analyzing this problem."
2004-0610,Partnerships and Public Service: Normative Issues for Journalists in Converged Newsrooms,Paper,Partnerships and Public Service: Normative Issues for Journalists in Converged Newsrooms,"Growing numbers of journalists are producing content not only for their own employer but also for other media outlets with which that employer has a business relationship. As media companies test and implement permutations of newsroom convergence, challenges for journalists include issues related to the normative dimension of professionalism.

This paper, based on case studies in four converged news markets, explores journalists perceptions of normative pressures in this new media environment, particularly in relation to the overarching professional concept of public service. The findings suggest that although journalists do not see convergence itself as posing significant normative problems, they do raise concerns related to specific components of public service, including a commitment to accuracy, an avoidance of sensationalism, and independence from economic pressures. Overall, however, many of their concerns are with the potential for ethical standards to be compromised rather than with current reality."
2004-0611,Passing the Love Along: An Intergenerational Study of Family Communication and Love Styles,Paper,Passing the Love Along: An Intergenerational Study of Family Communication and Love Styles,"Children learn about attachment, love and security from their early caregivers, typically their parents (sic)...these earliest lessons are linked in some ways to adult abilities to forge successful relationships (Inman-Amos, Hendrick, & Hendrick, 1994).
From the research on family and romantic relationships, it has been found that both experiences gained through interaction with family members and the way those experiences are processed cognitively impact attributions about relationships both positively and negatively (Bryant & Conger, 2002). This study used a matched pairs sample of 76 undergraduates and their parents to test for (a) a family communication orientation and (b) a love style connection between two generations. A combination of two instruments plus five relational and seven demographic questions are used. Utilizing both the (a) Revised Family Communication Patterns (RFCP) Inventory (Ritchie & Fitzpatrick, 1990) and the (b) Love Attitudes Scale (LAS; Hendrick & Hendrick, 1990), it was found that parent conformity-orientation is predictive of both conversation and conformity-orientations of their young adult children. In particular, as the parents conformity within their family increased (the desire for children to obey the rules of the home as established by the parents), the young adults reported lower family conversation-orientation which translates into less open discussion of ideas. Parents and young adults scores were significantly different in four of the six love styles: Eros, Ludus, Pragma, and Mania. Further, it was found that parent conversation-orientation is predictive of Mania love style among young adult children while the young adults conversation-orientation is predictive of Pragma love style."
2004-0612,Pathways to the Wireless Promise Land: Advances in Wireless Technology and Their Implications for Spectrum Policy,Paper,Pathways to the Wireless Promise Land: Advances in Wireless Technology and Their Implications for Spectrum Policy,"The intense policy debate over privatization (property rights) versus commons spectrum-governing regimes has profound implications on how wireless communications services will be structured in our society. In this debate, one major parting point between the two sides is whether latest advances in wireless technologies have the power to eradicate spectrum scarcity, which has been the rationale for government regulation over wireless communications since 1927 and is property right proponents main argument for implementing spectrum privatization rather than adopting a commons regime.
Commons proponents believe that technology will free us from spectrum scarcity and their arguments are often based on four promising new technologies: mobile ad hoc networking, ultra-wideband, smart antenna, and software radio. This paper examines these technologies technical characteristics and limitations, as well as their policy implications. When practical implementation and coordination issues are taken into consideration, these new technologies still carry a lot of uncertainty and there are important tradeoffs to be made such as that between signal reach and interference. These issues are likely to compromise the potential of these new technologies and complicate policy designs for the commons governing-regime."
2004-0613,Patient-Physician Communication and The Value of Listening,Paper,Patient-Physician Communication and The Value of Listening,"Topic: Patient-physician communication is a large and diverse body of literature with many authors making claims of which communication skills or attributes are the most important. Purpose: In an effort to understand which skills or attributes are truly the most important, this paper critically evaluates one single skill, listening, via a thorough and exhaustive published literature review to assess its value in patient-physician communication. Results: The value of listening in patient-physician communication was unable to be established. Conclusion: Further research is warranted to (a) appropriately and consistently define what listening is in the healthcare environment, and (b) clearly establish what types of listening are most appropriate in which specific contexts and domains."

This study explores the compliance-gaining strategies utilized by student activists in their work with administrators in affecting campus change. The topic is studied through the frame of superior-subordinate communication in the organizational context of the university. Twenty-four interviews were conducted with student activists through a collaborative effort between scholars in the departments of communication studies and higher education. A qualitative analytical approach to the data yielded four compliance-gaining strategies of student activists: upward influence, persistence, peer networking, and mass media. The analysis serves as an initial step in developing more satisfactory communicative experiences as between student activists and administrators. The limitations of the study and implications for future research are discussed."
2004-0615,Pedagogies of Travel and Transformation: The Rotary International Youth Exchange Program and Narratives of Cultural Adaptation,Paper,Pedagogies of Travel and Transformation: The Rotary International Youth Exchange Program and Narratives of Cultural Adaptation,"Every year, Rotary International sends thousands of American teenagers to live in foreign lands. Rotary is responsible for teaching students about travel and culture and for preparing teens for their yearlong intercultural experience. Rotary Internationals program is a pedagogical site, where students are taught how to think about and consume cultural difference and are given ways of conceptualizing travel, cultural adaptation, and personal transformation. Based on three years of ethnographic research with Rotary clubs and Rotary districts in the Midwest and New England, this paper explores some of the narratives and rhetorics utilized by Rotary International as they socialize American teenagers for study abroad. The paper asserts that Rotarys narratives of travel and cultural encounter employ many of the tropes utilized in Euro-Western travel accounts and Rotarys pedagogies reflect the assumption that cultural adaptation follows a relatively monolithic and linear path. At the same time, the Rotary Youth Exchange Program is helping to foster in American students a sense of global citizenship by cultivating a commitment to cultural diversity and an interest in intercultural communication."
2004-0616,Peer mediation in a Non-Western context: An exploration of the potential of peer mediation in Indonesia,Paper,Peer mediation in a Non-Western context: An exploration of the potential of peer mediation in Indonesia,"We explore the possibilities for the use of peer mediation and Western-influenced conflict resolution education (CRE) in the non-Western cultural context of Indonesia, a country that has experienced political turmoil and found itself embroiled in inter-ethnic, inter-religious, and state v. separatist conflicts since the fall of President Soeharto in May 1998. We begin by addressing the general challenge faced by those involved in community development and by charting the history of CRE and peer mediation. From there, we move to a discussion of conflict in Indonesia and give brief consideration to theories concerning the causes for the conflicts being experienced. We then examine key elements of the Indonesian culture with an eye toward obstacles to the importation of Western models of CRE. We conclude with a brief description of a program of workshops currently being conducted in Indonesia whose function is to introduce teachers and community leaders to peer mediation and Western-based theories of conflict."
2004-0617,Perceived Anonymity and the Role of Self-Disclosure in Text-Based Computer Interactions,Paper,Perceived Anonymity and the Role of Self-Disclosure in Text-Based Computer Interactions,"Computer-mediated communication technologies have been implemented in ways that bring people closer together. Yet little is known about the effects of perceived anonymity on peoples behavior when they are using these technologies in a group context. To advance the understanding of these issues, this study is a description and discussion of a study that examines if, and to what extent, perceptions of anonymity will impact self-disclosure in a text-based computer interaction. The effect of such disclosure on peoples feelings about their group is examined. To this end, predictions of the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects are compared to Uncertainty Reduction Theory using a nested experimental design. Undergraduate students, in groups of 3, engaged in conversation using a text-based computer system. Results revealed that perceived anonymity is negatively related to both self-disclosure and perceived group cohesiveness. Further, self-disclosure tended to increase feelings of group cohesiveness."
2004-0618,Perceived Costs and Virtual Experience: The Added Value of Rich Content in B2C E-commerce,Paper,Perceived Costs and Virtual Experience: The Added Value of Rich Content in B2C E-commerce,"Many studies have demonstrated the positive effects of virtual experience on B2C e-commerce. However, providing rich content may be a double edged sword for e-Retailers due to inevitable download delays under the current last mile Internet infrastructure. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the relationships among virtual experience, connection speeds, and product attributes to develop a clearer understanding of how to balance the Web page content and loading time delays across different product categories in B2C e-commerce. An economic model for the added value of rich content was conceptualized to help understand the relationships better.

An experimental research method was used to test the hypotheses. Although the impacts of download delays on the added value of rich content were not clearly explained in this study, the interpretation of the findings and suggestions for future studies were discussed to address guidelines for the dilemma of rich content."
2004-0619,Perception of Speakers Based on Accent,Paper,Perception of Speakers Based on Accent,"This study explores the connection between accents and the perceptions they produce, between both native English speakers and non-native English speakers. It assesses the degrees of attractiveness, friendliness, and intelligence of six male speakers as perceived by students from a small liberal arts college in the northeastern United States. The speakers in the study represent the following countries: England, India, Jamaica, Russia, the southern United States, and Mexico.
The study shows that the British accented speaker rates highest in all three categories. The southerner from the United States rates lowest in attractiveness and in intelligence, and the Indian accented speaker rates lowest in friendliness. The researchers pose that the reason for these results are due to attributing stereotypes to these accents."
2004-0620,Perceptions of Black South African Businesspersons and Opinions on Foreign Direct Investment in South Africa.,Paper,Perceptions of Black South African Businesspersons and Opinions on Foreign Direct Investment in South Africa.,"This study looked at the perceptions of Black South African businesspersons and opinions on Foreign Direct Investment in South Africa. We administered a questionnaire to a sample of 361 college students at a large university in the Pacific Northwest to account for stereotypes of South African businesspersons and respondents willingness to invest in South Africa. Hypothesis one predicted that the more positive stereotypes of Black South African businesspersons, the more willing respondents would be to invest in South Africa. Hypothesis two predicted that the more positive portrayals of South Africa, the more willing respondents would be to invest in South Africa. Finally, hypothesis three predicted that the more positive television portrayals of the Southern African region, the more willing respondents would be to invest in South Africa. We used the same hypotheses to do the same predictions for China, Israel, and Colombia with the assumption that if the hypotheses were supported for South Africa, they would be also supported for the three other countries. Results from regression analysis and structural equation modeling strongly supported the three hypotheses for South Africa. Strong support was found for China, Israel and Colombia, but hypothesis three was only found for South Africa."

This exploratory study begins to fill that void through an on-line survey of PRSSA members (n=566; response rate=9.01 percent). Factor analysis indicated that gender on the job and salaries most affected future professionals perceptions of the field. Analysis of variance showed significant gender differences in perceptions of numerous issues, particularly salaries."
2004-0622,Performing Motherhood: Ladies' Home Journal in Postwar America,Paper,Performing Motherhood: Ladies' Home Journal in Postwar America,"This paper explores how Ladies Home Journal, the most popular womens magazines of the postwar era, participated in the discursive construction of maternal identity as the nation underwent a critical transition from wartime to peacetime, marshalling women out of the factories and encouraging a return to domestic life. Drawing on theories of gender identity, motherhood, and the ideological influence of womens magazines, the analysis demonstrates how Ladies Home Journal celebrated motherhood, portraying white, middle-class mothers as protecting the future of American democracy through the performance of selfless, hands-on mothering."

Communicative activities that surround the phenomenon of advice giving are discussed, including those of face and social networks. Personal advice giving within relationships is then explored as a concept understood through the theories of politeness and social support. Politeness theory and theories of comforting are framed as privileging the speaker, the advice giver. As an alternative perspective, Problematic Integration Theory privileges the hearer, and the advice seeker/receiver is postulated as a lens through which to reexamine and explore the phenomenon of personal advice giving within relationships."
2004-0624,Personal Home Page Construction As An Expression of Mastery and Identity Formation,Paper,Personal Home Page Construction As An Expression of Mastery and Identity Formation,"New technologies provide children with opportunities for self-exploration. According to Erikson (1968) the key developmental challenge during middle childhood is mastery and during adolescence is identity formation. This study explored the hypothesis that creating a personal homepage is a way of gaining feelings of mastery and expressing ""who I am."" In the first study, a nationally representive survey of eight to seventeen year olds was conducted to determine the prevalence of home page or online journal creation. Survey items regarding the relationship between personal homepages and mastery or identity were included. In the second study, a content analysis was conducted on the personal home pages of 48 eight to seventeen year olds. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that eight to seventeen year olds who create personal homepages express feelings of mastery regarding technology. Furthermore, children are able to experiment with how they describe themselves to others on their personal homepages."
2004-0625,Personality and Perception of Media Sex,Paper,Personality and Perception of Media Sex,"This exploratory study investigated the perceived state of media sex and gender role portrayals in China. Personality predictor variables were measured to see their correlations with perception outcome variables. The survey was administered to 314 Chinese college students. Results indicated that respondents were divided regarding the amount of sex and gender portrayals in the media. The individualism variable was found to be a strong predictor, but other personality factors did not demonstrate consistent predicting power. Implications for future research are discussed."
2004-0626,Personality Characteristics Associated with Watching Reality Programming,Paper,Personality Characteristics Associated with Watching Reality Programming,"Reality television has become one of the most popular forms of television in American culture. The goal of this study was to investigate what personality traits are related to the viewing and enjoyment of reality programming. This analysis established three genres of reality programming; dating/romance, voyeurism, and challenge. Six personality traits were explored in relation to these genres and general viewing and enjoyment measures; need for affiliation, empathy, loneliness, morbid curiosity, voyeurism, and verbal aggression. Findings suggest that morbid curiosity is positively related to the viewing of these programs and social loneliness is negatively related. Enjoyment was negatively related to both a need for affiliation and social loneliness. Gender analyses are also reported."

We use previous literature suggestive of psychological and content antecedents of PSI to study PSI with a favorite TV character and the development of PSI with motion picture characters previously unseen.
2004-0628,Personal Web Social DNA &Cybernetic Decision Making,Paper,Personal Web Social DNA &Cybernetic Decision Making,"A new convergence process is taking place that will dramatically affect every aspect of human physical, spiritual and social life. This convergence process is the new union being created between the Digitation process of every aspect of human physical and spiritual activities, Data Mining procedures and the penetration of Cybernetic Decision Making into all human organizations - either public or private. This new integration of disciplines will have a profound effect in the areas of social science and psychological research and will revolutionize our knowledge and understanding of the human psyche. A new Social Personal DNA will be created, as will be discussed in this paper, for each and every individual. It will allow us to predict human behavior, based on personal cognitive and other psychological traits.
In this paper, I will describe the convergence between Digitation, Data Mining and Cybernetic Decision Making. These concepts will be clarified, with the use of examples from various fields. A visual model will be proposed, which describes the information flow from the digitations of all human activities; the application of Data-Mining procedures to the data; the creation of Personal Social DNA ; and the conversion of this knowledge into new social indicators. These indicators are fed into Cybernetic automatic Decision Making Processes.
The Digitation process will be discussed with reference to music and visual images.
Data Mining Techniques will be discussed with examples from cognitive enhancement and retail applications.
The Cybernetic principles will be discussed with reference to a theory of social development and cybernetic assumptions on human behavior. The dangers of applying cybernetic decision making to social systems will be analyzed.

A special focus will be placed on the need to redefine knowledge-based social indicators which will better describe social system performance. Social indicators are at the core of the Cybernetic Decision Making Process.
In conclusion, the urgent need to restructure the process of social monitoring is discussed. The union between data mining and cybernetic decision making presents non-technological social groups and academic institutions with a great and urgent challenge. The inevitable creation of electronic virtual Personal Social DNA raises serious social, political, legal and ethical issues, which must be identified and discussed. The lack of public discourse will not hinder this convergence. Personal Data Bases are already being traded as commodities and are perceived as the new gold mines of the twenty first century. The window of opportunity for dealing with these issues has become very limited in time."
2004-0629,Person Effects and Perceived Reality,Paper,Person Effects and Perceived Reality,"Earlier studies have detected a reality-person effect. That is, when mentally processing media stories people perceive them to be more real for other people than for themselves. One question is whether this effect is related to influence-person effects such as the third-person and first-person effects and to other self-other comparisons. Five stories were manipulated so that there were parallel public service announcement and commercial advertisement versions. Commercials were considered more real and more influential for other people than for the self, and there were no such gaps for public service announcements. There were other similarities as well as some differences between the reality-person and influence-person effects."
2004-0630,Persuasion Effects of Issue-Framing Functions: An Experiment Using an Environmental Social Movement Issue,Paper,Persuasion Effects of Issue-Framing Functions: An Experiment Using an Environmental Social Movement Issue,"Communication and social movement scholars have suggested that there can be four functions of framing in relation to an issue: defining a problem, attributing blame for the problem, suggesting solutions or remedies, and invoking a moral appeal that something should be done. Although these functions are assumed to exist, little research has investigated their persuasive effectiveness as they are presented in textual messages. To address this shortcoming, the author executed a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment with 244 subjects who received an environmental message manipulated by the inclusion versus exclusion of these functions. Although no significant interaction effects were revealed for all functions simultaneously, means on all dependent variables were highest when all functions were included in the message. Several significant two-factor interactions demonstrate that, although the functions exist, they can perform differing persuasive roles depending on the desired outcome of the message. Additionally, in some situations, the presence of certain functions mitigated, rather than enhanced, persuasion. The author also suggests that the ""moral appeal"" function  as utilized originally in the current study  should be considered as essential as the other functions when the goal of an organizations message is opinion change rather than participant mobilization."
2004-0631,Photojournalists Attitudes Towards Picturing the September 11 Attacks & the War in Afghanistan,Paper,Photojournalists Attitudes Towards Picturing the September 11 Attacks & the War in Afghanistan,"Results of a web-based survey of visual professionals associated with the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) reveal the vast majority of the respondents agree that in picturing the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. media differed from foreign media in the depiction of humanitarian suffering, patriotism, political climate and global reactions. Findings also indicate while the majority of the respondents support the use of graphic imagery, they reported the context of news events influenced the selection of photographs with graphic content. Respondents reported taste, self-censorship, avoiding readers criticisms, self-censorship and personal ethics ranked higher for selecting imagery of the September 11 attacks and political sensitivity ranked higher for selecting imagery of the Afghan war. The limited use of organizations codes of ethics and the lack of necessary access to photograph the war in Afghanistan were also noted. Further, personal experiences and background characteristics had minimal effect on news practitioners perceptions of the visual coverage."

2004-0633,Physiological Responses to Visual and Vocal Racial Cues and their Mismatch,Paper,Physiological Responses to Visual and Vocal Racial Cues and their Mismatch,"This study investigated the effects of visual and verbal racial cues and their consistency on physiological indices of attention, arousal, and valence. Subjects were exposed to a series of short clips containing a digitized Black face or White face reading a priming sentence. The priming sentence was recorded from two males, one Black and one White. Clips contained either still faces, animated faces with lip synch, or no face at all (voice only). Subjects heart rate and skin conductance were recorded during exposure to stimuli. Preliminary results indicate that Black faces elicit responses consistent with greater automatic attention and negative valence than those elicited by White faces. Voice alone did not lead to any significant differences in autonomic response. Consistency interacted with racial cues such that inconsistency increased attention to a White face but decreased attention to a Black face. Results will be discussed in terms of racial framing and psychological processing of media."

Characteristics of the photo coverage were explored, and across time comparisons were made both within and between the two newspapers. Results show a remarkable increase in the total number of news photos on China and a roughly balanced distribution of negative and positive photos. No significant differences were found between the two newspapers."
2004-0635,Picturing the Invasion of Iraq: Photos as News Frames,Paper,Picturing the Invasion of Iraq: Photos as News Frames,"Building from previous studies of the visual portrayal of the Gulf War in 1991, this essay analyzes pictorial coverage of the recent invasion of Iraq in the three major U.S. news magazines, Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report. A survey of the published photographs accompanying newsmagazine articles on Operation Iraqi Freedom indicates that some prominent patterns of pictorial portrayal identified in studies of the first Gulf War were repeated. However, the establishment of a different central news theme, The Road to Baghdad, seems to have produced different parameters for photo coverage, setting limits for the range of photo material published and inhibiting the publication of pictures that did not clearly support the official story. The end result: an overall picture of the invasion of Iraq that is contained within the narrative/myth of American rescue and supremacy. A picture that provides cohesive support for the U.S. Government's version of circumstances, motivations and events, and is without divergent images that might prompt questions or raise doubts about the the official version of the American deposition of a tyrant."
2004-0636,Poking and Prodding Parents: The Child's Assertion of Political Identity,Paper,Poking and Prodding Parents: The Child's Assertion of Political Identity,"This paper provides a framework for understanding how partisanship originates as a developmental outcome contingent on changes in the child-parent dyad. Our approach departs from most prior research on political socialization, which has tended to conceive of partisan identity formation as either the one-way, affective influence of parents, or as the childs processing of news content, resulting in the direct acquisition of partisanship. The research setting is a middle school in Lubbock, Texas, during the final weeks of the 2000 campaign. Students interest in the election, once stimulated by classroom discussion and news media, motivated them to engage parents in political conversations. Adolescents coaxed and cajoled parents to read newspaper articles, to support candidates, and to vote. Success in influencing parents apparently confirmed for a child that a power shift had occurred in the family. Adolescents thereby appreciated the value of partisanship as a means for expressing an autonomous identity."
2004-0637,Polarization of Political Attitudes and Values on the Internet,Paper,Polarization of Political Attitudes and Values on the Internet,"Laboratory experiments show that people online can be more powerfully affected by group norms. This has led some to suggest that the Internet could serve as a divisive social force, polarizing the public sphere. Many potentially relevant differences exist between the real Internet and online laboratory experiments, which raises the question of whether polarization does occur on the real Internet. This paper employes data from a representative sample survey of Pittsburgh, PA, to determine whether political attitudes and values of those who use the Internet for political purposes are more polarized. Polarization is measured both as extremity and mean absolute distance between all pairs of responses, a measure of clustering. The significance of polarization differences between Internet users and non-users is determined by statistical bootstrapping, with weights to control for intensity of Internet use. Findings show no significant polarization on the Internet, and trends imply modestly lower polarization."
2004-0638,Polarization versus the Mainstream: Differentiating the Effects of the News Media,Paper,Polarization versus the Mainstream: Differentiating the Effects of the News Media,"This paper examines the differential effects of exposure and attention to television and newspaper news on public perceptions and opinion toward organized labor within the United States. Using a cross-sectional survey of 888 New York State residents, we employ a hierarchal ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression model to examine how the news media may influence three different dimensions of public opinion toward labor unions: the institutional role of labor, the power of labor unions, and the image of labor unions. Building upon the foundational work of both Gerbner et al. (1982) and Zaller (1991, 1992), our media effects model demonstrates how ideological predispositions interact differently with both television and newspaper news flows. High exposure to television news promotes a mainstreaming interaction with liberal and conservative viewers, decreasing the perception gap between television news viewers. Conversely, high attention to newspaper news promotes a polarization effect, widening the perception gap between liberal and conservative newspaper readers."
2004-0639,Policy Developments and Prospects for the Wireless Telephony: Comparing South Korea and Canada,Paper,Policy Developments and Prospects for the Wireless Telephony: Comparing South Korea and Canada,"The Republic of Korea and Canada differ in many respects, politically, culturally, economically, and geographically. At the same time, both have placed a high priority on the goals and tasks identified by the NII and global information infrastructure debates, and both are among the countries with the highest restrictions on foreign direct investment in the telecommunications sector. In part because both are relatively small economies among the industrialized countries, and both experienced economic uncertainties in the past decades that have raised questions about the role of the state and the appropriate paths to take to promote national development. Despite these uncertainties, both countries have emerged as differing examples of ""best practices"" for the introduction and deployment of ICTs. The paper examines the current market status and structure, technological developments, subscriber, revenue and pricing trends for wireless telephony. It also compares questions and issues that are being encountered in considerations of future policy directions for wireless telephony services in South Korea and Canada, including measures to encourage the development of competitive services, as well as efforts to increase universal access to telecommunications services."
2004-0640,Policy-making in the Public Interest: A Contextual Analysis of the Passage of Closed-captioning Policy,Paper,Policy-making in the Public Interest: A Contextual Analysis of the Passage of Closed-captioning Policy,"In 1990 the United States Congress approved the Television Decoder Circuitry Act which mandated that all television sets 13 inches or larger for sale in the United States be manufactured with caption-decoding microchips. This legislation allowed millions of deaf and hearing-impaired people throughout the US access to captions on commercials and television programs. Access to technology is one determinant of who can participate in the social, cultural, political and economic facets of a society. Communication scholars recognize that communication processes in the public sphere often are unbalanced. Access to media outlets creates a gap between those with media power and those without. Using a contextual analysis framework, this paper defines the roles of parties involved in the passage of closed-captioning legislation and highlights how social forces were successful in passing legislation beneficial to the deaf and hearing-impaired community."

2004-0642,"Political Communication among Advocacy Group, Government and International Institute: Campaign of Human Rights Nongovernmental Organization on Comfort Women Issue in East Asia",Paper,"Political Communication among Advocacy Group, Government and International Institute: Campaign of Human Rights Nongovernmental Organization on Comfort Women Issue in East Asia","This study examines the process and effects of human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) campaigns on comfort women issue in East Asia. Through the perspective of political communication and campaign, this study explores NGOs organized efforts to force the issue on to the political agenda and further lead the realization of justice and compensation for comfort womens survivors.
The study begins with a review of this issue. I then theoretically specify various strategies and campaigns conducted by comfort womens NGOs, with a focus on a leading NGO - the Korean Council For The Women Drafted For Military Sexual Slavery By Japan. I further assume that three main actors involve in the issue: comfort women NGOs; Japanese government; and the United Nations (UN). In terms of linkages, the dynamic process of communication and interactions between them is a crucial factor in influencing this issue. This linkage takes a main form as NGOs promotion and networking in the UN system, and it presses the Japanese government to face the issue by participating the political communication. Finally, I widely examine the emerging transnational NGOs networks on this issue in East Asia and assess the effects of their campaigns on governmental and international levels.
The findings support four arguments. First, the Japanese government is being forced to change its original discourse of official denial and cover-up policy to approach the demands offered by comfort womens NGOs. Second, the human rights movement relies on popular awareness and consciousness toward human rights issues in civil societies. Hence, through political communication and campaign, NGOs can be the key role to promote this issue in civil societies and further form a transnational activism around East Asia and the international community. Third, a significant NGO can greatly influence the Japanese governments position and create conditions in which international campaign in the UN can become more effective. Fourth, I suggest that further research needs to conduct process-oriented empirical analysis of a specific case within a research framework to establish the exact influence of NGOs on the human rights issues. I conclude that comfort womens NGOs has established a successful model for the transnational advocacy networks in human rights movement through political communication. They have also promoted a new claim for womens rights in East Asia."
2004-0643,Political Effects of Infotainment: Priming the Late Night Audience,Paper,Political Effects of Infotainment: Priming the Late Night Audience,"No longer a novelty in Americas media landscape, infotainment has become fully integrated into contemporary mediated politics. Infotainment extends Americans traditional venues of newspaper, radio news, and television news to include media outlets that are grounded in entertainment values, yet still serve as a source of political information, and in some cases, political mobilization. Given the critical role of infotainment in contemporary politics, this study addresses the effects of appearances on late-night comedy during the 2000 presidential campaign and their ability to prime audience members evaluations of these candidates. Findings from the 2000 National Annenberg Election Study (N=10,308) indicate that evaluations of candidates are based in part on respondents' sociodemographics, perceptions of candidates to handle certain issues, and their character traits. Although there was no main effect of watching late-night comedy on evaluations of candidates, interaction effects between late-night comedy and character traits emerged and are discussed."
2004-0644,Political Mobilization by the Internet? Findings from a Panel Survey,Paper,Political Mobilization by the Internet? Findings from a Panel Survey,"Starting point of our study is the question of what effects the Internet may have on individual political communication of citizens. The possible hypotheses vary from a general stimulation (""mobilization"") over growing differences in political communication (""digital divide"") to a general decline of political activities (""exclusion""). The authors conducted a survey representing the population of a western country in a panel design to answer this question. It can be shown that people don't drive back their political offline-communication after getting access to the Internet, the new possibilities of online communication are employed complementary. The most effectful means of political communication on the Internet are those of interpersonal communication (e-mail, chat). An analysis of variance controlling for concurring variables shows that the Internet accounts for a significant amount of the increase in political communication of Internet users."

Yet the many ways in which this phenomenon is potentially both reflective and constitutive of global cultural and political-economic relations of power have not been examined by scholars working within the political science sub-discipline of international relations (IR) scholars. This paper is a preliminary attempt at a cross-disciplinary analysis focused on this phenomenon. It is rooted in a somewhat eclectic set of theoretical and methodological traditions: Gramscian, neo-marxist and constructivist IR, and critical sociolinguistics. Its aim is relatively modest. First, I seek to draw attention to the relations between language, politics and economics. Second, I aim to show how looking at the global rise of English helps IR scholars to better understand and explain the (re)production of social relations of power within a global capitalist system. Third, I attempt to make a contribution to a general Gramscian inspired research program within IR. I propose to do so by examining how dominant social groups have historically sought to articulate their own universalizing hegemonic aspiration via language. Fourth, I hope to show that additional efforts at cross-disciplinary inquiry into the global hegemony of English are worthwhile. Such inquiry has the potential to reveal much of significance about the complex dialectical interplay between global material and ideational forces. I conclude by suggesting several potentially fruitful directions for further Gramscian inspired IR research focused on the position of English within the global linguistic configuration of power."
2004-0646,"Popular Music, Religion, and 9/11: Analysis of Two Music Albums",Paper,"Popular Music, Religion, and 9/11: Analysis of Two Music Albums","The attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 (9/11) have provoked various collective and personal responses in the US, whose meaning continues to be negotiated through time. This paper analyses two popular music albums released in 2002, which address the events of 9/11. The analysis engages with the question: How do these albums incorporate religious symbolism in formulating a response to 9/11? In exploring this question, the paper draws conclusions about the relationship between popular culture and religion within the context of collective crisis and suffering.

The paper is theoretically informed by constructivist and cultural studies frameworks and adopts an interpretive approach towards the analysis of the albums as cultural texts. Further, the analysis draws upon the scholarly debate on the increasingly blurred line between the sacred and the profane, as well as on the literature on media and religion. In addition to providing a close reading of the albums, the analysis seeks to contextualize its interpretations and situate them historically. The paper argues that the two albums represent two divergent forms of spiritual sensibility present in American society today. By implication, they express specific articulations of collectivity, while, at the same time, serving as sources for the construction of personalized meanings and identities."
2004-0647,Portrayals of Nutritional Practices and Exercise Behavior in Popular American Films,Paper,Portrayals of Nutritional Practices and Exercise Behavior in Popular American Films,"This study describes how food, alcohol, and exercise/sport are depicted in popular films. Standard content analysis procedures were applied to the top-ten grossing films in each of the ten years from 1991 through 2000 (N=100 films). Food and drink appeared regularly in the films analyzed, typically as a background element or prop. Foods that could be classified into the Food Guide Pyramid categories were most likely to be fats, oils and sweets; fruits, vegeta-bles and dairy products were rarely seen. Overweight and obese characters were depicted as more frequent users of fats, oils, and sweets, and as less frequent consumers of fruits. Foods ingested were seldom evaluated by the consuming character or others. More than 20 percent of the food items shown were alcoholic beverages, which were nearly two times more likely to be ingested as non-alcohol food items. Planned exercise and sports were common in movies, appearing at a rate of about two incidents an hour. These activities rarely received explicit comment or evaluation by any of the characters. A characters demographic profile was not associated significantly with the intensity of his or her exercise and sporting choices. An analysis based on social learning theory and cultivation theory suggests that movie depictions of nutrition and exercise are unlikely to have much of an effect on viewers behaviors through modeling, but could potentially alter beliefs about normative eating and exercise behavior."
2004-0648,Possibility and Impossibility for Global Online Privacy: A Cross-Country Examination,Paper,Possibility and Impossibility for Global Online Privacy: A Cross-Country Examination,"Abstract
Followed with vanishing of national boundary on the Internet, online privacy has been an international dispute among countries. For instance, the European Union (EU) urged the U.S. government to sign up the Safe Harbor in order to prevent personal data from the EU countries being transferred into the U.S. without notice. Subsequently, the concept of global online privacy starts to draw attention all over the world. Do we need to have global online privacy on the Internet? This study investigates respondents from four countries (China, the Netherlands, Taiwan, the U.S.) to see their privacy concerns and regulation preference. It finds out that respondents have different privacy concerns, priorities, and diverse regulation preference, which might hinder the concept of global online privacy. Each country has its own definition of privacy; thus, it is not possible to have global online privacy suitable for every country. This study; however, does not propose that there is no necessity of a global standard to data protection. It claims that it is necessary to have a minimum global guideline to protect personal data on the Internet and as for the details, country difference should be considered."
2004-0649,Post-September 11th Perceptions of Islam and the Spiral of Silence,Paper,Post-September 11th Perceptions of Islam and the Spiral of Silence,"The September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States brought Islam into the forefront of the public agenda. Americas ensuring war against Al Qaeda, continued terrorist acts by Islamic extremists, and the Beltway sniper killings in the Washington beltway area has kept Islam and its relationship to violence on the national agenda. The ongoing public discourse on Islam and terrorism is replete with competing moral claims and sensitivity to which views are socially acceptable, providing an ideal opportunity to test hypotheses derived from Noelle-Neumanns spiral of silence theory. Our resulting study of public perceptions of Islam indicate people generally believed that others consider Islam less peaceful than they, themselves, do, and tended to fear negative consequences for publicly speaking out their beliefs. Participants generally believed that television news media downplayed the Islam-terrorism connection. There appears to be tension between the two mediated presentations of Islamthe party line advanced by U.S. government officials and the news reports showing Islamic terrorism around the world. Results of this research indicate that most people perceive Islams relationship with terrorism to be a complex issue, and that they have not entirely determined their own beliefs about Islam."

Type of food, health claims, meal status, eating locale, and character attributes were coded. In addition, nutritional information for advertised foods was obtained via the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Nutrition Facts label, which has been mandatory on food packaging since May 8, 1994. Snack foods were advertised more frequently than meal foods, and the most frequently represented food categories were convenience foods, sweets, and soft drinks. The most nutritionally unsound foods were found in advertisements aimed specifically at children. Following a 2000-calorie-per-day diet composed entirely of these foods, a child would consume 130 percent of her daily limit of saturated fat, 124 percent of her daily sodium, and 180 grams (almost a cup) of refined sugar, but only 36 percent of her daily fiber and about half of her recommended daily dose of vitamin A. Discussion focuses on the status of foods advertised to general versus child audiences."

This clarification may lead to less ambiguous propositions in both political analysis and pragmatic organizational activity. This discussion extends Bell's paradigm to the nonpolitical speech of friendship, and explains through a case study of the Green Party of Ontario how political linguistics may be of practical use for either analysts or change agents of even loosely-structured organizations."

The content analysis method was used to investigate nearly 28 years of public relations literature. Results suggest that about 16 percent of articles published in Public Relations Review and Journal of Public Relations Research addressed race/ethnicity/culture, but few works described researcher-researched power interactions in the research process. Distinct patterns emerged among scholarship concerning practice 1) beyond U.S. boundaries, and 2) in the U.S. Solutions for reducing the degree of neglect to this methodological issue include developing a Critical Race Theory of Public Relations for our body of knowledge."

Through the methodology of discourse analysis, the paper proposes that the cartoon reflects changes in feminism in American society and, consequently, in the construction of fictional feminist characters. It begins with an overview of popular press commentary linking The Powerpuff Girls with feminism. It then offers an overview of feminist theory and previous scholarship on mediated feminist discourse. Finally, it turns to an analysis of how The Powerpuff Girls subverts stereotypical norms in the superhero genre as it negotiates third wave feminism and the concept of girl power within the larger context of feminist thought."
2004-0655,Predicted Outcome Values: The Affect of Sexual Orientation on Anticipated Communication Behaviors,Paper,Predicted Outcome Values: The Affect of Sexual Orientation on Anticipated Communication Behaviors,"The role sexual orientation plays in communication is continuously evolving (Herek, 1988; LaMar & Kite, 1998). As public opinion regarding sexual orientation changes, so does the effect of disclosing ones sexual orientation to another. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers continue to investigate the affect sexual orientation may have on interpersonal relationships and present such findings to the public.
This poster session presents current data on the affect sexual orientation has on predicted outcomes values (Sunnafank, 1986), and ultimately, communication behaviors. Unlike previous studies examining outcome values and anticipated communication behaviors (Mottet, 2000), this study examines attitudes toward both gay men and lesbians.
As aforementioned, the role sexual orientation plays in communication behavior is dynamic. Each year, public opinion evolves to reflect the value structures inclusive of a new generation and researchers have a responsibility to present such findings in the publics interests. This poster session reveals that sexual orientation continues to affect predicted outcome values assigned to another and ultimately leads to a reduction in anticipated communication behaviors. The implications for such results are presented for both gays and lesbians.

In addition, with reference to the knowledge gap, two- and three-way interactions are tested. Education X cable TV international news use and education X involvement narrow the knowledge gap, while education X interest widens it. The Internet plays an especially strong role. It has the most positive effects of the media measures on both open- and close-ended international knowledge and, via a three-way interaction with education and involvement, appears to offer people with low education and low involvement a chance to catch up with others when it comes to open-ended international knowledge. The analyses undertaken suggest a simple prescription to low levels of American knowledge: use news on the Internet and expose yourself to foreign nations and foreign people."

Research suggests that attention to procedural justice may offer one way to increase satisfaction and outcome acceptance. Procedural justice argues that people care about the fairness of the procedures, and research has shown that when procedures are viewed as fair, people are more satisfied with the process and accepting of the outcomes  at times, even when they do not get the outcomes they desire. Using survey data from attendees at 11 U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meetings, we tested whether procedural justice judgments predicted satisfaction with the FDA and its advisory committees and acceptance of advisory committee meeting outcomes. We also examined how contextual factors  namely, procedural knowledge, tolerance for potential conflicts of interest among advisory committee members, and participants stakes in the outcomes, influenced the results. The findings supported a strong role for procedural justice perceptions in predicting satisfaction and outcome acceptance among meeting attendees."

Earlier studies had demonstrated that three dimensions of informational utility  magni-tude, likelihood, and immediacy  guide information selections of news consumers. Efficacy as an additional dimension is derived from persuasion theories and incorporated into the informational-utility model. An experiment was conducted with German participants (n = 311), who browsed through online news reports. The 2x3x2 design varied efficacy (low vs. high), the additional utility dimension (magnitude, likelihood, and immediacy) and the associated level of utility (low vs. high) by presenting different versions of news leads. Results show that efficacy, as well as established facets of utility, govern information selections. News leads implying that consequences of reported events can be influenced by recipients resulted in longer exposure times than parallel news leads indicating lower levels of efficacy. As expected, these impacts apply to positive and negative news and are additive."

We found that a lack of substantive coverage in the mainstream Japanese print media of the important terms related to a gender-equal society was correlated with a low level of knowledge of these terms."
2004-0660,Press for Democracy? Some Notes About Newspaper Competition and News Quality in Sweden,Paper,Press for Democracy? Some Notes About Newspaper Competition and News Quality in Sweden,"Abstract


The aim of this paper is to examine and discuss the relationship between the degree of newspaper competition in a region and the quality of local news reporting. The first part of the article introduces some theories in the field and empirical findings in international research. The last part of the article introduces two new case studies based on changes in some regional newspaper markets in Sweden. Local news content in competition and monopoly situations is compared and the implications for free press ideals are discussed. The findings in the paper suggest that the relationship between newspaper competition and local news quality is actually more complicated than at first thought. The study gives some support to the thought that ruinous competition could be as bad for democracy as monopoly media."
2004-0661,Press Freedom and Politics of Objective Journalism in Post-handover Hong Kong,Paper,Press Freedom and Politics of Objective Journalism in Post-handover Hong Kong,"This paper analyzes how press freedom is maintained in Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty. Past studies have pointed out that the Hong Kong media have adopted the strategies of self-censorship and introspection in face of political pressure. However, the market imperative of the commercial media system and the psychological needs of professional journalists require a third response from the media  an intensified objective stance. This paper discusses the manifestations and political implications of this intensified objectivity by critically reviewing the media scene in Hong Kong in the past few years. An exploratory analysis of a journalist survey was also conducted to shed light on the relationship between objective journalism, self-censorship, and medias watchdog function in Chinas Hong Kong. It is emphasized that objectivity, as a professional norm, is both enabling and constraining to professional journalists. Yet in transitional societies where even negative freedom of the press is not guaranteed, objectivity can become an important weapon of the weak for journalists to fight against political pressure."
2004-0662,Priming political leaders: The effect of negative evaluations in the news on public assessments of political leaders,Paper,Priming political leaders: The effect of negative evaluations in the news on public assessments of political leaders,"The premise of political priming is that public evaluations of political leaders are made on the basis of issues that are on the top of citizens mind. This study investigated the impact of a national referendum campaign about a European integration issue on the evaluation of the incumbent government, the Prime Minister as well opposition leaders. Drawing on a content analysis of news media and a two-wave panel survey, the results showed that as the topic of the referendum (the introduction of the euro) became more visible in the media during the campaign, the importance of the euro issue for formulating general evaluations of political leaders increased. The incumbent government that was seen to handle the referendum poorly was penalized by the referendum. Exposure to news media outlets that covered the referendum extensively and offered negative evaluations of political leaders boosted the decline in overall performance rating of political leaders for politically less involved respondents. These results stress the necessity of considering the campaign and the specific content of the media to understand fluctuations in public opinion during a referendum campaign."
2004-0663,"Prior Attitudes in Processing TV PSAs: Effects of Accessibility and Congruency on Attention, Memory and Attitude Changes",Paper,"Prior Attitudes in Processing TV PSAs: Effects of Accessibility and Congruency on Attention, Memory and Attitude Changes","This study examines how prior attitudes toward the issues such as smoking, drinking and drug use affect the processing of TV PSAs designed to decrease those riskly behaviors. TV viewers may have strong or weak prior attitudes toward the issues when viewing these PSAs and the automatically activated these attitudes likely affect attention, memory and persuasion. Further, whether a viewer has an attitude that is congruent or incongruent with the attitude presented through the PSAs would also influence these factors. It is predicted that the PSAs viewed with strong (thus highly accessible) prior attitudes will receive more attention and will be remembered better than the PSAs viewed with weak attitudes (inaccessible). Further, when the prior attitudes match with the message attitude, the processing will be more elaborated (more attention and better memory). However, attitude change will be induced when the attitudes are weak rather than strong."

Previous studies have been done to develop these measures, test their reliability (both within and across groups), and begin to assess their validity by looking at their predicted relationships with sensation seeking and self-report measures of substance abuse. The measures of positivity offset and negativity bias were developed based on the work of John Caccioppo and his colleagues that suggests that emotional processing and emotional responses are a function of underlying activation in the appetitive and aversive motivational systems. The theory suggests that emotional stimuli engage underlying motivational systems, which accounts for their being processed differently from neutral or non-emotional stimuli."

Using the theoretical framework of Social Exchange Theory, this study seeks to understand the process through which products and brands become embedded within entertainment programming. Through in-depth interviews with executives from leading entertainment studios, multinational corporations, and integrated marketing firms, this paper identifies the participants involved in the process, offers three models of the product placements, and their origins in entertainment and commercial relationship networks: (1) serendipitous placements; (2) opportunistic placements; and (3) planned placements. The result is a rare insiders look at the many ways in which product placement can occur in the United States, as well as a theoretical articulation of the process."

Suicide bombings by six Palestinian women between January 2002 and October 2003 have challenged a long standing myth and by doing so, have begun to shape a new mythical archetype while making a long-standing one more ambiguous. This study explores mythical archetypes of both male and female Palestinian suicide bombers, but especially draws upon the case of female Palestinian suicide bombers to argue that when faced with culturally remote occurrences, news media draw on myth to facilitate the telling of news. News items and other information were gathered about the six Palestinian women. The textual analysis first pursues the conventional archetype of the Palestinian suicide bomber as male territory, and then turns to the contrasting archetype of female Palestinian suicide bomber as woman warrior."

Consumer misinformation about the true risks of online disclosures as well as individual differences in privacy involvement and privacy self-efficacy may account for the apparent paradox. Consumer risk was manipulated through warning labels placed on test privacy statements and their effects examined in relation to the presence of privacy seals and the involvement and self- efficacy of the respondents in a factorial experimental design involving 227 college students. Privacy warnings reduced the amount of personally identifying information respondents were willing to disclose to sites carrying the warnings and negatively impacted intentions to buy products from those sites. Highly self-efficacious respondents were unaffected by the warnings, while those with low self-efficacy disclosed less information. Privacy seals increased personal information disclosures among those with high privacy self efficacy and low privacy involvement and among those with low self efficacy and high involvement. Recommendations for changes in online consumer privacy policy and practices were made."

Using subaltern public spheres as the theoretical framework, the Internet is expected to empower the subordinated social groups and promote democracy. RearWindow to Movies is a Chinese online discussion group which focuses on the topics of movies. I used this case to answer my research question: How the online discussion group acts as a subaltern public sphere? My research found that the Internet supported the concept of subaltern public spheres instead of a unitary public sphere. The online subaltern public sphere was open to their members and provided safe discursive spaces for the subaltern public. The subaltern public used online spheres to form their own discourses which can resist the discursive domination from the state. The discursive practices were supported by various social resources. In addition, RearWindow users tried to disseminate their counter discourses into the outer world through the interaction with the mass media. However, I also find that the interaction has the risks of being misappropriated."
2004-0669,"Prospect Theory, Message Framing, and Evaluation of Political Policies",Paper,"Prospect Theory, Message Framing, and Evaluation of Political Policies","Message frames influence how people interpret and understand the world. A number of studies on decision-making have found that if information is presented in terms of gains (a positive frame), people are more risk-aversive. However, when information is presented as losses (a negative frame), people tend to be risk-seeking. Prospect theorya theory of choice behaviortypically is used to explain these changes in preferences. An experiment tested how information framing within the context of new coverage of political policies influence readers evaluation of the policy. The results suggest that the framing effects predicted by prospect theory can be found in the political realm."
2004-0670,Protecting Children While Silencing Them: COPPA and Children's Free Speech Rights,Paper,Protecting Children While Silencing Them: COPPA and Children's Free Speech Rights,"In 1998 the U.S. Congress passed the first and only law protecting the privacy of individuals on the Internet. The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) restricts the online collection of personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. According to COPPAs Final Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web sites that maintain chat rooms directed at children must either a) condition a childs participation on the prior consent of the childs parent or b) monitor the chat room and censor any references to personally identifiable information. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether COPPAs chat room restrictions infringe on the free speech rights of children under the age of 13.
The paper first analyzes a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions to determine whether children have access to the same constitutional rights of adults and to what extent childrens rights have been restricted. After determining that a childs right to free speech is protected by the First Amendment, the paper examines the constitutionality of COPPAs chat room restrictions using the Courts free speech regulation test articulated in Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence.
In the end, the paper determines that aspects of COPPAs chat room restrictions maybe constitutionally suspect. While the regulation appears to be content neutral, of substantial government interest, and leaves open alternative means of communication, it is questionable whether the regulations parental consent requirement is narrowly tailored."
2004-0671,Providing Mobilizing Information: A new approach to studying environmental issues in the media,Paper,Providing Mobilizing Information: A new approach to studying environmental issues in the media,"Our perception of and relationship with our natural environment is shaped by the dominant cultural perspectives held toward the environment. This comparative study is based on the assumption that there is a marked difference between these cultural perspectives in India and the United States, and because journalists carry cultural notions to the newsroom, these differences are likely to surface in media coverage of environmental issues. Considering environmental activism opposing large hydroelectric projects as one example of environmental news, this study examines the emergence of cultural differences in the print media in India and the United States. Contextual analysis was used to analyze two Indian newspapers (The Times of India and The Hindu) and two U.S. newspapers (The New York Times and The Buffalo News) in the environmental cultural context of their respective countries. Environmental activism was measured by examining provision of mobilizing information, as an indication of newspapers' emphasis on citizen involvement.
The study demonstrates that there indeed is a difference in the way environmental news, as it relates to the hydroelectric projects is covered in the United States and in India. Some of the key findings of the study are: 1) Indian newspapers provided much more detailed and frequent coverage of the struggle against hydroelectric projects than their U.S. counterparts, 2) Mobilizing information was provided often and at varied levels, which could potentially cater to audiences with diverse political orientations. The study revealed varying kinds of mobilizing information not discussed in earlier research on mobilizing information. Two previously unidentified types of MI were labeled invitational and empowering. Invitational mobilizing information seemed more useful for motivating the audience to get involved. Empowering MI was mainly useful for those who were already involved either in the same or similar issues."

The latest Argentinean crisis was accompanied by a series of profound cultural re-ensembles. The massive engagement of people banging kitchen pots in the streets represented a form of social struggle against the political class apathy that can be read following the psychoanalytic conception of family complexes. The author, first, explores subjectivity as a result of these complexes and then examines the value of the psychoanalytic thesis of the family as a psychical complex for cultural studies. Two subjective positions are identified, rivalry (sameness) and difference (otherness). Rivalry is discussed in the context of telenovelas, and the author argues that this subject position is destructively exploited in these popular narratives. Difference is discussed in the context of everyday cultural politics, and the author argues that embracing this subject position helped Argentinean families creatively and productively re-imagine and re-work the socio-political conditions in which they were immersed during the crisis."
2004-0673,Psychological Customisation of Information. Applications for Personalizing the Form of News.,Paper,Psychological Customisation of Information. Applications for Personalizing the Form of News.,"Information, such as news, presented to individual users may be customized on the basis of the immediate emotional and cognitive types of psychological effects it is likely to enable or create. Both content and its way of presentation (modality, visual layouts, ways of interaction, structure) may be varied. Despite obvious complexities empirical evidence suggests that the way of presenting information to certain psychological profiles has predictable psychological effects. For instance, one may facilitate positive emotion for users with certain personality type or more efficient learning for certain cognitive styles. This is the basic concept of Mind-Based Technologies. Psychological Customization may be considered an operationalization and technique of implementing the concept of Mind-Based Technologies. Psychological Customization may be used for controlling the influence of the content and way of presentation of information on consequent and transient emotional and cognitive effects. This paper describes the basics of Psychological Customization and discusses the personalization of the form of news as one possible application area."
2004-0674,Psychophysiology in Media Effects Research: From Content to Structure and Beyond,Paper,Psychophysiology in Media Effects Research: From Content to Structure and Beyond,"This paper reviews the brief history of research involving psychophysiology and media. The primary theoretical contribution of this literature is represented by a fundamental shift in the way media are defined. Early research in this area defined and analyzed media content according to container or genre. Recent work, however, has demonstrated the utility of defining media not solely in terms of containers or genres, but rather by the structural units that determine how messages are processed. The two dependent concepts which, to this point, have served as the focus of this research are attention and emotion.
The theoretical and methodological contributions of this area are encapsulated, in part, by two ongoing research paradigms: Langs limited capacity model and Reeves and Nass social responses to communication technologies. Current advances in technology and bandwidth open the door to unprecedented levels of immersion and interactivity in mediated experience. A definition of media which emphasizes the interaction between structure, medium, and content, and relates this interaction to changes in attention and emotion, will best accommodate an understanding of new media technologies. The legacy of media and psychophysiology research is a large contribution to such a definition."

Based on research data, a three-level model of knowledge influence on perception of risk issues is developed.

The goal of this study was to discern if self-identified racial group members use similar or different language in their public discourse about advancements made in Human Genetic Research (HGR). Analysis of focus group transcripts reveals that African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) do use different linguistic strategies to discuss HGR. Racial standpoints were found to shape participant understandings of the relationship between genes, race, and human ability. Participants were not asked to respond to questions as members of their racial groups, yet their thoughts expressed and articulated reveal real world experiences with race. The linguistic strategies reveal that AAs have a stronger identification with their racial group membership than do EAs. While AAs tended to use strategies that promote a positive collective group identity within the focus group context and the larger AA community, EAs used strategies that linguistically created distance between them and all outgroup members, particularly AAs."

This moment in the spotlight presented Americans with an opportunity to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the nations public health infrastructure. This paper closely examines how that opportunity was used in two major U.S. newspapers (the New York Times and the Atlanta Journal Constitution) that covered the anthrax/public health story in some detail. Our central research question is, How thoroughly did these leading news organizations cover the political context of the anthrax story? By political context we mean coverage that illuminated the political and policy background of the story and made connections between political decision-making and the functioning of the nations public health system, particularly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of 174 news articles, supplemented by interviews with key reporters, we find that political context was included inconsistently and in sometimes strikingly different ways by the two papers, and lines of accountability extending beyond the CDC itself were not clearly traced. We theorize that these patterns in coverage of political context reflect the nature of reporting on public health issues, which inevitably span several beats; the different relationship of the two papers to the CDC; and the unwillingness of key public health sources to articulate certain claims in the heat of the crisis."

However, with more relatives caring for patients, confidentiality maintenance has become more complex. The purpose of this study was to investigate physician disclosures of confidential health information to relatives of patients. Based on the content analyzed transcripts of 22 internists, the physicians narratives offered insights into this phenomenon. The physicians shared that disclosures to relatives of patients were common, occurring daily, regardless of whether or not they had permission from patients. However, they argued that most frequent disclosures appeared to be harmless. The experiences shared by the physicians illustrated important aspects of the confidentiality issue which need to be more fully explored in future studies."

In this study, a Web site on the topic of the state budget was created and tested to assure maximum usability by citizens. It found that a site designed to conform to users wants and needs in content and navigation did indeed foster positive attitudes toward civic engagement. All three hypotheses about site features that are under control of Internet journalists  usability of navigation, story content, and site design  showed strong correlations with positive attitudes toward civic engagement. Likelihood of re-visiting the site also was significantly and positively related to more positive attitudes about civic engagement."

Following an examination and evaluation of an arduous history of democracy in this country, the paper sets out to identify clusters of public problems, opportunities and the goals of the community of people living in the city of Kathmandu. The essay then sets out to spell out some techniques for actually doing public-oriented journalism focused on one of this city's major problems-- bureaucratic corruption. The technique is largely based on Arthur Charitys book Doing Public Journalism (1995), and Daniel Yankelovichs model of public judgment. The paper emphasizes the pragmatic value of public-oriented journalism in a developing, emerging democracy."

Though public relations practice everywhere is suffering from low standards of professionalism, practitioners are hardly looking for support from public relations scholars. The question is why. In this paper I will argue that this is not because practitioners are reluctant to adopt the scholarly work that has been done, but because, in defining what professionalism is all about, practitioners and scholars live in different worlds.

The literature shows four clusters of theories of professionalism. In this paper I will identify these and position them in a typology of professionalism models. I will then question common views on professionalization held by the academic public relations community on the one hand, and by practitioners, their associations and their clients, on the other hand. The academics common view on professionalism is rooted in a model of rational intelligence and group identity, while practice seems to embrace an opposite view on professionalism, based on emotional intelligence and individual identity. Coherence in views on professionalism can be seen as a prerequisite for development of practice. In this paper I will propose a new model of professionalism in which certain values of previous views are adhered to and, where appropriate, partially integrated."

Specifically, the study identifies the presence of mobilizing information, which allows audiences to determine whether, how, when, and where they can participate in the political process. While the idea of mobilizing information is not new, factors like the growth of the Internet, modifications news writing and newspaper layouts, and heightened attention to low rates of civic participation have made the topic worthy of re-examination. This study analyzed the frequency of mobilizing information in six daily newspapers during the Texas statewide elections of 2002. It found that mobilizing information was present in only 15 percent of the 1,311 total campaign/election stories published. Of those stories, an overwhelming number (70 percent) provided electoral information (e.g., registering to vote, voting locations, etc.), as opposed to only 28 percent concerning political information (e.g., political volunteering, attending campaign events, contacting candidates). The author concludes that this disproportionate emphasis upon electoral participation tacitly devalues other political activities in which citizens should involve themselves, discourages further information seeking beyond that which the newspaper provides, and leaves political actors with a sense that all that is expected of their civic responsibility is to casting a ballot."

The diverging results may derive from the fact that previous studies have largely overlooked a key factor of news coverage, conflict. Moreover, the studies did not investigate a potential context dependency of news coverage. Focusing on the supra-national issue of European integration, we studied whether the level of conflict displayed in TV news coverage of the EU affected citizens' engagement in EU politics. Moreover, we investigated whether these effects were contingent upon the nature of elite opinion about European integration. Linking content analysis and survey data at the individual level in 13 EU countries, we found that higher levels of conflict in news increased citizens' engagement in politics if elite opinion was consensual. However, if elite opinion was polarized, conflict in news decreased people's engagement in EU politics. Our study may thus help to initially reconcile previous research by pointing out the context dependency of media effects."

Even with the destabilization of borders through the diffusion of new technologies, national regimes continue to exert a major influence on every aspect of information flowaccessibility, censorship, infrastructure, etc. In the contemporary literature on international development, the free flow of information is described by the concept of transparency. This paper examines the transparency strategy of Qatar, particularly through its sponsorship of the Al Jazeera satellite network. Qatar attempts a careful balance of strategic foreign alliances, regional leadership, and national autonomy. Increasingly intense global and grassroots pressures pose a dramatic challenge to this delicate Qatari position."

However, while much research has focused on organization-wide implementation of QI, there has been little empirical research on the factors that contribute to the success of the implementation of QI programs at the work unit level. The goal of this project is to identify factors determine the adoption and effective implementation of QI programs by work units and teams. The study evaluated structural, process and communication models of the adoption and implementation of QI in work units in a state agency. Dependent variables were level of participation in QI, willingness to undertake QI, and attitudes toward QI. A survey was conducted in a state agency regional office which had adopted a number of quality initiatives. Results of the study indicated that four structural variablescontrol over decisions, unit independence, task interdependence, and rate of change in unit proceduresthree process variablesvigilance, boundary spanning, and efficiency two job stress variablesjob frustration and job stress and two communication variables communication quality and communication network predicted one or more of the outcomes. Results also suggested modifications to the original model. Implications for QI implementation in state agencies are discussed."

Digital Literacy, Information Literacy, and Computer Literacy are all common terms used to understand how people access, evaluate and understand online content. The current study looks to conceptually define Internet literacy within the context of media literacy (or more commonly referred to as television literacy), and to empirically outline how children access and evaluate information online when faced with cognitive interference. Using e-tracking files to understand access and manipulating source presence, advertising, and dynamism to understand information and source credibility perceptions, and content recall, this research initiates a needed research agenda aimed at children and Internet literacy. Our results demonstrate that children do use different open search strategies and content such as source, dynamism and advertising do influence credibility perceptions and recall."

Typically, it involves Western men traveling to developing countries for the purpose of buying sex. The focus of this paper is on the construction, maintenance, and movement of symbolic representations of sex workers and sex tourists. The site for analysis is a discussion board on a sex tourism website where 'hobbyists' exchange information on travel for sex. This study utilizes a multi-level, multi-theoretical approach that employs a computer assisted content analysis and network analysis of semantic networks in an Internet website for sex tourism. Information communication technologies, such as the Internet play a particularly important role not only in the promotion and packaging of sex travel but of a new type of global surveillance of bodies, race, and desire. The imagining of women as available and submissive is structured by racialized, sexualized, and commodified discursive formations."
2004-0689,Race-ing Sexuality: Interracial Pornography and Asian American Male Audiences,Paper,Race-ing Sexuality: Interracial Pornography and Asian American Male Audiences,"This paper explores how Asian American men who are most underrepresented in American popular culture think and talk about interracial X-rated pornography produced in the United States. The first part of the paper examines dominant forms of interracial X-rated porn in the United States to identify how sexuality of racial minorities is portrayed and constructed in pornographic representations. The discussion involves how such racist representations in porn, as cultural texts, intend to construct the porn audiences perception and view on race and sexuality. For the purpose of the qualitative audience analysis, I will examine discourses on porn in two Asian American online communities. Overall, the goal of this paper is to be able to make links between theory and practice of representation and to critique the limitation and possibility of resistance. The key theme running throughout the analysis of the Asian American male audience of interracial porn is Asian mens constant struggles to reject western misconceptions and stereotypes of Asians and to restore and empower their stigmatized sexuality."

While television is usually available to all inmates, it is at the same time highly controlled by jail and prison authorities. As this study suggests, however, upon closer examination the practices of television viewing are embedded within the context of interracial power dynamics and offer inmates a number of opportunities not only to shift the power from the authorities into their own hands but also to appropriate television viewing as an arena of testing power relations among themselves. The discussion is based on interviews with 64 inmates (50 males, 14 females), conducted at three different correctional facilities in South Texas. The analysis of the interviews suggests three main approaches to television viewing practices among Hispanic, Black, and White inmates: segregation, contestation, and negotiation."

Nevertheless, there has been little academic inquiry into the content of music from this period. The need to remedy this lost opportunity for understanding was highlighted most recently by the Donovan Jackson police brutality case in Inglewood, California. The case, and news reports about it, reflected the continued unstable nature of relations between the police department and members of the African-American community. It also highlighted the general paucity of knowledge about how people sympathetic to the victim might react.

This study investigates issues of race and politics outside the confines of traditional media content. Using fantasy theme analysis, it explores rap music as a location for symbolic convergence following the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The lyrics of some of the rap communitys most prominent voices of the early nineties (Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Willie D) are examined, and the setting, character, and action themes that contributed to a larger rhetorical vision of the uprising are identified. The idea of a war between Black America and White America serves as the master analogy in these songs. The riots are portrayed as a justified form of protest against systematic oppression by dominant individuals and institutions."

Some theories, for instance, the concept of selective exposure, propose a non-intentional, rather unconscious media selection, whereas action-theoretical concepts like the uses-and-gratifications-approach suggest well-planned, rational choices. The present study assessed the rationality of media selection given the condition that multiple similar media offers are available. In this case, very specific decisions are required, which should involve more rational thinking than unspecific selections. Rationality was defined as (1) match between general motivations and according expectations towards the media offers that respondents intended to use and (2) match between expectations towards a media product and actually obtained gratifications. Findings from a repeated-measure survey of 290 users of soccer-related media suggest highly rational decisions with respect to both defined facets of rationality."

The influence of sensation seeking and decision-making styles on condom attitudes and risk perception will be emphasized in this paper. In the experiment, 144 18- to 25-year old undergraduate college students enrolled in communication classes were exposed to either a high or a low physical appeal message. After reading the test pamphlets, they completed the Wittes Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale and the following measures: sensation seeking, decision-making styles, fear arousal, message reactance, defensive avoidance, condom attitudes, and knowledge about gonorrhea. They also evaluated the appropriateness of the content in the test pamphlets in terms of language and word choices used, statistics presented, and the use of photographs and testimonials. Main effects for sensation seeking on perceived threat and condom attitudes with respect to interpersonal impact were found. Main effects for decision-making styles on perceived efficacy and condom attitudes with respect to interpersonal impact and self-control were also found. Lastly, main effects for message condition on perceived efficacy, condom attitudes with respect to self-control and the appropriateness of the content, were also found."

2004-0695,"Reactance, Message Processing and Failed Health Campaigns",Paper,"Reactance, Message Processing and Failed Health Campaigns","One commonly cited cause for the failure of health campaigns aimed at reducing alcohol consumption among young adults is psychological reactance. Through attempting to limit the freedom of young adults, campaigns can induce reactance and result in increased alcohol consumption. To date, little research has examined the role cognitive processing plays in responses to health messages by individuals experiencing reactance. To address this issue, we develop and test a model of the impact of reactance on message processing. Reactance is proposed to induce anger, which spurs biased processing and, ultimately, results in negative attitudes towards abstaining from alcohol. The findings from this study provide a foundation for future research examining message factors that may mitigate the detrimental effects of psychological reactance in health campaigns."
2004-0696,Reactions to 9/11 at a Function of Terror Management and Perspective Taking,Paper,Reactions to 9/11 at a Function of Terror Management and Perspective Taking,"The present study investigated the types of behaviors people had displayed in reaction to 9/11 incidents, tested the main premise of terror management theory (TMT) that the need for reducing/eliminating existential terror is the primary motive for these reactions, and found that people may have an inevitable need for interpersonal communication in horrific events such as 9/11. Individual differences (e.g., perspective-taking) were also considered. Prior TMT research has established that a majority of behaviors people engage in - especially when ones mortality is made salient as in the case of 9/11- are terror management mechanisms (e.g., investment in personal relationships, prosocial behavior, and interpersonal aggression). However, it is not yet known that these findings hold true when tested from the perspective of participants (e.g., open-ended responses). Also, TMT has not yet been tested in a real life situation in which the threat to ones existence is authentic. Data for the present study were collected two weeks after the fatal 9/11 incidents. Relying on Pyszczynski et al.s (1999) dual model of terror management, the present study asked directly what individuals initial (proximal) and delayed (distal) reactions were and what their motives for those reactions were. Results indicated that a vast majority of people experienced shock/disbelief as a proximal defense. In addition, participants reported enacting a wide range of distal defenses involving altruistic/prosocial behavior, intensified search for meaning/value, comforting, seeking/sharing information, relational investment, and counter-bigotry activism. All in all, most people engaged in some form(s) of interpersonal communication in an effort to alleviate fear of extinction. People also pointed out the need for terror management as the motive for these reactions. However, perspective taking did not affect the preference for types of terror management defenses and need for defense, except the fact that a greater number of high perspective takers reportedly took action as opposed to low perspective takers."
2004-0697,Recognizing the Power of Fat Fashion: Mode Readers Respond to Cultural Erasure,Paper,Recognizing the Power of Fat Fashion: Mode Readers Respond to Cultural Erasure,"Mode magazine, a plus size womens fashion magazine (1997-2001), was unique in its ability to cultivate reader feedback and forum space for women seeking to engage other women and culture in a dialog about the plus size body. More than simply fashion questions, women asked their fellow readers and Mode editors about where in culture they fit, and specifically, why their clothing figuratively restrained their role as women. Using Barthes (1983) analysis of the fashion system, this project unpacks why women requested information on lingerie, bridal wear and maternity wear more than any other category of clothing. As Barthes fashion dreamers, these plus size women recognized and sought to remedy their own erasure from culture via the heavily coded areas of gendered life these fashion exclusions created: heterosexual marriage, female sexuality, and pregnancy. To recover resistant space within the fashion industry, plus size women sought a new marginalizing boundary, that of woman, rather than plus size woman from which to articulate their subjectivity."
2004-0698,Re-conceiving the BBC as a Post-British Entity,Paper,Re-conceiving the BBC as a Post-British Entity,"This paper places recent developments with the British Broadcasting Corporation in the context of deeper cultural and economic shifts that are combining to undermine the corporations traditional dual role as domestic public service broadcaster and government-sponsored vehicle of international public diplomacy. It attempts to theorize these changes through application of the concept of post-Britishness, which seeks to articulate and interpret mediated post-colonial cultural identities among the english-speaking peoples of the world. It suggests that the BBC provides an excellent case study for understanding and reevaluating the broader paradigm shift, facilitated by rapid technological change, from international communication to global communication. The paper suggests that the BBC both reflects and facilitates the formation of a particular set of post-British identities from the cross-currents of global communication between and among the nation-states, nations, diasporas, and other cultural groupings that made up the former British empire (including constituent nations of the UK and diasporic communities)."
2004-0699,Reconceptualizing the Global and the Local in Postdevelopment Discourse,Paper,Reconceptualizing the Global and the Local in Postdevelopment Discourse,"Using the cultural turn in development studies as a backdrop, this paper argues for a reconstruction of the development subject that has been deconstructed by the poststructuralist critique of the dominant development discourse. Focusing the tensions the poststructuralist debate entails, this paper compares the three templates featuring the relationship of the global and the local: think globally, act locally, think locally, act globally and think locally, act locally. It proposes a synthesis think glocally, act glocally as a better conceptual device in theorizing postdevelopment interventions. This reconceptualization balances poststructuralist tendency to retreat to the local with an emphasis on the normative concern of global capitalism. It also aims to reconstitute the designated subjectivity in the development discourse with materiality and corporeality by combining a cultural politics with political economy. The paper also engage in the essentialization discourse and argues for a postcolonial sensibility in development studies where the term hybridity offers a better understanding of the dynamics between the global and local."
2004-0700,Reconciling framing and ideological analysis: An exploratory study of business news,Paper,Reconciling framing and ideological analysis: An exploratory study of business news,"Positivist and critical approaches to the media are seen frequently as irreconcilable. However, a review of the literature regarding framing analysis and ideological analysis suggests that the gulf between the two approaches is not as wide as it seems. The two approaches complement each other. Methodologically, framing suggests a robust way of analyzing content. This is an issue ideological analysis is somewhat vague upon. However, ideological analysis enables the analyst to capture attributes of the text that cannot be reduced to ordinal or even categorical variables. It also offers theoretical linkages between the institutional realities of producing media content and the type of content that is produced, a matter on which framing is relatively silent. Applying these two approaches in conjunction to the coverage of corporate mergers suggests that the media tend to achieve ideological closure naturalizing media mergers as inevitable processes that are beyond the scope of normal citizens influence."

This paper reviews previous third person effect and question order effect studies and then discusses underlying process of question order effect which may provide a theoretical bridge between question order effect and third person effect. Finally, the paper suggests a new approach to understand the relationship between question order effect and third person effect based on the attitude construal perspective."
2004-0702,Recording Strife: The media industry's legal reactions to VCR and DVR technology,Paper,Recording Strife: The media industry's legal reactions to VCR and DVR technology,"This paper compares legal reactions from within the existing media industry against Sony Betamax VCR technology in the early 1980s and ReplayTVs digital video recorder (DVR) technology in the early 21st century. In each case, content producers sought to limit the extent of recording technology out of fear that it would prove disruptive to entrenched economic systems. Legal means were utilized to protect control over the exhibition of content. Differences are also explored, including the impact of digital and networked technology. The paper concludes that factors outside the innate abilities of a technology determine the ultimate shape of the technology as it appears to consumers."
2004-0703,Redefining Public Access Strategies,Paper,Redefining Public Access Strategies,"Providing computers and Internet access to members of the community have taken several forms in many countries over the past several years. Called community networks, telecenters, community technology centers, or freenets, such endeavors represent a range of institutional bases, of ideological premises, of State commitments, and of local empowerment.

The research presented here focuses on one set of such efforts, a program whereby 36 communities of varying sizes received $500,000 to establish community networks over a two year period. This project investigates the efforts of those towns and cities in order to assess how communities organized themselves  essentially the process features (management, access to expertise, organizing volunteers, organizing training, etc.) associated with their community networks  and to assess the range of outcomes attributable to local networking activities. The research compares the 36 sites and highlights the unique roles and difficulties of collaboration, large-institution involvement and support, and the economic development and civic engagement processes associated with technology training and access.

This paper singles out the establishment of public access sites specifically and analyzes strategies by which communities attempted to structure such places to provide computer and Internet services. The case of these public access sites illustrates the difficulties communities face in re-mapping sites of power and control to create advantages for the poor and minority populations."

Using an adapted appraisal model of emotion in public relations, crucial dimensions are added to Camerons contingency theory that take into account emotional tone, weight and temperature with regard to contingency factors. An emotion-laden contingency model is presented on a multidimensional plane, proposing that for a given public at a given time in a given public relations encounter, and across external and internal contingent factors, the publics emotional tone, temperature and weight regarding encounter-related contingency factors will have strong effects on the publics stance toward the organization on the accommodation continuum."

This paper however attempts to dispel this notion and provide evidence based on historical sources to illustrate that the Korean printing press did effect changes in medieval Korean society. This paper will show that in conjunction with certain other social factors, the Korean printing press altered the strict social hierarchy of Korean society. This change proved to be of fundamental importance for it was the vital element that led to the downfall of the Koryo dynasty and the ascendance of the succeeding Chosun dynasty."

This study addresses the research question ""Do people who use the Internet more frequently and for longer periods of time experience lower symptoms of depression than less frequent users?"" It points out two gaps that previous studies on the relationships between Internet use, Internet self-efficacy and depression have failed to address: (1) the lack of consideration for the gender of Internet users; and (2) that the focus in this area have been on finding linear effects amongst related variables. This study proposed a moderated-mediation model and used path analysis to test it, results found that Internet efficacy, mediated by a persons gender, has different effects on depression according to the amount of Internet use. Implications, limitations and directions for future studies are discussed."

This study compared the penetration rates of these newspapers print and online editions. Results showed the print editions enjoyed significantly higher penetrations than their online counterparts. The study also identified the overlap of the same newspapers online and print readerships. Print penetrations were not reduced among Web users. Readers of a newspapers online edition were more likely to read the same newspapers print edition and vice versa. These results have demonstrated striking similarities with what the earlier U.S.-based study has found -- suggesting the existence of a universal pattern characterizing the market relation between online and print newspapers."
2004-0708,Reflections: A Bibliometric Analysis of Intercultural Communication Articles (1977-2002),Paper,Reflections: A Bibliometric Analysis of Intercultural Communication Articles (1977-2002),"Abstract
Unlike past reviews of intercultural communication research, this review is supported with descriptive statistics based on a bibliometric analysis of intercultural communication literature. 632 intercultural communication articles from the International Journal of Intercultural Relations (IJIR) and 348 from various communication journals from 1977 to 2002 are analyzed. Among the various results, William B. Gudykunst is found to be the most prolific author and the Howard Journal of Communication is the top intercultural communication journal. Results also show that approximately 85 percent of authors have only written one article. Results also suggest that a large percentage of the research is written by U.S. authors. Implications of these last two findings are especially addressed. Lotkas and Bradfords laws of bibliometrics were also tested for the intercultural communication literature."
2004-0709,Regulating for C0mpetition: The Paradox of the 1996 Telecommunications Act,Paper,Regulating for C0mpetition: The Paradox of the 1996 Telecommunications Act,"Our point of departure is that deregulation in the U.S. has not created what most economic philosophy would have predicted. Grappling with how regulatory policy can interact with an industry buffeted by technological change must lead us toward new models of technology regulation, models that require re-calibration and the primacy of fundamental goals. This paper discusses competition in terms of issues that illustrate the fragility of competition in universal service, unbundling and interconnection, and broadband services. Each of these cases is scrutinized in terms of penetration and cost data. We conclude that USF funding has been undermined by technological change, and that competition in broadband services (and local voice) has unfolded in in equitable patterns. These challenges - the rural-urban digital divide spanning the maintenance of universal services high cost fund as well as uneven broadband deployment  should prompt reexamination of the premises of the competitive model."
2004-0710,Regulation and Technological innovation. The case of ITT's Project Deep Freeze,Paper,Regulation and Technological innovation. The case of ITT's Project Deep Freeze,"This paper focuses on the issues of overlapping markets, innovation and convergence in the international telecommunications market of the 1950s. The first international telephone cable TAT1 in 1956 faced regulators with the problem of the convergence of international telephone and telegraph  markets that had been kept separate by the FCC. At the same time International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) proposed new technology for a transatlantic telegraph cable designed to improve its market share and mobilized defense interests in its support. The paper seeks to demonstrate from historical analysis how market structure, foreign policy, security policy and domestic regulation can interact in hindering the adoption of innovatory technology. It raises the question of how regulators should respond to innovatory services provided in adjacent markets by dominant incumbents."
2004-0711,Relational Communication in Computer-mediated Interaction: A Comparison of Participant-Observer Perspectives,Paper,Relational Communication in Computer-mediated Interaction: A Comparison of Participant-Observer Perspectives,"This study utilizes the participant-observer paradigm to re-examine relational communication in the context of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Prior research employing this approach in face-to-face (FtF) interaction reports that participants and observers generally agree on the direction of relational message interpretations (e.g., positive or negative), but participant ratings are simply more intense or extreme. At issue in this study was the extent to which these predictions extended to CMC or whether the context of the interaction moderates relational message interpretations. A laboratory study employing a 2 (positive- versus negative-disclosure) by 2 (participant versus observer) by 2 (CMC versus FtF) examined differences in relational messages (Burgoon & Hale, 1984). The overall results provided general support for the predicted participant-observer differences, although the interaction context emerged as a moderator on two relational dimensions. Moreover, significant differences also emerged between CMC and FtF contexts. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed."

I used the relationship cultivation strategies and relationship outcomes developed by Hon and J. Grunig (1999) to explore how differently multinational and Taiwanese companies build relationships with their publics in China. I conducted qualitative interviews with 20 participants from 18 Taiwanese companies and compared the findings with Hungs (2003) study on multinational companies in China. The findings show that two-way and symmetrical communication were the best dimensions for both multinational and Taiwanese companies to achieve quality relationships. Among all the relationship cultivation strategies, positivity and cooperation were the strategies multinational and Taiwanese companies used the most to build trust, control mutuality, commitment, and satisfaction with their Chinese publics. This study not only provides more insightful evidences for the research on relationship management, but also gives more information on practicing successful public relations at the global setting."
2004-0714,Relationship development and workplace integration: An evolutionary perspective,Paper,Relationship development and workplace integration: An evolutionary perspective,"In this paper we argue that recent scholarship emanating from the field of evolutionary psychology (EP) promises to further current understandings of organizational communication practices and processes. To this end, we review EPs core assumptions about human nature and behavior, and then examine two adaptive mechanisms that underlie the ubiquitous practice of workplace collaboration. Next, we describe how reciprocal altruism and preference for similarity underscore the exchange and coordination activities of employees relationships at work. The model of relationship development we propose is then discussed in terms of uncertainty, employee adjustment and organizational integration processes. In conclusion, we highlight the potential of EP as both a meta-theoretic framework through which seemingly disparate areas of scholarship can be unified, as well as a vehicle for theoretical development, a catalyst of novel predictions about communication in organizations, grounded in ultimate, rather than proximate causation."
2004-0715,Relationship Maintenance Strategies by Industry Type,Paper,Relationship Maintenance Strategies by Industry Type,"For this study, a content analysis of 286 Web sites was conducted in order to explore how corporations utilize their Web sites to strategically and effectively manage relationships with their publics. Company Web sites were selected from the 2002 Fortune 500 list according to industry type. Positivity, openness, sharing of task, networking and access were adopted as relationship maintenance strategies.
Two research questions were explored, with the first addressing how well organizations use the positivity, openness, sharing of tasks, networking, and access as relationship maintenance strategies through their Web sites. The results revealed that openness items were most common and used at the highest level on the corporate Web sites.
The second research question addressed whether different types of industries utilize different levels of relationship maintenance strategies. Three of the strategies, positivity, openness, and access provided a significant result in differentiation of industry type."
2004-0716,Relationships between image and organization-public relationships: Interaction between symbolic relationships and behavioral relationships,Paper,Relationships between image and organization-public relationships: Interaction between symbolic relationships and behavioral relationships,"The purpose of this study is to suggest that effectiveness of public relations should be evaluated in terms of behavioral relationships as well as symbolic relationships by examining relationships between image and organization-public relationships. This study empirically investigated relationships between public relationships and corporate image and furthermore explored whether the relationships differed depending different corporations (public/private) as well as groups (professional/non-professional). A survey was conducted with 423 respondents. It found that there were statistically significant positive correlations between corporate image and multiple components of public relationships in the public and private corporations as well as in the professional and non-professional groups. Moreover, it discovered that the components of public relationships affecting corporate image were almost similar in both corporations. It also found that components of public relationships affecting corporate image were different between professional groups and non-professional ones, for the public corporation, whereas they, except one component, were almost similar in both groups, for the private corporation. Conclusively, these findings suggest that there were close relationships between corporate image and public relationships, implying that effectiveness of public relations should be evaluated in terms of behavioral relationships as well as symbolic relationships."

This paper reports on field research on religious meaning-making in the media age. Beginning with a review of relevant literatures in media studies and religious studies, it goes on to present a taxonomy of ten categories of religious meaning practice that have emerged in in-depth household-level interviews. These categories provide an opportunity to test received ideas about the implications of the media sphere for the practices, understandings, and prospects of religion in the late-modern age. Among the findings re that media have come to play an integrative role in indivudal relitious idenity-builing, and that their role is one that is sublte, tacit, and complex. The paper also includes discussion of emerging theories and methods in qualitative media audience research."

After describing the context of the execution imagethe Oklahoma City bombing, its community response, and the relationship between the survivors and the criminal justice systemthe paper turns to an analysis of the execution itself as a communicative event. In comparing and contrasting the execution image to commemorative memorial photography and evidence photographs, officially taken images of violent death, the paper argues that such photographic images that convey the actuality of the end enable awareness, thereby offering therapeutic potential to those desperate for finality."
2004-0719,Renewing a Deweyan Cultural Studies Project through Pragmatist Publics: Contributions from James Carey and Michel Foucault?,Paper,Renewing a Deweyan Cultural Studies Project through Pragmatist Publics: Contributions from James Carey and Michel Foucault?,"James Carey has raised serious questions about the political relevance of contemporary cultural studies work in terms of its ability to engage conventional liberal/capitalist thought. To address this situation, Carey has attempted to distinguish his Dewey group from French influences, particularly the work of Michel Foucault. This paper suggests that Careys analysis of the contemporary political situation and articulation of the tasks of cultural studies (a confrontation with scientism, a recovery of historical consciousness, and the reconstruction of Deweys view of publics) remains valid and reachable. However, his proposal for abandoning Foucaulta central aspect of his proposed strategy for re-focusing cultural studiesis deeply flawed. In response, this paper outlines the conditions likely facilitating Careys understanding of Foucault and forwards a counter proposal for advancing the values and tasks of American cultural studies as articulated by Carey at the theoretical level. This counterproposal suggests that a Deweyan cultural studies requires many of the tools advanced by Michel Foucaultarchaeologies of discourse, genealogies of values and problematizationin order to meet the conditions set forth by Dewey for the constitution of publics. It focuses on a) what Foucault knew and read of Dewey, b) Foucaults employment of Deweys view of a history of the present, and c) the shared rejection of Hobbesian sovereignty as a means of rethinking the analysis of power relations. I conclude by elaborating on Foucaults self understanding of problematization and suggest this critical practice is central to any pragmatic renewal of Deweys critical project."

It is therefore even more significant to know how the news media coverage health and health issues. The authors extend previous research on the public health perspective on reporting crime news to include general health topics, such as health care, and social services. A content analysis was conducted on health news articles in The Minneapolis Star Tribune in 1982 and 2001. The purpose of the study was to examine how the reporting patterns on general health and crime/violence topics have changed after the calls for public health perspective initiated by scholars and practitioners in early 1990s."

The overall purpose of this paper is to examine and compare how leading Swedish news media in television and the press covered and described the terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11 in 2001, the US attacks on Afghanistan later in 2001 and the war in Iraq in 2003. The paper examines factors influencing news decisions and media ability to maintain fair news reporting. The study looks specifically at the sources that are used, the occurence of speculations and whether the coverage were anti-American or anti-Muslim. The central questions are:

 What were the most frequently used sources?
 How frequent were different types of speculations?
 How frequent were anti-American and anti-Muslim rhetorical figures respectively?"

Two six-week periods are evaluated, one in 2002 when the US and its allies were focused on unilateral action, and one in 2003 when the US and its allies realized multilateral cooperation and assistance were necessary in Iraq. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that the United Nations was much more favorably framed in 2003 than in 2002. This is in accordance with the US policy shift, and illustrates the power of dominant ideology in media framing."

The method of the study is qualitative text analysis based on Davis's and van Dijk's hypothetical schema of the news. Furthermore, the news actors in the headlines and the leads were documented quantitatively to determine the dominant and main actors during the research period

The main purpose of the study is to investigate how Turkish daily newspapers have different ideological perspectives that represent the possibility of war and of peace.

Three issues were mainly investigated in this study: Firstly, the representation of the United States of the America; the stands` of newspapers to USA were different according to their ideology. Secondly, Northern Iraq or Kurds were address because according to Turkish political discourse `Northern Iraq` is very sensitive. All newspapers were nationalistic and sensationalized anti-Kurdish sentiment. Lastly, demonstrations for peace and peace lovers were viewed negatively according to Hurriyet, yet Hurriyet continued to support USA resistance and occupation in Iraq. On the other side Yeni Safak and Cumhuriyet were attitude positively the peace activists."

They are excluded from combat roles and find it difficult to advance through the ranks. This difficulty is recreated in how female soldiers are represented in the media. This research examines how media representations of female soldiers separate their feminine identity from their military identity. Specifically we perform a feminist/critical rhetorical analysis of news stories on Private Jessica Lynchs experiences in Iraq. First, we argue that the media reproduces traditional patriarchal roles for female prisoners-of-war. Second, we argue that Private Jessica Lynchs rescue is a rhetorical act to demonstrate U.S. Military prowess. This demonstration creates a deeper rift between the roles of women and soldiers in the U.S. Military."
2004-0725,Rethinking Hate Speech Law,Paper,Rethinking Hate Speech Law,"This project re-examines the question of whether so-called ""hate speech"" deserves protection under the First Amendment. That question, I argue, arises from a need to balance competing narratives about the American value system. I address the question of prohibitions on racist speech from a perspective that attempts to take the competing stories about America into account. While I do not pretend that an easy balance of these stories is possible, I will argue that restrictions on speech will not further the goals of outsider jurisprudence, and may be completely counterproductive in the end.

In the essay I articulate my basic understanding of the harms of hate speech and the possible remedies for those harms. An analysis of the Supreme Court's decision in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, which most scholars agree closed the book on the possibility of criminalizing racist speech, reveals some fundamental problems in the underlying narrative of America expressed by the Court. Nevertheless, from a social and cultural perspective, efforts to criminalize hate speech do nothing to further -- and may even hinder -- more progressive American narratives."
2004-0726,Rethinking Interference Management,Paper,Rethinking Interference Management,"This paper suggests and analyses the possibility that electromagnetic spectrum owners or users in the USA manage radio interference independent of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC proposes to manage interference through a regulator-defined metric called interference temperature. Instead, we suggest that individual agents can minimize interference according to their own objectives and constraints including criteria set by the regulator. The paper first criticizes the FCC proposal, and then contends that possibilities exist wherein interference can be managed individually by processes other than what the FCC proposed, independent of direct regulatory control. In a broader sense, we suggest that such regulation might not be necessary, and should be revaluated, especially in the light of new methods of technique and organization."
2004-0727,"Rethinking the Prescriptive: A Closer Look at Feminism, Postmodernism, and Ethics in Communication Studies",Paper,"Rethinking the Prescriptive: A Closer Look at Feminism, Postmodernism, and Ethics in Communication Studies","Communication studies as a field can trace its genealogy back to a plethora of academic disciplines. With roots in sociology, psychology, linguistics etc., mapping the field and identifying the historical and methodological underpinnings of traditional communication theory has been an often contested and contentious occupation for communication scholars. A recent resurgence in the desire to reinvent itself provides communication studies, and its teachings of professional practices, a moment to rethink old methods and align itself with a more critical understanding of ethics within the field. Addressing this, the following discussion attempts to raise ideas about how the inclusion of feminism and postmodernism within communication studies provides a moment to renegotiate traditional notions of ethics as established by professional organizations within the field, and include a more contextual understanding of such. The paper attempts to explain why this particular moment in communication studies, during which feminism and postmodernism are becoming established as parts of the field, is an important juncture to introduce and adopt a non-distributive model of ethics."

This study utilizes niche theory to examine the niche of instant messaging (IM) in relation to those of the telephone and e-mail in providing sociability gratifications and gratification opportunities. The overall results indicate that the niche of IM is characterized by competition with e-mail in fulfilling sociability gratifications and the telephone in providing gratification opportunities. It also overlaps substantially with that of the telephone on the prior dimension and e-mail on the latter one, indicating a degree of substitutability. Moreover, IM emerged superior to e-mail on the sociability gratification and gratification opportunities dimensions, but was only marginally superior to the telephone on the latter dimension; the telephone was superior to IM on the sociability dimension. This latter set of findings places IM on a continuum of overall utility in between the telephone and e-mail. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
2004-0729,Revolution on the Net: Media in the Zapatista Uprising,Paper,Revolution on the Net: Media in the Zapatista Uprising,"A New Years Eve uprising nearly a decade ago linked two strikingly different communities: a network of technology leaders in urban Mexico, the United States, and Europe with isolated, indigenous peasants in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas. This is a study of the community they created and the communications medium that allowed them to construct it together. Understanding that process illuminates the role of technology in revolutionary media, updating the understanding of both media determinism and revolutionary media. Relying on archives of rebel communiqués and list serves that linked the insurgency in Chiapas to cyberspace supporters, with context from contemporaneous mainstream news reports, this study follows developments from the perspective of the participants, the neighbors of the imagined Zapatista community."
2004-0730,Risk Behaviors and Attitudes Of U.S. And Russian Injection Drug Users: A Call For Tailored Interventions,Paper,Risk Behaviors and Attitudes Of U.S. And Russian Injection Drug Users: A Call For Tailored Interventions,"Two separate databases, one on Russian (n=444) injection drug users (IDUs), and the other on U.S. IDUs (n=241), were merged, and responses were compared. Results indicated that Russian IDUs perceived themselves to be at greater risk for HIV/AIDS based upon behaviors over the past 90 days. U.S. IDUs were more likely to be tested for HIV, report a negative HIV test result, and know more people with HIV. U.S. IDUs consumed greater amounts of alcohol and marijuana, and made more alcohol/drug treatment attempts than Russian IDUs. Russian IDUs injected more frequently, although were more likely to recently use clean needles.
Russian and U.S. IDUs responded significantly differently to eight AIDS knowledge questions. Eight condom attitude questions were asked of each group, and each revealed significantly different responses. Gender differences for Russian IDUs were also observed. There is a clear need to create culturally targeted sexual risk reduction interventions."
2004-0731,Risk Mitigation through Uncertainty Reduction in Online Auctions,Paper,Risk Mitigation through Uncertainty Reduction in Online Auctions,"This research extends two relatively new concerns in computer-mediated communicationinformation seeking with the aid of new media and the indirect exchange of information between individualsby examining behaviors in online commercial transactions as communication acts intended to reduce uncertainty between interactants. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (Berger, 1979; Berger & Calabrese, 1975) and Predicted Outcome Value theory (Sunnafrank, 1986a, 1990) are used to contextualize individuals motivations and behaviors in the risky and uncertain environment of online consumer-to-consumer auctions. Data from 6,477 randomly-selected auctions conducted over eBay.com are used to test hypotheses formed to interpret individual behaviors in this domain. Results indicate that more commodity information leads to more, and higher, final bids; higher seller reputation results in fewer bids for less money; and greater system security features result in fewer bids. Additionally, when controlling for item type, much more variance in final bid price and bid activity can be explained by these factors as item value increases, although important differences in the direction of relations emerge as well. Based on these findings, current theoretical perspectives on uncertainty reduction are extended to the environment of computer-mediated communication and interpretations are offered to explain individuals behaviors in initial encounters in online auctions."
2004-0732,Rudali (The Lamenter): Mourning as Cultural Practice,Paper,Rudali (The Lamenter): Mourning as Cultural Practice,"In this paper I employ a critical intercultural communication frame to study the creative practice of public mourning or lamenting, among women known as rudaalis in rural India. Their public performance and location in village hierarchy is best understood as subaltern since they are unable to represent the pain and poverty in their daily lives more broadly within creative media that urban upper class women might have access to. Rudaalis lamentations are rarely understood as art or creative practice. Not only are they invisible in the national arena, or in any public discussion of gender and creativity, but the commercialization of art, music, and theatre avenues have not developed the idiom to recognize their valuable embodied contribution to community and society, or their reasons to practice the art.
In examining this very public, cultural practice of a very private emotional experiencegrief, I study the interconnections in implicit binary oppositions of public and private, community and society, male and female, nature and culture (Chakravarty, 1999). This subject is provided by a text, titled Rudaali, written by Bengali woman writer, Mahasweta Devi, and made into a popular Hindi film in 1992 by a woman filmmaker, Kalpana Lajmi. Writing is still regarded as mens domain (Gupta, 2003); and there are just a few women filmmakers despite an over hundred year history of Indian cinema (Subramanyam, 1996). Therefore, both Lajmi and Mahasweta Devi are worthy of note as important literary and film industry figures respectively."

2004-0734,Salience or Vision? A Structural Equation Modeling of the Electoral Choice in the 2000 Presidential Election,Paper,Salience or Vision? A Structural Equation Modeling of the Electoral Choice in the 2000 Presidential Election,"The present structural equation modeling of the electoral choice in the 2000 presidential election demonstrated that issue salience effects are greater than issue vision effects in shaping voting preference, providing support for the non-spatial approach to voting behavior. As maintained by the scholarship on partisan issue ownership, the salience of Democratic issues advantaged the Democratic candidate. These results suggest that political candidates should focus on the issues that their parties have traditionally been perceived to better handle, rather than those issues that their rivals own. That is, simply increasing the salience of those partisan issues is more useful at least in enhancing the electoral effectiveness than focusing on specific policy promises. This study also hypothesized that the advertising media as a principal source of political information for the citizens could indirectly influence the electoral outcomes by increasing the salience of certain issues. This assumption was based upon campaign advertising research and agenda setting theories, yet it was not supported by the present data. Although there was a significant difference between the ad exposure and non-exposure groups in the salience of the top three issues on the advertising agenda, the two groups showed no difference in the role of the salience of the issues as a determinant of the electoral choice. Otherwise stated, wherever the public salience of those issues came from, the impact of the salience of the issues on voting behavior appeared similar."

One more emotionally unpredictable, sexually voluptuous, thickly-accented Latina appearing in Hollywood movies like Desperado (1995), Dusk till Dawn (1996), Fools Rush In (1997), 54 (1998) and Wild Wild West (1999). However, with the 2002 release of Frida, the artsy biopic about the queer-feminist-marxist-Chicana-Mexicana-Latina icon Frida Kahlo, Hayek recuperated her on-screen image and public Hollywood persona. Hayek the subject disrupted gendered, raced and nationalistic borders, while Hayek the body remained nevertheless constrained by a history of racialized and sexualized mainstream media representations. Following an ethnicities-in-relation approach, this article explores the relational construction of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, class and nation through the commodified representations of Hayeks and Kahlos identity and physicality. Furthermore it examines how representations of Latinidad as circulated through public discourses about Hayek, Kahlo, and Hayeks performance of Kahlo connect to broader transformative notions of transnational identities."
2004-0736,SARS and the Urban Double-take,Paper,SARS and the Urban Double-take,"The SARS crisis harshly exposed the fragility of Hong Kongs geo-cultural and political predicament six years after the fateful reunification with China. We may say those have been years of atypical postcoloniality, and everyday life felt like it was suffering from a severe acute recession syndrome. It is necessary to see that the failure in local governance in relation to SARS must in fact be seen in light of concrete practices of urbanity specific to the position of Hong Kong. By urbanity, I mean to bring together a specific connection between SARS and the new imaginations of urban space in Hong Kong during the current moment of rapid integration with the mainland. I therefore mean to shift our attention away from seeing SARS as a disease syndrome with a medical--- and political---virulence, to seeing it as a locus for emergent forms of urban practices specific to our current stage of postcoloniality."

This paper content analyzed five distinct periods of SARS coverage in China from February to May, 2003, including 1479 articles from government media and 114 from non-government media. It was concluded that although government and non-government media coverage of the SARS crisis were different in content and tone, the coverage of non-government media was significantly restricted by government media. Future direction of research was discussed in the end."

Findings show that an organization can play a predominant role in managing how various publics perceive the crisis when that is extensively communicated through news coverage. To effectively manage the perception and emotion of the publics and for the publics to support the organization, the organization must utilize more accommodative stances. Advocacy can be embedded in accommodation if the organization wants its publics to move in the same direction of stance along a continuum from advocacy to accommodation."

It examines the psychological distance assumption of the impersonal impact hypothesis and optimistic bias in the context of SARS risk. Repeated measures ANOVA, t-tests, and multiple regression were used. Results support previous research on risk perceptionsparticipants perceived they were at less risk for SARS than other individuals. Data also supported the impersonal impact hypothesis, which contends that in the absence of direct experience with a risk, interpersonal communication will affect personal risk judgments and media will affect judgment of others."
2004-0740,"Satellites, the Internet and the Global Public Sphere",Paper,"Satellites, the Internet and the Global Public Sphere","This paper considers the need for a global public sphere. The existing mass media, and the public spheres to which they contribute, are closely linked, theoretically and empirically, to the state system. Claims for an emerging global public sphere rest upon the ability of some contemporary media, notably satellite broadcasting and the Internet, to transcend the limits of political geography. The nature and spread of these media is then considered. Contrary to popular (scholarly) opinion, satellite broadcasting is not deterritorialized and has an extremely small audience. While the Internet does not suffer as badly from these limitations, access to it is now, and will remain for many years, open only to a fraction of the worlds population. Claims for an emerging global public sphere are therefore mistaken. In conclusion, the paper examines more fruitful ways of looking at international communication."
2004-0741,Satellite Television Viewing Among Arabs in the U.S.,Paper,Satellite Television Viewing Among Arabs in the U.S.,"Minority ethnic viewers originating from the Arab world are more densely equipped with satellite receivers than the majority population in the United States. Very little research has so far been conducted on the impact of satellite channels. This research study seeks to fill in the knowledge and information gaps in the literature of mass media and ethnic communication and in the literature of Arabs in the United States. This paper is based on a qualitative survey among 50 viewers of Arabic satellite channels in the Portland metropolitan area all from Arab descent. Respondents were asked what they had expected of satellite programs, how their viewing habits had changed with the installation of satellite receivers and how this had affected personal and family attitudes. The study reveals major differences between first generation and second generation Arab viewers as well as significant variations related to gender."

This meta-analysis examines the satisfaction levels participants in mediation compared with those using an adversarial method of dispute resolution. Eleven articles were coded by the authors in order to discern overall satisfaction experienced by people who participated in mediation during child custody hearings, divorces, and other conflicts. The results from this meta-analysis indicate that overall satisfaction ratings were higher for mediation than for litigation. This study challenges existing literature in its findings that comparisons of satisfaction with mediation and adversarial methods of dispute resolution contrasted by gender, with men being more satisfied with mediation and women being more satisfied with adversarial methods."
2004-0743,Saving Face: An Analysis of Ten Time Magazine Front Covers Featuring Chiang Kai-shek,Paper,Saving Face: An Analysis of Ten Time Magazine Front Covers Featuring Chiang Kai-shek,"According to his numerous critics, media mogul Henry Luce was an unapologetic promoter of Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek and his ruling Chinese Nationalist party during the pre-war, World War II, and Chinese civil war eras. Critics harshly accused Luce of using his Time, Inc. media empire, particularly Time Magazine, to promote Chiang and his Nationalist government to the American people despite increasing evidence of rampant corruption, extortion, and incompetence within the regime. It is said that Luce used Chiang and his wife, Madame Chiang, in his print publications to help Americans and the American government identify and connect with China thus in turn support the regime in spirit and with financial resources. This paper analyzes the ten Time magazine issues that feature General Chiang on the front covers and looks for evidence of a Luce and Time magazine agenda in the construction and substance of the covers. The results of this visual analysis indicate that there is some evidence of just such a supportive agenda."
2004-0744,Scheduling Strategies and Program Structure,Paper,Scheduling Strategies and Program Structure,"In our study we take a closer look at the programming strategies of the past three decades in German television. Especially with respect to the introduction of commercial television in Germany in 1984 we raise the question whether or not program strategies originally developed for commercial program planning in the United States are now employed by German TV corporations. Furthermore it is interesting whether there is a difference between public-service and commercial television. To answer these research questions a program analysis of the public-service TV channels Das Erste/ARD and ZDF and the commercial programs RTL, SAT.1 und ProSieben was conducted.
The results are indicating that there are still considerable differences between public-service and commercial television programming. Commercial television uses more strategies stimulating habitual viewing patterns and audience-flow concepts than its public competitors. But over the time period under study a convergence of public and commercial television in their programming strategies is in part observable as well. Nevertheless the public-service broadcasters adhere to their traditional custom and counterprogram each other."
2004-0745,Scopophilic Pleasure and Gender Identity in Being John Malkovich,Paper,Scopophilic Pleasure and Gender Identity in Being John Malkovich,"Since the early 1970s feminist critics and theorists have debated and analyzed the idea of filmic spectatorship. Most of these feminist writings are rooted in Freuds psychoanalytic theories and revolve around the idea of scopophilia, or pleasure in looking. Some argue that it is impossible for a female viewer to be a true spectator of film due to the patriarchal nature of the industry that constantly projects women on the screen as passive objects that merely receive the gaze of the male characters, viewers and camera, without ever returning the gaze (Mulvey, 1975). Other theorists argue that a woman can receive scopophilic pleasure from film viewing, but only by employing a form of transgendered spectatorship (Mulvey, 1981; Kaplan, 1983). This paper addresses the major theoretical perspectives of gendered film spectatorship, applying them to the 1999 film Being John Malkovich. It is argued that through its portrayal of issues of gender identity this film not only encourages female spectatorial pleasure, but that it also effectively illustrates some of the issues of feminist film theory that have been debated for decades."
2004-0746,Scratching Out Authorship: The DJ's Shifting Role in the Electronic Music Industry,Paper,Scratching Out Authorship: The DJ's Shifting Role in the Electronic Music Industry,"This paper argues that the DJ is represented by the electronic music industry as the creative author of his/her music. I examine commercial discourse that is aimed at the consumer of DJ-mixed music, such as rave flyers and electronic music CDs, as well as discourse that is aimed at the DJ-consumer, such as trade magazines and gear catalogues. In all of this discourse, the DJ is presented as the culmination of creative musical technology, as a musical author-god who carries on a long tradition of patriarchal authorship. In light of these observations, I argue that the DJs authorship comes not from what s/he does, but how those practices get represented in a capitalist system. Further, I argue that the industry instilled the DJ with authorship to fill a vacuum left by the increasing anonymity of dance music producers. The DJ becomes a tool for generating social capital within a music scene, and this social capital is turned into monetary capital via the sale of DJ-related commodities."
2004-0747,Seattle's Pike Place Market (de)constructed. An analysis of tourist narratives about a public space,Paper,Seattle's Pike Place Market (de)constructed. An analysis of tourist narratives about a public space,"Public space is not merely a geographical configuration, but also a verbal and visual narrative construction by means of technologies such as writing, photography and storytelling. The construction of a narrative via the means of technology can be political both in the way that it is produced and in the way it is consumed. The authors argue that a power relationship exists between institutional and amateur texts about popular public spaces, such as a citys public market.
Tourist narrative is a good example of this, because it is emblematic of how public space is both communicated to the majority of people as well as how most people use mediated forms of communication to construct narratives of themselves and their experiences in public space.
Tourist literature provides narrative themes in the form of literary descriptions and photographic images, which emphasize and reveal only certain textual portions of a place. Tourists experiences and accounts are inevitably informed by such themes. In addition, studying tourist photography is an excellent way to understand whether people actively use or resist modes of representation that are derived from institutional sources. Tourists are usually remarkably prolific photographers, while also being exposed to a great number and variety of institutional narratives of the sites they visit.
This paper is a critical analysis of the narrative construction of Seattles well-known and heavily touristed Pike Place Market. The analyzed data come from both institutional and amateur sources (e.g. images from travel guides and photographs taken by visitors to the market)."
2004-0748,Seeking Community in Community Networking Projects in Texas,Paper,Seeking Community in Community Networking Projects in Texas,"Communication has long been considered a vital component in international aid and development efforts in the Third World, but relatively little attention has been given to development communications programs in more affluent regions such as Canada, the United States and Western Europe. Recent concerns over the digital divide in these nations have been articulated in the proliferation of technology-based initiatives that aim to provide universal access to information technologies; enhance educational opportunities; facilitate integration into regional, national and global economic systems; and foster production and sharing of local, community-based content. This paper examines a recent effort in the state of Texas providing funding to 36 communities to design and implement their own community networks. An 18-month evaluation of this program is the basis of the paper, which assesses how community economic and social development were inscribed within these networks, the processes by which the projects were undertaken, and the ways that opportunities for community participation and engagement were articulated and enacted. We conclude by assessing the value of these CNs in providing spaces for community members to define, participate in, and benefit from economic and social development processes and outcomes."

A survey of 641 public relations practitioners and journalists showed the differences in agreement, congruency and accuracy regarding their conflict management strategies. Public relations practitioners reported that they employ other-corned strategy more than self-concerned strategy possibly from their need for placement in print or on the air, while journalists are likely to employ self-concerned strategy more than self-concerned strategy with self-efficacy representing that they are independent from any source and maintain the reporters credibility."

In considering the importance and the complexity of signification of Chinese rock and pop, I view pop music as a sign and describe its surrounding complex of symbolic values and activities. Also taken into consideration is the need of tools for the application of semiotic concepts in pop music analysis, as well as the need for understanding and differentiating areas and relevant points of view. One song in particular, Nothing to My Name, performed by Cui Jian  the father of Chinese pop music  at the Tiananmen Square in 1989 is analyzed. To this end, this article helps readers better understand pop music references to and interpretations of experiences caused by phenomena in the larger post-modernist and sociocultural set of reality of which pop music is an integral part."

Several conceptual propositions are forwarded, including that humor appreciation is a multidimensional constructi.e., multiple senses of humor are possible. Data from three surveystwo student surveys and a general population survey--are examined, with results indicating that sense of humor may properly be viewed as multidimensional, and emergent humor dimensions may be validated with preferences for particular media content. Findings are compared to the initial set of propositions, and the usefulness of senses of humor as a communication trait is explored."
2004-0752,Sex Differences in Negotiations: Combining Perspectives from Neurobiological and Communication Domains,Paper,Sex Differences in Negotiations: Combining Perspectives from Neurobiological and Communication Domains,"This paper deals with sex differences in negotiations. Many claims have been made about males outperforming females in negotiations. However, much of this research does not account for the contextual factors involved. In the present study, we replicate prior effects on the sex gap in negotiations and demonstrate that by making certain communication aspects more or less salient sex differences can be bridged. Our findings suggest that making visual information a more important aspect of the negotiation process enables females to attain a shared understanding and thereby increased performance. Whereas such a process was observed in males irrespective of the amount of visual information available, understanding among female dyads benefited significantly from the visual information available. The increased understanding was also accompanied by changes in interpersonal affections. Our results suggest that both males and females follow different routes towards their outcomes: whereas males seem to perform slightly better in general, the amount of visual information available informs females about the other person involved, thereby fostering a shared understanding, which in turn leads to better negotiation outcomes. In our discussion, we propose a possible neurobiological basis for these sex differences, arguing that females process (affective) visual information differently than males do and follow different routes in attaining successful negotiations."

The results of a path model showed that the best predictor of viewer interest and anticipated enjoyment was anticipated humor. Sexual images were associated with increased anticipation that the film would be sexual, which in turn was associated with greater anticipated humor. Violent images were directly associated with increases in anticipated humor. These results are discussed in terms of viewers responses to media images of sexuality and violence, and the importance of these portrayals in the marketing of motion pictures."

In the 87 ads studied, women were depicted primarily as a wife or a mother, who had no job outside the home and lived exclusively in the domestic arena. However, the bodies of women were not the focus of most ads and women were seldom shown as sex objects. Instead, women were shown in shapeless clothes, which symbolized the political and gender ideologies at the time. While no essential difference was found in the representations of women in the Western product advertisings vs. Chinese product advertisings, more emphasis on women's bodies and stronger sex-stereotypes were seen in the former ones."
2004-0755,"Small group productivity: Communication, interpersonal attraction and group identification",Paper,"Small group productivity: Communication, interpersonal attraction and group identification","This paper is about the influence of interpersonal attraction and shared social identities on group negotiation productivity. Three studies showed that interpersonal attraction and shared social identification are crucial aspects of group communication and influence each other to a great extent. That is, shared social identification leads to the development of productivity norms (Study 1), which will develop particularly in situations where an organic identity formation took place (Study 2). Furthermore, the path from interpersonal attraction to productivity appeared to be indirect: interpersonal attraction lead to the recognition of a shared social identity, which then fostered by shared cognition and productivity norms- lead to increased workgroup productivity (Study 3)."

Participants (N=160) were induced to experience either a happy/sad emotional state prior to watching a five-minute segment of a happy/sad television program. They were then shown an anti-smoking PSA and asked about their processing of the PSA, and their attitudes toward the PSA. Also assessed were participants BIS/BAS orientations. Regardless of prior emotional state, participants who watched the happy program segment reported greater heuristic processing and less cognitive processing of the PSA than those who watched the sad program segment. All participants reported a positive attitude toward the PSA. These results were somewhat consistent with the predictions made based on the cognitive-functional and negative state relief models. As predicted, BIS scores were found to positively correlate with cognitive processing, and negatively correlate with heuristic processing. The reverse situation was found for BAS scores. The discussion highlights the importance of appropriate PSA placement within the commercial breaks of television programs for them to be most effective."
2004-0757,Smoking-Frames: How German dailies framed the smoking issue before and after the Terry-Report,Paper,Smoking-Frames: How German dailies framed the smoking issue before and after the Terry-Report,"The paper examines coverage of smoking issues from an elaborate framing perspective. Our considerations start from the so called Terry-Report, which was the first to provide publicly relevant scientific evidence for the negative consequences of smoking published in 1964.
Since the Terry-Report had at least visibly effects on smoking habits, we regard it to be a key event having the power to alter patterns of media coverage, i.e. media frames. Analyzing the German national dailies Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) and Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) between 1952 and 1973 we examine whether and how amount and depiction of tobacco consumption before and after the Terry-Report differed. Discussing which elements of frames are relevant and supported by previous research we developed an elaborate codebook. It included elements like causes and effects, background, and evaluations, i.e. the theoretically relevant framing categories. Based on two factor analyses and on cluster analyses five media frames were identified. The findings are discussed in terms of the framing-approach as well as and in regard to health communication."
2004-0758,"Soccer in the Media, Public Mood, and how the German ruling coalition won the last national elections",Paper,"Soccer in the Media, Public Mood, and how the German ruling coalition won the last national elections","This paper clearly shows that soccer covered in the media regularly and significantly influences judgment statements about the most important political candidates and parties in the last ten years in Germany. To our knowledge, there has been no further study in Germany or elsewhere that investigated the success in sports and its relation to political popularity.

Results are based on a daily survey representative of the German population. The effect of soccer games and soccer coverage on voting intention and popularity of political candidates are analyzed for the time between 1993 and 2002 using time series analysis.

The effects supported in this paper mostly originated from matches of the German national soccer team, mostly in international tournaments. Victories in those games could often be useful for the party in power and the opposition, failure could sometimes harm. Soccer could influence the popularity of persons (i.e., the leading candidates) more than it influenced the intention to vote for a certain party.

The Public Mood Theory offers coherent explanations for the relationship between soccer and political judgement. The general Public Mood provides the logical link between the two items."
2004-0759,Social Cognitive Mediators and Relational Outcomes Associated with Parental Divorce,Paper,Social Cognitive Mediators and Relational Outcomes Associated with Parental Divorce,"People exposed to parental divorce experience a number of relational and attitudinal effects that appear to be learned from vicarious experience with divorce. One such effect, the intergenerational transmission of divorce, involves a greater risk for divorce among those adult children whose parents were divorced. Social cognitive theory provides a comprehensive and plausible account for how and why these effects might occur. In particular, social cognitive theory would explain many of the effects of parental divorce as inhibitory or disinhibitory effects learned through vicarious experience. Predictions from social cognitive theory were tested on a community based sample of 821 adults. Results replicated the intergenerational transmission of divorce as well as higher family conflict, more negative attitudes toward marriage, and greater likelihood of marriage to a previously divorced person, as a function of parental divorce. Parental divorce was also associated with a decreased likelihood of currently being in a close relationship. Many of these effects, including the intergenerational transmission of divorce, were mediated by either family of origin conflict or negative marital attitudes. In other words, it is not parental divorce per se that is responsible for certain relational and attitudinal effects. Rather, family of origin conflict as well as the negative attitudes toward marriage acquired by children of divorced parents appear to be largely responsible for these effects."

After providing a critical overview of the existent literature, the author proposes the use of social construction as a framework to analyze construction and management of multiple identities in discourses. Analysis of 13 in-depth interviews and 5 discussion groups with Russian female PR practitioners provided the basis for the argument that multiple identities are constructed and managed through discourses.

While the typical message used in these campaigns describes the quantity and frequency of alcohol use by the average student on campus, many students may find such a vague comparison other to be socially irrelevant. The current study compares the relative weight of perceptions about alcohol use by distant vs. proximate peers in the prediction of college students personal drinking behavior. The results of analyzing data collected from a sample of college students at a large public northeastern university (N=276) show that, as hypothesized, perceived alcohol use by proximate peers (best friends and friends) was a stronger predictor of students personal alcohol use than perceived alcohol use by more distant peers (such as students in general), controlling for other strong predictors of alcohol use by college students (age, gender, race, off-campus residency, and sensation seeking tendencies). The implications of these findings for the design of more effective social norms messages are discussed."
2004-0762,Social Identity Salience and Stereotype Threat in Standardized Test Performance,Paper,Social Identity Salience and Stereotype Threat in Standardized Test Performance,"Research on stereotype threat provides insight into the low standardized test performance of students from stigmatized social groups. These individuals often experience extreme anxiety in educational settings where they are reminded, intentionally or not, of their membership in groups targeted by negative stereotypes about intellectual ability. Because they belong to many social groups, one means to mitigate students stereotype threat may be to remind them of their membership in social groups for which there are positive stereotypic expectations about their performance. We tested this hypothesis by priming different social identities among undergraduate women prior to administering a standardized test of spatial reasoning that routinely produces large gender differences in performance (Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test). We found that women who were primed to contemplate their identity as students at a selective private college performed better than women from this population who were primed to contemplate their gender or a test-irrelevant identity. For men, priming their identity as males increased performance relative to the test-irrelevant or private college student primes. These results demonstrate the potential of reminding students of their achieved identities (e.g., private college student) in an effort to subdue the anxiety created by negative stereotypes about their ascribed identities (e.g., female)."
2004-0763,Social Identity Theory and Depression,Paper,Social Identity Theory and Depression,Harwood and Sparks (2003) have begun a discussion of how social identity theory and intergroup communication may be valuable in health communication research. They have applied these intergroup concepts to the area of cancer communication and behavior pinpointing three levels of identity. This paper will explain these three levels of identity and describe how they can be effectively applied to depressive disorders. Implications for health campaign planners will be discussed.

This study suggests people map their understanding of common social rules and dilemmas onto new technologies. Over time, these interactions create and reflect a new social landscape. Based upon a year long observational field study and in-depth interviews, I examine cellphone usage from 2 main perspectives: 1) how social norms of interaction in public spaces change and remain the same, 2) how cellphones become markers for social relations and reflect tacit pre-existing power relations. Informed by Goffmans concept of cross talk and Hoppers caller hegemony, I analyze the modifications, innovations and violations of cellphone usage on tacit codes of social interactions."
2004-0765,Social Selection Processes for Communication to Retrieve Information in Transactive Memory Systems,Paper,Social Selection Processes for Communication to Retrieve Information in Transactive Memory Systems,"Abstract
This paper identifies existent structural tendencies of networks by analyzing organizational work teams at multiple levels. It uses social network analysis to achieve this multilevel (actor, dyad, triad, and network), actor attribute inclusive examination of the structures of communication ties between members of intact work teams. The focus is to understand why coworkers choose to retrieve information from specific teammates and not others according to Transactive Memory (TM) Theory.
This research extends the literature on TM theory in multiple ways. First, it continues the effort to move out of experimental lab settings by testing the theory in preexisting organizational work teams. In addition, it tests teams of considerably larger sizes than those of the experimental teams investigated in the majority of current literature. Thus, this research explores the extent to which TM theory can be generalized to organizational settings. This research also tests the underlying assumptions of the retrieval of information process of TM theory. That is, the theory assumes specific processes should exist in work teams, resulting in specific structures or patterns of organizing. The retrieval of information patterns in the network are not just a function of the people in the network, but how those people are connected to each other through the retrieval relation.
The results indicate that members of work teams follow some expected patterns but not others. In particular, multiple team members retrieve information from a common teammate. However, self-reported expertise is not a good indicator of these emergent retrieval patterns."
2004-0766,"Social structure and citizenship: Examining the impacts of social setting, network heterogeneity, and informational variables on political participation",Paper,"Social structure and citizenship: Examining the impacts of social setting, network heterogeneity, and informational variables on political participation","In this study, we develop a model of the interplay between socio-structural determinants of an individual?s discussion behavior, such as the setting of primary discussion networks (work, church and volunteer groups) and the nature of discussion (i.e., the level of exposure to non-likeminded ideas), and individual-level outcomes, such as hard news media use, political knowledge, and participation in political processes. In doing so, we synthesize many of the different and sometimes competing models that political communication scholars have used to examine the link between more macroscopic sociological variables and the individual-level behaviors that political scientists often focus on.

Data to test our theoretical model come from a national telephone survey conducted in October and November 2002. Our analysis showed that the social setting in which citizens discuss politics is an important antecedent of political participation. Discussion networks as part of volunteer groups, for example, indeed serve as important networks of recruitment. In other words, discussing politics frequently in this setting is positively and directly linked to political activity. The impact of conversational networks in church and work settings on participation, however, is only indirect. In fact, our data show that the impact of church and work networks on political participation is to a significant degree mediated by the different viewpoints that individuals are exposed to when they discuss politics in these settings."

However, research on the influence of social ties on individuals performance appears mixed. The purpose of this study is to explore the utility of a social network approach applied to the quantification of communication process in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments. Data were collected from twenty-eight senior level engineering students involved in a two-semester design course, which were distributed between two universities and relied on Internet-based collaboration technology to communicate. We found that individuals who establish new social ties in a distributed, technology dependent community perform significantly better than those who remained with familiar others. Additionally, we found that new instrumental ties have more influence on individuals perceived class satisfaction. Further, our results suggest that more new instrumental and social ties seem to influence both actual class performance and perceived class satisfaction."

Cognitive approaches are presented, some specific examples regarding creation of scientific concepts (in physics and communication), and philosophical conclusions from the perspective of including imaging in the scientific production are explored. I also propose a new category of mental imagery called structuralist. The final conclusion points towards a strong connection between mental imagery and the justification of structural realism."

Female students (N = 333) completed measures describing aspects of their third party communication about their female professor and their evaluations of the course and professor. Six aspects of student third party communication were examined: general amount, amount about professor's personal life, positiveness of the communication, amount about professional aspects of the professor, amount about the professor's appearance, and amount the student jokes about the professor. Correlations indicate that all six aspects of third party communication are related to students' evaluations of the professor, but only three aspects are significantly related to students' evaluations of the course."

In contrast to expectations based on the ""convergence"" view, the ability to compensate for the absence of one technology by using an alternative one was limited. The limitations concern the technologies themselves less than their respective routine operation. The results: A large proportion of reporters missed parts of their stories and were late in discovering primary information. A small proportion lost entire stories. The greatest difficulties were encountered during live coverage of dramatic events, including terrorist attacks, during which reporters were demanded to keep on supplying information output while they received no input. Paradoxically, the pager belongs to sources but is worn on a journalists hip. Despite its limited features, and probably because of them, the pager is ranked as a vital journalistic tool."

To this end, a total of 618 undergraduates, studying in Taiwan (n = 298) and the United States (n = 320), participated in this study. Participants filled out the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension along with Self-Construal Scale, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, Fear of Negative Evaluation, and Self-Perceived Communication Competence scale. The results indicated that Chinese in Taiwan scored significantly higher in communication apprehension than Americans. The influence of culture on CA was mediated by independence self-construal, neuroticism, extroversion, fear of negative evaluation, and communication competence. The strongest mediating effect was found for self-perception of communication competence. The implications of these findings were further discussed."

Previous research has commonly focused on online interactions among strangers. This study, however, examines how existing offline group members communicate with one another in online interaction. Classroom environments are classified into two dimensions, classmate relationship and academic development. Based on self-evaluations about their integration or alienation in these two dimensions, students are categorized into four types: Well-adjusted, Socialite, Book-worm and Maladjusted. A questionnaire survey of 303 South Korean middle school students was carried out. According to the results, students who are integrated in the dimension of classmate relationship dimension participate more in online community activities, whereas Academic development dimension has no main effect. In addition, students of each type show different levels of participation in online class communities, in such activities as logging-in, message posting and message reading."

Results from a national survey indicate that high sensation-seekers visit both pro- and anti-drug websites more often than their low sensation-seeking peers. Voluntarily contributed, teen-authored testimonials about personal experiences with drug use are a common feature found on anti-drug sites. This study examined the hypothesized interaction effect between exposure to testimonials and sensation seeking in producing anti-marijuana beliefs, attitudes, norms, efficacy, and intentions. A sample of 147 undergraduate students read and evaluated 0, 2, 5, or 8 Internet testimonials collected from various anti-drug websites. The findings suggest that sensation-seeking is an influential moderating variable in the processing of anti-marijuana testimonials. Specifically, sensation-seeking and exposure boomerang in their effects on intention to try marijuana. There was also evidence supporting a priming effect of these testimonials on self-efficacy to say no to marijuana and attitude towards marijuana use."

The author argues that reviewers? reception of and discourse on The People vs. Larry Flynt used representations of freedom of speech to outline an ideological field of freedom in general that defined the reviewers? senses of political and social agency. The reviewers? use of speech to describe freedom, further, worked to elide material conditions that limit freedom.

Through a critical review of Chinese Internet policy, this paper argues that the Chinese government views the role of the Internet in two ways: an engine for national development and a tool for political control, which lead to strategies and regulations to promote commercial use of the Internet and restrict free production and distribution of information. Furthermore, although commercial forces sometimes challenge the state authority as neo-liberalism claims, more often than not, they cooperate with the government in exchange for their private interests at the expense of public interests. The result is commercialization without democratization of Chinese cyberspace. This paper fits the theme of 2004 ICA conference well because it highlights access to information and technology, one key value of public interest, in the analysis of Chinese Internet policy, which provides valuable implications on development, democracy, technology and regulation."

Before media gossip first appeared we gossiped about our neighbors, our boss, and all other people we encountered once or more in a lifetime. Today this gossip about people we me(e)t still exists, but next to that, today we also gossip about people we have never met in our life. How come? Why are people so addicted to stories about the private lives of others, especially people we dont know? What is this gossip about? In this paper we try to find an answer to this and we focus on one specific kind of gossip, the media gossip of tabloids. To see what is in these tabloids that can catch almost everyones attention, we conducted a content analysis of 852 stories from three Belgian gossip magazines. Each article was rated by three independent coders. Our results show that topics in these magazines can be classified in a list of universal occurring adaptive behavior strategies. Clear differences appear for male and female subjects, with females being more subject of articles about beauty and males being more subject of articles about their job and status. We also found differences for articles about celebrities and non-celebrities appearing in these magazines. About the first more articles are about status and daily issues, about the latter almost all articles report of rare occurring or life threatening events."

Using Bourdieus notion of symbolic capital, this qualitative study analyzes the communicative processes by which some individuals and groups knowledge came to be considered more valuable than others knowledge. In this case of an Internet-based organization, members routinely guided activities in ways that positioned their own knowledge as the most valuable. Through various micro-practices, members changed organizational priorities, engaged in knowledge turf wars, and altered or maintained the knowledge-compensation criteria within departments that all shaped the perceived value of their knowledge. The self-serving features of members activities became more apparent against the backdrop of executives espoused goals, labor market trends, and the main clients expressed interests that all conflicted with members more situated actions."

Through a poststructural feminist critique, we not only showed how these women positioned themselves and others vis-à-vis gendered discourses, but also how this positioning process shaped possibilities for practice in particular ways. Three thematic processes (i.e., reining in the feminine, (de)constructing identities and identity work, and resisting and complying with maternity leave policies and practices) offered indications of how, when, and why women simultaneously exerted and failed to exert agency.

Consequently, peoples comprehension of a film with subtitles may be less than a film where subtitles are not necessary. The types of inferences that people make are an indication of how well they comprehend a film. This experiment investigated the different pattern of inferences generated by participants watching a native language film versus a foreign language film with subtitles. In this framework, reading subtitles was assumed to have a detrimental effect to inference generation. To test this effect, this research used two versions of Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1956). The first version is in English and the other is dubbed in French with English subtitled. Inferences were gathered by asking participants to write down any thoughts coming to mind during watching a film. The inferences were categorized as either backward (focus on previous information), forward (focus on future information), and current (focus on information in the current scene. Participants generated more current inferences in the foreign language film with subtitles. However, participants generated more backward inferences in the native language condition. These results are consistent with the idea that participants had less comprehension of the foreign language film with subtitles."

Causal modeling was used to determine the effects of advertising that contains gay male, lesbian, and heterosexual imagery on attitudes toward the ad, brand, and purchase intentions and to test if positive relationships with gay males, lesbians, or bisexuals have a positive effect on advertising processing. Results indicated that female gender impacted homophobia, with homophobia influencing emotional reactions to advertising. Irritation and happiness, aroused by exposure to advertising, had the strongest effects on attitudes toward the ad and the brand. In general, attitudes toward advertising with less explicit homosexual imagery and promoting products that are stereotypically associated with homosexuals were most positive. Lesbian imagery was more accepted than gay imagery but less accepted than heterosexual imagery. Positive contacts with homosexuals decreased homophobia, with homophobia affecting emotional reactions and attitudes toward the ad, brand, and purchase intention."

Research on the supply of television contents in Mexico shows that although local supply is large (even larger than foreign supply), American imports account for significant percentages of total programming, especially in fiction. Regarding consumption of foreign messages, Mexican research shows a clear dominance of local productions in the preference of audience members in general, with the exception of upper class male youngsters who tend to like U.S. contents more than Mexican contents. The evidence suggests that in the context of globalization and liberalization experienced by Mexico in the last few years, proliferation of foreign television contents and their consumption by different segments of the audience co-exist with a strong volume of national productions with equal or greater popularity than imported messages."

It investigates the picture of parties and issues presented by the leading German quality papers, one tabloid and the leading news agency during the last three weeks before the election. Special attention is directed to the representation and the thematic contextualization of the parties, in particular to the medias construction of party-specific issue profiles. Results show high levels of attention for the large parties and considerable degrees of personalization. Whereas the SPD - and the Greens in particular - managed to benefit from the extensive media coverage on the highly newsworthy Iraq crisis and the flood, the CDU/CSU could not present themselves as competent and crisis-resistant problem solvers. Even though they displayed some media presence regarding the Iraq crisis, they were only moderately associated with the flood. Their attempts to put genuine party concerns on the media agenda, and establishing a distinguishable issue-profile proved to be hardly successful. Media coverage not concerned with Irak and flood concentrated on the campaign itself, on scandals and other politics-issues, rather than on policies. This expecially regarded FDP and PDS  already suffering from a low degree of media presence -who found themselves almost exclusively related to politics. The strong focus on the large parties and a severly reduced issue-repertoire can be attributed to the professional routines of news production. It left the audience with only minimal information about the policy preferences of the competing parties."

This work-in-progress paper looks at the work of interwar-era feminists who attempted to frame womens paid employment in positive ways in Ladies Home Journal. Focusing primarily on a series of articles written by Doris Fleischman in 1930, it looks at how dominant discourses concerning womens paid labor were subverted to make womens career success seem like a cultural norm. These strategies include role reversal, the strategic use of numbers, and a refutation of binaries.
The paper is part of a larger project exploring magazine representation of employed women during the interwar yearsa significant time because increasing numbers of women entered the workplace after World War I ended and suffrage was passed; however, their employment became far more controversial during the Great Depression. During the interwar era, the larger project argues, writers and editors working in mainstream publications framed employed women in ways that resonated with culturally familiar definitions of socially constructed femininity. This paper, then, looks at how those social constructions were reworked, primarily by Fleischman. Ultimately, however, it points to the difficulty of overcoming the dominant discourse, even among writers who apparently intended to support womens increased job roles.
The paper uses theories pertaining to social construction of reality and feminist theories of femininity, along with qualitative textual and visual analysis"

The theory of television audiences always involved larger concepts  concern with peoples engagement with mediated texts  that went beyond the phenomenon of television, particularly national mass broadcast television. That theory now needs rethinking in the age of the internet. We examine the parallels between researching audiences for television and for the internet, identifying the similarities and differences in the trajectories of the two bodies of research, and the theoretical context of each. We pose the question here of which methods are appropriate for audience researchers to use in the age of the internet? and the larger question: must audience research start all over again with the internet, or can ideas, methods, and findings be carried forward, so we dont reinvent the wheel?"

Based on assumptions from a motivated information processing perspective and self-integrity theory, it was postulated that that the effects of fear appeals on persuasion are mediated by a motivation to restore the integrity of the self, and not by perceptions of threat, or the emotion of fear, related to ones health. A 2 (vulnerability: hi, lo) x 2 (self-affirmation: hi, lo) x 2 (argument quality: weak, strong) factorial design was employed to test predictions. Results were in accordance with hypotheses. It was found that increases in vulnerability induced an overly positive perception of action recommendations, and increased persuasion regardless of the quality of the arguments in the recommendation. However, intention and actions to engage in the recommended action dissipated when participants had been given the opportunity to affirm the self."

In the last seven years a profound transformation had taken place. As a result of an unorthodox governmental strategy that mixed education and communication interventions plus rehabilitation of public spaces, the citizens have reported positive changes in their relationship with the city. The program called Cultura Ciudadana (citizenship culture) showed results in the way people relate to the notion of the public (public space, sources and institutions), but most tangible, after 2 years of Cultura Ciudadana the numbers of violent deaths dropped significantly, and the Bogotás mayor initiative gained the applause of the international community, particularly public health organizations.
According to the program, citizens need to interact in the public space (public sphere?) thought situations of intense communication, participate in symbolic and pedagogical encounters and be exposed to communication campaigns of conviviality in order to make sense of minimum agreements of coexistence.
This essay is not just a description of the uniqueness of Bogotas case. My attempt is to narrate a tale of the city that critically raises questions about the gains of this program (increasing of social capital, trust, healthy social environment, behavior change, etc.), but also to discuss the limits of this top-down strategy, its tensions between the discourse of the civic, modern, liberal city, and what it is left aside, the extreme exclusions, the unorganized civil society, the other languages and ways to participate and communicate that belong to different cultural and social experiences of the marginalized population.

As experimental paradigm was used that required participants to create unique messages, and the participants were timed for response latencies. Three individual-difference variables (speed of information processing, cognitive tempo and need for cognitive structure) were examined to see if they accounted for differences in response latencies. Results showed no significant relationship between response latency and speed of information processing or cognitive tempo, but need for cognitive structure was significantly related to latencies. These findings suggest new directions for studying the creative component of message production."
2004-0796,Targeting Norm-Related Beliefs about Marijuana Use in an Adolescent Population,Paper,Targeting Norm-Related Beliefs about Marijuana Use in an Adolescent Population,"The integrative model of behavior prediction and priming theory were used to evaluate the effects of anti-marijuana advertisements in an experimental context. In one original study and two replications, 436 adolescents were randomly assigned to condition and those in the experimental condition viewed three ads that challenged undesirable normative beliefs about marijuana use. The results showed that ad exposure had small but positive (anti-drug) effects on adolescents specific considerations of the outcomes of using marijuana and their specific perceptions of the social normative climate surrounding marijuana use. Priming effects were also observed but generally ran counter to predictions. Implications of the persuasion findings are discussed. Potential explanations for the unexpected priming effects are also offered."

2004-0798,Technology of Confrontation: Politicizing the Internet in the Chinese Context,Paper,Technology of Confrontation: Politicizing the Internet in the Chinese Context,"The Internet technology has taken on deep political implications in China. Based on the governments strategy to control Internet access and information via technological means, the Internet can be seen as a technology of control. Government regulation over the Internet has provoked the use of technological counter-measures on the part of users to fight government regulation and access the information they desire. From the users perspective, the Internet can be viewed as a technology of freedom. These two opposing approaches to the nature of the Internet technology in the Chinese context, if separated, however, fail to capture the confrontation between the governments use of the Internet technology to restrict user activities online and users online efforts to battle against the regulation. To integrate these two opposing political aspects of the Internet in China, I propose that the Internet should be more appropriately defined as a technology of confrontation in the Chinese context of politicization."

Not only does dating violence lead to negative physical and mental health outcomes, but it is also linked to other types of risky behavior, such as preventing teens from engaging in safe sex. While a growing amount of research has been conducted to examine the prevalence of and risk factors for dating violence among teens, very little research has incorporated media effects into the study of violence between teen dating partners. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of dating violence and teens, discuss theoretical perspectives related to dating violence and media effects, propose a conceptual model, and provide suggestions for future research."
2004-0800,"Televised Coverage of the War in Iraq on Al Jazeera, CNN and Fox News",Paper,"Televised Coverage of the War in Iraq on Al Jazeera, CNN and Fox News","A content analysis of Al Jazeera, CNN and Fox News was conducted during the days leading up to the fall of Baghdad. Similarities and differences in event coverage, source selection and message framing strategies were analyzed. The primary thesis in this report is that media employ three primary frames to attract and maintain the attention of audience members. The satellite news agencies studied employed what might be characterized as action, normative and dichotomizing frames. Action frames were employed to incite or reaffirm public perception and opinion of events or policies that can have broad social implications. Normative frames involved maintaining social control, preserving existing social norms, and spotlighting injustice. Dichotomizing frames were used to clearly delineate the differences among opposing sides. Implications of the use of these three frames are analyzed."
2004-0801,Televised debates and the public interest. Dysfunctional effects of televised debates on voters' knowledge of the state of the country,Paper,Televised debates and the public interest. Dysfunctional effects of televised debates on voters' knowledge of the state of the country,"Televised debates are supposed to provide voters with political information that helps them to decide on a rational basis whom to vote for. Many studies have shown that voters do in fact learn from what is said during debates, e.g. about the positions advocated or the importance of political issues. Therefore, many researchers regard televised debates a useful feature of political campaign communication. What is not investigated in these studies, however, is the extent to which televised debates actually enhance voters' knowledge. We argue in this paper that a differentiation between learning effects (e.g. being able to repeat candidates' descriptions of the state of the country) and knowledge effects (improving understanding of the state of the country) is necessary because what people learn in televised debates might not necessarily leave them with a better basis for a rational voting decision.

In order to investigate that, we surveyed a sample of 75 voters immediately before, during, immediately after and five days after the second televised debate before the 2002 German national election. During the debate, viewers' reactions were measured using a real-time response measurement system (RTR). In the surveys, participants were asked to assess Germany's economic situation as compared to (a) the situation before the last national election in 1998 and (b) to other European countries. Our analysis shows substantial learning effects among viewers. But that does not mean that they improved their knowledge. In fact, knowledge about unemployment was actually worse after the debate among a substantial number of viewers. They were obviously misled by the candidates' selective presentation of facts. This means that televised debates sometimes can even reduce the knowledge of voters."
2004-0802,Television and Theories of Selective Exposure:Review and Directions for Future Research,Paper,Television and Theories of Selective Exposure:Review and Directions for Future Research,"This paper summarizes selective exposure research as it relates to television use. It outlines theories of television use and considers the state of research in four fundamental approaches to selective exposure: Uses and Gratifications, Mood Management Theory, Trait Theory of Selective Exposure, and Cognitive and Priming Effect Approaches to Selective Exposure. The final section of the paper introduces the theory of Structuration as an alternative explanation of television use, and suggests the theory could be used as a means to fill an important gap in the selective exposure literature. After noting similarities between Structuration and a Uses and Dependency model of TV use, the paper provides evidence to support the idea that people draw upon social structures in making the decision to view television. A structural equation model shows that the importance of television in a persons life is influenced negatively by moral authority, but positively by seeking personal gratifications."
2004-0803,"Television, Remote Memory, and Social Reality Estimates: A Cognitive Neuroscience Approach",Paper,"Television, Remote Memory, and Social Reality Estimates: A Cognitive Neuroscience Approach","Cultivation analysis has shown that heavy television viewers make social reality judgments more aligned with TV reality than the actual world more than light viewers. Models by L. J. Shrum (1997) and M. A. Shapiro and A. Lang (1991) offer psychological processes underlying these effects. This paper extends these models by suggesting brain structures involved. Cultivation is argued to be a function of declarative memory. Eighty-seven students provided estimates of crime, occupation, affluence, and marital discord prevalence. Participants remote memory for television and level of viewing were assessed. Remote memory negatively predicts estimates of crime and is not related to amount of viewing. TV viewing significantly predicts social reality estimates after remote TV memory variance is removed. Results suggest that some individuals better remember TV information, and these people are less prone to making crime estimates biased toward TVs reality regardless of how much TV they watch."
2004-0804,"Television, Transition and Globalization: Uzbekistans Experience after a Decade of Independence",Paper,"Television, Transition and Globalization: Uzbekistans Experience after a Decade of Independence","Uzbekistani mass media today are passing through an uneasy stage of development. Media, including television, are facing economic difficulties and restrictions on freedom of expression. The television industry in the last decade has made progress, however: an advertising market has emerged, and journalists have learned to work in a competitive environment. Regional and local television stations have found their own audiences and their places in the broadcast market. The number of newspapers has tripled since 1990, despite circulation declines. All of these facts demonstrate progress in terms of diversity. These changes in the mass media system, however, have brought with them a problem related to the correlation of quantity and quality. Uzbekistan has enough media outlets to ensure diversity. Now it is time to convert quantity into quality. Unfortunately, this process is slow, and, in some places, even at a standstill. The problem cannot be solved effectively unless direct foreign investments flow to the media industry. Such investments, whether from Uzbekistani or foreign sources, also enable media to be financially independent from the government. Hence, restrictive Uzbekistani laws regarding media ownership should be revised. Once they are, free media that reflect local culture will be feasible, albeit with a global influence."
2004-0805,Television viewing and 12- to 15-year-olds perceptions of peer sexual behaviors,Paper,Television viewing and 12- to 15-year-olds perceptions of peer sexual behaviors,"Several studies reported positive linear relationships between adolescents television viewing and their assumptions about the prevalence of certain sexual activities. It was considered good practice in these studies to control for age. However, the unequal pace with which teenagers develop bodily maturity suggest that it may not be enough to control for this variable. Therefore, we explored whether the relationship between television viewing and sexual assumptions is moderated by level of development. Respondents from a sample of 12- and 15-year-olds (N = 2121) reported on their viewing behavior and estimated the prevalence of given sexual activities. In the younger sample, results demonstrated that a quadratic regression equation provides the best description, indicating that the effect of television only starts off after a certain amount of viewing. Further exploration showed that this relationship becomes stronger as pubertal development progresses. In the older sample, linear and unmoderated relationships were found."

A sample of 2127 12- and 15-year-olds rated the appropriateness of the sexual and the romantic approach. Results show small but significant associations for overall television viewing, after sexual experience, pubertal development, and gender were accounted for. These associations are moderated by sexual experience, denoting that the relationship between television viewing and the suitability of the sexual approach is stronger among more experienced adolescents, and by pubertal development, suggesting that the relationship between television viewing and the suitability of the romantic approach is stronger among adolescents who reported higher levels of development."
2004-0807,Tell Me Something I Didnt Know About Why You Did That: Attribution and Perceived Reality,Paper,Tell Me Something I Didnt Know About Why You Did That: Attribution and Perceived Reality,Considerable evidence indicates people make dispositional and situational attributions to explain the social actions people observe. Two experiments examine whether media stories influence perceptions of realism in a media story by providing dispositional or situational information about an action. The attribution literature suggests that people spontaneously generate dispositional information for negative stories and situational information for positive stories. The results here indicate that stories that supply the missing attributional information (situational for negative stories and dispositional for positive) are judged more real than stories that supply information congruent with the spontaneously generated information. Evidence is also presented for the psychological mechanisms for a person-reality effect.

Grunigs (2003) model of public cognition, across different types of organizations. For this purpose, the researcher conducted the secondary data analysis of the data used in Yang and J. Grunigs (2003) study with focusing on each of an organization from the profit and the nonprofit sector for testing multiple-group analyses. The results of the study suggest that most paths among factors in the model are statistically invariant across different types of organizations studied."
2004-0809,Testing the Homogeneity Assumption of Public Opinion,Paper,Testing the Homogeneity Assumption of Public Opinion,"The purpose of this paper is to test the plausibility of the homogeneity or parallel publics hypothesis (Page & Shapiro, 1992) using the agenda-setting model as a framework. One of the implicit assumptions of the agenda-setting model is that in the absence of a news story about a particular topic, such as stories about air quality, public concern about the topic is at equilibrium. In response to a media story or external events such as a public information campaign asking drivers to alter their driving behavior, concern about the topic of air quality may quickly diverge from the long-term equilibrium level of concern. This equilibrium state is similar to Downs' (1972) pre-problem state or Baumgartner and Jones' (1991; 1993) values consensus state. A focusing event or system shock punctuates the equilibrium state causing concern about air quality to rise. Eventually, after the media or the public becomes bored with the issue of air quality, concern will return to an equilibrium level of concern (Downs, 1972; Henry & Gordon, 2001; Neuman, 1990). This change in the level of concern about air quality in response to a system shock such as a news story or focusing event such as a public information campaign raises a fundamental question; do all members of the public respond similarly or in the parallel fashion predicted by Page and Shapiro to the system shock? That is, do men and women or do people who are college-educated or not college-educated respond in the same way at the same time to news stories or a public information campaign about air quality? The homogeneity or parallel publics hypothesis suggests that all groups respond similarly. The heterogeneity hypothesis suggests that groups may differ in their response to a system shock with the public either converging or diverging.

The results from the models tested in this paper provide strong evidence that the homogeneity or parallel publics hypothesis is untenable. The initial analysis, correlating the aggregate means and variances gave strong indication that there were different processes at work. The results of the vector autoregression analysis show significant differences in response patterns to the media coverage and public information campaign based on sex and education. The results provided support for what we will call the convergent heterogeneity hypothesis, though the sex series was more consistent with what we called the divergent heterogeneity hypothesis. In an attempt to explain the disparate findings between the people and group models, we simulated the effects of a public information campaign to demonstrate that different groups responded in systematically different ways to the system shock with the overall effect washing out."
2004-0810,Testing the Spiral of Silence in the Context of Computer-Mediated Communication,Paper,Testing the Spiral of Silence in the Context of Computer-Mediated Communication,"This study examined the applicability of the spiral of silence theory in a computer-mediated communication (CMC) context. It created a real discussion setting and introduced two new dependent variables: controversial topic selection and the order of raising a controversial topic, both of which serve as new ways of conceptulizing and operationalizing speaking out. Results did not indicate a strong spiral effect in either communication context. There was no significant difference in minority opinion expression or the order of bringing up a controversial issue in the conversation in face-to-face (FTF) vs. CMC. However, the communication context did affect controversial topic selection  people in the FTF condition were more likely to raise a controversial issue than people in CMC, which suggested a less salient spiral effect in FTF. Importantly, it appeared that two traditional predictors  fear of isolation and perceived support of ones own opinion  could not account for this increased willingness to talk about controversial issue in FTF."
2004-0811,Textual Agency: How Texts and Other Nonhumans Contribute to the Mode of Being of Organizations,Paper,Textual Agency: How Texts and Other Nonhumans Contribute to the Mode of Being of Organizations,"Most of the time, the reflection on discourse and textuality tends to reduce this phenomenon to what employees or managers do when producing and using texts in organizational contexts, but fails to recognize that texts, on their own, also seem to make a difference. In the present essay, I will show that one way to approach discourse also is to analyze the active contribution of texts (especially documents, but not only) to organizational processes, that is, to what extent texts like reports, contracts, memos, signs or work orders can be said to be performing something in a given situation. After reviewing what other scholars have (often indirectly) been saying on the question of textual agency, I will show how it is analytically possible to ascribe to texts the capacity of doing something without falling into some modern form of animism. Having done that, I will explore systematically the different types of action texts can be said to be performing by taking up (while adapting it) Searles (1979) well-known classification of speech acts. This review will then lead me to address questions related to the constitution of organizations, that is, to what extent this reflection on textual agency (and nonhuman agency in general) enables us to redefine the mode of being of organizational forms."

The film portrays 1970s American suburban life, where parents emphasize competition and winning a baseball game at all costs  over values such as education, fair play, respect, and racial and sexual equality. The research suggests that in the context of globalization and increasing spread of American cultural influence through the world circulation of media products, U.S. hegemony needs further consideration."

We sought to examine the change of television news quality over time and answer the question, In what ways has television news shifted from an informative approach to an entertainment approach? Conducting content and critical analyses of television news via 1991 and 2003 broadcasts of Good Morning America, we examined each for graphics and news content.
Results showed the news has changed significantly over the past decade to become both more entertainment and information oriented. The substantial increase in the use and amount of graphics from the first to the second decade gave the 2003 broadcast a more ""magazine-like"" quality. In addition to the information-packed graphics, an increased number of news stories were covered in 2003. The substantial increase in the overall amount of information from the first to the second decade, we suggest, has not resulted in a better informed public, but rather one that suffers from information overload. Thus, news industry leaders motives for the increased use of graphics and the news lite, sound byte approach to news broadcasting are questioned."
2004-0814,The 2003 Congressional Fight Over Media Ownership,Paper,The 2003 Congressional Fight Over Media Ownership,"This essay discusses the unprecedented explosion of media policy into the American public policy debate in the summer of 2003. When the Federal Communications Commission ruled on June 2, 2003, to undertake the most dramatic reduction in media ownership restrictions in history, it triggered a massive public backlash. An odd political alliance of left and right arose in Washington and in the country at large and moved quickly to challenge a policy structure that has for decades remained the province of industry lobbyists and corrupt lawmakers. This essay analyzes the relationship between the burgeoning public reform movement and the path of the policy debate on Capitol Hill. The essay proceeds through a detailed study of how the reform effort fought uphill against a resistant Republican administration using guerilla tactics, unconventional legislative vehicles, and media attention to consistently snatch victory from defeat. The paper argues that the nature of American media policy debates has been fundamentally changed. However, it also charts the power of anti-democratic structures in the governmental process which will force real policy reform into a longer term struggle, despite broad populist appeal for change.This essay discusses the unprecedented explosion of media policy into the American public policy debate in the summer of 2003.

2004-0815,The Accessibility versus Quality Debate Revisited: Personal Source Selection from a Situational Perspective,Paper,The Accessibility versus Quality Debate Revisited: Personal Source Selection from a Situational Perspective,"This paper focuses on source selection in organizations. Previous research on source selection identified accessibility and quality as two important criteria in source selection. However, the relative importance of these criteria is subject to debate. Inconsistent results have been found. This paper argues that these inconsistencies can be attributed to two main weaknesses in previous source selection research: A lack of attention for the specific situation in which source selection takes place and the use of widely differing operationalizations. Both weaknesses are addressed in the research design of the study. Think Aloud sessions with 45 participants were conducted. In order to clear some conceptual confusion, the spontaneously mentioned criteria in these sessions were examined instead of examining a priori developed criteria. The study also specifically looks at source selection in different situations. It is found that accessibility and quality consist of several aspects and that the use of criteria differs between situations."

Using a three-wave panel comprising citizens of Augsburg and Bamberg  two medium-sized cities in Bavaria  that was conducted to analyse the impact of the 2002 German debates, the present article deals with the following questions: First, how were the two contenders evaluated by viewers of the debates? Who ""won"" the debates? Secondly, do these perceptions and evaluations influence viewers attitudes towards Schröder and Stoiber? And if so, what is the magnitude of this effect? Thirdly, do these effects last  and for how long? How do the mass media as well as interpersonal communication influence the durability of debate effects? Our results show that Schröder won both debates. Based on a path model, we show that the debates considerably affected the images of both candidates. These effects are not very stable and thus quickly disappear. However, mass media as well as interpersonal communication have the potential to stabilize debate effects, depending on the extent and the (perceived) content of the follow-up communication."

Currently, many institutions are incorporating web-based communication as a means to recruit future donors. This paper examines the use of visual and textual images on a university fundraising website. A pretest-posttest experimental design was conducted to find out if the manipulation of website elements affected the retention of information about the institution and attitudes towards donating to the institution. A sample of 160 participants was assigned to three different experimental conditions. Results found the use of visual and textual elements did not affect retention of information, but did change the attitudes participants had about donating to the university."

The study tests ideas about how the alternative press relates to its audience, comparing this with previously published literature about how mainstream media relate to their audiences. Through interviews with staff members and an online survey of the magazines readership, the study concludes that the staffs connection with its readers is closer than is usual for mainstream media and that the readership is politically active; and that this alternative publications content serves its audience needs. This study is unique because it provides an up-close look at how the alternative press relates to its audience and what its audience thinks about this publication, and what its producers think about their audience."
2004-0819,The Applicability of Cognitive Flexibility Theory to the Production of Hypermedia News Stories,Paper,The Applicability of Cognitive Flexibility Theory to the Production of Hypermedia News Stories,"This paper contributes to the literature on hypermedia news by testing the application of Cognitive Flexibility Theory, a theory from the field of education, to the writing and presentation of complex news issues. The CFT hypermedia format provides readers with multiple cases of a knowledge area and allows crisscrossing these cases with multiple conceptual perspectives. The format is designed to improve ability to apply knowledge in varied real world settings and to reduce oversimplification in the learning of complex knowledge areas. An experiment was conducted to see if the CFT hypermedia format would increase ability to apply news knowledge by increasing perceived ability to publicly discuss a complex news issue. Also of interest was whether the CFT format would reduce extremity of opinion by exposing readers to multiple perspectives and multiple cases. A number of other dependent variables were also tested. Overall, effects from the CFT format were not strong. Subjects found the CFT formatted site to be the most enjoyable of the three sites tested, and there was marginal evidence that the cognitive flexibility theory improved reader self-efficacy in regard to engaging in public discussion. Ability to recall information, perception of credibility, extremity of opinion and degree of cognitive load were not related to format variation. Results do suggest further study is warranted."
2004-0820,The Bhopal Carbide Disaster: A Case Study in Crisis Communication,Paper,The Bhopal Carbide Disaster: A Case Study in Crisis Communication,"Multinational corporations (MNCs) face major challenges when dealing with crises simultaneously at both local and global levels. The magnitude of the environmental and human devastation resulting from the Bhopal disaster confronted Union Carbide with a challenge that severely tested the mettle of its crisis communication expertise. Although two decades have elapsed since the disaster, Bhopal is still evoked as an example of what not to do in the case of a crisis of global proportions. As one of the worlds worst industrial disasters, the Bhopal tragedy devastated an entire city (and country) both physically and emotionally. The disaster had far reaching ethical, social, environmental, legal, and financial consequences for Union Carbide, and offers a rich lesson in corporate social and communication irresponsibility.

Though several studies have examined Carbides handling of the disaster (for example Shrivastava, 1989, Sen & Egelhoff, 1991, Ice, 1991) none have systematically focused on the process of communication planning and execution (research, objectives, strategies, tactics, evaluation), or explored Carbides communication plan holistically from a global-local perspective. This case study focuses on Carbide's handling of crisis communication at global/local levels following Bhopal. It investigates how Carbide prioritized its publics and stakeholders and developed strategies and tactics to address their information needs. It concludes with a critique of Carbides crisis communication planning and execution in the post-Bhopal scenario."

This study of the birth of the profession of foreign correspondents in the United States seeks to illuminate how effective correspondence was in providing American readers with previously inaccessible information. Research focused on eight newspapers across the United States from 1838, when the first corps of foreign correspondents was established, to 1859. Findings suggest correspondents, who showed concern about truthfulness, accuracy, and balance, seemed to have perceived their role as political and cultural analysts, not merely descriptive writers. They sought to offer their readers not only eyewitness accounts but stories that put foreign realities within the context necessary to make them understandable beyond ethnocentric stereotypes."

At the beginning of year 2000, the Downing Street Cabinet was facing a mostly undecided or hostile public on the issue of the EU and a hostile public on the issue of the euro. There was work to be done if the intention of the Prime Minister was to promote Britains involvement in Europe and a possible switchover to the euro. Even if the case of a single government is explored, the study expands the normative contingency theory of accommodation in public relations by adding new variables relating to government-practiced public relations in an international context."
2004-0824,The Caring World of Television. The Impact of Television on Public Perceptions of Physicians. Two Cultivation Studies.,Paper,The Caring World of Television. The Impact of Television on Public Perceptions of Physicians. Two Cultivation Studies.,"The number of television programs relating to medical issues has remarkably increased during the last decade. At the same time the German health care system had to face growing financial strain rising public fears of insufficient support. These developments might lead to a critical perception of physicians. Patient surveys however still point to stable confidence in physi-cians. On this basis the paper examines how television contributes to the perception of physi-cians. Theoretical background is cultivation theory postulating television to influence public perceptions of reality. Study 1 focuses on the depiction of physicians hospital series and their impact. Content analysis of eight hospital series indicates a rather idealistic depiction. A panel survey of hospital patients (t1: beginning of hospital stay, n=157; t2: end of the hospital stay, n=83) shows heavy viewers of hospital series to have a more positive perception of real-life physicians than light viewers. Comparing patients evaluations at the second wave to their previous evaluations it was possible to measure the influence of real-life experience under controlled conditions. Results indicate real-life experiences to have a disenchanting impact on heavy viewers. Study 2 examined the depiction of physicians in non-fictional medical pro-grams on TV and their impact on viewers perceptions. Content analysis indicates a fairly inconsistent image of physicians in those programs  a rather positive depiction in reality-shows and health magazines, a more critical one in boulevard-, trend- and lifestyle-magazines and reportages. A survey among 294 citizens shows limited effects in the context of non-fictional formats. While heavy viewers of reality-shows perceive physicians more positively than do the light viewers, the impact of a more critical depiction in boulevard-magazines hardly influences viewers perceptions. Implications for health communication, cultivation theory, and future research are discussed."
2004-0825,The Changing Election Coverage of German Television. A Content Analysis 1990-2003.,Paper,The Changing Election Coverage of German Television. A Content Analysis 1990-2003.,"The paper reports considerable changes in content and style of German election coverage between 1990 and 2002. The findings are based on a content analysis of the main evening news of the four major television channels, spanning four Bundestag elections. During the observation period television has immensely expanded its coverage of the top candidates. While the presence of the candidates in the news increased, their issues did not come across. The news discourse narrowed down to election and campaigning as issues. Matters of campaigning style, the hoopla and horse race, as well as election polls became increasingly salient. The number of sound bites grew, although the average sound bite length itself decreased slightly. The presentation of the candidates became more vivid and more colourful, and, thus, more attractive for the audience. On the other hand, there are no signs of increasing negativism. The observable trends in the scope and kind of presentation of candidates can be interpreted as a personalisation of media coverage. The changes partially fit into the pattern of convergence (i.e., a mutual assimilation of public and commercial channels). These developments are partly rooted in the change of the German television market. Other results can be explained by historical incidents like the German reunification in 1990, the flood disaster in 2002, and by the candidate constellation during each election. In spite of some similarities with developments in the U.S. the authors argue that it would be misleading to label the observable changes of German election coverage as ""Americanisation""."
2004-0826,The Changing Interpersonal Communication Media Environment,Paper,The Changing Interpersonal Communication Media Environment,"In spite of the growing importance of e-mail and cell phone use, these interpersonal communication media, including the telephone, have not received much attention from communication researchers compared to other mass media such as television. Moreover, communication researchers have often studied these interpersonal media separately. The current study attempts to investigate the use of the cell phone, e-mail, and the telephone in the overall context of the interpersonal communication media environment. An exploratory survey with college students was conducted, and the results were that the motivations for using the three interpersonal communication media above were different. Also, it was found that the level of cell phone use was positively correlated with that of the telephone, but not with that of e-mail."
2004-0827,"The Chinese Diaspora, Ethnic Media Use, and Identity Formation",Paper,"The Chinese Diaspora, Ethnic Media Use, and Identity Formation","Based on in-depth interviews, this study explores how Chinese diaspora intellectuals and professionals use Chinese ethnic media in their daily lives, and what are, if any, the influences that these ethnic media have over the diaspora members perceptions and constructions of their cultural identities. The study reveals that ethnic media do provide these culturally displaced subjects with socializing topics and contexts and facilitate their imagination of a unified transnational ethnic community. Also, ethnic media can constitute a space within which individual agency and alternative ethnic identities may develop and emerge. However, there is no perfect match between watching ethnic media and the alternative ethnic spectatorship that will support activism. Rather, the formation of alternative consciousness and activism inhabits a shifting realm of differences and contradictions that have to be overcome through continuous efforts across boundaries."
2004-0828,The 'Choice for America' Campaign: A Combined Analysis of Framing Urgency,Paper,The 'Choice for America' Campaign: A Combined Analysis of Framing Urgency,"Abortion is a topic of contention, even after the monumental 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. Young women have grown increasingly indecisive toward the subject of abortion for a variety of social and political reasons. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the foremost leader in abortion rights, is in the midst of releasing a multi-faceted campaign meant to counter that indecision and mobilize the post-Roe generation. The campaign is a unique opportunity to apply the concept of frames and framing to an emerging campaign whose goal is mobilizing an audience unaware of the problem. The organization, therefore, frames the situation as urgent. While framing analysis has traditionally relied on one of two strands of thought, a combined framing analysis in this instance is the most effective."
2004-0829,The Civic Bonding of Family and School: Bridging the Domestic Sphere and the Public Sphere,Paper,The Civic Bonding of Family and School: Bridging the Domestic Sphere and the Public Sphere,"This paper highlights an under-examined but powerful linkage of two institutions in political socialization  the school and the family. By motivating student-initiated discussion at home, the school energizes the family as a domestic sphere in which students and parents express newly formed opinions and encourage each other to use news media. We explore whether this political communication in the home instills conversational dispositions that are eventually applicable outside the family, in the public sphere. According to our theoretical model, the school and the family should become bonded in a discursive dynamic that promotes political communication both inside and outside the family. Evidence for this process is derived from an evaluation of an interactive civics curriculum. We describe the curriculums influence on high school juniors and seniors and their parents. The research encompasses field experiments in Arizona, Colorado, and Florida during the election campaign of 2002."
2004-0830,The Cognitive Dynamics of Beliefs: The Effect of Message Discrepancy and Source Credibility,Paper,The Cognitive Dynamics of Beliefs: The Effect of Message Discrepancy and Source Credibility,"This study examined that the effect of message discrepancy and source credibility on dynamics of belief change. Results showed that at the beginning of judgment, only a linear effect of message discrepancy was found, as expected. However, for final belief change, a significant quadratic effect of message discrepancy and a significant interaction effect between message discrepancy and source credibility on belief change were found. Source credibility was shown to have a barely significant effect at the beginning of judgment and highly significant effect at the final judgment. The initial differences in belief change among different levels of discrepancy did not diminish throughout judgment. Implications and significance of findings were discussed."
2004-0831,The commercialization of human feelings in new German popular television shows  Emotions in the eye of public interest,Paper,The commercialization of human feelings in new German popular television shows  Emotions in the eye of public interest,"If as stated in the Conference description, the area of public interest includes what people need in terms of communication and particularly media input and how we operate as recipients, cognitively and psychologically as well as socially then communication research should include the hitherto largely neglected emotional dimensions and drives in its analysis. This paper therefore takes a closer look at the development of new television formats that attract large numbers of viewers and fans, and examines what is behind the involvement of an active audience.

This paper explores the basis for the emotional involvement of viewers and fans of the increasing number of reality-TV shows in Germany. The analysis focuses on the role of the media in the community-building emotions and the emotionalization of the masses within the German television audience. The aspect of the cultivation of shared emotions is investigated. The article further examines the extent to which the commercialization of human feelings leads to a democratization of fame in the eye of the media recipient and investigates how this can be seen as the key to the success of this kind of entertainment in Germany."
2004-0832,The Conception of Chinese Journalists: Ideological Convergence and Contestation,Paper,The Conception of Chinese Journalists: Ideological Convergence and Contestation,"The chief function of the modern Chinese press has been enlightenement and propaganda, not provision of information. This paper traces and compares the three prevailing models of Chinese journalism--Confucianism, Maoism, and Communist capitalismwith reference to press role, conception of journalists and audience, as well as source of media legitimacy. The Maoist model shares the Confucian emphases of elite (cadre) responsibility while fighting against elitism in the name of the masses. The post-Mao media in what Deng Xiaoping called socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics are, in effect, the media in Communist (and post-Communist) state capitalism with authoritarian characteristics. Despite their seemingly irreconcilable differences, all three models conceive of the press as an instrument of Chinas century-old quest for national wealth and strength. They see the press as a means, not as an end. Their implications (barriers) to Chinese democracy are discussed."
2004-0833,"The Concept of Television Programs' Reputation:Meaning, Sources and Implications",Paper,"The Concept of Television Programs' Reputation:Meaning, Sources and Implications","Not much attention has been paid to the social nature of taste for television. The current study attempts to shed some light on this question by focusing on television programs' reputation. It draws on the conceptual affinity of programs' reputation to the climate of opinion construct in public opinion theory, to explore its meaning, sources and implications. Based on a large-scale survey among television viewers in Israel, we find that reputation is distinct from appreciation, although heavily influenced by it. Viewers tend to project their appreciation of television programs onto the audience majority. In addition, they tend to attribute high reputation to popular programs with large and with loyal audiences. On the aggregate level, programs' reputation is related to programs' audience size and repeated viewing. We also find pervasive pluralistic ignorance with respect to programs' appreciation and the extent of this pluralistic ignorance increases with program popularity. We suggest that the concept of television programs' reputation can expand the boundaries of the current paradigm of research on television program appreciation to include socially derived and shared criteria of programs' evaluations."
2004-0834,The Confucian Model of Self-Cultivation: Lessons for the West,Paper,The Confucian Model of Self-Cultivation: Lessons for the West,"According to Berthrong (2000), Confucianism is a way of cultural formation as well as a way of life. The Confucians had profound insights into human nature, character, thought, and conduct. But, as Tawney and Chiang (2002) note, Confucianism has been criticized as being conservative and oriented toward the past. Because Confucianism developed in an agricultural and patriarchal society, certain aspects of the Confucian teachings would have to be adapted to a modern environment. It is important to point out, however, that several basic features of Confucianism are in fact modern in their nature. For instance, not only are the Confucian thoughts on self-cultivation and humanity timeless, but they also have much to offer to the global community as a whole, and to the West in particular. In this paper, I will first examine the Confucian model of self-cultivation, and then discuss its implications and lessons for the West."
2004-0835,The construction of Black female bodies in Amos n Andy: A case for hybridity,Paper,The construction of Black female bodies in Amos n Andy: A case for hybridity,"Despite the prevalence of investigations into the condition of African Americans in the media, few analyses have been done of the radio medium, and even less of the representations of Black females on the radio. This paper endeavors to fill both these voids in scholarship by exploring how radio programming (fictional) of the first half of the 20th century created and presented Black females to its audiences. Using as its text the controversial Amos n Andy radio show, the preeminent and definitive program that aired between 1929 and 1945, the treatise examines the ways in which Black women were constructed in the years between WWI and WWII. I argue that Black women were depicted as hybrids, and as possessing features of liminality, as bodies out of order. They were thus established as symbols of the age, and therefore potential outlets for the frustrations and anxieties that characterized the time. The arguments presented in this paper are informed by the works of Fredric Jameson who contextualizes cultural texts in history, and Mary Douglas who perceives discourses about the human body as metaphor for occurrences in the societal body."
2004-0836,The Construction of Non-White Subjectivities in Western Society: A Theoretical Framework,Paper,The Construction of Non-White Subjectivities in Western Society: A Theoretical Framework,"How can we make sense of racial minority group members multiple identities which often conflict with one another? How it is possible to make a sustainable argument that defines this contradictory nature of racial minority identities? This paper attempts to build a framework in which racial minority group members conflicting identities can be understood and investigated. The key argument of this paper is that while racial minorities hold a multiplicity of identities, the construction of such identities cannot be imagined without reference to the majority whites who occupy the privileged position in western society. Non-whites different and contending identities result from their different ways of relating themselves to the dominant white society and discourses. It is emphasized that while non-whites are interpellated by white racist representations and constantly given their identity, they are also active subjects who appropriate and negotiate the meanings of imposed identities. Thus, what is required in understanding of non-white cultural identities is to explore the dynamics between how non-whites are positioned by dominant western discourse of race and how they position themselves within the white racial hierarchy."
2004-0837,The Construction of Pan-South Asian Identity Among Immigrants to the United States,Paper,The Construction of Pan-South Asian Identity Among Immigrants to the United States,"This paper takes a cultural studies perspective in examining how a South Asian identity, vis-à-vis separate national identities, is emerging among immigrants from the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives) to the United States. Specifically, the colloqual desi, a Hindi word, which means from the land, is commonly used in the context of the phenomenon of parties where South Asian music is mixed with techno and hiphop. Using Stuart Halls notion of representation, a website that focuses on the party scene is examined. Given the antagonism between the nation-states of India and Pakistan, the finding that there is a collective South Asian identity developing is quite significant."
2004-0838,The Contingency Turn: Explicating the Concept of Interactivity from the Users' Perspective,Paper,The Contingency Turn: Explicating the Concept of Interactivity from the Users' Perspective,"This study attempts to explicate the concept of interactivity from the users' perspective by employing the contingengy view of interactivity (Rafaeli, 1988). Unlike the functional view in which higher interactivity is conceptualized based on the number of features included on a Web site (e.g., e-mail links, chat rooms, and multimedia functions), the contingency approach argues that the technologically based explications (i.e., the functional view) fail to capture the user-oriented qualities (Rafaeli, 1988). By adopting the contingency view of interactivity, we first provide dimensions of interactivity by examining users experience of interactive features. We,then,explore how the emerged interactivity dimensions in the contingency view may relate to user involvement and satisfaction.
We accomplished this by employing researcher introspection method that has been widely used for the purpose of concept generation and insight discovery (Scheffler, 1982)."

A study into the Quality of Organizational Communication,"The critical incident technique is one of the current methods used in commu-ni-cation audits. There is an abundance of how to information available about the method, and various case studies underline the methods usefulness to investigate the quality of organizational communication. However, little is known about the way the method works: what kinds of incidents do employees report, and how can these incidents best be used to diagnose communication problems in an organi-za-tion. These questions are addressed in this paper, based on data that were collected among teachers, management and staff of a high school in the Netherlands."
2004-0840,The Culture of Computing: Gender Online as Contained Empowerment,Paper,The Culture of Computing: Gender Online as Contained Empowerment,"The Internet potentially provides space for otherwise marginalized voices to be heard, generating both the opportunity and the literal space for those voices; yet is criticized for re-creating global and gender divides in these new spaces. Internet space exists in both the public and private spheres, its nature determined by the cultural rules of both spheres. Therefore, the power structures of the Internet and offline cultures dictating who and how many people have access Internet spaces restrict online spaces and hamper online democratic discourse. As such, potential online empowerment is contained empowerment: both limited to its local space and illimitable in its potential for discursively diffusing resistant ideals and goals.
Contained empowerment, a theory developed by Newsom is localized power restricted by social norms yet flourishing in a space customized for that power. Contained empowerment is the potential to generate new types and concepts of power transferable into hegemonic space. However, contained empowerment is limited temporally, only capable of indirectly impacting hegemonic structures. To investigate contained empowerment in internet spaces, we investigate online spaces created specifically for empowerment outside of hegemonic norms. These spaces were created, intentionally, for democratic dialogue and inquiry into challenging hegemonic norms."
2004-0841,The Development and Effects of Newspaper Reading Patterns: The Impact of Exposure Medium,Paper,The Development and Effects of Newspaper Reading Patterns: The Impact of Exposure Medium,"The present study examines the extent to which newspaper format (i.e., print versus online) affects how audiences develop reading patterns and whether those patterns influence the sorts of news people read. Data for the study were drawn from an experiment in which some subjects read a print version of a newspaper for five days and others read the online version for that period. As expected, print news readers reported developing habits characteristic of linear reading, while online readers reported a more non-linear style. There was also some evidence that these reading styles accounted for differences in the sorts of news topics that subjects selected for reading and were able to recall a few days later."

The questionnaire and performancetest were distributed to an at random stratified selection of the target group of the protocols. And by means of interviews (n=48) dealt with the design, implementation of the protocols.
The results of the performance study were less positive than the results of the questionnaire. Participants appeared to be less familiar with the protocols and the precautions, and they also appeared less willing and able to put the measures into practice than was suggested by the results of the questionnaire. Problems frequently occurred as a result of misunderstanding, excessive detail, and impediments to applying the regulations. The development of the two types of protocol is an institutionalized, more or less top-down process of (re)designing. In the process of bringing the protocols more into line with actual practice, greater priority was given to achieving a consensus among experts on issues of content than to users needs. Once the protocol has been introduced, its designers lose control of its functioning. Organizations often operate according to the principle of To read is to know is to do. The current protocol development policy and design process do not allow sufficient participation of users and line management in the development and implementation of the protocols. Currently, evaluation and testing are not included in the design process. As a result, protocols are implemented too early, which is not conducive to the active involvement of users and line management."

However, these studies focus on face-to-face conversations as the only means citizens discuss political issues with others. This study takes the idea one step further and, not only examines the effects of face-to-face interactions, but examines the effects of interactive and non-interactive Internet use on participatory behavior. We found that not only did non-interactive Internet use have a positive main effect on participatory behavior, but that this effect was moderated by both face-to-face interpersonal discussion and interactive Internet use such as chat. This study explores explanations for this phenomenon and implications for future research."

Using a 2 (public relations vs. news) by 3 (text only; text and pictures; text, pictures, and video) by 2 (participate vs. do not participate) between-subjects post-test only experimental design, the study showed that there were no significant differences between online stories coming from either public relations or news sources on perceptions of credibility or any of the other dependent variables. However, statistically significant differences did emerge for the effects of the other independent variables. The results suggest that audience perceptions of online stories differ not because of source differences, but because of the use of multimedia and audience engagement on the page. Both theoretical and practical implications for public relations scholars and practitioners are discussed."

The author suggests steps for policy makers to stimulate and reward older workers, whose roles in the ""new work"" are both vital and threatened. Proceeding from data suggesting that work status often drives home computer and Internet competencies and usage in the lives of Americans over 50, the author acknowledges that the advancing age of Baby Boomers will cause some generational differences in competency and usage to disappear, but cultural differences among elders will persist. Effective public policy for curing the Digital Divide must include attention to older Americans on the margins, many of whom are single women, racial minorities, and residents of central-city or rural areas, the author claims. Recommendations include:
1. Tailor retirement systems for individual differences.
2. Make employment sectors elder friendly.
3. Make the educational system non-discriminatory.
4. Eliminate ageist practices inside the academy.
5. Strengthen policies to deter age discrimination by employers.
6. Encourage inclusive images of older workers.
7. Stop retrofitting facilities to ""shoehorn"" in disabled (often older) workers.
8. Encourage intergenerational learning communities.
9. Pursue age studies and intergenerational research.
The author concludes that citizens must assume a collective responsibility for re-creating social environments that will accommodate unprecedented complexities of intergenerational living in today's world."

Destabilizing the boundary between the researched and the researcher, we research both ourselves and our friends viewing practices. Using diaries, participant observation and interviews, and drawing on dialogues, e-mail and telephone exchanges both among ourselves and with our friends about Korean TV dramas, we attempt to understand womens viewing pleasure and the ways in which Korean TV dramas might provide working women with resources to negotiate real life tensions between deep-rooted, Confucianist sociocultural values and new, modern working conditions in a rapidly Westernizing, globalizing Hong Kong. Implications for womens TV drama viewing practices and the (re)production and negotiation of womens identities are discussed."

Although considerable amount of media coverage of this issue has been released, there is no doubt that Chinese government has thrown great efforts to seal this HIV blood scandal up. In this study, I analyze 62 news stories from three major newspapers of China in order to display: (1) how the Chinese news media construct and represent the HIV blood scandal; and (2) how the media discourse about the HIV scandal interacts with social and political context of contemporary Chinese society. By using discourse analysis, I find that: (1) the coverage of the HIV scandal reflects various social problems during the process of modernization, such as the ineffectiveness of Chinese public health policies; (2) an ideological constrain imposed by the Chinese Communism Party decide that it is hard for the Chinese news media to play the role as efficient communication channels to convey health information."

Results showed that Remedial Action and No Preferential Treatment, frames dominating affirmative action discourse in mass media from the 1960s through the mid-1990s, were overshadowed in 2003 by Diversity, a frame asserting that a blend of racially and ethnically different people serves to strengthen organizations and society. Logistic regression analysis indicated that Dedman and Doigs (2003) Newsroom Diversity Index, the ratio of the proportion of minorities professionally employed by the newspaper to the proportion of minorities living in its market, was positively associated with choosing the diversity frame and negatively associated with choosing the no preferential treatment frame. Failure to respond to the American Society of Newspaper Editors 2003 Newsroom Employment Survey predicted use of the No Preferential Treatment frame. Implications for framing and affirmative action are discussed."
2004-0849,The Economics and Politics of Audio-Visual Copyright Enforcement,Paper,The Economics and Politics of Audio-Visual Copyright Enforcement,"The Economics and Politics of Audio-Visual Copyright Enforcement
Abstract

Using simple economic models supported with anecdotal evidence, this paper investigates reasons for what appear to be wide variations in the levels of enforcement against piracy and illegal copying in the AV entertainment industries. In particular, copyright holders such as the MPAA appear to be very aggressive, while firms at the retail level, especially cable operators, appear to tolerate or in some cases even encourage piracy and illegal copying. It is argued that these differences exist because of asymmetries of enforcement costs and control, interdependent demand in the movie release system, and inefficiencies due to profit-sharing payment contracts for electronically distributed media. In conclusion, I consider public welfare issues and several possible policy improvements, including facilitation of greater vertical integration, greater reliance on public authorities for enforcement, and a change in the law regarding the system of restitution payments private firms can collect from copyright infringers."
2004-0850,The Effectiveness of Anti-Smoking Public Service Announcements: Do Emotional Appeals Work?,Paper,The Effectiveness of Anti-Smoking Public Service Announcements: Do Emotional Appeals Work?,"The Effectiveness of Anti-Smoking Public Service Announcements: Do Emotional Appeals Work?

In order to reduce the negative health outcomes of cigarette smoking, the mass media is often used as a tool for delivering anti-smoking messages. One recent campaign, the Florida truth campaign, uses a variety of scenarios to address the death toll caused by cigarette smoking. Both fear and humor-based messages have been constructed for the campaign.

Although these messages have resulted in attitudinal and behavioral changes, an explanatory mechanism for these effects has not been made clear. This research was primarily designed to examine emotional appeals as a potential explanatory mechanism for the effectiveness of the messages. Additionally, we investigated perceived susceptibility, severity and efficacy, which are more cognitive in nature, to observe how these variables might be related to the effectiveness of the campaign. Finally, previous investigations regarding the truth campaign have been conducted with adolescent samples; however, the message effects on college-aged individuals have gone unexamined. In this study, we assessed college students responses to the truth campaign.

The PSAs investigated in this research did affect emotions, emotions tended to co-occur and fear and anger had strong but opposite effects on the dependent variables of interest. Fear was associated with persuasiveness, negative attitudes toward smoking and acceptance of the non-smoking message. Increases in anger were associated with less persuasiveness, more positive attitudes toward smoking and less acceptance of the non-smoking message. Self-efficacy was also associated with changes in the dependent variables in the desired direction."
2004-0851,The Effectiveness of Retrospective and Anticipatory Self-referencing Ads,Paper,The Effectiveness of Retrospective and Anticipatory Self-referencing Ads,"This study explores the effectiveness of retrospective and anticipatory self-referencing ads. The findings of this study show that individual differences in terms of femininity and masculinity can moderate the effectiveness of retrospective and anticipatory self-referencing ads and lead to either self-congruency or self-enhancement effects. Specifically, the findings suggest that feminine participants prefer ads that invite retrospective self-referencing to ads that encourage anticipatory self-referencing. The reverse pattern, on the other hand, has been found for masculine participants. In addition, this study shows that when participants are exposed to retrospective self-referencing ads, both feminine and masculine participants express a preference for ads that depict congruent self-images over those that depict incongruent self-images, exhibiting what is referred to in the literature as a self-congruency effect. In clear contrast, when exposed to anticipatory self-referencing ads, both feminine and masculine participants react more positively to ads that depict masculine traits -- traits that are believed to be associated with positive values -- than to those that portray feminine values, suggesting what is referred to as a self-enhancement effect."

To explain heterogeneity, models using study characteristics were fitted to the effect sizes. Results of the analyses showed that effect sizes tended to get larger as sample size increases. A related prediction, framed using attachment theory, that the variances in self-esteem across COA and non-COA groups would be equivalent was also supported. Results are discussed within the context of the literature reviewed. The review concludes by highlighting the need for increased focus on explaining and understanding resilience and adjustment, rather than dysfunction, in children of alcoholics."
2004-0853,The Effect of Viewer Motivation on the Development of Parasocial Relationships with Reality Television Contestants,Paper,The Effect of Viewer Motivation on the Development of Parasocial Relationships with Reality Television Contestants,"This study identifies the uses and gratifications of reality television among young adult viewers. Two hundred and fifteen college students were surveyed to determine the correlation between their fundamental motives and their level of parasocial interaction with reality television contestants. The results suggested that viewers with different fundamental motives use the genre differently in their formation of parasocial relationships, as viewer motivation was found to effect the development of parasocial relationships with reality television contestants. Study results contributed to a greater depiction of the internal motivations of the active viewer and an accurate representation of the uses and gratifications processes. Young adults who reported being more status-oriented, desiring vengeance and social contact, formed stronger parasocial interaction levels with reality television contestants."

2004-0855,The Effects of Information Sources on Consumer Attitudes toward Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising: A Consumer Socialization Approach,Paper,The Effects of Information Sources on Consumer Attitudes toward Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising: A Consumer Socialization Approach,"Pharmaceutical manufacturers are spending more than $2.5 billion annually in Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) advertising in an attempt to educate consumers about prescription drugs. Unlike most other consumer goods, prescription drugs cannot be purchased directly by the consumer, and thus the goal of most DTC advertising is to influence consumers to talk to their healthcare providers about medications that they have seen in ads. Is this advertising effective? Who is most influenced by it, and how does reliance on mass versus interpersonal communication for health information affect attitudes and behaviors regarding DTC advertising?
Using data from a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population conducting by a professional polling organization (with a sample size of 3,000), this study uses structural equation modeling to answer the above questions and to explicate linkages among antecedents (age, gender, race, education, income, family structure), socializing agents (mass and interpersonal channels), and attitudes and behaviors regarding DTC advertising."
2004-0856,The Effects of Internalized Oppression on Marginalized Student Perception of Instructor Credibility,Paper,The Effects of Internalized Oppression on Marginalized Student Perception of Instructor Credibility,"Source credibility theory states that people are more likely to be persuaded when the source presents itself as credible. In the process of exploring this theoretical perspective, this study attempted to determine to what extent source characteristics such as gender and ethnicity play in the perceptions that university students have in the student/professor relationship.
At a bi-national U.S. university with a predominantly Latino student body, students perceived European American professors as more competent and caring, and hence more credible overall, than Latino professors. Female professors were perceived as more trustworthy and caring, as well as more credible overall, than male professors. While results failed to yield a significant MANOVA effect between instructor gender and instructor ethnicity, female Latino professors were perceived as somewhat less competent than their male and female European American and Latino male counterparts. In addition, on overall credibility, European American female professors were rated higher than their European American male, and male and female Latino counterparts. In order of relative significance, competence, immediacy and attractiveness significantly contributed to student learning."

Using off-the-shelf technology, we conducted a simple experiment that required subjects to engage in a person-identification task while posing as security agents in field setting. Subjects attempted to identify a target person in a public setting under different conditions with or without the aid of video information distributed to them via wireless-enabled multimedia PDAs. We develop expectations based on previous research in the areas of social presence, information richness, and the role of video in grounding. Our findings suggest new directions for research on this new generation of video-enabled devices."

Reading news stories and looking at Web banner ads are the most two common activities involved with online news reading. Since two activities tend to occur concurrently, the dual task paradigm used to examine the interference effects.
In this study, we changed the amount of mental resources allocated to the reading of news stories by altering either difficulty of news content or effort of participants, and observed whether our manipulations can influence the performance of processing banner ads. First, we expected that the more difficult news stories, the more banner ads will be remembered. The results showed that Web banners ads paired with difficult news stories were recognized and recalled better than those paired with easy news stories. Second, we expected that the more effort is devoted to the reading of news stories, the less cognitive resources are available to the processing of banner ads. This hypothesis was not supported. Third, we anticipated that there is the differential influence of animation on either two levels of difficulty or the two levels of effort. We predicted that if any, the impact of animation is bigger at the low level of difficulty and the low level of effort. These hypotheses were not supported. Instead, we found that for easy stories animation matters when people read news without paying much attention while for difficult stories animation matters when people read news with a high attention."

2004-0861,The Effects of Teacher Clarity on Affective and Cognitive Learning: A Causal Model of Clear Teaching Behaviors,Paper,The Effects of Teacher Clarity on Affective and Cognitive Learning: A Causal Model of Clear Teaching Behaviors,"The purpose of this study was to test two models explaining the effects of teacher clarity behaviors on students affective and cognitive learning. Based on previous research, elements of teacher clarity behaviors could operate in both affective and cognitive domains (see Chesebro, 2003), or could be segmented where some elements operate in the cognitive domain and others in the affective domain. A scale, called the Clarity Behaviors Inventory, was created to assess teachers use of low-inference clarity behaviors in a wide variety of actual classroom settings. Using the CBI, two models, the multiple domain model and the split domain model, were tested using structural equation modeling procedures. Analyses of structural equation models indicated support for the split domain model. The results are discussed in terms of theoretical and applied implications."
2004-0862,The Effects of Typicality and Familiarity on Readers Memory for War-on-Iraq Coverage in a Korean Newspaper: An Experimental Test for Schema-Copy-Plus-Tag Model of A Schema Theory,Paper,The Effects of Typicality and Familiarity on Readers Memory for War-on-Iraq Coverage in a Korean Newspaper: An Experimental Test for Schema-Copy-Plus-Tag Model of A Schema Theory,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of schemas in newspaper readers memory for Iraq-related news coverage. We assume that the readers memory for international news is constructed from prior experiences of similar stimuli mediated from the news media. Thus, a reader has acquired generic knowledge structure from prior media exposures and the structure will influence what he or she remember from the current international news. Based on the schema-copy-plus-tag (SC + T) model of a schema theory, we predicted that people would better remember atypical news stories than typical ones; however, after a delay, they will experience faster memory decay in the atypical news messages, resulting in higher memory errors. We tested the memorablility of atypical and typical news messages in a news story in an experiment design."
2004-0863,The Essential Secret of Indirect Communication and the Field of Communication Studies: Is a Kierkegaardian Revolution Needed?,Paper,The Essential Secret of Indirect Communication and the Field of Communication Studies: Is a Kierkegaardian Revolution Needed?,"Abstract:
Throughout his pseudonymous authorship, Kierkegaard employs a method of indirect communication. The existentialist Kierkegaard is an author who was acutely aware of the importance of various types of communication. His contribution and relevance has gone relatively unnoticed in our discipline. This paper looks at the impact the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication has on the individual, community and various organizations. Considering the ethical impact of Kierkegaardian indirect communication this paper asks if a Kierkegaardian revolution is not needed within the discipline of communication."
2004-0864,The ethnographic study of language usage and communication patterns in English language institute,Paper,The ethnographic study of language usage and communication patterns in English language institute,"The main purpose of this ethnographic study was to explore language usage and communication patterns of both teachers and students in English language institute. In addition, the differences between class taught by the native English teachers and class taught by a non-native English teacher were examined. All data were obtained from in-depth interviews and observations, and qualitatively analyzed by using domain, taxonomic and componential analyses. Results indicated that communicative rules in school and teachers ethnicity were the major factors that influenced students communication both inside and outside the classroom. Also, the styles of a teacher who is a non-native English speaker tended to be the most preferred style by the students."
2004-0865,The final frontier? Testing a temperament-based paradigm of media uses and gratifications,Paper,The final frontier? Testing a temperament-based paradigm of media uses and gratifications,"The study of media effects has generated an enormous and inconsistent body of research during the last 50 years. Conventional analyses of audience exposurefocusing on social locators as well as audience use motivations--are providing diminished returns. Clancy and Shulman encourage scholars to broaden their scope of inquiry, incorporating measures of somatic hot markers which reflect deeper personality factors that motivate human behavior.
Although relatively unknown to mass communication scholars, communibiology applies the principles of neurobiology to communication processes. Scholars have found, or instance, that temperament accounts for a wide degree of varianceexceeding 50 percent--in such areas as communication apprehension (e.g., Beatty, McCrosky, & Hiesel, 1998).
Similarly, the study of individual biological processes may prove fruitful in the attempt to understand how people interact with various media (e.g., Finn, 1998; Sherry, 2001; Zillman & Bryant, 1988). The present study employs a biologically trait oriented communication model, communibiology, offered by Beatty and McCroskey (1998).
We tested the influence of the ""big 3"" personality traits on TV uses and gratifications vis a survey of viewers. Through regression analysis, the personality dimension of neuroticism continually offered the most explanatory power in determining television viewing motivations."
2004-0866,The First and Second Level Agenda Setting Effects on Online Users:,Paper,The First and Second Level Agenda Setting Effects on Online Users:,"This study examined the first and second level agenda setting effects of media coverage on online users dealing with the topic of Axis of Evil. Right after President Bushs State of the Union speech in 2002, three countries called the Axis of Evil  Iraq, Iran, and North Korea  had been the focus of media coverage and online users.
The media coverage and online postings about each country were regarded as the objects of the first level agenda setting, and the characteristics about each country and the attitudes toward each country were regarded respectively as cognitive and affective attributes of the second level agenda setting. A content analysis was conducted on media coverage and Google Usenet postings to compare media and online users agendas.
This study found that agenda setting effects on online users were not significant and even showed negative effects. In addition, there was a difference in effects between the first and the second level agenda setting process. These results could have been influenced by possible intervening variables, such as media exposure, political interest and Internet (non-media) sources."
2004-0867,The Frames of Jornal do Senado: A Public Relations Developmental Strategy,Paper,The Frames of Jornal do Senado: A Public Relations Developmental Strategy,"This paper studies the news frames used in the public relations strategy by the Federal Senate of Brazil known as Jornal do Senado. Its goal is to provide insight into the strategies employed by this Senate newspaper which was created to increase awareness of the political process and participation in democratic activities in Brazilian society. This study also examines the extent to which Jornal do Senado reproduces news reporting orientations usually found in the commercial media. The main implication is that the inclusion of sensationalizing and dramatic coverage and the exclusion of utilitarian and mobilizing information can have a neutralizing effect on this development communication strategy. Composite weeks consisting of 36 main stories from Jornal do Senado were analyzed using media framing theory. The sample represented a full year of coverage from 10/2001 through 10/2002. Four major frames emerged as a result of this examination: The active committee frame; the ethical story frame; the pro-democracy frame; and the nationalism frame. There were notable differences in the players, the issues, the procedures emphasized, the conflict stories and the core concepts explored. Findings also show that while this newspaper avoids commercial orientations to a great extent, it also falls short of providing sufficient procedural information the like of which could result in increased political participation by Brazilian citizens. Framing analysis shows evidence, however, that Jornal do Senado does accomplish at least one of its two main goals  to increase awareness of the political process."
2004-0868,The Gendered and Sexualized Relationship between Israeli Women Journalists and Male Sources,Paper,The Gendered and Sexualized Relationship between Israeli Women Journalists and Male Sources,"The goal of this paper is to study the ways the interaction between Israeli press women journalists and their male sources are gendered and sexually structured. The study is based on 32 semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in 1998-1999 with women journalists working for ten newspapers: two of the three biggest daily national newspapers in Israel and eight local newspapers.
On the one hand, women journalists point out that the stereotypical attitudes of the male sources are expressed in a disrespectful manner involving sexual harassment, mainly verbal. On the other hand, the central perception of the women journalists of the relations is the power they themselves feel and express: they consider the sources stereotypical attitude a source of strength for them, enabling them to achieve professional goals. Furthermore, they use these attitudes and this power in a conscious and deliberate way. They have a whole arsenal of tactics when working with sources, based on these stereotypical concepts about them. The choice of tactic depends on the nature of the interaction with the source and the personal characteristics of the women journalists. Contrary to expectations, the question of the legitimacy of such tactics from a professional and from a feminist point of view is not central for women journalists and their discourse on this manner focuses more on the power of women."
2004-0869,The Gender-Ethnicity Construct in Public Relations Organizations: Using Feminist Standpoint Theory to Discover Latina Practioners' Realities,Paper,The Gender-Ethnicity Construct in Public Relations Organizations: Using Feminist Standpoint Theory to Discover Latina Practioners' Realities,"This study invokes the concept of organizations gendered and racial foundation from the organizational communication discipline (Ashcraft & Allen, 2003) in order to examine the dynamic of female ethnic minorities who practice public relations. Focus group meetings conducted among Latina practitioners in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, revealed gender- and race-related barriers to public relations excellence. Results suggest that three major forces are at work: 1) inability to attain power, 2) challenge to maintain a unique identity, and 3) struggle to balance self-contained opposites. Implications of these findings for the public relations organization are discussed and a developing theory of gendered-and-raced public relations organizations is introduced."
2004-0870,The General Affective Aggression Model: Explaining the Effects of Point of View and Blood in Violent Video Games.,Paper,The General Affective Aggression Model: Explaining the Effects of Point of View and Blood in Violent Video Games.,"In this study we examined the effect of self-reported violent video game play on aggressive cognitions, hostility and behavior. In addition, we utilized an experimental design to test the effect of violent vs. nonviolent game play on these dependent variables and we examined the impact of two game manipulations: point of view and presence of blood in the game. Overall, we found that frequent players as compared to less frequent violent game players reported more aggressive cognitions and higher resentment scores. In response to the experimental manipulations, those in the violent condition were more explosive than those in the nonviolent condition. In addition, those in the first person condition had somewhat more aggressive cognitions as compared to those in the 3rd person condition. Lastly, the point of view manipulation interacted with the blood manipulation such that those who played the game in first person with the blood visible were somewhat less irritated but significantly more verbally and physically aggressive. In sum, there was some evidence that the generalized model of aggression was supported and that furthermore, first person, graphically violent games can exacerbate effect."
2004-0871,The Genesis of Civic Awareness: Agenda-Setting in Political Socialization,Paper,The Genesis of Civic Awareness: Agenda-Setting in Political Socialization,"Agenda-setting theory, the core conceptual framework used to trace how issue salience is established among policymakers, media, and the public, has yet to be looked at within a political socialization framework. This study attempts to extend agenda-setting theory by conceptualizing it as a core activity within the larger process of political socialization. In this analysis of the 2002 election campaign, data are reported from a quasi-experimental field study of student-parent dyads in Arizona, Colorado, and Florida that assesses the impact of a school-based intervention, news media, and interpersonal communication on this newly proposed dimension of political socialization. A model of agenda-setting among adolescents is built by investigating the impact of demographics, school intervention exposure, news media attention, interpersonal communication among family and peers, and information integration on perceptions of issue salience, issue opinion strength, and finally partisan opinion strength. Findings suggest that agenda-setting is a key part of the broader process of political socialization. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed."
2004-0872,The glocalization of the Korean media,Paper,The glocalization of the Korean media,"Typical understanding of the globalization is as follows. Global spread of neo-liberal deregulation, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and transnational corporations (TNCs) playing the key role, in conjunction with the information technology development, has virtually eliminated the traditional constraints that nation states place on the flow of capital and commodities, opening a new era of global economic integration (Albrow, 1990; Hirst and Thompson, 1996). In the area of media and culture, globalization thesis often equals the situation in which the U.S. media products dominate the global market, represented by CocaColonization or McDonaldization.
However, what have recently developed in East and Southeast Asian media markets provide an opportunity to revisit the common assumption of media globalization. Realizing the economic, as well as cultural and political, importance of the media several Asian countries have successfully developed their local media industries into export capacity, making inroads into the regional market. A newly-coined phrase Korean wave, which refers to the Korean media culture enjoying popularity across East and Southeast Asia, is indicative of this recent regional media development. This paper, by examining the recent big leap of the Korean media industries, argues that the U.S. dominance thesis of the globalization is not entirely justified. Although popular entertainment forms such as film and television are Western invention, Koreans have provided their own twists to the media by blending indigenous characteristics and adding their unique flourishes in often innovative ways."
2004-0873,The gospel of anti-Americanism in Korea: mass media exposure and negative audience perception,Paper,The gospel of anti-Americanism in Korea: mass media exposure and negative audience perception,"Recently, there has been a surge in anti-Americanism in Korea. Based on the exemplification and social cognitive theories, this study examines the extent to which exposure to Korean mass media coverage of two concrete exemplars of negative American images  the Olympic speedskating controversy and the U.S. Boeing F-15K issue  affected Koreans negative perceptions of America. Results revealed that Korean mass media exposure covering of negative American images serves as the basis for evaluating American-coded issues: negative evaluation of the American soccer teams performance in the 2002 Korea and Japan World Cup and positive evaluation of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001."
2004-0874,"""The Guilt Thing"": Balancing Individual Needs and Domestic Social Roles",Paper,"""The Guilt Thing"": Balancing Individual Needs and Domestic Social Roles","Despite major changes over the past thirty years, one dimension of womens lives that remains complex and problematic is that of balancing domestic and professional roles. This paper will look at examples from womens everyday conversations to explore the themes that emerge in relation to socialized gender roles. The analysis of the data suggests that the social identity of the good mother is a common theme within the discourse practices of the women who took part in this study. Facets of this social role are often raised within the womens interactions and the data examined here suggests that, for working mothers, balancing the increasingly demanding roles of both their domestic and professional lives creates a dialectical tension that results in feelings of guilt."
2004-0875,The illusion of nonmediation and third person perceptions,Paper,The illusion of nonmediation and third person perceptions,"This study examines the impact of television form and several presence dimensions on third-person perception. Previous research has demonstrated that presence, an illusion of nonmediation, can impact third-person perceptions, with mental immersion and perceived realism reversing the third-person effect (Botta & Bracken, 2003). An experiment was conducted to provide causal evidence for the two previously studied presence dimensions, and to investigate if other dimensions would have a similar effect to those found by Botta and Bracken. The results provide causal evidence for mental immersion and perceived realism, and provide evidence that transportation, and spatial presence dimensions also decrease third person perceptions.. Additionally, the results show that television form in and of itself does not impact third-person perceptions. The implications are discussed."
2004-0876,The Impact of Arousal on Television Viewers' Stereotype Use,Paper,The Impact of Arousal on Television Viewers' Stereotype Use,"This research examines the influence of physiological arousal on the television viewers use of stereotypes in making judgments about characters and people featured on television. In an effort to clarify inconsistencies in past research, an experiment was conducted to assess the influence of arousal on television viewers' stereotype use. We tested the influence of different levels of physiological arousal on participants evaluations white women and black men after exposure to stereotypical images of these groups. Results of the study indicate that the inconsistent findings in the affect literature surrounding affect and stereotype use may be due to the effect of physiological arousal rather than the valence of the induced affect. The findings support the hypothesis that both increased levels of physiological arousal and decreased levels of physiological arousal lead to perceptions of greater homogeneity within social groups, and perceived homogeneity is an important element of stereotypic thinking."
2004-0877,The Impact of CMC Feedback systems on Organizational Boundary Spanners' Roles Stress and Work Outcome variables,Paper,The Impact of CMC Feedback systems on Organizational Boundary Spanners' Roles Stress and Work Outcome variables,"The goal of this paper is to examine the impact of CMC feedback system on organizational boundary spanners role stress, communication satisfaction, job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The study was conducted in a well-renowned university in Taiwan, using the presidential BBS as CMC feedback systems and treating administrative staffs as organizational boundary spanners. The results indicated OBS have relatively lower sense of security, higher levels of role conflict, lower wishes for advancement, lower levels of organizational commitment, lower levels of job satisfaction, yet higher levels of satisfaction with organizational integration, and higher levels of responsibility with the work. However, regression analyses showed an overall negative association between role stress and work outcome variables. Concept such as internet stress, electronic boundary, and new characteristics of OBS are discussed in the end of the paper."
2004-0878,The impact of Foxification of the War in Iraq II on American Attitudes and Perceptions of the War: A Media Bias Perspective,Paper,The impact of Foxification of the War in Iraq II on American Attitudes and Perceptions of the War: A Media Bias Perspective,"Abstract
The Converse-McGuire Model, Cognitive Similarity Model, and Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion and attitude change were examined to propose a media bias perspective to study the effects of news media coverage on public attitudes and perceptions of the recent war in Iraq. The media bias model was tested within a nationwide telephone data (n=428) controlling for demographics, party identification, political ideology, and interest in both domestic and international news. Also explored were the characteristics of Fox News coverage and its impact on public attitudes and perceptions, compared to CNNs. The results show that attention to Fox News coverage resulted in stronger attitudes toward the war in Iraq, approval of the Presidents handling of the war and the U.S. military effort, whereas attention to CNN coverage went the opposite direction. Personal importance of international events and source credibility each had an independent effect on the attitudinal measures. The study suggests that biased messages are more influential than unbiased ones in attitude change when the first are consistent with peoples existing attitudes, leading to cognitive similarity between the source and recipients. It also argues that people may not be always aware of a biasing factor in the messages they receive, particularly when they are not motivated and unable to make a cognitive effort in evaluating the content of the incoming message, therefore reducing the impact of unbiased messages on persuasion."
2004-0879,The Impact of Mood on Persuasion: A Meta-Analysis,Paper,The Impact of Mood on Persuasion: A Meta-Analysis,"A meta analysis of 14 studies reporting the effect of argument strength on attitude under various mood states was conducted. The analysis yielded 44 estimates of effect size that were used to test the hypotheses generated by the motivational/ability deficit perspective, the hedonic contingency model, and the mood as a resource hypothesis. Although not fully consistent with any one perspective, the results were most consistent with the hedonic contingency model. That is, subjects processing of messages seemed to be aimed at facilitating a positive mood. One major deviation from each perspective was that across most conditions, argument strength and attitude were strongly, positively correlated regardless of mood state."

The central study research question is: Are the gratifications from Internet usage related to the extent of online community participation? The study data was collected from 1345 subjects in three countries, US, Netherlands, and S. Korea. Preliminary analysis of the study data indicate broad support for the key study hypotheses and implies the importance of the uses and gratifications approach to understand online community participation behavior."

Specifically, this study examined if past relationship solidarity is related to current relationship commitment, satisfaction, and investment among individuals in dating relationships. Participants were 204 undergraduates at an Eastern university who were currently in a dating relationship. Results indicated that past relationship solidarity is significantly and negatively related to current relationship commitment and satisfaction, but not significantly related to current investment. Several mediating variables were also examined, including the nature and attribution of individuals breakups, the length of past and current relationships, and participant sex. Results revealed that the nature and style of past breakups were particularly salient mediating variables such that past solidarity was predictive of future relationship commitment and satisfaction only when breakups were mutual and somewhat ambiguous. Furthermore, these relationships were significant only for women and not men."

This article focuses on how a quality methodology called six sigma can positively affect three such characteristicsconducting evaluation research, engaging employees in participation in decision-making, and facilitating cross-functional teams using structured problem-solving methods. In this article we provide the reader a detailed analysis of what six sigma is, then apply this knowledge in a six sigma project dealing with communication practices at the GE Global Research Center in upstate New York."

The study has a basic 3 (synchronous, asynchronous quick, asynchronous slow) x 2 (high, low civility) between-subjects factorial design. At least 140 participants will be randomly assigned to each of the six treatment conditions. Two different discussion topics are used in the study, and each has been extracted from actual on-line forums and manipulated accordingly. The two asynchronous conditions will use an on-line discussion forum very similar to the original source and have the time stamps altered. The synchronous condition will use an on-line chat room and have a broken up version of the original discussion (a program has been designed such that it looks as though people are chatting in real time). Civility is manipulated by interjecting impolite phrases and name calling into the discussions at suitable intervals to create high and low civility conditions. Manipulation checks have been conducted, and the differences between the high and low civility conditions as well as the quick and slow asynchronous conditions were significant (a check of the synchronous vs. asynchronous manipulation was deemed unnecessary). For the actual experiment, participants use a web browser to view the stimulus materials, and make their evaluations via a pencil-and-paper questionnaire after reading each of the two discussions (presentation order is counterbalanced)."
2004-0885,The Impact of the Railroad on American Society: A Communication Perspective of Technology,Paper,The Impact of the Railroad on American Society: A Communication Perspective of Technology,"This article examines the railroad system as a combination of humans and machines that together form a symbiosis and explains how the railroad has exerted a huge effect on human life when it made irrelevant the organic  following nature  time system that existed in cities and countries where clocks were set according to weather conditions. To describe the complex relationships that form the communication network in the rail industry, this article also incorporates research on the social, cross-cultural, psychological, and economic and financial impact of the railroad on American society in the past two hundred years. Finally, this article demonstrates that the measure of progress in the United States is tantamount to the mass of things that had to be sacrificed to it. An actual progress always appears in the shape of a Nietzschean will to power and a desire to improve society."

2004-0887,The Implications of Bouncing In and Out of Television,Paper,The Implications of Bouncing In and Out of Television,"This abstract summarizes an in-progress examination of how visual attention to television is organized, not with respect to what prompts looks to begin or end, nor even what types of looks (of different lengths) viewers employ. Instead, we are investigating something implied but uninvestigated in discussions of viewing strategies and styles: the sequences of looks themselves. We have proceeded far enough to see that existing conceptions of television viewing have completely missed a phenomenon that accounts for a large proportion of all looks at television, and may significantly alter our conceptions of how people watch television.
When subjects in our study watched television in the presence of alternative activities, many of their looks were very short, matching previous findings by many authors. However, these short looks were typically surrounded by similarly short looks at alternate activities, which was unexpected and suggests a different conception of attention allocation strategies."
2004-0888,The Importance of Allowing for Diversity of Opinion in the Examination of Third-Person Perceptions,Paper,The Importance of Allowing for Diversity of Opinion in the Examination of Third-Person Perceptions,"This study explored individuals perceptions of the issue of affirmative action in higher education to examine the importance of assessing perceptions of media influence on self and others via the use of measurements that allow for bi-directional influence (pro and con). Results show that measurements that assume a uni-directional influence or those that assess only magnitudes of influence may result in different conclusions concerning third person perceptions. In this study, individuals tended to perceive that they were more strongly influenced by media portrayals than others in the direction of their existing attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of a possible reinforcement schema that viewers may employ when estimating media influence for content that contains a diversity of viewpoints."
2004-0889,The Influence of Affection and Ideology on Media Priming,Paper,The Influence of Affection and Ideology on Media Priming,"Media priming process was comprehensively examined in terms of the two heuristic devices, accessibility bias and affection, and ideology. 261 Korean university students were surveyed to see their media use, accessible information of recent economic news, affect toward the current president, the perceived ideological similarity with him, and their evaluation of the presidential economic performance. As a result, the respondents with favorable affect were found to utilize negative economic news stored in their memory bin less than those with negative affect. Also, those who perceived ideological similarity with the president showed the same pattern of evaluation. The concept of applicability as another factor for the activation of prior knowledge in judgmental process is discussed. Also, the importance of affect as another heuristic device is considered."

With data from telephone interviews at three points in time, we find increasing support for the social capital model, over time, with the diffusion of campaign information: norms and trust ³ social connections ³ social consequences. Although there are important links from the TV and newspaper news and campaign measures to the three social capital groupings, only one measure¡Xsocial trust¡Xactually appears to increase over the course of the two-year campaign. Practical and research implications of the findings are discussed."

Results indicated that a significant correlation exists between reported intimate communication about health and communication satisfaction (r = .40), and between confirming communication and satisfaction (r = .45). Results also indicated that engagement in communication strongly predicts reported satisfaction among parents (R2 = .63, F(1,218) = 377.67, p < .001)."
2004-0892,The Influence of Context Normativeness and Homophobic Beliefs on Perceived Appropriateness of Self-Disclosure in Male Heterosexual Friendships,Paper,The Influence of Context Normativeness and Homophobic Beliefs on Perceived Appropriateness of Self-Disclosure in Male Heterosexual Friendships,"Context normativeness and individual differences in homophobic beliefs may explain variation in perceived appropriateness of self-disclosure among male friends. Heterosexual men completed a homophobia scale, read scenarios depicting a man self-disclosing to his male friend in more and less normative contexts, and rated the appropriateness of self-disclosure in each context. Homophobic beliefs were negatively related to perceptions of appropriateness of self-disclosure. In addition, male self-disclosure was judged as more appropriate in more, compared to less, normative contexts. Counter to predictions, the negative relation between homophobic beliefs and perceived appropriateness of self-disclosure was not attenuated in more as compared to less normative contexts."

An obscure disease in 2002 that apparently traced its origins to rural China suddenly became the focus of massive news coverage throughout the world in 2003.
This paper reports a content analysis of SARS coverage in two nations directly affected by SARS, but to varying degrees: Hong Kong and Singapore. In particular, this paper examines the role of context-related factors in influencing media frames about the SARS epidemic. The results show that the framing of SARS as a threat to public health was far more prevalent in Singapore news than Hong Kong. Conversely, SARS in Hong Kong was more likely than in Singapore to be framed in news coverage as a threat to the economy. Implications of these and other findings are discussed in terms of journalistic practices and cultural factors."
2004-0894,The influence of exemplars in fear appeals on the perception of self-efficacy and message acceptance,Paper,The influence of exemplars in fear appeals on the perception of self-efficacy and message acceptance,"Fear appeals are frequently used in health communication to persuade people to adopt a new type of behavior (e.g., practicing safe sex) because their current behavior (e.g., having unsafe sex) is likely to result in harmful consequences. A fear appeal's persuasiveness depends on the extent to which the consequences are perceived as undesirable and realistic and on the extent to which the proposed alternative behavior is considered effective and feasible. In an experiment, the perceived threat and self-efficacy were manipulated by means of an exemplar in which a person either succeeded in performing the propagated behavior (and, consequently, did not suffer the harmful consequences) or in which the person did not succeed in performing the propagated behavior (and, consequently, did suffer the harmful consequences). A total of 149 participants read one of the versions and indicated their intention to perform the propagated behavior, their perception of its feasibility, and their inclination to minimize the message. The results showed that the version in which the person succeeded in performing the behavior yielded a more positive self-efficacy perception and stronger acceptance of the message claim. The version in which the person failed to perform the behavior yielded a more negative self-efficacy perception and more negative intention to perform the behavior propagated. Further statistical analysis showed that the effects on intention were mediated by the message minimization."
2004-0895,"The Influence of Frame, Appeal, and Arousal of Antismoking Ads on Attitude, Perceived Effectiveness, and Third Person Perceptions",Paper,"The Influence of Frame, Appeal, and Arousal of Antismoking Ads on Attitude, Perceived Effectiveness, and Third Person Perceptions","Antismoking ads have been found to be inconsistent in counter-marketing the influence of cigarette advertising. Although there have been many studies that examined how different message appeals can influence peoples attitudes and behavior, there have been few studies that have explored these message attributes simultaneously in order to identify the possible interactions and to refine the conditions under which one type of ad may work better than others.

The present study examined how message attributes of antismoking TV ads (i.e., frame, appeal, and arousal) interact to influence peoples attitudes, perceptions of message credibility and effectiveness, as well as third person perceptions. The key findings include interaction effects between message frame and message appeal, and between message frame and message arousal level on attitude, perception of message credibility and effectiveness. The results of this study added to the understanding of how attributes of messages interplay in persuading people, and can help in message selection or design in antismoking campaigns."
2004-0896,"The Influence of Love Attitudes of Friends with Benefits Relationships: Rules for Maintenance, Motivation, and Outcomes",Paper,"The Influence of Love Attitudes of Friends with Benefits Relationships: Rules for Maintenance, Motivation, and Outcomes","This study was designed to explore the relationship between attitudes about love and friends with benefits relationships. Friends with benefits relationships are defined as cross-sex friends who also engage in sexual activity, but do not define their relationship as romantic. Respondents completed self-report surveys in which they described their relationships, the rules for maintenance, and the current status of their relationships. They also completed the short form of the love attitude scale (Hendrick, Hendrick & Dicke, 1998). Results indicated that there were no significant relationships among love attitude and rules for maintaining FWB relationships. Implications for our understanding of these relationships are discussed."
2004-0897,The Influence of Persuasive Messages on Attitude and Subjective Norm: A Test of the Theory of Reasoned Action,Paper,The Influence of Persuasive Messages on Attitude and Subjective Norm: A Test of the Theory of Reasoned Action,"The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) predicts that a persons attitude and subjective norm both impact behavioral intent which subsequently predicts behavior (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1970, 1974, 1980; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). One limitation to extant TRA research, however, is that it has not examined the impact of persuasive messages on the TRAs predictions. Given that attitudes and subjective norms are subject to change, and given that people are exposed frequently to messages designed to change their attitudes and subjective norms, the current study examined the predicted relationships outlined by the TRA within two systems of change: 1) when attitudes and 2) subjective norms were influenced by a persuasive message. These predictions were tested by examining 276 undergraduate students eating behaviors (i.e., fruit and vegetable consumption and the number of meals skipped per day). Participants were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: 1) a no-message control group, 2) an attitude message group, and 3) a subjective norm message group. The results related to fruit and vegetable consumption indicated that when respondents attitude or subjective norm was influenced by a persuasive message the TRAs predictions were not consistent with the data. The test of the TRA when no change was present, however, provided evidence that its predictions were consistent with the control group data. These results were not replicated, however, with the second topic (skipping meals). Specifically, the TRAs predictions were not consistent with the data from any group. Interestingly, the only model to predict accurately the number of meals participants skipped every day was a simple causal string such that attitudes impacted intentions which predicted behavior. The implications of these results, limitations of the current investigation, and directions for future research are discussed in detail"
2004-0898,"The Influence of Positive, Negative, and Neutral Messages on Voluntary Hearing-Protection Behaviors Among Miners",Paper,"The Influence of Positive, Negative, and Neutral Messages on Voluntary Hearing-Protection Behaviors Among Miners","This longitudinal field study was designed to increase hearing protection behaviors among Appalachian coal miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Participants were mailed postcards that featured either a positive, negative, or neutral message on the outside of the postcard and a persuasive message encouraging hearing protection behaviors on the inside. The first posttest measurement of the effectiveness of the manipulation was conducted about a week after the postcards were mailed. The delayed posttest measurement was conducted six weeks later. Responses from 307 coal miners revealed that the positive or neutral messages generated significantly more hearing protection behaviors than the negative message. Identical behavioral results were obtained in a delayed posttest assessment of the miners hearing protection behaviors. The positive message was also more effective than the other inductions in preventing defensive mechanisms from emerging over time. These results extend our knowledge about the role of both positive and negative messages on behaviors in a field setting."
2004-0899,The Influence of Social Norms on Attitudes: Considering a Modified Value-Expectancy Approach,Paper,The Influence of Social Norms on Attitudes: Considering a Modified Value-Expectancy Approach,"Numerous studies are present in the extant literature that build on the theory of reasoned action (TRA; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) assessing the models framework that attitude and subjective norm proximally predict behavioral intention. At the same time, a number of studies demonstrate that attitude consistently outweighs subjective norm in predicting behavioral intention (e.g., Farley, Lehmann, and Ryan, 1981; Fishbein, von Haeften, & Appleyard, 2001). Researchers have recognized that attitudes cannot be conceptualized outside of subjective norm (e.g., Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) yet there are few studies that investigate the significant relationships between the variables and their implications (e.g., Miniard & Cohen, 1979; Oliver & Bearden, 1985). A meta-analysis of 26 studies found that the attitude-behavioral intention correlation outweighed the subjective norm-behavioral intention correlation five-fold (Farley et al., 1981). Others have found that a consistently strong relationship remained between subjective norm and attitude across experimental conditions, suggesting that subjective norm may reliably influence attitude (Oliver & Bearden, 1985). The current research investigates the notion that attitude is a product of subjective norm, which then may proximally predict behavioral intention. In order to do this, I examine private behavior to robustly assess whether or not subjective norm permeates ones attitude toward a behavior even when others are not present. Results of these findings may have implications for health campaigns that aim to change behavior."
2004-0900,The Influence of Social Status on Communication Predispositions:,Paper,The Influence of Social Status on Communication Predispositions:,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of social status of the communicator on communication predispositions of people with different cultural orientations. Based upon independent and interdependent self-construals as individual-level cultural dimensions, people's degrees of two distinct communication orientations (communication apprehension as an avoidance orientation and argumentativeness as an approach orientation) were assessed in a dyad with different status of communicators (professor as high status and classmate as low status). Participants were a total of 702 undergraduates studying in Japan, Hawaii, and the mainland U.S. After reading two hypothetical conversational situations with different status communicators (professor and classmate), participants were asked to rate items measuring two communication constructs (communication apprehension and argumentativeness). The data indicated that individuals showed greater level of argumentativeness in the conversation with a low status communicator (classmate or roommate) than in the conversation with a high status communicator (professor). On the other hand, individuals showed greater level of communication apprehension in the conversation with high status communicator (professor) than in the conversation with low status communicator (classmate or roommate). We also found that, among people of high interdependence, the level of CA was greater in the conversation with the high status communicator than in the conversation with the low status communicator. On the other hand, among people of high interdependence, the level of argumentativeness did not differ in the conversation with the high status communicator as compared with the conversation with the low status communicator."

Using the key concepts of the theory of the public sphere, this paper examines discussion sections of three different web sites to see if they can be called as promising electronic public spheres, where constructive public discourses could occur. The selected discussion sections are: Online Community at www.oprah.com, The Opinion at www.theopinion.com, and Waking Life Forums at www.wakinglifemovie.com. In the analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of a virtual space in forming a public discourse are discussed.

2004-0902,The internet as source of health information and support: Less than meets the eye?,Paper,The internet as source of health information and support: Less than meets the eye?,"Intervention. Breast cancer patients received in-home Internet-enabled computers with either an Interactive Cancer Communication System (providing information, decision-making, and emotional support) or access to the Internet along with links to high-quality breast cancer sites. Both experimental groups received training. The control group received either a book or an audiotape on cancer.
Main outcome measures. Pre and post-test surveys (2, 4 and 9-month); five dimensions of quality of life and five dimensions of information/healthcare competence.
Results. Interactive Cancer Communication System (ICCS) subjects logged-on more than Internet subjects who spent most time on non-health sites. Two months: ICCS outperformed Internet subjects on bonding, functional well-being, social support, health-information-accessing ability and competence. ICCS subjects outperformed Controls on functional well-being and bonding. Controls outperformed Internets on concerns and health information competence. Four months: ICCS outperformed Internets and Controls only on bonding. Controls outperformed Internet on health self-efficacy. Nine months (4 months after removing computers): ICCS outperformed Controls on functional well being, emotional well being, social support, health care competence, and ability to access health information. ICCS outperformed Internets on functional and emotional well being. There were no significant differences between Control and Internet subjects.
Conclusions. Breast cancer patients do not benefit (and may even be hurt) by providing computers with Internet access and URLs to high quality breast cancer sites. The chaotic Internet environment with many interfaces and overwhelming, conflicting information creates confusion and anxiety. A system with one simple interface and integrated information, communication and skills services can help patients even after computers are removed."

Overall, the war became an instantaneous discussion that led people to find their voice during wartime."
2004-0904,The Internet movie and its impacts on the windowing strategy of the movie industry,Paper,The Internet movie and its impacts on the windowing strategy of the movie industry,"Based on windowing theory, this paper examines the impact of the Internet movie on the windowing strategy of the motion picture industry. Whether Internet movie can be another significant distribution channel will eventually rely on whether Internet distribution will provide an additional and independent revenue stream without cutting into the pre-existing ones, or it will instead slice into and perhaps absorb one of the other models. The factors that influence the development of Internet movie as a new distribution conduit can be considered in multiple facets; Industry, consumer, technology, and legal/policy aspects. Industry side represents the cost and benefits of Internet movie, and the competition among video entertainment providers. Consumer adoption rate will depend on whether the new service is attractive enough in terms of convenience, quality and costs in spite of the demands of passive entertainment service. The most important limitation would be more or less slow penetration of broadband at home in the U.S. In technological aspect, Internet congestion and low quality of service would be one of the biggest challenges Internet movie faced. Also, Internet movie providers should be able to overcome many legal and political obstacles such as copyrights and patents debates."
2004-0905,The Internet's Political Impact and the Penetration/Participation Paradox in Malaysia and Singapore,Paper,The Internet's Political Impact and the Penetration/Participation Paradox in Malaysia and Singapore,"The use to which a communication technology is put may depend on factors other than its level of diffusion. Accordingly, a country with lower penetration levels for a medium may, paradoxically, exhibit more and better utilization of that medium than a country with higher penetration. This penetration/participation paradox is seen in the case of Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore is significantly ahead in terms of network availability, but it is Malaysia that has the more developed political activism online. The paradox cannot be explained by the two countries regulatory regimes, which are more similar than different. Instead, the differences can be accounted for by traditional social networks that help to organize online dissent, and the motivation to use available technology in creatively political ways  both of which are greater in Malaysia than in Singapore. This case study highlights the importance of social and political context in the shaping the impact of new communication technologies."
2004-0906,The Internets Role in Fostering Political Participation in Singapore,Paper,The Internets Role in Fostering Political Participation in Singapore,"Technological determinists and cyber-utopians have argued that the Internet will bring about greater democracy as it inherently possesses dialogical and libertarian characteristics, thus allowing greater political participation amongst the citizenry. However, this argument fails to take into consideration the larger socio-political and cultural contexts that vary from one country to another. Singapore proves to be a good case study to illustrate the weaknesses of using technological infrastructure and access to determine the extent of political participation. With one of the highest Internet penetration rates in the world and one of the most successful e-government initiatives, Singapore citizens are still unable to realize the democratization potentials of the Internet. Rather than concentrate on the societal impact of the Internet on democratization, this paper looks at the role of the Internet from the users point of view, to determine if the Internet has had any role in encouraging political participation in a country state well known for its repressive political culture."

The present study examined the influence of incidental exemplars in Web advertising, as moderated by an individual difference variable, i.e. participants need for cognition. More specifically, a 3 (Exemplar) X 2 (Need for Cognition) mixed-factorial experiment was designed to determine perceptions of risk associated with drug use for various ethnic groups. Results indicate that individuals who score low versus high on need for cognition estimate risk associated with drug use differently for different ethnic groups, contingent upon the groups exemplification (balanced for ethnicity or not). Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

2004-0910,The Link Between Labels and Experience in Romantic Relationships among Young Adults,Paper,The Link Between Labels and Experience in Romantic Relationships among Young Adults,"By examining the labels that people use to name their romantic relationships, a new perspective and understanding of relationships as processes may be gained. This study sought to identify and analyze those labels used by young adults to describe their romantic relationships. Study participants were asked to identify and explain the labels that they used to describe their romantic relationship during the first six months of its development. The results indicate that individuals tend to use more ambiguous terms very early in the relationship (1st and 2nd months) and then use terms such as boyfriend and girlfriend to designate the relationship. In addition, the majority of participants reported that the most difficult time to name their relationship occurred during the first month of their romantic involvement. Participants were also asked about whether or not they discussed the topic of relationship labels with their friends or their partners. The majority of participants reported discussing what to call their relationship with their partner, but not with their friends. These findings contradict previous research, which describes conversations about the relationship within the romantic dyad as taboo. Finally, this study found that different trajectories of relational development were related to the use of different relational terms, but relational trajectories were not related to relational satisfaction."
2004-0911,The Low end of Hi-tech:New Media and Communication Technologies and Terrorism in Asia,Paper,The Low end of Hi-tech:New Media and Communication Technologies and Terrorism in Asia,"The use of the Internet by terrorists and activists all over the world is an increasingly popular topic for research and analysis. The growing use of the simple everyday tools of communication such as mobile phones and short messaging service (SMS), by extremist groups is less adequately examined. In order to understand fully the impact of new media and communication technologies on terrorism in the region it is as important to examine the use of text messaging as it is to analyze the websites of terrorist groups.

The paper will first examine the role of new media and communication technologies in the spread of terrorism and provide a global perspective on the changes brought about in the tactics and strategies of terrorist organizations by the information revolution. The paper will then narrow its focus to look closely at the particular aspects of the information revolution in South and Southeast Asia, and using extensive examples and case studies of new media use by regional extremist groups, examine their use of specific communication technologies and situate them in the global context.

Research in the field of communication studies into this aspect of new media use is growing but limited, often to the role of the Internet. This paper will draw extensively on research in the realm of terrorism studies, particularly research into the relationship between media and terrorism. In doing so the paper attempts to extend the field of communication research into new areas, and by combining approaches from other fields of study, outline new areas of focus for communication scholars."
2004-0912,'The Magazine that Brings Back the Good Times': Nostalgia in Media Narratives of an Idealized American Past,Paper,'The Magazine that Brings Back the Good Times': Nostalgia in Media Narratives of an Idealized American Past,"This paper examines one of the increasing number of nostalgic media products on the American market. In Reminisce magazine and its mail-order Country Store, the past is a rose-colored, rural place full of close families and treasured possessions, and a lost time of communal strength and simple pleasures. Such an idealized and sanitized view of the past nevertheless seems natural because it emerges from the nonfiction experiences of real people who contribute to this reader-written magazine and whose stories are told either in narrative form or in conversations recreated on the page. This study uses rhetorical and discourse analysis to examine not only the content of five years worth of issues of the magazine, but also the broader editorial and marketing processes through which that content is created. It identifies the narrative themes, symbolic devices, and presentational style of the memories recalled in this magazine in order to consider why the notion of a lost--and better--past captures the imagination of present-day Americans."

The addition of the Internet to the news media environment and evolving explanations of media consumption create an opportunity to re-examine news consumption behavior. The present research proposed a theory of news habit formation based in the Uses and Gratifications paradigm and applied it to emerging patterns of news consumption among college students. Five distinctive patterns of news consumption related to specific news genres emerged: hometown newspapers, comedy news, cable news, Internet news, and broadcast news. A sixth consumption pattern included diverse print and electronic sources specializing in depth news coverage. Surveillance and escapism gratifications were the most consistent predictors of news consumption behavior across these patterns. However, habit strength was the most consistent predictor of news consumption. Depth and hometown newspaper sources were related to current events knowledge."
2004-0914,The Mangle of Media: implementations of point-of-view in video games,Paper,The Mangle of Media: implementations of point-of-view in video games,"The concept of media use is one of the most widely researched topics in the field of Media, Technology and Society. Most often it is engaged through the questions: How do people use media? or For what reasons do people use media? although there can rarely be an answer to the latter without some understanding of the former. This paper is a critical inquiry into the conceptualization of media use as exposure, that often underlies the extrapolation of experimental findings to social impacts of interactive media practices. As an alternative, the author contributes a socially-situated concept of media use, with a special emphasis on the social dynamics of mastery involved in interactive media. The author describes resistances and accommodations in the implementation of point-of-view in video games in order to illustrate the socially-situated concept of media use. This paper contributes to the theory of interactive media use and is of import to the fields of Media Studies, Cultural Theory, Audience Analysis, and the Psychology of Media."
2004-0915,The Media Campaign in the 2003 Israeli Elections,Paper,The Media Campaign in the 2003 Israeli Elections,"The paper examines the media campaign in the 2003 Israeli general elections. Political scandals primarily implicating Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Likud ruling party stood at the center of this election. The paper analyzes the media coverage of the scandals, the responses of the Prime Minister and his supporters, and the effects of the coverage and the responses on the election results. It shows that a combination of controversial coverage and effective responses neutralized the potential damage and allowed Sharon to score a major victory. The second part of the paper explores a few characteristics of the media campaign including the party broadcasts, the debates, the themes, the campaign of ethnic and religious minorities, the use of foreign campaign consultants, and the election night coverage. The main conclusion is that in comparison to previous elections, the 2003 election campaign moved somewhat backward from the postmodern phase of campaign communications."
2004-0916,The MEDIA Programme and the Construction of a Unitary European Audiovisual Identity,Paper,The MEDIA Programme and the Construction of a Unitary European Audiovisual Identity,"Since the GATT negotiations of 1994, the European Union's vision of a pan-European audiovisual policy has included a strong cultural argument, aimed at limiting imports from the United States while taking advantage of innovative technologies to produce and disseminate European content. Support mechanisms like the MEDIA programme can be seen superficially as mere economic tools to boost the EUs audiovisual industry. However, by analyzing the development of the programme over the years, it is possible to understand how MEDIA is a crucial instrument in the EU's politics of identity.
This paper is a critical analysis of the texts pertaining to MEDIAs revisions and other documents related to EU audiovisual policies. The themes that emerge from this analysis suggest that the EU has been increasingly considering audiovisual heritage (especially feature films and TV fiction) as a key actor in the construction of a strong unitary European cultural (and thus also economic) identity, both at the domestic and international level. A tension, however, exists in the process of creating a non-national European identity that also respects and promotes linguistic and cultural diversity.
These findings are important for communication research because they document and analyze the EUs attempt to construct its own deliberate international image and imagery as a means to compete with U.S. global dominance. In addition, they function as a beginning point for discussion on the current and future role of cultural and media policies in the making of a geo-political entitys identity in the international landscape."

That is the question underlying this paper. It contains the first preliminary results of a large Belgian (1991-2000) agenda-setting study encompassing 143 issues, four media and three media agendas. First the media and political agenda-setting literature is critically reviewed pointing towards flaws in the available research designs. Next the Belgian project is presented anticipating most of the weaknesses of previous studies. Finally initial whole-agenda analyses are presented revealing effective but limited media impact on the three political agendas under study, being civil society, parliament and government."
2004-0918,The Meta-Technologies of Genetic and Digital Information,Paper,The Meta-Technologies of Genetic and Digital Information,"The Meta-Technologies of Genetic and Digital Information

The technologies that process digital information and genetic information both fall into the class of informational meta-technologies that are qualitatively different from industrial (modern) technologies and premodern tools because they so vastly increase the degrees of freedom with which humans can transform their relations with themselves, others in society, and the material world. As a result, these two meta-technologies share a number of discourse, economic, cultural, social, and legal spaces. Understanding the parallels and interactions between the two types of meta-technologies across these spaces enhances our ability to understand either digital or biotechnologies as well as to make policy regarding both. This paper explores the parallels between the two types of meta-technologies as the foundation for a research agenda."
2004-0919,The Movement Against Neo Liberal Globalisation and the Media: Friends or Enemies? A Case Study,Paper,The Movement Against Neo Liberal Globalisation and the Media: Friends or Enemies? A Case Study,"This analysis is part of a wider research project investigating the legitimacy issue of international institutions. The European Union and the WTO are the main institutional focus of this research. It is within this framework that we analyse the movement against neo liberal globalisation or anti-globalisation movement in Belgium. The popularity of new social movements depends crucially on their ability to contest symbolically the public sphere. The media can thus be considered potentially very important players for the visibility of this movement and as a channel for the movement to voice their ideas. They are channels through which to communicate their goals but also to mobilize support from citizens (i.e. public opinion), to win recognition from governments and political institutions and elites, and to broaden the scope of conflicts so as to draw in potential partners or mediators.
We primarily draw on the data gathered for our media study. We examine in detail the news reports covering the movement against neo liberal globalisation. On the basis of these data we will attempt to shed some light on the way in which the movement against neo liberal globalisation is portrayed in the media.
Theoretically this paper is inspired by framing theory and tabloidisation issues. These enable us to better understand the amount and ways in which mainstream mass media pay attention to new social movements such as the movement against neo liberal globalisation."

Polls and media agendas from three EU countries appear to be inter-related on the issue of the euro. The British media featured less coverage of the euro introduction than the French and Spanish media. The agenda setting hypothesis was supported only in the case of France. The Spanish public agenda appeared to follow the French media agenda while the French and British media agendas appeared to be correlated.
A total of 808 paragraphs were analyzed to compare the different amounts of coverage and to examine second-level agenda setting effects. Data come from newspapers in France, Spain, and Great Britain and the Eurobarometer public opinion poll. The implications of the adoption decision on the quantity, content, and impact of news are discussed."
2004-0921,The Multiple Proximities of Telenovelas and Audiences,Paper,The Multiple Proximities of Telenovelas and Audiences,"This paper examines the interplay of several forces in international television. The primary focus is various competing, seemingly contradictory trends in television production and flow. While many countries create more and more of their own television programs (Straubhaar, et al, 1992; 2003), television programs continue to flow between countries. Those flows include increasing numbers of telenovelas flowing to unusual cultural spaces and markets, beyond those that a strict appeal to cultural similarity or proximity (Straubhaar, 1991) would predict. So this paper also examines some of the complex, even contradictory forms and audience appeals of other kinds of proximity: genre proximity, value proximity, and thematic proximity. These theoretical categories for television flow are then considered within the context of an ongoing hybridization of television genres, which implies an underlying hybridization among their appeals to their audiences as well. So the literatures on both proximity and hybridity will be explored and related to each other. Hybridization in the development of television genres permits the creation of television forms that can be exported from an increasing variety of countries. Hybridization among cultures enables audiences to have increasing interest in more varied forms of television, both local and global. For a number of countries, such as Japan or much of Western Europe (Buonano, 2002), television has tended to be either local or U.S. imports. For them, hybridization of genres may produce new programs that their audiences will find interesting and which will begin to imported, as Korean and Chinese dramas are beginning to find some acceptance in Japan, and as Brazilian telenovelas have found niches in Italy and Russia. To understand these new, more complex flows we need to explore and understand multiple forms of proximity between the cultures, global, regional and national, represented in imported television programs and the audiences that choose to watch them."
2004-0922,The Multiply Transgressive Body of Anna Nicole Smith,Paper,The Multiply Transgressive Body of Anna Nicole Smith,"From its debut in August 2002, The Anna Nicole Show put the public into a near tizzyand not just because of its popularity, its strange hybrid genre of reality TV/sitcom/celebrity profile, or the banality of its content, but rather because of the body of its star. In this paper, I contend that the body of Anna Nicole is viewed as problematic because it is more than just that of a notorious celebrity; it is a body that is multiply transgressive, in which dominant ideologies of femininity, bodily discipline, and social class converge and conflict. Drawing on the works of Foucault, Judith Butler and Susan Bordo for my theoretical framework, I provide a textual analysis of both the program and the popular criticism to reveal that as a body that trangresses many cultural norms and therefore hints at the abject, while simultaneously remaining intelligible, Anna Nicoles body generates a controversial figure that both defies and reinforces her socially prescribed positions. The investigation into the harsh reaction to this particular presentation of the female body serves as a case study into the ways in which society still works to maintain specific forms of disciplined, docile bodies."
2004-0923,The Narrative Basis of Leader-Member Exchange,Paper,The Narrative Basis of Leader-Member Exchange,"In this paper, we argue that extant measurement of LMX force-fits judgments of relational quality into numerical scales in ways that obscures the experience of LMX. A discursive approach is required to reclaim this experience and the narrative basis for sensemaking in communication. We propose a narrative research agenda for LMX that suggests that: 1) the uniqueness paradox may apply to actors sensemaking narratives suggesting some common scriptal elements over interpretation of high versus low quality LMX experiences, 2) the ways that narratives come to constitute, not merely reflect, LMX relationship quality will reveal itself in the actual dialogue and the interaction process of leaders and members, and 3) the character of certain stories told will be influenced by the Discourses of the corporate community and society, which serve as interpretive resources from which leaders and members draw to construct what is normal and reasonable as they set and solve problems in an LMX context."

The purpose of this paper is to analyse Chinas regulatory policies of transborder television drama flow. Through this, I engage in the debate over the role of the state in a globalizing media environment.

I will demonstrate that, though the transborder media poses a challenge to a national media system and culture, the local state still plays a crucial role in regulating domestic cultural policies and guiding development.

The paper begins by reviewing the existing debates on the communication sovereignty of nation-state with particular focus on broadcasting. It is followed by a brief introduction to the changing environment of Chinas broadcasting industry. This is aimed at providing a context for the analysis and at articulating the debates with the empirical phenomena. The rest of the paper covers two parts. The first part sketches the structure of the broadcasting regulatory system in China, and the development of its television drama in the late 1980s and the earlier 1990s. The second one deals with the recent changes of the Chinese regulations on governing the transborder television drama flow and investment."
2004-0925,The News Media and Economic Voting in the 1998 German Bundestag Election,Paper,The News Media and Economic Voting in the 1998 German Bundestag Election,"This study investigates the role of the news media in the economic voting process, by exploring how exposure to economic news in the mass media affects economic evaluations. The empirical results are based on a content analysis of a range of German news media outlets and on survey data from a two-wave panel survey in the1998 German Bundestag (federal parliamentary) election. News media outlets differed in their representation of economic issues: private television newscasts portrayed the economy in a rather negative manner, whereas public television news shed a more positive light on the nations economic condition. The survey data suggest that the depiction of the economy in TV news influenced respondents economic assessments: exposure to public television news yielded positive judgements about the national economic situation, whereas exposure to private television news resulted in negative evaluations of the national economy. Economic evaluations affected political attitudes towards the main incumbent party. For people with a low level of news exposure, pocketbook as well as national economic concerns mattered for the formation of political attitudes towards the incumbent party. By contrast, people with high levels of news exposure only took into account the national economy when evaluating the main incumbent party."
2004-0926,"The News Media, Communication Networks, and Opinion Heterogeneity: A Preliminary Assessment with Agent-Based Modeling",Paper,"The News Media, Communication Networks, and Opinion Heterogeneity: A Preliminary Assessment with Agent-Based Modeling","This paper presents the results of five agent-based simulation models about the influence of the news media and communication networks on the heterogeneity in opinions. The models explore the impacts of interaction between individuals and the news media at the individual level on the survival of opinion diversity at the aggregate level. Results indicate the following. First, opinion heterogeneity survives in a model where citizen agents are able to access the news media for different opinions. Second, the news media that provide diverse opinions prolongs the process of interpersonal discourse. Third, in a society model where every agent buys what the political information source provides, the heterogeneity of opinion hardly survives in social networks of the like-minded. However, when the agents turn to take the news media information to strengthen their attitudes, opinion heterogeneity could survive and be maintained through personal interaction. Implications of this heuristic approach and results are discussed."
2004-0927,The One-Sentence/Long-Sentence Lead Revisited: Have We Learned Our Lesson?,Paper,The One-Sentence/Long-Sentence Lead Revisited: Have We Learned Our Lesson?,"Stapler (1985) determined nearly two decades ago that the lead sentences in many of the nations top newspapers were too long to be comprehended by the typical reader. The current study sought to determine if those papers had addressed the problem. This replication involved analyzing 237 articles from 12 of the nations most respected newspapers. The average lead sentence for this sample was 27.3 words long, a 1.2 word increase from Staplers study. That is in stark contrast with the recommendations of readability experts, who suggest average sentence length not exceed 19 words. On the other hand, some newspapers did appear to begin backing a way from the notion a lead always has to be a single sentence. Overall, the findings suggest the newspaper industry would do well to listen to Staplers earlier warning as it continues to fight for its own economic wellbeing."
2004-0928,The Online Rush for Novelty: Exploring the Profile of a Virtual Innovator,Paper,The Online Rush for Novelty: Exploring the Profile of a Virtual Innovator,"Taking advantage of a unique moment in the evolution of digital cameras, the current research examines communication dynamics and influence of communication patterns on diffusion of innovation in the particular setting of an online professional message board, the information-exchange interface of a heterogeneous international community of amateur photographers. Findings suggest that earlier adopters of innovation in virtual communities have the same general characteristics as those identified by previous researchers in real communities and that a positive correlation exists between the online interaction and innovation adoption. The profile of a virtual innovator is constructed based on research data and characteristics of online communities regarding diffusion of innovation communication are discussed."
2004-0929,Theoretical Description and Comparative Analysis of Adaptation and Fusion Theories,Paper,Theoretical Description and Comparative Analysis of Adaptation and Fusion Theories,"This study describes and compares Cross-cultural Adaptation theory and Cultural Fusion theory. The context used here is reentry into ones original culture. If the theoretical descriptions of adaptation are accurate, one would expect those who have adapted to another culture to experience issues of deculturation, acculturation, reentry problems, and psychological stress. If fusion is more accurate, one should see a sedimentation of cultural learning and functioning. Subjects consisted of returned LDS missionaries who have spent 18 months to two years completely immersed in a foreign culture. Using open-ended survey method, responses were coded and compared statistically. Results for the most part do not support adaptation, providing an argument for the sedimentation of cultural functioning."
2004-0930,"The Oxymoron of the Global Community: Globalization, Communication, and Community",Paper,"The Oxymoron of the Global Community: Globalization, Communication, and Community","This essay analyzes globalization from the perspective of communication and, more specifically, the community. By exploring the notion of community and importance of communication to its creation, the essay will discuss the fundamental flaws in the idea of a global community. Some of the defects examined are the development of an unhealthy homogeneity, unbridled consumerism, and a lessening of responsibility. The essay concludes the rush toward a global community should be replaced with a focus on a move in the direction of a global society."
2004-0931,The Parasocial Contact Hypothesis,Paper,The Parasocial Contact Hypothesis,"One of the most significant and enduring contributions of social psychology in the past 50 years is known as the Contact Hypothesis. Credited to Gordon W. Allport (1954), the Contact Hypothesis, or Intergroup Contact Theory, states that, under appropriate conditions, interpersonal contact is one of the most effective ways to reduce prejudice between majority and minority groups members. Two years after Allports book, The Nature of Prejudice, was published, Horton and Wohl (1956) set forward the case for studying what they dubbed para-social interaction: ""One of the most striking characteristics of the new mass mediaradio, television, and the moviesis that they give the illusion of face-to-face relationship with the performer"" (p. 215).
In this essay we propose a communication equivalent to Allports Contact Hypothesis that we call the Parasocial Contact Hypothesis (PCH). If people process mass-mediated parasocial interaction in a manner similar to interpersonal interaction, then it is worth exploring whether the socially beneficial functions of intergroup contact have an analogue in parasocial contact. After reviewing the salient portions of the theoretical literature concerning both the Contact Hypothesis and parasocial interaction, we offer a more formal statement of the Parasocial Contact Hypothesis and describe two studies that test the hypothesis with respect to majority group members level of sexual prejudice concerning gay men."

A theoretical background in culture and management serves as a foundation to exploring the emergence of third culture people in the transnational workplace. In turn, the paper illustrates how these cultural and management theories then give rise to the past, present, and future study of third culture people. The benefits and challenges of hiring third culture employees are discussed, as well as what the trend of the increasing presence of third culture people could mean for business and job-seeking individuals. A special section looks at the affect of third culture practitioners on international public relations."
2004-0933,The path from favors to compliance: Explaining the effectiveness of pregiving messages,Paper,The path from favors to compliance: Explaining the effectiveness of pregiving messages,"Several studies suggest that pregiving messages (providing the target with a favor before making a direct request for compliance) are more effective than direct requests. Most explanations for this phenomenon posit that the norm of reciprocity causes us to feel obligated to repay the favor. Nevertheless, alternative explanations for reciprocal behavior exist, and are often confounded in the literature. This examination attempts to differentiate two of these explanations, gratitude and obligation, and test the relative veracity of each as a mediator of the favors to compliance relationship. Findings are consistent with the multi-factor model, challenge the obligation explanation, and bolster the gratitude explanation."
2004-0934,The peoples detective: true crime in Dutch folklore and popular television,Paper,The peoples detective: true crime in Dutch folklore and popular television,"Peter R. de Vries is a Dutch true crime television programme in the tradition of Americas Most Wanted. Critics say it is a threat to the moral order and the paradigm of an over-commercialised, degenerate television culture. This paper argues differently: programmes such as Peter R. de Vries follow an existing tradition and morality in the history of popular culture. The nineteenth century saw various forms of entertainment that revolved around true crime. A comparison between these forms and the Peter R. de Vries episodes revealed striking similarities. Nevertheless, Peter R. de Vries is not a straightforward translation of folklore to television codes. The program also incorporates features of more recent genres. Peter R. de Vries takes up a position in the vacuum between the official system of justice and the popular sense of justice, fulfilling a traditional need using new media."
2004-0935,The Physiological Effects of Oral Contraceptives on Communication in College Romantic Relationships,Paper,The Physiological Effects of Oral Contraceptives on Communication in College Romantic Relationships,"Previous research has discussed various side effects connected with the application of OCs, primarily discussing the physical drawbacks. However, research has neglected to examine the emotional and sexual side effects of OCs, and how this hormone-modifying drug affects communication in relationships. The hormonal imbalances attributed to OCs may be likened to steroids, of which extensive research exists. The present study, conducted on a small liberal arts college in the northeast, surveyed 203 male and female participants on their use of OCs and what, if any, impact they had on the communication within their relationships. The results indicated that communication and seriousness of romantic relationships both improved after the introduction of the oral contraceptive in the relationship. However, the irritability of the female increased after taking the oral contraceptive. The results reflected that oral contraceptives were not the only influence on communication within relationships, but that social, evolutionary, and hormonal factors play large roles as well."
2004-0936,"The Policy Web Construction: Domestic Policy, Foreign Policy, and Justificatory Rhetoric of the Bush Administration",Paper,"The Policy Web Construction: Domestic Policy, Foreign Policy, and Justificatory Rhetoric of the Bush Administration","In recent years, United States foreign and domestic affairs have become increasingly intermeshed. Since these affairs are linked, domestic and foreign policy might also be linked, and implemented under a larger policy umbrella. In this critical case study, this paper examines National Security policy to look beyond if these policies are linked in practice, and see how the administration discusses them. Through discourse analysis, this paper investigates the justificatory rhetoric of the Bush administration on the U.S.A. Patriot Act and the Bush Doctrine, a domestic and a foreign policy within National Security. By analyzing Bushs rhetorical justifications in this critical case study, this paper aims to provide a foundation for future research to explore this connection, a concept I label the policy web construction."
2004-0937,The Postcolonial Context of Computer-mediated Communication Use,Paper,The Postcolonial Context of Computer-mediated Communication Use,"Using the premises of postcolonial theory, this study aims to show how former colonial and present postcolonial relations between the Philippines and the United States creates contexts that influence the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in organizations. This study examines three contexts of organizational use of computer-mediated communication (CMC): (a) Philippine history as a macrocontext, (b) the information and communication technology milieu in the Philippines, and (c) the Filipino organizational conditions that influence when and how CMC is employed to fulfill organizational goals. Findings indicate that the three contexts simultaneously and paradoxically enable and constrain Filipino organizational members in using CMC as a part of their organizational communication strategies, which in turn lead either to the facilitation or disruption of the American technological colonization of the Philippines. These findings also reveal postcolonial theorys inability to explain completely organizational communication processes that require the mediation of tightly coupled technological tools. This deficiency suggests the need to extend postcolonial theorys frames to include the material conditions and lived experiences of postcolonials in theorizing about computer-mediated communication and its use in postcolonial societies."
2004-0938,The Power-Communication Model of Leadership and the Failed States Paradox,Paper,The Power-Communication Model of Leadership and the Failed States Paradox,"Failed states have become a major international political problem. Such states constitute breeding grounds for terrorism, regional instability, and human misery. An important question, then, is can such states be stabilized, and if so, how? In this paper we identify a paradox of leadership in failed states: to emerge as leader requires foreign intervention, yet association with this intervention can taint a leaders legitimacy. Should this happen, the leaders rule will be brought into question, intragroup competition for control will ensue, and with it, the state remains unstable. We illustrate this paradox in the context of Hamid Karzais rise to the Presidency of Afghanistan using the power-communication model of leadership. We address: (1) how Karzai uses language to emerge as a representative leader; (2) how becoming a representative leader confers material power; and (3) the paradox of maintaining leadership, and producing a stable state, when it is contingent on foreign intervention. In doing so we counterpose our analysis with extant theories of leadership."
2004-0939,The power of emotionally packaged commonplaces. Short-term effects and post-debate consequences of different rhetorical strategies in televised political debates,Paper,The power of emotionally packaged commonplaces. Short-term effects and post-debate consequences of different rhetorical strategies in televised political debates,"Despite the large body of research on televised debates, some fundamental questions have remained unanswered so far. This is especially true for the way, in which viewers react to different kinds of statements during a debate and the degree to which these short-term reactions influence post debate opinions. Taking the second televised debate in the 2002 national German election as an example, we address both of these questions in this paper. By means of a real-time response measurement, we first identify those statements that were most successful in the audience as a whole and those that polarized supporters and opponents of the candidates. Then, we analyse the content, style and rhetorical means of those statements. In a third step, we investigate the effects of short-term reactions upon post-debate opinions. Our analysis shows that emotionally packaged commonplaces were most successful in the audience as a whole. On the other hand, statements in which the candidates presented factual evidence, specified their political plans or criticised their opponent, tended to polarize supporters and opponents of the candidates. Moreover, short-term reactions did in fact influence viewers' post-debate opinions. This means that it is most effective for candidates in a televised debate not to deal with controversial topics but to address in an emotional way questions in which most of the audience agrees with them. It is very unlikely, though, that this strategy serves democracy."
2004-0940,The Processes of Emergence: Global Information Policy Regime Formation and Features,Paper,The Processes of Emergence: Global Information Policy Regime Formation and Features,"The Processes of Emergence:
Global Information Policy Regime Formation and Features

Global information policy is developing to regulate the information infrastructure, its uses, and the content it carries. The domain is still highly contested, however -- not only in terms of the specific features that will ultimately characterize global information policy, but even in terms of the very processes by which that policy will be formed. Regime theory, developed within the field of international relations, is particularly valuable in understanding the processes of global information policy regime formation. This paper introduces regime theory, examines its applicability to the domain of global information policy, looks at those features of the global information policy regime that are contested and those that are not, and examines the contending processes by which regime formation is taking place. It concludes by identifying trends in the regime formation process that can help guide future analysis of the emergent regime as it further takes shape."
2004-0941,The Public Domain Trapped by the Mouse: Walt Disney and Ramifications of the Copyright Term Extension Act,Paper,The Public Domain Trapped by the Mouse: Walt Disney and Ramifications of the Copyright Term Extension Act,"This paper examines potential ramifications of the Copyright Term Extension Act. As much mainstream media coverage of the CTEA and Eldred v. Ashcroft case has centered on Disneys stake in the issue, this paper first provides a quick overview of judicial conflicts of the Eldred case, and uncovers Disneys maneuvering and lobbying before Congress during the legislative procedure. This paper, then, investigates why the CTEA turns out legal inconsistencies with the public domain by focusing on Disneys animated films. With respect to Disneys synergistic market power based on copyright control over its animated films, this paper focuses on how Disney animations, as copyrighted works, are created, marketed, and recycled. By tracking their original resources in the public domain or derivative works and the companys copyright control over the materials, this paper raises questions concerning the widely accepted proposition that strong copyright protection such as the CTEA motivates our creativity and cultural expression. From the analysis, this paper concludes that the CTEA is an unfair tradeoff between copyright holders private interests and the public interest."
2004-0942,The Public Interest & Mobile Communications: Effective Competition versus Open Spectrum Alternatives,Paper,The Public Interest & Mobile Communications: Effective Competition versus Open Spectrum Alternatives,"Mobile telephone service uses a scarce publicly owned resource. In the U.S., electromagnetic spectrum is allocated through auctions with the winner obtaining property rights. Critics have argued that the public interest would be better served through an open spectrum policy where the public retains ownership. They argue that open spectrum approaches would provide flexibility in terms of network architecture and applications while emphasizing access.

This study examines as to whether the public interest is being served through the FCC policy of effective competition. In an economic sense, this is defined as having two components, efficiency and technological progress.

Based upon trends in price discounting and expansive service plans, consumer demand, customer churn, and the new policy of number portability, this study concludes that economic efficiency is being served by FCC policy. Likewise this policy is promoting technological progress as indicated by the migration to digital networks, growth in the number of cell sites, and six new classes for services that are identified.

This apparent success of the FCC mobile communications regulatory policy suggests that supporters of open spectrum alternatives need to be more specific as to their plans and measurements of effectiveness before alternative spectrum models are seriously considered."
2004-0943,The relationship between global media use and cosmopolitan orientation among Hong Kong adolescents,Paper,The relationship between global media use and cosmopolitan orientation among Hong Kong adolescents,"The exponential growth of the Internet contributes to a planetary communications network in which images are rapidly transmitted around the globe. Morley and Robins (1995) argue that the globalization of communication technologies provokes identity crises by forcing individuals to acknowledge the presence of others who are very different from them. This concept of identity crisis also describes the teenage experience. Buffeted by external economic and technological forces, as well as by developmental challenges, todays global teenagers must constantly renegotiate their identity on two fronts.

Cultural imperialism theorists argue that lopsided cultural flows threaten the autonomous cultural space of non-Western nations. Others celebrate the democratic potential of our global communications infrastructure. Yet, both stances rely on a belief that is currently unproven, namely the notion that there is a direct relationship between global media use and audience orientation toward the outside world.

This study examines how the media habits of Hong Kong youth are related to their orientation toward the world, or their cosmopolitan orientation."" In relating the cognitive classifications, values and behaviors of Hong Kong youth to their media habits, it demonstrates that exposure to global media does not necessarily fuel global culture. It also strengthens our understanding of how global communication technologies might be used to foster cosmopolitanism."

Results indicated significant relationships between relevance, clarity, and narrative use with some of the factors of instructor self-disclosure. Results also suggested that when instructors use more self-disclosures that are positive and relevant, present content clearly, make the content relevant, and use narratives in the classroom, students perceive them as having more referent, expert, and reward power."
2004-0945,The Relationship between Media Environments and Advertising Effects: A Literature Review,Paper,The Relationship between Media Environments and Advertising Effects: A Literature Review,"This paper provides the results of an extensive and structured synthesis of the existing empirical literature on the influence of media environments on the effectiveness of embedded advertisements. To date, most studies investigating this relationship have been experiments, making use of a homogeneous (generally student) sample, and focussing on television. In order to assess the general findings across studies, a formal vote-count analysis was conducted on 173 unique relationships found in the literature. Results show that with regard to the influence of objective characteristics of the context, most studies either report non-significant findings, or report contrasting effects. With regard to the influence of subjective psychological responses induced by the context, a clearer pattern of results emerges. Studies predominantly report a negative relationship between intensity of the response on advertising recall, while significant findings for the relationship between valence of the response and attitude toward the ad (Aad) are exclusively positive. In the discussion, gaps in the present body of research are revealed and possible directions for future research are proposed."
2004-0946,"The Relationship between Psychological Distress, Television Exposure and Television Viewing Motives in Crime Victims",Paper,"The Relationship between Psychological Distress, Television Exposure and Television Viewing Motives in Crime Victims","The present study examines the relationship between psychological distress as a result of criminal victimization and television exposure and viewing motives. Subjects were 221 recent crime victims who were measured for 'common' distress symptoms (SCL-90), symptomatology associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (SIL), amount of television exposure and viewing motives. Remarkable gender differences were found in the relationship between psychological distress and both amount of television exposure and gratifications sought from television. In the male sample, distress levels were related postively to ritualistic viewing motives; in the female sample, distress levels were related positively to escape viewing and amount of exposure. Methodological and measurement implications are discussed."
2004-0947,The Relevance of Irrelevant Anchors in Judgment Studies,Paper,The Relevance of Irrelevant Anchors in Judgment Studies,"Since Tverksy & Kahnemans (1974) seminal paper on judgment heuristics, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate a wide range of cognitive biases that result when decision makers utilize one or another heuristic. Anchoring and adjustment is one such heuristic. While the anchoring phenomenon is well established with respect to individual judgments, researchers are now investigating how and when groups can reduce or counteract anchoring effects. One potential advantage of group decision making over individual decision making is the opportunity for group interaction. While perhaps not a panacea, group interaction at least offers the opportunity to critically question information and the integration of potentially irrelevant information into the judgment process. The current research investigated how multiple anchors, some relevant and some irrelevant, influence judgments of persons working together as a group. Independent variables included size of the irrelevant anchor and degree of irrelevancy. Dependent variables were standard negotiation measures: initial offer, level of aspiration, and resistance point. An additional aspect of the investigation was the analysis of the interactions among negotiation team members (84 teams of three persons each). Examination of the interaction transcripts revealed that participants almost universally took the irrelevant anchor information to be relevant, sometimes offering elaborate strategic scenarios. A conversational explanation for the results is offered, focusing on Grices (1974) Maxim of Relation. Finally, we discuss the implications of the study for judgment research and offer suggestions for ensuring the validity of future research on anchoring biases in human judgment."
2004-0948,The representation of gender and ethnicity in digital interactive games,Paper,The representation of gender and ethnicity in digital interactive games,"The content of games is an understudied area in research about digital interactive games (DIGs). This paper reports a content analysis of the representation of gender and ethnic groups in 12 console games. We concentrated on the portrayal of the leading character, and supporting role in the introductory film of the DIG. Among the titles studied were games with a female leading character (for example, Tomb Raider, Parasite Eve), and with a male leading character (for example, GTA ViceCity, Splinter Cell). Our results show that the number of female characters was far larger than in earlier studies, with many of them in leading parts. Whatever their role in the game, the physical representation of women was as stereotypical as before: Their attire emphasized female features. Most characters in the DIGs belonged to the dominant, white ethnic minority, the heroes exclusively so."
2004-0949,The Rhetoric of Rescue: Salvage Immigration Narratives in Israeli Popular Discourse,Paper,The Rhetoric of Rescue: Salvage Immigration Narratives in Israeli Popular Discourse,"The paper explores the popular discourses associated with the reporting, documenting and commemorating of a series of 'salvage immigration' operations that have punctuated Israeli history between the 1930s and 1990s. These operations involved large-scale, orchestrated national efforts sponsored by the community and the Israeli state to bring to the land of Palestine/Israel Jews who have experienced persecutions or hardships in different parts of the world (e.g. Yemen, Iraq, Russia, Ethiopia). These high-profile events dominated news reporting upon their occurrence and over the years became part of the nation-building ethos through repetition, elaboration and mythization in popular commemorative texts in the media, in museum settings and in school-related pedagogical materials.
The paper explores the scope and contours of 'salvage immigration' narratives that serve as the core of Israeli cultural discourse on immigration. The discourse on immigration, in Israel as elsewhere, plays a central role in constituting and policing cultural-national boundaries and in defining the terms for the circumstances under which they can be crossed. At the same time, in different national contexts this discourse is inflected in specific, culturally meaningful ways. The dominant immigration idiom in Israeli cultural finds its quintessential expression in those 'salvage immigration' narratives that chart a cultural 'rhetoric of rescue'. The paper offers a schematic account of this popular rhetoric, which is associated with the meta-narrative of 'catastrophic Zionism,' and points out the potential for a cross-national study of immigration discourses, taking the US as a preliminary comparative example."
2004-0950,The Right to Play,Paper,The Right to Play,"The virtual worlds now emerging on the internet enjoy a unique legal status. A person can accumulate large fortunes in digital assets there (e.g. gold pieces) with no fear of being taxed; on the other hand, if a Thief character comes by and steals it all, the owner cannot take the Thief to court. As more time, and hence more assets, are devoted to virtual worlds, the law will almost certainly begin to take away the privileged status these worlds now enjoy. This is unfortunate; the play status of these worlds is one of the things that makes them such valuable arenas for communication. This paper suggest a remedy under law, an act or charter that would instantiate a play world as a *play* world, not subject to Earth law. In effect, such a law would accord a unique and elevated status to this communication technology, analogous to the elevated status that corporations - fictional persons - have relative to us ordinary persons."
2004-0951,The Rise and Fall of Online Social Support: Group Level Predictors,Paper,The Rise and Fall of Online Social Support: Group Level Predictors,"The sustainability of online social support groups is an important issue: The more new members are attracted and the more old members remain, the more benefits can be created through their communication for current and future participants. However, little attention has been given to the sustainability of online social support groups in the information systems and the communication literature. The present study tested a structural-functional model of online social support group (OSSG) sustainability with 116 OSSGs. Structurally, significant non-linear effects of group size and message volume on attraction rate and message increase rate were found. Group age and no-posting-period negatively affected OSSG sustainability. Functionally, symmetry was found increasing retention rate. The proportion of emotional social support comments significantly increased retention rate in physical illness groups, but not in mental illness groups. Primary results were discussed with secondary analyses, followed by practical implications of the findings and limitations for future research."
2004-0952,The role of credibility on the intention to return or recommend a Web site,Paper,The role of credibility on the intention to return or recommend a Web site,"This study explicates the role of Web site credibility in the intention to return or recommend a site in two information-seeking contexts. Of the four dimensions of credibility that emerged, trust/expertise was the most significant predictor of intention to return or recommend a site. Subsequent hierarchical regression analyses revealed that for the antecedents of credibility, media reliance, gender and involvement significantly influenced credibility. High media reliance and high topic involvement resulted in significantly higher credibility scores. Males perceived Web sites to be more credible than females."
2004-0953,The Role of Enforced Structural Holes in Independent Radio Promotion,Paper,The Role of Enforced Structural Holes in Independent Radio Promotion,"The subject of independent radio promotion has been energetically discussed in academic literature, independent research, and the popular press for many years. Many authors have offered structural explanations for the power and durability of independent promoters, but none to date has undertaken a quantified network analysis. This study analyzes the network comprised of radio stations, record labels, and independent promoters in the top 20 markets for Contemporary Hit Radio, demonstrating that independent promoters serve as classic tertius nodes, brokering relations across structural holes between labels and stations. However, unlike normal structural holes, the one inhabited by independent promoters is enforced by federal prohibitions against payola and replenished by an unending supply of new music, financial capital and airtime. This fact helps to explain the durability of the institution in the face of resistance from both record labels and radio stations."
2004-0954,The Role of Face and Facework in Negotiation,Paper,The Role of Face and Facework in Negotiation,"This essay examines the impact of culture-specific face and face maintenance on negotiation outcomes. Two cultures, Chinese and American, are discussed. Chinese culture, regarded as representative of collectivistic, interdependent-self, and high-context cultures, is assumed to manifest other-oriented and mutual face concerns and remedial strategies, such as avoidance and hinting in face-threatening situations. In contrast, American culture, typical of individualistic, independent-self, and low-context cultures, is presumed to show concern for self-face and to enact self-face related remedial strategies, such as clarification and aggression. This paper reviews previous scholarship to assess the ways in which the expectations for face and maintenance behaviors based on culture are likely to shape the consequences of negotiation sessions."
2004-0955,The Role of Facial Expressions of Emotion in Attributions of Personality Characteristics,Paper,The Role of Facial Expressions of Emotion in Attributions of Personality Characteristics,"Facial expressions of emotion are an important source of information that may result in evaluation of the expresser. This phenomenon is particularly salient in impression formation when attributions of personal characteristics can, and do, influence the quality of communication. This study used attribution theory to examine the effects of facial expressions of emotion on the assessments of personality in an initial encounter. 121 men and women were exposed to expressions of six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) portrayed by male and female models and then evaluated personal characteristics (credibility, attraction, desire for future interaction). Results supported the predictions such that negative expressions resulted in lesser attributions of credibility, attraction, and desire for future interaction while positive expressions resulted in greater attributions, although there were some subtle deviations from this general trend. Gender of the expresser was found to be influential, with the most striking finding being that men were consistently rated more positively for expressions of anger and surprise while women were rated more positively for expressions of sadness. In general, however, there were fewer distinctions between the genders than anticipated and some of those differences were contrary to expectations."
2004-0956,The Role of Identity and Cognitive Balance in Family Relationships Characterized by Dislike,Paper,The Role of Identity and Cognitive Balance in Family Relationships Characterized by Dislike,"This study examines how relationships are maintained with a disliked family member. Heiders balance theory predicts that when people dislike their relational partner, a sense of imbalance prevails in the relationship that people strive to reduce or eradicate. Given the nonvoluntary nature of family relationships it is not possible for people to exit the relationship with the disliked family member to eradicate this sense of imbalance. Forced to negotiate these relationships, individuals are then faced with concerns about how to present and preserve their identity. Participants (n = 271) completed a survey to investigate how common relationships with disliked family members are, how these relationships are sustained, and what influence concerns about identity have in the sustenance of these relationships. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the participants in the study stated that they disliked a family member. Moreover, disliked relationships between families members are sustained through the use of both behaviors that create distance and behaviors that create closeness."
2004-0957,The role of national crises in the framing of media policy debates,Paper,The role of national crises in the framing of media policy debates,"The following paper discusses the ways the press framed the debates prior to the 1927 Radio Act and the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act through textual analysis of period mainstream articles. The analysis aims to explore whether and when do journalists have the capacity to be self-reflexive, to criticize their profession and the institutions they work for. This analysis finds that the two instances of press coverage differed in their normative evaluation of commercial funding for broadcasting. In the latter period journalists were much more willing to criticize the commercial status quo and support a public broadcasting system. The paper suggests that the wider historical context in the 1960s, and especially the Vietnam War, played a role in motivating journalists to hold a critical stance that might have contributed to the successful passage of the 1967 act. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possible implications these findings have for the contemporary role of the media in media policy debates."
2004-0958,The role of public and private self-awareness in a computer-mediated environment:,Paper,The role of public and private self-awareness in a computer-mediated environment:,"Although little research has been devoted to understanding the effects of self-awareness in computer-mediated communication (CMC), most explanations of both pro- and anti-social CMC behaviors seem to be indicative of changes in self-awareness. The present study examined the effects of ones self-awareness, specifically, a persons public and private self-awareness in anonymous, time-restricted, and synchronous CMC. Two experiments were conducted. The pilot experiment tested and confirmed the effectiveness of using a Web camera combined with an alleged online audience to enhance users public self-awareness. In the second experiment, users private and public self-awareness were manipulated in a crossed 2 x 2 factorial design. Participants in different experimental conditions were paired up to complete a Desert Survival Problem via a synchronous and text only chat program. After the task they evaluated each other on intimacy, task/social orientation, formality, politeness, and attraction. Participants also reported the degree to which they felt working as a group. The results suggest that a lack of private and public self-awareness does not automatically lead to impersonal tendencies in CMC as the deindividuation perspective of CMC would argue. Further, partners of the participants in this study were able to form favorable impressions in a completely anonymous environment based on less than twenty minutes of synchronous CMC interaction, which lends strong support to the notion of the idealization proposed by hyperpersonal theory."
2004-0959,The Role of Religion in the Formation of Dispositions in Sports News,Paper,The Role of Religion in the Formation of Dispositions in Sports News,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an athlete's expression of a religious affiliation in a sports news article affects the readers evaluations of the character of the featured athlete and the article. Religion and religiosity were determined to be factors in the formation of dispositions. Sports magazine articles featuring an athlete expressing strong religious beliefs (Christian or Jewish) were evaluated more positively by respondents than a similar article without an expression of religious beliefs. Compared to individuals with low levels of religiosity, individuals with high levels of religiosity had more favorable attitudes about the athlete depicted in the article as well as the article. Level of sports interest did not appear to play a role in participants' evaluations of athlete who expresses a religious affiliation in a sports article or the article."
2004-0960,"The Role of Screen Size in Inferring the Effects of Content Type on Attention, Arousal, Memory, and Content Evaluation: A Search for Content-Specific Effects",Paper,"The Role of Screen Size in Inferring the Effects of Content Type on Attention, Arousal, Memory, and Content Evaluation: A Search for Content-Specific Effects","This study examined the role of screen size in making inferences about the effects of television content on viewers attention, arousal, memory, and content evaluation. Both main and combined effects of two levels of screen size and three levels of content type on the four criterion variables were investigated via a 2x3 mixed factorial-experiment. A total of seventy-five participants were randomly assigned to one of the two screen size conditions (big or small). Those in each condition watched six 2 to 3-minute-long television segments representing three different content types (news, advertising, and entertainment). During the viewing, heart rate and skin conductance (SC) were measured as indicators of attention and arousal respectively. Heart rate data were later converted into beats per minutes (BPM). Skin conductance data were converted into skin conductance response (SCR) and skin conductance level (SCL). After watching, participants completed a questionnaire containing measures of psychological responses to the segments.
The results showed that, with few exceptions, content on the large screen resulted in better memory and was more attention-getting and arousing, as indicated by an cardiac deceleration and an increased SC responses. However, the predicted effect of screen size on participants subjective content evaluation did not materialize. Of most importance, viewers cardiac and SC responses were most prominent when entertainment content appeared on the big screen, which demonstrated content-specific effects for large screens."
2004-0961,The Role of Situation-Specific Secondary Goals in Message Planning,Paper,The Role of Situation-Specific Secondary Goals in Message Planning,"Persons sometimes produce messages that they later regret. Often such messages conflict with secondary goals such as not offending the hearer. This study predicted that the likelihood of becoming aware that a message conflicts with a secondary goal and the likelihood of rejecting the message because it conflicts with the goal increase with the importance of the goal in the specific situation. It was predicted, however, that a greater perceived likelihood that a message conflicts with a goal leads to message rejection only if the goal is important in the situation. The study also asked whether the importance of four secondary goals depends on the primary goal pursued. Secondary goals included goals to make a good impression, not offend the hearer, act in accordance with one's ethical standards, and maintain a positive relationship. Eight primary goals were investigated (e.g., goals to comfort the hearer, account for a failure, respond to a request for a favor)."
2004-0962,The Role of Social Support in the Family and Community Integration of Right Hemisphere Stroke Survivors,Paper,The Role of Social Support in the Family and Community Integration of Right Hemisphere Stroke Survivors,"The goal of this project was to understand better the processes by which social support can assist right hemisphere stroke survivors in the process of community integration. Open-ended interviews were conducted with 12 right hemisphere stroke survivors and their caregivers. The transcribed interviews revealed 7 challenges and 3 types of resources: formal external, informal external, and internal. Relationships between types of resources were discovered, leading to the development of a reciprocal model of community integration. The internal resources of the stroke survivor gave evidence of being the most important resource for facilitating community integration. Implications for researchers and healthcare providers are discussed within this framework."
2004-0963,The Role of Stereotyping in the Construction of Reality in a Crisis,Paper,The Role of Stereotyping in the Construction of Reality in a Crisis,"This study analyzed the New York Times news coverage of 9-11 to see how the press stereotyped the three groups, Americans, Arab-Americans, and Arabs. It was hypothesized that the social psychological inclination in a crisis to maintain positive social identity through stereotyping in-group as well as out-group members would appear in media content. News frames, episodic cases, and quotes were quantitatively analyzed, and textual analysis was added. As a result, the images of coping Americans, longing Arab-Americans to be accepted as Americans, and hungry and angry Arabs were found. The three images supported the idea that the temporary mood for positive identity in a social crisis should influence news narratives. This study tried to expand the concept of framing applying it to people rather than issues or events. Also, it provided a methodological tool for research of stereotyping."
2004-0964,The Role of TV Viewing in Emotional Satisfaction: Romantic expectations and romantic TV,Paper,The Role of TV Viewing in Emotional Satisfaction: Romantic expectations and romantic TV,"Building on Segrin and Nabi (2002), this study examined possible associations between romantic TV content and romantic expectations (romantic beliefs and fantasy rumination) in individuals who are versus are not involved in committed romantic relationships. Participants were 415 undergraduates who completed self-administered questionnaires. Results revealed that exposure to romantic TV and seeking romantic fulfillment from TV were positive predictors for fantasy rumination, but not for romantic beliefs, whereas perceived realism of TVs romantic portrayals was a positive predictor for romantic beliefs, but not for fantasy rumination. Additionally, romantic expectations were positively predicted by the strength of respondents romantic parasocial relationship with favorite TV characters or personalities. Associations among the main romantic TV variables in not committed and committed individuals separately showed similar patterns. However, perceived realism of TVs romantic portrayals was a positive predictor of romantic beliefs only in committed individuals. Implications for these findings are discussed."
2004-0965,The Rural Divide: The Social Shaping of Technology in Three Community Networks in Texas,Paper,The Rural Divide: The Social Shaping of Technology in Three Community Networks in Texas,"Although eighty percent of Texas is considered rural, most of the population resides in urban areas. Creating an advanced telecommunications infrastructure in Texas is difficult to achieve because of these geographical barriers. In 2000, the Telecommunications and Infrastructure (TIF) Board released a Request for Proposals (RFP) to Texas communities to establish community networks (CNs). The goal of the CN project was to extend resources from schools and libraries, where TIF had placed its earlier funding priorities, to the broader community. This CN program follows national trends of creating policy solutions to bring advanced telecommunications services to underserved communities in the United States. TIF gave special consideration to those projects located in rural areas in order to support creative solutions to infrastructure barriers. This paper attempts to answer the question of how effective these efforts were through examining case studies from three rural CN projects. I argue that the development of infrastructure can be enhanced through an understanding of the social shaping of technology in rural communities. In this paper, I analyze how CN project leaders envisioned technology would enhance their communities, what obstacles they faced in implementation, and how community members received the technology. In all three cases presented here, local residents resisted technology in varying degrees as a way to protect this sense of identity. This resistance, while viewed as a barrier by some of the institutions involved, became a productive force for these communities."
2004-0966,The Sarcastive: A Linguistic and Paralinguistic Analysis,Paper,The Sarcastive: A Linguistic and Paralinguistic Analysis,"This paper reports on an exploratory field study in which student coders collected samples of sarcastic utterances and described the sarcastic speakers linguistic and paralinguistic behaviors for each utterance. Analysis of the data revealed that sarcastic utterances included more positive language than negative language, more evaluative than expressive intent, more declarative than interrogative or imperative sentence types; and frequent use of specific verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Regarding paralinguistic features, few gestures were associated with sarcasm, but facial expressions were abundant (most frequently raised eyebrows, open eyes, and smiling). Vocal features reported included increased emphasis and stress, both increased pitch and decreased pitch, and increased volume."
2004-0967,The Situational Nature of Media Evaluations: An Investigation of Broadcast and Online News Credibility Before and After Election Night 2000,Paper,The Situational Nature of Media Evaluations: An Investigation of Broadcast and Online News Credibility Before and After Election Night 2000,"This study examined media credibility evaluations of broadcast news and online news sites (TV and print) in the context of the 2000 presidential campaign. Credibility is theorized to be situational in nature both within news industries, which use problematic events to justify polling, and by individuals, who rely on available information to form cognitive representations of media. Further, interactivity is theorized to mitigate the potentially negative assessments that are activated by problematic events. Effects on credibility were tested for time (before-after election night) and interactivity (interactive and noninteractive conditions) using a mixed-design factorial experiment. The study found that perceptions of broadcast news credibility and informativeness significantly increased after the election. Both before and after the election, different news channels activated similar primary evaluative criteria but secondary criteria differed depending on the time of evaluation. Interactive conditions improved credibility evaluations for online TV news but diminished assessments of newspaper sites. Such findings point to the situational nature of media credibility judgments and suggest that the influence of the news context, the specific media channel in question, and the quality of news experiences afforded by different channels (i.e. interactive, non-interactive) should be taken into consideration when determining the enduring consequences of a news crisis."
2004-0968,The Sky of Venus Seen From Mars: A Cognitive Investigation Of Americans Perceptions Of the Europeans,Paper,The Sky of Venus Seen From Mars: A Cognitive Investigation Of Americans Perceptions Of the Europeans,"This paper contains the results of a survey administered in Fall 2002 to 283 students about stereotypes and personal opinions of the Europeans in general and of four European nations (France, Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom).
From the data emerges that our sample perceives the Americans and the Europeans as having two different characters, with the Americans reflecting masculine values (attachment to material possessions, and a tendency to achieve status and to compete), and the Europeans as reflecting instead feminine values (appreciation for arts and association with romance and passion). The Europeans are also related to values such as tradition (heritage, history) and family.
We identified 2 stereotypes of the Europeans, one that emphasizes negative traits such as arrogance, rudeness, and nationalism, and the other that emphasizes positive traits such as romance, passion, sophistication, and art. The two stereotypes were not related to personal opinions based on mediated contacts vs. personal ones."
2004-0969,The Social Construction Fear in Young Women: The Roles of Television and Parent-Child Communication,Paper,The Social Construction Fear in Young Women: The Roles of Television and Parent-Child Communication,"A matched sample (198) of parents and their children (college freshmen) were surveyed about their perceptions of crime prevalence, fear of crime for themselves and for family members, the frequency of parents warnings to children about crime, and television viewing habits.
It was predicted that exposure to televised violence, both fictional and news programming, would predict not only parents estimates of crime frequency, but also parents fear for the safety of family members and the frequency with which they warn their children about crime and violence. It was also predicted that parents warnings would cause young-adult children to estimate that crime is more prevalent and to be more fearful of the potential of victimization.
Results indicate that parents crime related television viewing influences parents crime prevalence estimates directly, and parents altruistic fear for daughters indirectly through prevalence estimates. Moreover, warning daughters about violence appears to increase daughters fear of violence directly and their perceptions of crime prevalence indirectly.
The studys results are discussed in light of gender difference, relationships between interpersonal and mass communication, cultivation theory, and heuristic processing."
2004-0970,The social diffusion of influence among adolescents: Group interaction in a chatroom environment about anti-drug advertisements,Paper,The social diffusion of influence among adolescents: Group interaction in a chatroom environment about anti-drug advertisements,"The goal of this study was to test the effects of online adolescent group interaction about anti-marijuana advertisements on relevant attitudes and behaviors. A between-subjects post-only experimental design was used to test two crossed factors, online chat and strength of arguments in anti-drug ads. A sample of 535 students was randomly assigned to one of four conditions: chat and strong argument ads, chat and weak argument ads, no chat and strong argument ads, and no chat and weak argument ads. The group interactions about anti-drug ads lead to negative effects such that those who chatted reported more pro-marijuana attitudes and subjective norm beliefs than those who just viewed the ads. No support was found for the hypothesis that strong argument ads would result in more anti-drug beliefs relative to weak argument ads. A significant interaction effect was found for belief in the positive consequences of marijuana use. Overall, these findings suggest that viewing anti-drug ads and discussing them with peers may result in deleterious effects in adolescents."
2004-0971,The Spiral of Silence in Online Discussions:,Paper,The Spiral of Silence in Online Discussions:,"The purpose of this study is to apply the spiral of silence hypothesis to the online discusions with the topic of the 2002 Korean presidential election. By examining the bulletin board postings, this study attepmted to investigate how the online users' opinions on two candidates were affected by the publicized polls and the media coverage about the candidates. Based on the spiral of silence hypothesis, it was hypothesized that online users increased their postings when they thought their supporting candidate was in the majority side whereas they decresed the postings when they thought their supporting candidate was in the minority side. The poll data and media coverage of the candidates were regarded as referential indicators that showed online users which side is majority and which side is minority.
Three kinds of data were collected: Nine poll data including the supporitng rates of two candidates, media coverage of two candidates, and the online postings in a bulletin board designed for the election discussion. The number of online postings supporting cadidates was compared with the supporting rates of the candidates in the polls and the media coverage in favor of the candidates. Methodologically, the comparions were conducted nine times cross-sectionally and acorss nine times longitudinally.
The results showed several interesting findings. First, in most cases, the spiral of silecne did not occur. The demographic and attitudinal characteristics of online users were suggested to explain for those non-significant results. Second, despite rare spiral of silenec occurrence, the logitudinal comparison between media coverage and online postings showed a significant spiral of silence occurence. This result implies that online users were more sensitive to media coverage than the supporting rates, more sensitive to the logitudinal media coverage than one-time media coverage, and more sensitive to broadcastings and progressive media than newspapers and conservative media."

This paper found out two things. First, results indicate that Korean culture did not preclude absolute replication of the spiral of silence. Second, Noelle-Neumanns suggestion that the changeable make greater use of mass media was patricianly confirmed, but another suggestion that the hardcore frequently engage in interpersonal communication was not supported."
2004-0973,The State of the Debate: Internet and the Consolidation of Democracy in Latin America,Paper,The State of the Debate: Internet and the Consolidation of Democracy in Latin America,"This paper argues that the media and new communication technologies, including the Internet, can play an essential role in consolidating democracy in Latin America. The first step in understanding this role is to understand the place of the Internet within theories of democratic consolidation. The paper thus fills a gap in the literature as it synthesizes and collects the latest research on the Internets possibilities for enhancing democracy in Latin America and places these works within the established writings on democratic consolidation. It finds that most research looks at Internet use in civil society organizations, the public sphere, and political society. Few publications address communication in other arenas also seen as important to democratic consolidation. Thus scholars have a great opportunity to contribute to research in the public interest by enhancing our understanding of communication and democracy."
2004-0974,The Stem Cell Controversy: Towards a Model of Mediated Issue Development,Paper,The Stem Cell Controversy: Towards a Model of Mediated Issue Development,"Across a range of public issues, media sociologists have observed cycles or waves in media attention. Despite the taken-for-granted nature of these cycles, there has been little theoretical specification regarding the dynamic social mechanisms that shape the amount of media attention to an issue and how the media define an issue. With this in mind, the current study outlines a model for understanding mediated issue development. The theoretical components of the model include the type of policy arena where debate takes place, the agenda-setting and framing activities of strategic actors, and the journalistic need for narrative structure. Related factors include the type of journalist assigned coverage, and the type of media outlet. The outlined model is successfully tested against data specific to the media lifecycle of the stem cell controversy, and generalized to media coverage of other public issues."
2004-0975,The Structuration of Sport Broadcast Commentary: III. Examining the Intergroup System and Temporal Structure of Gendered Athletic Performance,Paper,The Structuration of Sport Broadcast Commentary: III. Examining the Intergroup System and Temporal Structure of Gendered Athletic Performance,"An interdisciplinary body of research in the domain of sport studies has revealed that the broadcast commentary enacted at sporting events differentially draws upon intergroup assumptions to facilitate a gendered climate for assessing and characterizing male and female athletic performance. While research has begun to clarify how such processes (a) theoretically become the symbolic rule and the interactive resource for sports broadcasters as they account for athletic performance (Author[s], 2003a), and (b) empirically become a symbolic artifact in the interactive course, and mediated conduct, of enacting an athletic event (Author[s], 2003b), this essay continues to explore these issues by examining the degree to which temporal dynamics contribute to these processes. A content analysis of 2,367 lines of broadcast commentary, enacted among sportscasters in the 2000 Mens and Womens NCAA Final Four Tournament games, revealed how temporal dynamics enacted throughout sport commentary, contribute to the promotion and perpetuation of inter-group assumptions. The findings from the study provide theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic insight into those intergroup dynamics that surround the gendered domain of sport."

The resultant study avoids the weaknesses of other studies on the topic, and has implications for the modern as well as the historical debates over how to define universal service."
2004-0977,The Technologizing of Inhumane Practices,Paper,The Technologizing of Inhumane Practices,"Australias aggressive foreign policy stance, particularly on the refugee / illegal immigrant issue has been politically successful. This paper attributes this success to a two-part strategy. The first, using the theories of Said and Barthes, is to create a ubiquitous semiotic that plugs into Australias invasion myth. Founded on fear and ignorance it demonizes a recognisable other, the oriental refugee demonised as a queue jumper. The second part of the strategy responds to the daily news and public affairs programs, which scrutinize government actions, but also provide the locus of contesting political discourses.

The paper deals cursorily with the first part, the ubiquitous semiotic. The tactic of technologizing the inhumane is examined using sociolinguistic analysis of a television interview involving the Australian Immigration Minister. From this, it becomes evident how the process of classification into other allow the logic of technocratic processes to treat people inhumanely."
2004-0978,The Third Person Effect as an Obstacle to Media Literacy,Paper,The Third Person Effect as an Obstacle to Media Literacy,"Communication scholars and parents alike are concerned about the potential effect of television on teenagers. One way to buffer televisions influence is to teach audience members to become media literate. The third person effect, however, may be a significant obstacle to teaching media literacy, especially to teenage audiences who are sure they know it all and feel they are smarter than the media. Focus groups of Latina teenage girls were asked about the potential effect of telenovela viewing on teenage audiences. The data show qualitative support for a third person effect. The teenagers were sure there was no effect on them, but articulated potentially dangerous effects on others. This study provides insight into the dynamics of the third person effect so that improvements can be incorporated into media literacy curriculum."
2004-0979,The Third-Person Perception as a Social Judgment,Paper,The Third-Person Perception as a Social Judgment,"Although numerous studies have confirmed that the third person perception is a rigorous phenomenon, explanation on why and how such self-other discrepancy occurs remains underdeveloped. Conceiving the third-person perception as a social judgment under varying degrees of uncertainty, this study attempts to achieve two goals: 1) explicating the confounding concept of social distance as a moderator of the self-other perceptual gap and 2) uncovering psychological underpinnings of the third-person perception by reducing uncertainty of the judgment task. In both survey and experiment, this study found that social distance was a multi-dimensional concept involving geographic distance (termed as generality distance), specific difference (different background and political orientation), perceived dissimilarity, and demographic heterogeneity. As predicted, subjects who obtained information on the lack of overall message effects reduced perceived effects of the messages on both self and the different others. Further, such information reduced self-other disparity when the other is the most distant from the self. Directions for future studies and practical implications for political attack ads are discussed."
2004-0980,The Toxic (and Inconvenient) Female Body: The New(est) Medical Campaign against Menstruation,Paper,The Toxic (and Inconvenient) Female Body: The New(est) Medical Campaign against Menstruation,"Most feminist scholars of medicine have become accustomed to what has become an old saw  that medicine has framed womens bodies as problematic and potentially pathological  and that menstruation has been central in the construction of that pathology. Regulation of menstruation, both by women themselves and by medical practitioners, has occurred for centuries. But despite the profound ambivalence over its occurrence, theres been little doubt that the absence of menses has generally been viewed by mainstream medicine, until quite recently, as a major sign for concern.

That has changed in the last three years with a huge campaign  both by medicine and the mainstream media  to persuade women that they should stop menstruating entirely. The media currently play a key role in disseminating science and health news, and also play a key role in reinforcing dominant ideologies about femininity and sexuality. And this particular case study, on menstruation and health, represents a particularly rich and cacophonous point for problematic gendered discourses, as cultural anxieties about menstruation intersect with medical and popular discourses. What is emerging is a marketing campaign convincing women to stop menstruating completely by using hormones. Its a campaign that may challenge hormone replacement therapy as the number one pharmaceutical profit-maker within a decade.

This paper looks at the complex intersections of medicine and media using a variety of methods and texts: mainstream media coverage as an index of cultural knowledge, medical texts and their problematic intersection with popular media, and interviews with researchers, clinicians, and feminist activists."
2004-0981,The transformative experience of cancer survivors,Paper,The transformative experience of cancer survivors,"The concept of transformative experience is defined as an event that changes an individuals life so as to refocus priorities and self-identity. The trigger event that alters the individuals life might be a diagnosis with cancer, HIV, diabetes, or some other serious illness; divorce; financial tragedy; unemployment; or retirement. The present paper begins with the personal transformative experience of the first author, who was diagnosed with kidney cancer (Rogers, in process). We also draw upon relatively unstructured personal interviews with six male and female cancer survivors in New Mexico (Thombre, in process, 2004). We seek to explicate the concept of transformative experience, and to explore implications for health communication research and action."

This research explores McCornack's 91997)claim that from a message production perspective it is more cognitviely taxing to generate truthful messages in response to a multiple goal scenario than it is to generate deceptive messages because the truth must be ""packaged"" to address face and relational concerns. A sample of 216 undergraduate students responded to a hypothetical infidelity scenario in which they were tolde they had contracted an STD from cheating with a previous partner, and now their goal was to get their current partner to get tested for the STD. They were prompted either to be as honest as possible, to be less than honest if they had to, or they received no prompt regarding honesty. Results indicated that. Implications for advancing research in the production of ""packaged"" messages is discussed."
2004-0983,The USA PATRIOT Acts Application of Pen Registers to the Internet,Paper,The USA PATRIOT Acts Application of Pen Registers to the Internet,"Pen registers are electronic surveillance tools, initially used to record the telephone numbers dialed from a specific telephone. Because of the limited abilities of this technology, case precedent and laws governing the use of pen registers require a very low standard of proof. The USA PATRIOT Act redefines pen registers to permit their use on the Internet. This allows law enforcement to monitor Internet activities without showing probable cause that the search will provide evidence of criminal activity. This paper summarizes the application of the Fourth Amendment in electronic surveillance law, as it applies to pen registers, and examines the constitutionality of the use of pen registers on the Internet under the Fourth Amendment."
2004-0984,The Use and Effectiveness of Influence Strategies in Romantic Relationships,Paper,The Use and Effectiveness of Influence Strategies in Romantic Relationships,"This study examined the impact of both dating partners relationship perceptions and situational factors on the selection and the effectiveness of influence strategies used by individuals when writing appeals designed to change their partners behavior. Less close influence agents who desired long term change and who had less close partners were likely to use tactics emphasizing coercive power. Tactics that highlighted the salience and importance of the relationship were effective in changing the targets attitudes, but only when long-term change was desired. Furthermore, agents were more successful at influencing their subjectively closer partners when they used less logical argumentation compared to agents using more argumentation. These results accentuate the fact that influence agents rely on multiple strategies to influence their romantic partners, are sensitive to the goals of the specific influence situation, and must modify which strategies they use to achieve their goals."
2004-0985,The Use of Alternate Templates Approach to Study the Change Communication in an Australian Organization,Paper,The Use of Alternate Templates Approach to Study the Change Communication in an Australian Organization,"This paper presents the processual change communication dimensions of organizational change within a Queensland not for profit technology diffusion agency. One of the challenges that face process researchers is the inevitable messiness of the data collection and analysis, as the researcher maps the ebb and flow of the change process (Langley, 1999). To counteract this messiness, Langley (1999) advocates the use of several strategies to build theory from process research. This current study uses Langleys (1999) alternate templates strategy to investigate how organisational communication impacts on change receptivity in continuous change contexts. By analyzing the process data with three communication theories, monologic (Eisenberg, Andrews, & Murphy, 1999), dialogic (Bohm, 1998) and sense making (Weick, 1979), the interplay of interpretations offer greater accuracy in understanding communication of change"

Finally, it suggests some new directions for future uses and gratifications studies on CMC."
2004-0987,The Virtual Model: College Womens Knowledge of Digital Manipulation in Fashion Photographs and Body Image Distortion,Paper,The Virtual Model: College Womens Knowledge of Digital Manipulation in Fashion Photographs and Body Image Distortion,"Numerous studies have established a relationship between thin ideal media content and disordered eating patterns in women. Many of the images viewed in the media that endorse the thin ideal are digitally manipulated or computer-created. This exploratory study compared college womens knowledge of digital manipulation in fashion and entertainment images to their desire to be thin and look like the model viewed. Knowledge of digital manipulation did reduce participants desire to look like the model seen. Furthermore, exposure to a sports model decreased the gap between respondents actual body size and their ideal body size."
2004-0988,"The Will to Speak: Women, Media and the Public Sphere",Paper,"The Will to Speak: Women, Media and the Public Sphere","The paper reports findings from an ongoing qualitative cross-cultural study on women and media in which we are seeking to learn how women of diverse local, national and personal situations have tried to give women a greater public voice through both commercial and non-commercial media since the 1970s. We asked participants to explain their roles, personal and organizational goals, approaches and tactics. We also asked their perceptions of what women's media activism has accomplished and what remains to be done to eradicate barriers to women's access or, in some cases, to create new channels of communication. The paper draws from both online and in-person interviews with 35 women in 15 nations between March and October 2003. Participants ranged in ages, occupations, perspectives, and affiliations. They came from cities and rural areas in both developed and developing nations. The forms of media they were involved with included radio, television, film, newspapers, newsletters, zines, book publishing, live music, and Internet. We learned that for many, media activism on women's behalf was a means to accomplishing broader social and political goals, such as mobilizing peace dialogues in nations at war or effecting public policy to improve women's education. In other cases, it was aimed at correcting a discriminatory practice, such as persistent sex role stereotypes in media portrayals; or to affirm women's culture and community. Approximately half of those whose interviews we report here were formally trained as media professionals, but the rest learned to ""do"" some form of media through political motivation. Respondents shared a number of beliefs, among these that in spite of progress, sexism in media portrayals is still very serious, as is women's general invisibility in commercial media. Sexual harassment for female professionals was cited repeatedly as a problem. Women working in women-owned and controlled media conveyed the greatest freedom of thought and creativity. The activist role was viewed by all participants to be both essential for women's advancement and personally empowering. We conclude that a wide range of media activism represents a significant manifestation of a women's public sphere."
2004-0989,Threats to Local Television News Viewing: Fact or Fiction?,Paper,Threats to Local Television News Viewing: Fact or Fiction?,"An online survey of 2,365 people examined whether use of competing media influenced the amount of time spent viewing local television news. Guided by uses and gratifications, media displacement, audience availability, and inheritance effects theories it was hypothesized that time spent with competing media would detract from local television news programs. Results show that amount of time spent with radio, network television, and cable or satellite television influenced the days spent viewing local television news programs, but Internet use was not related. In addition, some demographic factors  though mediated in this study  still significantly affected local television news viewing."
2004-0990,Tobacco companies anti-smoking ads and adolescent reactance: Test of a boomerang effect,Paper,Tobacco companies anti-smoking ads and adolescent reactance: Test of a boomerang effect,"Little is known about the impact of youth smoking prevention ads sponsored by tobacco companies. This is the first randomized controlled study to test whether adolescents exposure to such ads promotes intentions to smoke, curiosity about smoking, and positive attitudes toward the tobacco industry. Additionally, we examined whether this boomerang effect may be either greater for or limited to adolescents who score high on a trait measure of psychological reactance. Ninth and tenth graders (n=832) attending a large public high school in central California watched five ads about preventing youth smoking sponsored by either Philip Morris, Lorillard, or the American Legacy Foundation (""truth""), or five ads about preventing drunk driving. Main outcome measures were perceptions of ad effectiveness, intention to smoke, and attitudes toward tobacco companies measured immediately after exposure. As predicted, adolescents rated Philip Morris and Lorillard ads less favorably than ""truth"" ads. Adolescents intention to smoke did not differ as a function of ad exposure. However, exposure to Philip Morris and Lorillard ads engendered more favorable attitudes toward tobacco companies. Thus, anti-smoking ads sponsored by tobacco companies do more to promote corporate image than to prevent youth smoking. This study provides empirical support for proposals to restrict the tobacco industrys involvement in youth smoking prevention."
2004-0991,To Brag or Not To Brag?: Cultural Relativity of the Perceptions of Self-Presentation,Paper,To Brag or Not To Brag?: Cultural Relativity of the Perceptions of Self-Presentation,"Prior studies have demonstrated the robust and pervasive tendency of North Americans to maintain and enhance an overall evaluation of the self. However, there are few studies investigating how culture influences people's perception of the individuals who employ self-enhancing or self-effacing strategies in communicative contexts. The present study investigates how self-construals affect people's evaluation about those who employ three different communicative messages (bragging, positive, and negative presentations) to represent the self. Eight hundred and sixty eight college students from Korea (n = 246), Japan (n = 189), Hawaii (n = 200), and the mainland United States (n = 233) read a scenario depicting a person using positive, negative, and bragging self-presentations for his/her accomplishment, then completed a questionnaire measuring their perception of the individual in the scenario (overall likability, and perception of competence), and willingness to copy different self-presentation styles. No significant differences were found between independent and interdependent self-construals in terms of the overall likability perception of bragging self-presentation style. On other other hand, interdependent self predicted more favorable evaluation of the individual enacting a negative presentation than the independent self Furthermore, independents perceived positive self-presenter to be smart and knowledgeable significantly greater than interdependents, whereas interdependents perceived negative self-presenter to be smart and knowledgeable significantly greater than independents."
2004-0992,To Know Or Not to Know: The Case of Communication by and with Older Adult Russians Diagnosed with Cancer,Paper,To Know Or Not to Know: The Case of Communication by and with Older Adult Russians Diagnosed with Cancer,"Abstract

This article builds upon previously discussed cross-cultural issues of diversity in intergenerational communication and healthcare through illumination of communication by and with older adult Russians diagnosed with cancer (e.g., patients and their family caregivers). This paper describes the ways in which group identifications and stereotypes can inform our understanding of cancer treatment and survivorship, as well as more general social processes surrounding the experiences of Russians with cancer. Utilizing an approach grounded in social identity theory, it describes the ways in which understanding primary identities (i.e., those associated with large social collectives such as cultural groups), secondary identities (i.e., those associated with health behaviors) and tertiary identities (i.e., those associated with cancer) can help explain certain cancer-related social processes. Case studies of communicative processes experienced by family caregivers of older adult Russian patients diagnosed with cancer serve as a springboard to highlight what may be perceived by many health care providers in the United States healthcare system as unique approaches to patient care (e.g., miscommunication between health care providers, patients, and family members, and truth disclosure to family members instead of patients). Health care providers throughout the world are increasingly finding an older, more culturally and ethnically diverse population to care for, and as such, should be progressively more aware of the strengths and weaknesses in their communicative practices in such intergenerational interactions. Additionally, in the paper, a series of propositions is forwarded to stimulate further research on this topic."
2004-0993,Tonight's Top Story: Commercial Content in Television News,Paper,Tonight's Top Story: Commercial Content in Television News,"While marketers look for creative ways to promote their products on television (e.g., through video news releases, sponsorship models), critics suggest the integrity of television news is being compromised by commercial content (Potter, 2001; McElgunn, 1992). Scholars also are concerned that as commercial content becomes more prominent in news programming, less time will be available for other stories potentially more important to democracy (Rowse, 2000). This content analysis investigates local and national news programming on ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, PBS, and CNN during a two-week period in February 2003 for evidence of four commercial practices. The study confirms that a substantial amount of commercial content exists; however, programs differ greatly in the amount and types of commercial content featured. Local news programs were found to have significantly more commercial content in all four categories than their national counterparts. Overall, commercial content was objectively portrayed in balanced or mixed coverage."

Coder analyzed the appearances and behaviors of 268 characters from Saturday morning programs. Similar to previous studies, the current project found that animated female characters are underrepresented in general and are portrayed as more warm, attractive, slim, concerned about appearance, mature, domestic, romantic, affectionate, responsible, and more likely to wear revealing clothing than male characters. Males were portrayed as more muscular/athletic, technical, hardy, brave, more likely to threaten and interrupt others, and were more likely to get into trouble than female characters. Various media theories are used to discuss the potentially negative effects of these portrayals on young viewers."

Adults (N = 204) from the US, India, and Ukraine completed self-reports of love styles, adjustment, cognitive appraisals, and relationship quality. Results showed support for Sternbergs three dimensions, viz., intimacy, passion, and commitment. Further, results using SEM techniques also indicated a good fit for the cross-cultural causal model of relationship quality. Specifically, commitment mediated the impact of culture on passion and intimacy. Of the three love dimensions, only intimacy had a direct impact on adjustment, cognitive appraisals, and relationship quality and cognitive appraisals mediated the impact of adjustment on relationship quality. Confirmation of the model speaks to the issue of the centrality of love at the cross-cultural level."

2004-0997,Toward an Understanding of the Role of Social Interaction in Effecting Social Change: The Case of the Allendale Charter School,Paper,Toward an Understanding of the Role of Social Interaction in Effecting Social Change: The Case of the Allendale Charter School,"Despite placing discursive strategy at the center of both the theory and practice of social change and grassroots organizing, social movement research does not connect general discursive strategies and their execution, by activists and practitioners, in local moments of social interaction. Using a case study of an activist groups grassroots efforts to organize a charter school in Allendale, an ethnically-diverse, mid-size city in Upstate New York (population about 20,000), in this paper I show, through detailed analysis of interaction surrounding these efforts, how organizers executed a discursive frame in local moments of social interaction by problematizing the distinction between Anglos and Latinos in the community. Organizers strategies included: a) emphasizing ethnic diversity among charter school organizers and a non-Latino ethnic-minority presence in Allendale; b) providing reasons (other than a vested interest in Allendales Latino population) for their conduct and motives; and c) detaching the charter school project from the categorical distinction between Latinos and Anglos altogether. I propose that organizers inconsistent execution of a discursive frame in local interactional moments contributed to the eventual failure of the initiative. How LSI scholars might investigate the role of social interaction in effecting social change in grassroots organizing through ""action"" research is discussed."
2004-0998,"Toward A Pragmatist Theory of Publics and the Public Interest: Recovering, Defending And Advancing Dewey",Paper,"Toward A Pragmatist Theory of Publics and the Public Interest: Recovering, Defending And Advancing Dewey","This paper proposes to recover, defend and advance John Deweys view of the conditions, constitution and operation of modern publics in the context of mass communication theory. Dewey claimed that the formation of publics and a genuine public interest would only come about when free social inquiry is indissolubly linked to the art of free and moving communication. Much of his work through the 1920s and 1930s reiterates the necessity for rethinking inquiry and communication in integral fashion if modern publics are to become effective vehicles of democratic expression and criticism. However, few have taken Dewey at his word with most theorists preferring instead to selectively reconstruct either his views on inquiry or his views on communication. This paper attempts to set the stage for a new appraisal of Deweys theory of publics in three ways: 1) through a re-evaluation of James Careys pragmatic theory of mass communication as drawn from Dewey, 2) through a review of the distortions introduced into Deweys work by critical historians of communication and democratic theorists, and 3) by providing a generic sketch of Deweys view of the conditions and constitution of modern publics. I suggest that much contemporary criticism of Dewey is misplaced due to a serious misunderstanding of his project, particularly with respect to the oft-repeated yet mistaken claims that Dewey is overly vague or unable to address power relations. I conclude that Deweys view of publics remains both viable and necessary for adequately characterizing democratic mass communication processes."
2004-0999,"Towards a philosophy of communication theories: an ontological, epistemological and ideological approach",Paper,"Towards a philosophy of communication theories: an ontological, epistemological and ideological approach","This article critically examines the various ways in which communication theories have been classified, suggesting that the traditional approaches (according to chronological development, domains of provenience, subfields of study, or components of an essentialized communication definition) do not take into account deeper grounds for association or for differentiation, stronger reasons for grouping. We then propose a philosophical conception for taxonomizing communication theories, one that has many times been promised but has never been fulfilled, one having as criteria for placing studies together or separately a theory of being (an ontology), a theory of knowledge (an epistemology) and a theory of power (an ideology), implicitly or explicitly structured, explained and used by various theorists and schools of thought. This study provides a brief presentation of the ontological, epistemological and ideological trends identified, showing how communication theories can be analyzed through this framework and configuring a modular scheme that organizes them."
2004-1000,Towards reliable e-readiness measurement: a Structural Equation Modeling approach,Paper,Towards reliable e-readiness measurement: a Structural Equation Modeling approach,"The objective of the present paper is to make a contribution to a conceptual model of information indicators by critiquing existing ranking-based models, and performing a full latent variable SEM to propose an indicator that takes into account the causal linkages between the underlying variables of the model. We suggest reasons why this should be a more reliable information measurement tool, and ways to overcome the challenge of developing valid e-metrics. The existing measurement models are descriptive at best, thus arriving at a set of cross-country rankings assessing e-readiness or ICT development and its impacts on Social and Economic Development that lack an explanation of the causal relationships between the included variables. Thus, most of the existing operationalizations lack a comprehensive deductive theory to guide them. Based on the literature review, the most likely candidates for the initial inclusion of the variables in the model are the Networked Readiness Index and Information Utilization Potential. However, since none of these performed a covariance structure analysis, and furthermore, since data for both models are for different time periods (IUP uses 1987 data, while NRI uses current data), our approach is to perform a comparison of IUP and NRI as alternative models, using current secondary data available for the US.We compare the initial fit of this model with the fit of the alternative model, represented by NRI. After assessing the model fit, we suggest covariance structure analysis as a way to overcome challenges in measuring the Information Society and propose further steps."

However, the philosophy and values of public relations has not recognized, and the general population often have negative connotation about the profession. Based on the normative role and definition of public relations, I attempt to develop a philosophy of public relations in South Korea by exploring the body of knowledge of public relations, the history and current situation of the public relations in South Korea, and traditional Korean philosophy and cultural values. I suggest three values, dialogue and two-way communication, public interest, and openness and transparency, as foundation for the contemporary philosophy of public relations in the country."

Thirty-nine male and female viewers of Friends, 18 to 45 years of age, were interviewed in-depth in India. While Indian audiences identified with the aspirations of the characters of Friends, and could understand the plot, they drew a distinction between what was Indian, and what was not. Elements related to humor and friendship in Friends were interpreted as being transparent  aligning closely with Indian culture; but depictions of sexuality were interpreted as being relatively opaque. Our findings hold significant implications for understanding how Hollywood weaves its global web of transparent narratives"

Over 900 adults from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China participated. The results of this study indicate: (1) Mainland China has demonstrated a pattern in perceiving argument as a relative positive and constructive action and in motivation of being argumentative, and (2) several traditional value orientations contributed to argumentative tendencies. In general, people in Mainland China perceive being argumentative more positive than Hong Kong and Taiwan. On the continuum of being argumentative, Taiwanese people locate on the low end whereas people in Mainland China are at the high end of being argumentative. The paper will discuss findings with reference to other studies on the same topic to gain better understanding of culture and communication in particular and Chinese communication in particular."
2004-1004,Transforming the News: Copyright and Fair Use in News-related Contexts,Paper,Transforming the News: Copyright and Fair Use in News-related Contexts,"Fair use in copyright law is an enormously complex and enigmatic legal doctrine. The fair use doctrine is intended to allow certain unconsented uses of copyrighted materials to advance the public good, in spite of the copyright holders statutorily granted exclusive rights. While the factors that go into fair use analysis can be stated simply enough, their actual application to individual cases is so uncertain as to be, at times, nearly indeterminate. News organizations are particularly concerned with fair use. Yet the contours of current fair use doctrine provide anything but certainty as to what uses will ultimately be considered fair, even after expensive and time-consuming litigation. This paper analyzes the current state of fair use law in news contexts, paying particular attention to the transformative use factor that has taken on key importance in recent years."
2004-1005,Translating Dissatisfaction into Political Activity: An Examination of Age and Perceived Government Relevance,Paper,Translating Dissatisfaction into Political Activity: An Examination of Age and Perceived Government Relevance,"The purpose of this study is to better understand what drives young adults to community-based volunteerism and away from participation in American politics. Rooted in existing research about political participation, this study focuses on the effects of age and perceived government relevance on the relationship between dissatisfaction and involvement. The results highlight the crucial role of perceived relevance in translating dissatisfaction into political activity. This study shows that perceived government relevance has an important direct and interactive impact on political participation. Those who feel the government is relevant are more likely to participate in political activities. Perceived government relevance also serves an important role in moderating the relationship between dissatisfaction and political activity. However, the results suggest that those who do not have these feelings are somewhat less likely to participate in political activities. They also suggest that young adults are less likely than older adults to perceive the government as relevant. Therefore, this study indicates that age itself may not be a very influential factor in the amount of political activity citizens undertake but instead the underlying problem may well rest with a failure to perceive the relevance of government to problems young citizens face."
2004-1006,Transportation into the Narrative and Perceptions of Media Realism,Paper,Transportation into the Narrative and Perceptions of Media Realism,"This study investigates the relationships among thoughts that occur while watching a television program, the extent to which one is transported into the narrative of that program, and the extent to which the program is perceived as realistic. We use a thought listing procedure to assess the number and nature of thoughts that occur while viewing, and questionnaires measuring tranportation, realism, need for cognition, and demographics. We hypothesize that the number of thoughts about the narrative will predict transportation and realism. Conversely, thoughts about non-narrative aspects of the program (location, plot, acting), and evaluative thoughts will interfear with transportation and will lead to judgments that the program is less realistic."

As the crisis unfolds, the mass media are called upon to keep both public officials and the general population abreast of the situation. This study focuses on news coverage of SARS, a public health crisis that had an enormous global impact. Drawing upon Media Dependency System theory, we examined a Chinese-language newspaper, a well read publication in the Chinese community in the U.S., with concerned readers about the happenings in their home countries where SARS originated. The findings suggested that the paper cited less health-related sources than health-related sources when reporting SARS stories. In addition, more government organizations were cited than regular individuals. There were only few stories that provide news you can use. While it is the newspapers goal to cite credible sources and to meet their social responsibilities in times of crisis, our results suggest that they might not be living up to their promise."

A comparison between Germany and the Netherlands,"Public relations is without doubt an expanding and diversifying discipline, not only in the USA but also in other parts of the world. An organized body of knowledge is seen as a major prerequisite for professionalization of public relations practice. That is why we conducted a research project within two countries in Europe, Germany and The Netherlands to analyze the state of the art of and the trends in public relations research in these two countries. These countries have a well-established public relations practice and since about half a century also a growing amount of professors in public relations. By comparing the development of and current trends in PR-research in these countries, we provide a context for a trans-national reflection of the relationship between PR-research and the professional development of public relations as a field of occupation.
For this research project we analyzed all PhD dissertations concerned with public relations from 1995-2000 (Germany) and 1990-2000 (The Netherlands). The variation of disciplines from which public relations is studied is enormous and there is hardly any exchange of knowledge. Most dissertations start from zero, assuming that there is nearly no other relevant research on which the project can proceed. This fragmentation of research hinders the development of public relations as a theoretically sound and empirically grounded academic discipline."

This paper examines factors contributing to the emergence of such trust in dyads. Two aspects of trust are distinguished. On the one hand the perception of interpersonal trust; this is a perceptual dimension that reflects the interpersonal relationship between two individuals. Results suggest that having a clear, unambiguous impression fosters interpersonal trust. On the other hand a behavioral dimension of trust is distinguished. Findings suggest that trustful behavior is not solely influenced by interpersonal trust. Whether or not interpersonal trust is a necessity for behavioral trust depends on contextual factors such as the group-membership of the people involved. Results show that when interacting within the boundaries of ones group, not knowing the individual with whom one has to interact, is no impediment to trusting behavior."

He was an eloquent leader of Indian nationalism and the architect of Indias freedom from British rule. This paper analyzes the philosophy of Gandhis communication strategy and how he succeeded as a journalist and popular communicator.
Immortalized as the father of independent India, Gandhi wrote prolifically and spoke frequently during his long career as a social reformer and political leader. Drawing upon writings, speeches, letters and recorded conversations of Gandhi, this paper examines the success of his communication philosophy and his role as an advocate of freedom of speech in India. Few know that Gandhi edited four weekly newspapers in a journalistic career covering more than 30 years. This paper also discusses Gandhis persuasive tactics of political communication such as fasting, propaganda tours, silence, clothing, and adoption of symbols."

Critical theory views truth and public interest as socially constructed which problematises claims of significant differences in the definitions, models and practices of propaganda and public relations. Specifically, it raises difficulties for those who seek to classify propaganda as unethical through assertions that it attempts to motivate people into action or thought through lying and/or deceitful means, and (the excellent two-way symmetrical model of) public relations as ethical because it draws on communicative practices which favour a collaborative approach in the determination of organisational direction and objectives. Drawing on the work of Jürgen Habermas, Michel Foucault and Norman Fairclough we explore how propaganda and public relations can both be understood as discourse practices utilised in efforts to legitimate or challenge social, political and/or economic power and the public interest."

Arnold Schwarzeneggers convincing victory cannot be fully explained without considering the power of his celebrity status. A survey questionnaire was posted on the Internet four days before the election. A total of 460 respondents voluntarily completed the survey, which assessed their involvement with Schwarzenegger through parasocial interaction and identification and their intention to vote for him. Research results indicate that those who were more involved with Schwarzenegger were more likely to support his candidacy. Although most of the respondents in the study were not Schwarzenegger fans and exhibited negative attitudes towards him, they still acknowledged his political influence and wanted to know more about his political beliefs. Implications of Schwarzeneggers victory for political communication are discussed."

But, it was in the early to mid 1980s--the period immediately preceding the string of purchases listed above--that Japan became a truly significant element in the American political and cultural landscape. As Japan moved from economic strength to strength, certain American discourse on Japan developed a peculiar mixture of panic and peevishness that suggested the latter's preeminence was causing more than purely economic concern. In this paper, I will examine how Japan comes to be constructed in this period (roughly from 1983 to 1990) as that which America both must and must not be, as America's past and future. I argue that this complex of desire and denigration produced an examination and re-articulation of American national identity that questioned some very basic assumptions about that identity. I am looking at two different sites where this discourses were circulated. The first site consists of popular discussions of economic and foreign policy relations between the United States and Japan in magazines like Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, and Business Week, and in contemporary books written about this issue that received widespread attention in the mainstream press. The second site consists of two mainstream Hollywood films that narrativized these tensions, Gung Ho (1986) and Black Rain (1989)."

The first section employs a contingency framework and describes the structural features of knowledge networks and communication networks in TM systems that match each task condition. The second part analyzes the effects of turnover on TM from a network perspective. The findings suggest that, contrary to previous research, turnover can be beneficial and the magnitude of turnover effects on TM varies considerably across task conditions. Moreover, the strengths of turnover effects depend on the structures of knowledge networks and communication networks as well as the position the person who leaves the system occupies in the communication network. Implications of this analysis are discussed in light of organization design."

Using a developmental approach, the study investigated age-related differences in parents use of cognitive versus non-cognitive coping strategies. Towards this end, a total of 94 parents of 5- to 12-year olds were randomly sampled from Ingham County, Michigan. Caregivers were surveyed about their childs fear responses to the news coverage as well as the comforting strategies they used. Based on developmental differences in information- processing and previous research, it was expected that parents of 5- to 8-year olds would report using more non-cognitive strategies whereas parents of 9- to 12-year olds would report using more cognitive strategies. Only partial support was found for these expectations, with parents of children of all ages relying heavily on cognitive coping strategies."

I examine TV news while describing my emotions and personal reactions as a TV news anchor and reporter. I first discuss TV news as embedded narratives or mirror texts, which enables us to understand the more encompassing narrative in which texts are embedded. I further discuss TV news as texts within texts that require emotional labor or suppression of emotion. Finally, I examine TV news as sensemaking and co-construction of meaning with both the audience and among coworkers. I also discuss the fallacy of news objectivity. The person who reports the news is often part of the story or becomes part of the story in the process and cannot separate from it. I draw on my own stories and experience as a TV news anchor to use as examples."

This study explores how roommate acquaintance, predictability, conflict style preference, post-conflict relational satisfaction, and present relational closeness are interrelated. Two hundred thirty-six students from two universities completed surveys on roommate conflict and relationship outcome. Roommate acquaintance and predictability were associated with other-oriented conflict management styles, which were in turn associated with positive relational satisfaction and present relational closeness.

By examining the dramaturgical repertoire and creative conditions of Japanese scriptwriter and novelist Nozawa Hisashi, this essay contends that the authorial and generic formation of Nozawa dramas comprised primarily of marriage stories and mystery/thrillers emerged in conjunction with the industrys most successful and ideological commodity in the 1990s: love stories. In new generic forums Nozawa problematized love as a social issue, and he actively asserted his purpose and style among his collaborators. His authorship is sustained through a synergy between marriage stories and mysteries at the narrative, socio-economic, and cultural/philosophical level. Nozawas place as a televisual author is reflexively implicated in the ways of seeing and in his alliance to the viewing communities, who are held responsible for negotiating with the social consequences of mass mediation."
2004-1021,Understanding Activist Publics,Paper,Understanding Activist Publics,"Understanding local activists

Abstract
Calls to improve communication research in the public interest to find solutions to regain the vanishing voter indicate the organizational focus that underlies much communication and public relations. Such an approach ignores the perspective of activists, those citizens who feel unrepresented by existing representative structures. As public relations researchers attempt to concentrate on the voices of activists rather than the organizations they oppose, this paper seeks to understand the reasons behind a local activism case study from the 2000 Olympics. It demonstrates the value of personal and local connections as represented in the NIMBY form of organizing to protect peoples own locality. It emphasizes that peoples local affiliation is important in an increasingly globalized world and that local activism may offer people a way to protect their lifeworlds from threats. Public relations that ignores the perspective of local activists excludes from discussion a vital part of public opinion."
2004-1022,Understanding and Facilitating Learning Through Hypermedia: A Pilot Study,Paper,Understanding and Facilitating Learning Through Hypermedia: A Pilot Study,"Along with the increasing use of online media, understanding how and what users learn from hypermedia has been emerged as new challenges for communication scholars. Despite the valuable findings contributed by prior research, several issues have remained unanswered. The present study addresses some of lingering issues. With the pilot study data, the present study argues that hypermedia can improve the structural understanding about a designated topic than non-hypermedia. More over, this discrepant gain also depends on users learning styles. At the same time, the present study introduces two structural knowledge measures, which could tap the cohesiveness and centrality of the knowledge structure."
2004-1023,Understanding Condom Use in Young Adults: Integrating Personality and Psychosocial Theoretical Approaches,Paper,Understanding Condom Use in Young Adults: Integrating Personality and Psychosocial Theoretical Approaches,"Sexually transmitted diseases continue to be a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Efforts to better understand condom use in these populations therefore remain very important. The purpose of the current study was to propose and conduct tests of a multivariate model of condom use utilizing data from 2 independent samples of young adults (total N= 1,489). The model examined the relations between personality characteristics including sexual sensation-seeking and impulsive decision-making, psychosocial variables including condom attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy, and condom use. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated adequate fit for both models (CFI= .93; AASR= .05 for both), which each explained 25 percent of the variance (R2= .25) in the dependent variable of condom use. Results indicated that those who were sexual sensation-seekers and impulsive in sexual situations tended to have more negative condom attitudes, believed that less of their friends use condoms (norms), and had lower condom self-efficacy. These psychosocial variables (more positive condom attitudes, more positive norms, and higher condom self-efficacy) were in turn found to be positively related to condom use. Results support the fusion of personality and psychosocial approaches in order to gain a broader theoretical understanding of condom use in young adults. In addition, those developing and implementing health communication campaigns may find sexual sensation-seeking and impulsivity to be fruitful variables upon which to target messages aimed at increasing safer sexual behavior."
2004-1024,Understanding Intolerance for Television Commercial: The Influences of Individual Orientation and Skepticism toward Advertising,Paper,Understanding Intolerance for Television Commercial: The Influences of Individual Orientation and Skepticism toward Advertising,"There have long been conflicts between concerns about potential harms of controversial television advertising, on one hand, and concerns about preserving the rights of advertisers to communicate with their publics, on the other. Since Farber (1979) recognized the importance of the free flow of commercial information, the Supreme Court has treated commercial speech as constitutionally valuable. The utilitarian value of commercial speech should be unquestionably acknowledged under the First Amendment. However, the First Amendments guarantee of free speech is not absolute. As Mill (1863) articulated, the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. (11). Due to potential harm to consumers, commercial speech under the First Amendment has often fallen under public scrutiny. Policy makers and the public who are concerned with the presumed harm that advertising produces has often called for regulation.
Specifically, it is argued that television advertising for alcohol and cigarettes generate problems associated with abuse or misuse of the goods such as violence, addiction, and adolescents drinking or smoking (Atkin, 1993). Consumer research theoretically based on social cognitive learning and cultivation indeed demonstrates the evidence that advertising urges actual consumption of alcohol and cigarettes (Barnes & Bourgeois, 1979; Bruce, Austin, & Fujioka, 2001; Calfee & Ringold, 1990). Another concern about advertising is the targeting of children (Treise, Weigold, Conna, Garrison, 1994). Because of the vulnerability of children, advertising is likely to have negative influences more on children than on adults (Smith & Martin, 1997). Further, there have been critiques against the sexual and violent components. A substantial body of research suggests that exposure to sexual or violent contents leads to sexual aggression, imitation of violent act, and desensitization of crime (Donnerstein & Berkowitz, 1981; Paik & Comstock). The undesirable effects of the sexual and violent contents are produced not only by advertising itself but also by shows and programs on which commercials are aired.
In spite of these concerns and studies on advertising, the harmful effects are yet clearly revealed. Research evidence indicates that television advertising accounts for only small variance in alcohol or cigarette consumption. Moreover, there has been little evidence about how much advertising-induced misuses of dangerous products increase social problems. In addition, some scholars confront the undesirable effects of the sexual or violent contents pointing out the methodological problems in media effect studies (Thompson, Chaffee, & Oshagan, 1990). Since the negative effects of advertising are unclear, the regulation of advertising cannot be disentangled clearly by legal examinations. In the context, public intolerance of advertising is important because it provides policy makers or legal scholars a guideline and a standard for decisions regarding the regulation.
Despite the public and policy debates over this issue, little research has been conducted on factors associated with opposition to or support for expressive rights of advertising. Marketing scholars have shown considerable interest in identifying consumers global attitudes toward advertising in general since they have recognized its influences on receptivity to specific advertisements (Andrews, 1989; Bush, Smith, & Martin, 1999; James & Kover, 1992; Mangleburg & Bristol, 1998; Pollay & Mittal, 1993). However, they have made little effort for specifying the relationship between consumers attitude toward advertising and tolerance judgments for advertising by focusing on conceptualizing the attitudinal sub-dimensions and exploring the sources of consumer skepticism.
Mass communication studies growing out of third-person effect hypothesis (Davison, 1983) suggest perceived media influence as a significant determinant of individuals support for censorship of advertising. Third-person effect researchers demonstrate that support for regulatory action often stems from the overestimation of media influences (Gunther, 1995; Hoffner et al. 1999; McLeod, Detenber, & Eveland, 1999; McLeod, Eveland, & Nathanson, 1997; Salwen, 1998; Shah, Faber, & Youn, 1999). Although evidence of the relationship between perceived media influences and intolerance of advertising rapidly accumulates, third-person effect research often bypasses other various orientational and attitudinal factors that seem to contribute to individuals intolerance of advertising.
Political science scholars have speculated a broad range of factors that affect public tolerance of speech (Marcus, Sullivan, Theiss-Morse, & Wood, 1995; McClosky & Brill, 1983, Sullivan, Marcus, Feldman, & Piereson, 1981). It has been theorized that variance in tolerance judgments often occur as a function of individual differences in value orientations and social attitudes. Further, the effect of the predispositions on tolerance judgments is experienced indirectly through issue- or domain-specific attitudes (Marcus et al., 1995). Although the studies on tolerance judgments have dealt with only political speech, the insights provide a useful framework for research on intolerance of advertising. Building on past studies on tolerance judgments and attitude toward advertising, this study explores orientational and attitudinal antecedents to support for expressive rights of advertising. Particularly, we investigate how individuals religiosity, traditional/family orientaion, political ideology, distrust in business, and skepticism toward commercial are related to intolerance of television advertising. Further, the mediating role of skepticism toward advertising in the relationships between orientational antecedents and the criterion variables is examined."
2004-1025,Understanding the Bias in Optimistic Bias: How Efficacy Determines Perceptions of Personal Vulnerability,Paper,Understanding the Bias in Optimistic Bias: How Efficacy Determines Perceptions of Personal Vulnerability,The bias in the extant literature on optimistic bias has been attributed to an irrational belief in ones invulnerability. This study asked whether individuals efficacy beliefs are also responsible for heightened levels of personal invulnerability. We proposed and tested our hypothesis that risk assessments depend on assessments of personal efficacy. A within-subject experiment was conducted by first categorizing six health and behavioral domains (from a total of 57) according to individuals personal efficacy to avoid the risk event. Participants then provided risk assessments for themselves and for an average person. Results lend support to the hypothesis that the bias in optimistic bias can be attributed to individuals perceptions about their efficacy to avoid risks. Although this study replicated the central argument of optimistic bias research  that we perceive our personal risk to be lower than risk to others across most domains  it also pointed to the importance of including efficacy beliefs in assessing personal risks. Implications for health campaigns are also discussed.
2004-1026,Understanding the Influence of Others: Changing Evaluation of Messages or Messages under Evaluation?,Paper,Understanding the Influence of Others: Changing Evaluation of Messages or Messages under Evaluation?,"Asch (1940) proposed that group standards change how people interpret objects under evaluation. This paper extends his intuition into a two-step model of social influence. In the first step, people interpret a given message differently with knowledge of how others interpret said message than if they did not know about anyone elses interpretation. In the second step, peoples interpretation of a message, in turn, influences how their attitudes change. These experiments test (a) if knowing how others thought a newspaper article showed a particular bias in presenting an issue affects how participants, themselves, perceive the extremity of this articles advocated position, and (b) if deviations in participants interpretation from a control group influences how they change their attitudes toward this issue. This two-step model coincides with participants reactions when they read newspaper articles opposing an issue, replicating across three message topics. A final experiment shows that the effect of this type of social influence increases when words in a newspaper article possess more ambiguity and disappears when they possess less ambiguity."
2004-1027,Understanding the 'problem': International Teaching Assistants and Communication,Paper,Understanding the 'problem': International Teaching Assistants and Communication,"American universities have grappled with policies and interventions addressing international teaching assistants (ITAs) and undergraduate education. This paper provided a meta-analytic review of published reports on how undergraduates perform with and rate ITAs English and teaching competence. Only undergraduate rating of ITAs teaching and ITAs English proficiency persisted across studies, but conclusions were tenuous, because moderators persisted between these studies. We responded with two longitudinal studies, panel and trend, to investigate methodological issues and to test an intervention aimed at changing undergraduate students perceptions of ITAs. Undergraduates only rated ITAs lower than DTAs at the semesters end. Many undergraduate students, except those in the intervention, reported progressively negative ratings of ITAs over the course of the semester, regardless of their individual experience with diversity or intercultural communication."
2004-1028,Understanding the qualities of leadership: A focus on political leadership communication,Paper,Understanding the qualities of leadership: A focus on political leadership communication,"The concept of leadership and the qualities we hope to find in our leaders remain difficult to define and quantify. Various theories suggest that leaders need to possess certain traits or abilities. Prior studies have examined what qualities leaders possess, this study takes a receiver perspective and examines the qualities that men and women look for in their political leaders. A second analysis examines the abilities necessary for women in leadership roles, again using a receiver perspective.
Both open- and closed-ended data were collected from 196 subjects between the ages of 18 and 67. Results for the initial study indicate that men are looking for credible leaders with good communication skills, integrity and leadership experience. Women are seeking honesty, good communication skills and goal-orientation. Similar but distinct results were found in defining female political leaders. An analysis with recommendations for political campaigns, a discussion of limitations and future research follow."
2004-1029,Unleashing telecommunications in a socialist market economy -- Chinas path reconciling domestic conditions and international obligations,Paper,Unleashing telecommunications in a socialist market economy -- Chinas path reconciling domestic conditions and international obligations,"In this paper, we use a framework rooted in the new institutional economics to examine the factors underlying the main trajectories of Chinas telecom reform, which constitute a unique mix of policies shaped by domestic policy goals and international obligations, most importantly those adopted in the context of Chinas accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). We show that the specific institutional context of Chinese policy-making has led to the adoption of a distinctive reform strategy, characterized by increased reliance on competition in a framework of state ownership and vague regulation. Although China is still struggling to reconcile domestic objectives and international obligations and has not yet established a transparent and stable regulatory framework, its reform model has expanded access rapidly and facilitated the introduction of innovative services. These observations illustrate the primary importance of competition and decentralized decision-making and the more secondary nature of ownership and specific regulations. Also, we examine the tensions between the goals of the international community to create a more homogenous policy framework and Chinas national constraints and policy goals. We conclude that some degree of diversity can be beneficial for China in the presence of its national constraints."
2004-1030,Unmet Expectations: Reconsidering Recruiters' Realistic and Traditional Information Sharing in Employment Screening Interviews,Paper,Unmet Expectations: Reconsidering Recruiters' Realistic and Traditional Information Sharing in Employment Screening Interviews,"Recent research suggests that realistic previews given to job candidates reduce voluntary turnover and increases their performance and job satisfaction. Yet, the extent that recruiters share realistic previews and the nature (e.g., job or organization) of those previews remains unclear. This review critiques extant theory and research concerning the patterns of sharing realistic information, the source of their job information, the timing of realistic previews, their interview training, and organizations recruiting priorities. A more complete model of the nature of recruiters information sharing behaviors is presented, and propositions are forwarded regarding the revealing of realistic job and organizational information during the employment screening interview."
2004-1031,Unpacking the Transparency of Social Class,Paper,Unpacking the Transparency of Social Class,"This paper agues that studying television, particularly the news magazine format, reveals much about the current state of class values in the U.S. Misdirected critiques have functioned in tandem with subtle textual narratives to perpetuate the misconception that class has been stripped from popular culture. However, I suggest that social class is so firmly entrenched in television programming that its complete normalization masks its presence. I utilize a textual analysis, drawing parallels between news and fictional storytelling, to unpack the transparency of class representations.
My analysis exposes two key patterns: distancing the poor from the upper-middle class and increasing the proximity of the upper-middle class to the elite. It was rare for segment narratives to explicitly reference social class, except with regard to the very poor. Such references to lower-class status functioned to imply such individuals were sociologically isolated and exceptionally rare. Upper-middle class story perspectives, characters and values predominated but were narrativized as universal to the extent that even those with elite social status could be encompassed by such broad conceptualizations. This functioned to divorce the story perspectives, characters and values from any precise association with class status or identification.
Because such articulations of social class were homogenously predominant and constructed to seem universal, their presence appeared only transparently. Nevertheless, deconstructing the stories and their discourses revealed that class issues were abundantly woven into the narratives of the news magazine segments, reproducing the mythology of Americas imperial middle while simultaneously communicating class distinctions in increasingly subtle ways."
2004-1032,"Usability, Cognition, and Affect in Web Interfaces: The Role of Informative Feedback and Descriptive Labeling",Paper,"Usability, Cognition, and Affect in Web Interfaces: The Role of Informative Feedback and Descriptive Labeling","This study investigated how following standard usability guidelines impacted participants' cognitive and affective perceptions of a website. In particular, the study focused on how participants reacted to (deliberately introduced) problems with the usability of a website. A 2x2 (descriptive labels by informative feedback) between-subjects experiment (N = 80) was designed to test the hypotheses that conforming to usability guidelines would result in not only better memory for website content and better task performance but also more positive attitudes toward the website. The results confirm the hypotheses, and provide insight into the consequences of designing for usability, and can help to guide designers struggling to navigate the tension between performance (usability) and emotional response (affect). Theoretical implications of the findings for human-computer interaction as well as technological variables such as interactivity and navigability are discussed."
2004-1033,Use of Inoculation to Foster Resistance to Predatory Credit Card Marketing Targeting College Students,Paper,Use of Inoculation to Foster Resistance to Predatory Credit Card Marketing Targeting College Students,"Student credit card debt is a growing problem. This study explores the effectiveness of the inoculation strategy to foster resistance to predatory credit card marketing targeting college students. In order to further explore the medical analogy from which the inoculation strategy is based, argument strength was varied in the inoculation treatment messages to determine whether counterargument and refutational strength impacts the effectiveness of inoculation treatments. In addition, this investigation explored whether inoculation spreads from person to person via social channels, similar to the marketing concept of viral marketing. Results indicated that conventional inoculation treatment messages successfully inoculated college students against credit card advertisements, manifested in attitude valence and in behavioral intentions."
2004-1034,User Behavior and the Impact of the Internet: A Study on Chinese Net Users in Beijing and Shanghai,Paper,User Behavior and the Impact of the Internet: A Study on Chinese Net Users in Beijing and Shanghai,"The Internet has been regarded as a revolutionary information communication technology which brings us with a global information flow and free discussion forums. As an authoritarian country which hosts the largest population in the world and spares no efforts in boosting information technology, Chinas future with the Internet has naturally become a key academic concern. More recent literature seems to stop short of the early optimistic ideas of the Internets liberalizing potential in China, and attributes the Internets failure to realize such a task to the rigorous regulation and controls of the Chinese government.This paper argues that it is necessary and valuable to rethink the political and social impact of the Internet in China from the Internet users perspective. The author combined a survey and in-depth interviews with Chinese net users of different backgrounds to uncover the underlying reasons for the usage patterns of Chinese net users. In conclusion, this paper finds that the Internet is not really a democratizing tool at China in its current stage, but it is not simply because of the control and regulations from the Chinese government. A number of cultural and social factors largely shape the usage patterns of the Chinese net users."
2004-1035,Users and manipulators: A typology of Internet usage styles,Paper,Users and manipulators: A typology of Internet usage styles,"Building on work by Turkle (1995), we propose a typology that measures user orientation towards the Internet, differentiating between Users and Manipulators. Both types are equally positive toward the Internet, however, the user approach focuses on the consumption of the technology, whereas the manipulator approach emphasizes both consumption and production of media content. A survey of college students uncovers these two dimensions of Internet use, correlating each factor with different demographic and psychological predictors. In turn, these two approaches correlate with different Internet behaviors. The results are discussed in terms of ritualized and instrumental media activity."

2004-1037,Using Folk Performances to Communicate Health Messages: A Case Study in Rural India,Paper,Using Folk Performances to Communicate Health Messages: A Case Study in Rural India,"Many countries are searching for communication methodologies that support health-related attitude and behavior change. The majority of the population in many of these countries is rural. For instance, 73 percent of Indias population lives in villages (Census of India, 2001). Although mass media has contributed to the communicative processes of Indian rural society, interpersonal and group communication still retains the central role due to the societys collective nature (Singhal et al, 2002). Village fairs and folk performances are focal points of rural life. This paper argues that folk performances are critical sites of interpersonal and group communication that can be used for effective health communication in rural areas. It analyzes the communication process that takes place during a folk performance from a theoretical perspective by drawing upon the work of Bakhtin, Delia, and Mead, among others. It exemplifies the effectiveness of folk performance to communicate health messages by discussing the folk media campaign in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) to give health messages about Family Planning (FP), Reproductive and Child Health (RCH), and HIV-AIDS jointly supported by Indian government and USAID. So far, this ongoing campaign (designed by Brij Lok Madhuri, a local non-government organization with assistance from Johns Hopkins Universitys Center for Communication Programs) has created 15 entertaining folk scripts in 6 performing traditions of Northern India, weaving together health messages related to FP and RCH. Eighty-six professional folk troupes were trained to present 8,500 performances across UP in six phases from 1999 to 2002."

In contrast to most evaluations of health communication campaigns, this study quantitatively evaluates campaign strategy before campaign implementation. Behavioral theory, or more specifically, the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction is applied to 2,731 Dutch smokers to test the validity of the campaign strategy, hypothesize about campaign effects, and validate the theory underlying the campaign as an account of the intention to quit smoking. The results validated the theoretical framework and lend support for the campaigns focus on self-efficacy, but less so for the campaigns choice to target social norms. It is suggested that campaign effectiveness may differ for smokers with varying prior experience with quit attempts."
2004-1039,Using the Past to Frame the Present: From Challenger to Columbia,Paper,Using the Past to Frame the Present: From Challenger to Columbia,"This paper argues that collective memory can structure both the search for information and the framing of news stories within the broader context of media-government relations. Following the space shuttle Columbias crash, journalists turned repeatedly to the lessons of the Challenger accident 17 years earlier. Previous research may have underestimated the power of the past to shape news because it considered only explicit references to past events in finished articles. But the past can structure information-seeking and be implicitly invoked in news. It can also provide reporters with an independent perspective, balancing elite-dominated news frames. This study examines these possibilities, presenting a richer picture of the ways that collective memory influences news reporting and the promise and pitfalls associated with this influence."
2004-1040,U.S. Regeional Newspapers' Coverage of China's Entry into the WTO --- A Regional Economy Approach,Paper,U.S. Regeional Newspapers' Coverage of China's Entry into the WTO --- A Regional Economy Approach,"Questioning a homogeneous U.S. national economy and its effect on news coverage, this study applied regional economic approach to examine factors influencing international news. It explored to what degree regional economic interests effect regional newspapers' coverage of China's WTO entry. The findings showed significant relationships between regional economic interests and key economic issues, references to gain and loss in the coverage and favorability of coverage. The findings also suggest the effect of regional economic interests on regional newspapers' coverage of international news vary according to level of interest involved in the economic events covered. In a region where difference between regional economic gain and loss was large, the regional economy had a strong effect on the coverage, while in a region where the economic gain and loss were balanced, the regional economy had a relatively weak effect on coverage."
2004-1041,"Value-based User Tendency and Usage of Wireless Internet: A Survey Analysis of Applications, Satisfaction and Use Amount",Paper,"Value-based User Tendency and Usage of Wireless Internet: A Survey Analysis of Applications, Satisfaction and Use Amount","Despite the huge interest and attention drawn to the question of values in mobile commerce, controversies still exist over the way in which they are defined and classified. We divide wireless Internet values in a twofold manner: device-specific and application-specific. While the literature states that there are three principal values of mobile devices, which are anytime, anyplace and personal values, we argue that applications of m-commerce serve two fundamental purposes: function and entertainment. As these applications are becoming more diverse and capable, one of the issues worth examining is identifying the users purposes for using them, and assessing how their use tendencies influence satisfaction and use amount.
Since little is known about the users of wireless Internet, We start by examining the demographic data of its users. Then, based on a scale measuring users tendency toward functional and entertainment utilization, we build a model that explains its effects on satisfaction and use amount. Data was collected from surveys of wireless Internet users in Korea, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to formulate and test a causal model.
Results shows that users of lower maturity level are more likely to be entertainment-oriented than those of higher maturity level, who in contrast exhibit more function-oriented use of wireless Internet. Also, the model supports the hypothesized positive effect of the users tendencies toward entertainment use to their satisfaction. On the other hand, users with higher tendencies toward functional use were more likely to connect to wireless Internet more frequently and longer in time. This paper contributes to the literature of m-commerce values and consumer satisfaction by giving a new twist on values laid out in terms of purpose and by applying them to predict satisfaction and usage. We conclude by discussing the implication of the results for wireless Internet service providers and presenting directions for future m-commerce studies."
2004-1042,Vernacular Ethics: Revitalizing the Discussion of Public Relations Ethics,Paper,Vernacular Ethics: Revitalizing the Discussion of Public Relations Ethics,"Public relations practitioners are often thrown into the fire when ethical dilemmas arise in their organizations because they are responsible for managing both the corporate communications and the moral dimensions of corporate conduct. Despite the efforts of practitioners and scholars over the past 20 years, the issue of ethics remains unresolved because the conversation has come to a halt. This paper explores attempts to apply media ethics frameworks to public relations and explains why the limitations of these approaches require scholars to reconsider how to research public relations ethics. A new method is essential because the current research methods do not capture the moral work practitioners perform in complex organizational structures. I call this new method vernacular ethics because it treats ethics as one aspect of the everyday sense-making of public relations practitioners. I argue that generating more vernacular accounts of ethical encounters will develop a fresh ethical consciousness in public relations."
2004-1043,"Veterans of Cosmic Wars: Communism, Terrorism, and Jihad",Paper,"Veterans of Cosmic Wars: Communism, Terrorism, and Jihad","This project studies the public address on both sides of the ""war on terrorism,"" offering a theoretical framework for understanding the implications of both Islamic terrorism in the modern sense and of the war against it. I examine the war from the perspective of communication; I am interested in the ways in which war is a communicative event that helps people make meaning of the world. Through a rhetorical analysis of certain key moments in this public address I tease out and elucidate some of the ways in which the rhetoric produced by national and nongovernmental leaders constrains the policy options available to them.

The analysis proceeds through a series of textual readings of important public speeches and documents. Speeches of U.S. presidents and diplomats are analyzed alongside important public documents from the Islamist world. These documents are interpreted with guidance from Mark Juergensmeyer's comparative study of violent religious terrorism. Juergensmeyer identifies a ""cosmic war"" narrative that animates such violence. I argue that the typical American political, diplomatic, and military understanding of terrorism neglects this important dramatistic dimension.

This study concludes that both the war on terrorism and the terrorist jihad collude both to maintain a specific set of political, social, and economic relations and to reiterate a narrative vision of final cataclysmic violence. This apocalyptic narrative both motivates and constrains public and national behaviors. Understanding the dramatistic dimensions of terrorism, I argue, might help those who would like to curtail it devise new strategies that resist these constraints."
2004-1044,Video Games and the ESRB: An Evaluation of Parental Beliefs about the Rating System,Paper,Video Games and the ESRB: An Evaluation of Parental Beliefs about the Rating System,"Prior research has not adequately shown how parents decide whether or not to use the Entertainment Software Rating Boards (ESRB) video game rating system, the most common means of assessing video game content in the United States. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, a survey of 145 parents in Pennsylvania and Montana was conducted to fill this gap by assessing parents knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with regard to the ESRB system. Overall, this study finds that parents were concerned about the potentially harmful effects of video games on their children. Results indicated that while some parents were unaware of ESRB system, their intentions to use the ratings increased as a result of completing the survey. Parents also expressed some skepticism about the accuracy of the ratings. Implications for the creation of message strategies designed to improve knowledge and use of the ESRB ratings are discussed, as are suggestions for restructuring media rating systems in general."
2004-1045,Videomalaise or Virtuous Circle? Media Exposure and Political Engagement in Spain.,Paper,Videomalaise or Virtuous Circle? Media Exposure and Political Engagement in Spain.,"The development of political communication as a discipline suggests some contrasting explanations around an issue that has been configured as a constant in the academic debate; the relationship between the mass media and political engagement. On one hand, we find some authors that accuse the media of narcotising the citizens, who are increasingly less participative and less interested in public affairs and are in the terms of Robert Putnam, disaffected democrats. On the other hand, some recent analyses state that the empirical evidence points out in the opposite direction.
Taking the cited framework as the main reference, this article tries to explore empirically this connection in the case of Spain."
2004-1046,Viewer Gender as a Moderator of Sex Appeal Effects---Sex Appeal as a Multidimensional Construct,Paper,Viewer Gender as a Moderator of Sex Appeal Effects---Sex Appeal as a Multidimensional Construct,"The current study tried to explore reasons for the heterogeneous findings in sex appeal research from two perspectives: message factors and audience factors.
Study 1 took the message factor perspective and identified sex appeal as a multidimensional construct. A reanalysis of existing data was conducted. A path diagram of the relationships among sexual components was developed. Study 2 took the audience factor perspective and developed a path model to map how people process sex appeals. Based on results from Study 1, sex appeal was treated as a multi-dimensional variable and manipulated along three different dimensions. It extended our understanding of sex appeal effects by including believability and reptilian emotion as possible mediators of sexiness effects to track both the rational and emotional responses of the audience. A two (high vs. low sexiness) by two (high vs. low congruity) by two (model replication) by two (product replication) repeated measure design was used. Gender was identified as the major moderator variable. In general this study supported that female viewers tended to use an all-around integrated approach when thinking about sexy ads, whereas males used a more direct and straightforward approach. As a result, sex appeals produced positive influences on attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand and purchase intention for men but negative influences for women."

We looked at these attitudes comparing Fox News dependents to those who used the other 24/7 cable channels. Even after controlling for demographics, including party affiliation, Fox News dependents matched Fox News content significantly more than those who watched other cable channels. The research is framed within cognitive consistency theory modified to consider the link between news medium and viewer."

Specifically, the study broadens the social identity gratifications approach to ethnicity by examining how African Americans selection and avoidance of television based on ethnic identity gratifications is related to their perceptions of ingroup vitality. Results from the survey reveal African Americans television selection based on social identity gratifications is positively related to vitality, while avoidance is negatively related to vitality. The role of ethic identification in the relationships is also tested. Two plausible models of television avoidance are offered. Implications and future research are also discussed."
2004-1049,Viewing behavior of children and TV guidance by parents: A comparison of parent and child reports,Paper,Viewing behavior of children and TV guidance by parents: A comparison of parent and child reports,"In this study parents as well as their children (N = 224) were surveyed about childrens television viewing behavior and television guidance provided by parents. It was investigated whether parents know how much time their child spends television viewing and which programs the child watches. Consistently, childrens viewing time was estimated lower by parents than by the children themselves. Parents showed to have knowledge of about half of the programs the child watches at home. About parental television guidance fathers as well as mothers reported to provide television guidance more frequently than children reported to receive. Parents tendency to report a greater incidence of television guidance than their children applied to all three measured types of guidance: restrictive guidance, instructive guidance, and social coviewing. Mothers, fathers as well as children reported that social coviewing was practiced most often and restrictive guidance the least."

A content analysis of 951 online videos indicated that 16.4 percent of the music videos contained violence. This paper presents an insightful analysis of how online music video audiences are at a significant risk of exposure to violent content. Based on the combined perspective of social learning modeling theory and interactive media, this study examined violent content in music videos in web sites of four leading music television networks, BET.com, Country.com, MTV.com, and VH1.com."
2004-1051,Virtual Democratic Possibilities: Creating and Sustaining Informed Opinion Through Online and Face-to-Face Deliberative Polling,Paper,Virtual Democratic Possibilities: Creating and Sustaining Informed Opinion Through Online and Face-to-Face Deliberative Polling,"This paper examines evidence from two parallel Deliberative Polls with representative national samples, one conducted face-to-face and the other conducted online. In both cases we investigate the impact of citizen deliberation on levels of knowledge and changes in opinion on foreign policy issues. Both the online and face-to-face polls had their own control groups that did not deliberate. We examine the differences in mode between online and face-to-face discussion, and their effects on opinion change and on political efficacy.
The online project is distinctive for a) overcoming the digital divide through the provision of computers to those respondents in the sample who did not have them b) overcoming the literacy divide through the provision of microphones so that the dialogue could be conducted verbally rather than through the exchange of text. c) its extension in time to cover the period both before and after the Iraq war. This extended period of deliberation allows us to examine whether it may be possible to approach effects online that are comparable to those achieved face-to-face over the intense but short period of a weekend.
We locate our results in the context of an ongoing debate in the field of public opinion. In our view, informed public opinion differs substantially from ""top of the head"" opinion in any given issue domain. Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, our results suggest that so-called ""heuristics"" do not allow ordinary (i.e. uninformed) citizens to approximate the voting and policy preferences they would adopt if they were more informed."
2004-1052,Virtual Ethnography or Ethnography of Virtuality?: Methodological Analysis of Ethnographic Research of the Internet,Paper,Virtual Ethnography or Ethnography of Virtuality?: Methodological Analysis of Ethnographic Research of the Internet,"The Internet technology has increasingly required the ways of doing research into the use, interaction, and meaning-making in relation to the technology an emergent means of communication. In the efforts, there has been a rising interest in ethnographic research of the Internet as an alternative way to the systematic or quantitative methods, which enables us to achieve the understanding of the Internet uses and practices in the context of everyday life. This paper suggests directions for, as a new area of inquiry, ethnographic research of the Internet, based on the lessons from the development of ethnography in anthropology and related disciplines, and on a review of studies into the Internet under the title of ethnography or ethnographic. It argues that the recent efforts in related disciplines to innovate ethnographic methods in terms of its epistemological assumptions and fieldwork practices give much more useful guidelines for the directions of Internet ethnography than experiential or interpretive paradigms that media studies has been limited to. Therefore, Internet ethnography should reflect on the self-reflexive phase of the development of ethnography. In addition, even though Internet ethnography has to be flexible and strategic in order not to be limited any ideals and formulas, the quality of contextuality should not be lost in any attempts to develop methods suitable to the phenomenon under scrutiny. This paper suggests that as one of the ways to achieve it we need to develop methods that can take both online and offline contexts into consideration."
2004-1053,Virtual Learning in IAV HIV-Prevention Interventions :,Paper,Virtual Learning in IAV HIV-Prevention Interventions :,"This research assesses the effectiveness of an interactive video (IAV) that places men who have sex with men in an interactive, virtual environment designed to simulate the emotional, interper-sonal, contextual, and other psychological features of an actual sexual encounter. Guided by cognitive social learning theory and related approaches, it encourages situated learning of safer sex negotiation techniques at critical points in a sexual sequence, models successful negotiations, and offers training in self-control and behavioral skills. In a longitudinal design, participants were randomly assigned to receive either an IAV intervention or not, after receiving standard post-HIV negative test peer counseling. Compared to the counseling alone, men who received the interactive video reduced risky anal sex behaviors and increased protected anal sex behaviors. The role of communication interventions that can more effectively and efficiently provide tailored health communication intervention in the public interest is discussed."
2004-1054,Virtually Working: Communicative and Structural Predictors of Media Use and Key Outcomes in Virtual Work Teams,Paper,Virtually Working: Communicative and Structural Predictors of Media Use and Key Outcomes in Virtual Work Teams,"Organizational trends toward team-based structures, globalization, and reliance upon communication technology have spurred research that examines the communication processes of virtual teams. However, much of the extant research focuses more upon the ways virtual teams differ from other team forms--most often conventional, face to face teams--and neglects the possibility that virtual teams may have distinctive configurations of organizational members, varying structural characteristics, and diverse communication needs. This paper reports the analysis of data from two separate studies of virtual organizational teams. A first study (n = 121) reveals that virtual teams vary in terms of their use of communication media and the outcomes of team communication processes (identification, cohesiveness, trust, and satisfaction). A second study (n = 98) focuses within a diverse set of virtual teams emphasizing how differences in unique teams' communication considerations and structural features explain variation in media use and communication outcomes. Findings from these studies are then discussed in relation to existing organizational and group communication literature with a focus upon identifying implications for research and organizational application."
2004-1055,Virtual Violence: Gender and Aggression in Video Game Advertisements,Paper,Virtual Violence: Gender and Aggression in Video Game Advertisements,"Video games are increasing in popularity and use, with 42 percent of households in the United States owning a video game console (Interactive Digital Software Association, 2001a, 2001b). Children and young adults are among the most frequent users (Roberts & Foehr, 2003). Yet, social scientific investigation of video game content is rare, and examination of the advertising messages used to promote the games appears to be non-existent. This study attempts to fill that gap through a quantitative content analysis of 1,054 advertisements for video games appearing in large-circulation magazines created for video game fans. The study examines the portrayal of gender and violence in the images and text of the ads, as well as the representation of race and ethnicity, the genre of the game, the rating/label, and the use of advertising appeals such as user identification. Among the key results: 55.8 percent of the games contained physical violence, an average of 2.5 weapons appeared per ad, and male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 1. The potential reception of these messages by young video game users is discussed."
2004-1056,Visibility Without Power: Women Journalists in Italy,Paper,Visibility Without Power: Women Journalists in Italy,"Over the Nineties there has been a dramatic increase of women entering the professional field of the journalism in Italy. They are now more than five thousands out of a total population of over eighteen thousands, equivalent to 28 percent. However, as the latecomers into a traditionally male job, women journalists can not skip the glass ceiling phenomenon. The paper revolves around the contradiction between high visibility and low power of women in Italian journalism at the beginning of the third millennium: focusing in particular on the self-conscious refusal to compete for power by the generation of women who entered the journalism in the late seventies, under the impact of the feminist movement."
2004-1057,Visions against Type: Myth-Making and Americanization in 2003 Israeli Labor Party Campaign Ads,Paper,Visions against Type: Myth-Making and Americanization in 2003 Israeli Labor Party Campaign Ads,"For several decades, America has attempted to export not only its particular definition of democracy to developing nations but also the style of modern televisual politics. As a result, the nature of televised commercials in election campaigns in many nations is increasingly fitting the strategies and design of U.S.-based, -trained or -inspired consultants. The current study examines ads run in the 2003 Israeli elections by the Israeli Labor Party. Findings include that the ads (a) are indistinguishable in appearance from American ads, (b) follow a particular American formula of ""visions against type,"" that is, creating counter images of candidates and parties to stereotypes held by voters and (c) obfuscate the actual issues that the embattled nation faced and still faces. We argue then that the ""Modern"" style of campaign ad hurts substantive and constructive political communication in nations wrestling with intensely substantive and complex issues."
2004-1058,"Visual Agenda-Setting after 9-11:Individuals Emotions, Image Recall and Concern with Terrorism",Paper,"Visual Agenda-Setting after 9-11:Individuals Emotions, Image Recall and Concern with Terrorism","A path analysis model was tested predicting that emotional responses to the terrorist attacks of 9-11 would influence individuals visual recall of 9-11 images. Both visual recall and individuals emotions, in turn, would influence concerns about terrorism. Based on responses from a phone survey conducted two months after the attacks, the total number of visuals recalled by individuals and the emotions of sorrow and shock fit the model better than other variables. If individuals reacted to the 9-11 attacks with sorrow or shock, they stored several images in their long-term memory, especially the emotional images of people jumping from buildings and depictions of dead bodies. In turn, the total number of images recalled and the ability to recall images of Palestinians dancing in the streets and dead bodies increased respondents level of concern with terrorism. Concern with terrorism also was influenced by the emotional reactions of respondents to 9-11."
2004-1059,"Visualizing Cultures: Expression, Participation and Reflexivity in Anthropological and Sociological Film",Paper,"Visualizing Cultures: Expression, Participation and Reflexivity in Anthropological and Sociological Film","This article offers a critical overview of the development and deployment of film in scientific endeavours of social and cultural scientists. It addresses some of the key issues involved in the use of a rich medium such as film to document, analyse and communicate about society and culture.
In the past, social and cultural scientists have taken different approaches when trying to bring into play or, as the case may be, restrain the varied means of expression that are available within this medium. While the extent to which these means should be applied is still a matter of concern, it is gradually recognised that a more expressive approach is not only unavoidable but also much more fertile if it goes hand in hand with a clear and duly communicated sense of purpose. A peculiarity of film as a tool in human behaviour research is that it can provide an opportunity for the field to 'talk back' (i.e. to respond in a very literal sense) and to become actively involved in producing and assessing visual data in various ways. The fact that film creates this opportunity is increasingly recognised and indeed it is increasingly explored in practice, as this approach often yields unique and richer data. Researchers/filmmakers, in their role as humans who are studying other humans of different cultures, need to be extremely wary of and explicit about their being 'positioned subjects' that operate within a necessarily limiting 'scopic regime' and that apply culturally moulded technologies. The growing awareness among scientific filmmakers of the far-reaching consequences of these kinds of influences on their visual products is today commonly referred to as 'reflexivity'."
2004-1060,"Vulnerable teens, vulnerable times: How sensation-seeking, alienation, and victimization moderate the violent media content-aggressiveness relation",Paper,"Vulnerable teens, vulnerable times: How sensation-seeking, alienation, and victimization moderate the violent media content-aggressiveness relation","This study explores the proposition that the relationship between use of violent media content by teens and aggression is stronger when these youth are dispositionally predisposed to be responsive to such arousing media content, or when they are, due to socialization difficulties, emotionally vulnerable to the effects of such content. Concurrent effects are modeled in four waves of data collection over two years with 2550 middle-school students from 20 schools across the U.S, using multi-level (hierarchical linear modeling) techniques, allowing for examination of variables that describe overall differences between students as well as variables that describe intraindividual differences across time. Results indicate that students who frequently engage in use of violent media content are more likely to be aggressive if they are characterized by high-sensation seeking or if they report feelings of alienation from school. While overall use of violent media is associated with higher levels of aggression, a robust within-individual effect also exists. That is, during times when a student is viewing elevated levels of violent media content relative to the student's own norms for use of such media, he or she is also more likely to demonstrate heightened levels of aggression. This relationship is more robust among students who are high-sensation seekers, students who are alienated from school, or students who are victimized by their peers. Furthermore, during times when a student is viewing more violent media than usual and is also experiencing heightened levels of sensation seeking, school alienation, or peer victimization he or she is more likely to be aggressive."
2004-1061,"War Attitudes and Interest During and Before the Iraq War: A Comparison of Broadcast, Print, and Interactive News Dependence",Paper,"War Attitudes and Interest During and Before the Iraq War: A Comparison of Broadcast, Print, and Interactive News Dependence","With two waves of online survey data collected immediately before and again 6 days into the U.S.-Iraq war in March, 2003, this study examined how peoples attitudes toward the war and their interest in it varied according to what medium they said they most relied on for war news. Results showed that television news dependency was associated with higher support and interest measures, whereas newspaper dependency led to the opposite result.. Six days into the war peoples support for the military action had increased, but their interest in war news had diminished. The exact pattern of this effect varied by media. For example, television dependency was associated with heightened interest in war events across time, while those relying on radio, newspaper and Internet reported less interest. This interaction of media dependency and time of war events furthers our understanding about the impact of different media channels by suggesting a more complex relationship particularly in times of international conflict and societal tension."
2004-1062,War in Iraq & Terrorism Frame: Critical Analysis on CNNs pre-War Coverage,Paper,War in Iraq & Terrorism Frame: Critical Analysis on CNNs pre-War Coverage,"About 20 years ago, Daniel Hallin posited that American media's news coverage on most of the warfare was predominantly framed based on the ""Cold War consensus."" This study is aimed to see whether the U.S. media's ideological practice is still at work after the 9/11 attack in the 21st century. The study analyzed CNN coverage during the pre Iraq War period in an effort to conceptualize the Terrorism Frame which has a close resemblance to the Cold War Frame suggested by Daniel Hallin. What kind of power made the U.S. citizens believe the linkage between Iraq and terrorism though the connection still remains uncorroborated yet? According to the analysis of this article, CNN exhibited three reporting patterns consistent with the American consensus formed after the 9/11 attack: straying from the direct questions (American Morning), making allusions (Showdown: Iraq), and marginalizing the anti-war voices. The qualitative research method was employed to examine the CNN's ideological practice during the pre-Iraq War period."
2004-1063,War or Peace Journalism? Asian Newspaper Coverage of Conflicts,Paper,War or Peace Journalism? Asian Newspaper Coverage of Conflicts,"This five-country study examines the extent to which four regional conflicts involving India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines are framed as war journalism or peace journalism based on Johan Galtungs classification. A content analysis of 1,338 stories from 10 newspapers suggests that, overall, the news coverage of these conflicts is dominated by a war journalism frame. The Indian and Pakistani coverage of the Kashmir issue shows the strongest war journalism framing while the coverage of the Tamil Tiger movement and the Mindanao conflict by the Sri Lankan and the Philippine newspapers reveals a more promising peace journalism framing. The three most salient indicators of peace journalism are the avoidance of demonizing language, a non-partisan approach, and a multi-party orientation. The war journalism frame is supported by a focus on the here and now, an elite orientation, and a dichotomy of good and bad."
2004-1064,War Stories: Changing Modes of Persuasion on the Homefront,Paper,War Stories: Changing Modes of Persuasion on the Homefront,"This paper examines the struggle over war and its media representations. It has not been easy for democratic governments to wage war. Over the years, elected officials and military planners have faced significant public opposition to fighting wars. Convincing the public that war is necessary and that the call to military action justifies the inevitable loss of life in its wake require persuasive and well-planned media campaigns. Ideally, democracy demands that open debate provides dissenting voices and all available policy alternatives to conflict, including political and diplomatic solutions to global issues. Indeed, once war is waged, problems including casualty figures can be an even greater deterrent to favorable public opinion, or what is referred to in wartime as homefront morale.
Information management can extend beyond the needs of national security and into the realm of opinion management. This paper examines the coverage of the United States invasion of Iraq. It seeks to understand how the reporting imbued the war with certain meanings while excluding and displacing other more disturbing or critical interpretations.
Current stories of war for homefront consumption represent a qualitative leap in the design of war persuasions, going beyond the more traditional simple binaries of good and evil. Iraq war stories diverged from the language of recognizable war propaganda adhering closely to the narrative landscapes of contemporary entertainment. They translated war into the language of exhilarating action culture and virtual reality. It becomes difficult to conceive of the realities of wars horrors within this contemporary media sensibility."
2004-1065,Watching Big Brother,Paper,Watching Big Brother,"This article is about the experience of watching Big Brother (UK, 2000). The way audiences watch and talk about this reality gameshow is significant to our understanding of the success of the series, and also its role in the development of popular factual television. Many people watched Big Brother because their friends and family were talking about it, and many people continued to watch Big Brother in order to have something to talk about with their friends and family. What people talked about is the focus of this article. In particular, I examine the topic of performance in relation to audience discussion of the series. Many viewers are critical of the performances of ordinary people in the Big Brother house, and such criticism leads to debate about the truth claims of this reality gameshow. The audience data I refer to is taken from an audience research project on television audiences and factual entertainment. The main methods used were a quantitative survey, semi-structured focus groups and in depth interviews, and the data was collected during a particular period in the development of the genre of popular factual television (2000-2001). Overall I argue that when audiences watch Big Brother they are not only watching it for entertainment, but they are also engaged in critical viewing of the attitudes and behaviour of ordinary people, and the ideas and practices of the producers of Big Brother."

The Charter is a collection of linguistic laws meant to promote the French language in Québec, and limit the development of other languages, primarily English. Since its ratification, supporters of the Charter have called it a protection of French-Canadian identity. The Charter has also come under scrutiny from Anglophones (English speakers) and Allophones (non-native English or French speakers) in Québec. The following analyzes one group of Allophones, Chinese-Canadians, in Québecs largest city, Montréal. In particular, this analysis examines how the Chinese-Canadian community in Montréal perceives their self-identity as threatened by the Charter of the French Language."
2004-1067,We Have a Hottentot History to Consider: The Black Female Sex Symbol from Josephine to Tina to Kim,Paper,We Have a Hottentot History to Consider: The Black Female Sex Symbol from Josephine to Tina to Kim,"Black womens bodies are constantly put on display for public consumption. They have been valued in the entertainment industry for various ends. With various forms of mass media, black womens bodies are daily put on display and dissected. Black women have had to deal with and fight stereotypical images and representations that continue to persist throughout the mass media. One may look to three black female sex symbols in order to evaluate how media portrayals of black women have and have not changed: Josephine Baker, Tina Turner and Kimberly Lil Kim Jones. Each of these women has had a larger degree of success than almost all women in their respective genres of entertainment. All of them acknowledge that sexuality in some form plays a major role in how they present themselves on stage. Although each woman embodies very different genres and time periods (which sometimes overlap), they all have striking similarities in the popular culture icon status: all have similar background narratives, all managed to crossover into mainstream acceptance while keeping connections with their black audiences and all embrace Eurocentric notions of beauty while playing on a black stereotype. The question becomes how do we make sense of black women who are willing participants in the exploitation of their sexuality? The answer may lie in several phenomena: institutional constraints hindering black female performers attempt to gain agency, attempts to crossover into a mainstream audience, and, to a larger extent, white male consumption of black female sexuality."
2004-1068,Western Research on Chinese Culture and Leadership,Paper,Western Research on Chinese Culture and Leadership,"The research literature in the West on Chinese leadership was reviewed. The review indicated that Western researchers looked at leadership practices in China from a cultural perspective. Three aspects of Chinese culture were captured: Confucianism, collectivism, and Chinese communist ideology. The influences and implications of these three cultural forces on Chinese leadership practices were summarized. Some general patterns on Western research on leadership practices in non-Western cultures were discussed."
2004-1069,What Does the Brain Tell Us about Processing Emotional Messages?,Paper,What Does the Brain Tell Us about Processing Emotional Messages?,"Understanding how people process emotional messages has been of interest to both communication researchers and message producers. Television and many other media are full of emotional content. Research on this topic has suggested that emotional messages receive more attention and are remembered better compared to neutral (i.e., non-emotional) messages. However, different theoretical approaches to emotion have been taken. Further, emotion as well as attention and memory, the dependent measures, have been measured in various ways including self-report methods. The limitations of using a self-report method to measure these hypothetical constructs have begun to be noticed. One of the assumptions is that people are not always aware of their emotions (thus not necessarily conscious experiences). Recent theoretical and methodological advances made in areas such as psychophysiology and cognitive neuroscience have expanded research on emotion and contributed to the existing knowledge enormously. This paper reviewed research on emotion in cognitive neuroscience to answer the questions that have been asked by many communication researchers. The studies favor the dimensional view of emotion over the categorical view, but suggest the functions of positivity and negativity activate independently rather than reciprocally. By examining the areas these emotional sites are connected to, research shows that negative and positive messages receive priorities in selection for cognitive processing than neutral messages."
2004-1070,What Does the Public Have to Say About This? Speaking Out on the War on Iraq through News and Opinion Pages,Paper,What Does the Public Have to Say About This? Speaking Out on the War on Iraq through News and Opinion Pages,"Media representation of wartime public opinion becomes pertinent to the maintenance of social order by presenting pro- and anti-war perspectives to a newspapers community. This study investigates how news and opinion pages  sites where public opinion and ideology are negotiated  represented rallies and protests about the War on Iraq in 2003. This media content is usually characterized by a protest paradigm that focuses on negative actions of protesters. The study offered up the notion of a rally paradigm serving as a counterpoint that focuses on the positive attributes of ralliers instead. Through a qualitative textual analysis from the top newspapers in Seattle, Minneapolis, and Atlanta, the study found that community character shaped news coverage as well as the letters that were published. As such, the actual news discourse did not clearly delineate the usual forms of the rally and protest paradigms."

Differentiating Opinion Leaders into Dazzlers and Experts,"In this paper we propose that the knowledge and expertise of opinion leaders (in their area of interest) has to a certain extent always been taken for granted by communication scholars. We want to investigate what opinion leaders really know and if they have the competence to influence others and to be asked for advice.
In this paper, results of a survey with 139 students will be presented to answer the above questions. In the survey, respondents ratings on the most prominent scales of opinion leadership (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955; Troldahl & van Dam, 1965; Childers, 1986; Noelle-Neumann, 1983) and their knowledge was assessed. It was found that opinion leaders can be differentiated into informed opinion leaders, who rate high on opinion leadership and know a lot in their area of interest, and dazzlers, who rate high on opinion leadership, but are ill-informed about the area of interest they claim. Also, there are silent experts, who know a lot and do not function as opinion leaders, and the inerts, belonging to a not-informed and non-opinion leading group. Future directions according to the definition of opinion leadership and its measurement will be discussed."
2004-1072,What Do We Know About Computer and Video Games?A Comprehensive Review of Literature,Paper,What Do We Know About Computer and Video Games?A Comprehensive Review of Literature,"Despite the growing popularity of computer and video games, systematic research on this phenomenon is scarce. This paper offers a comprehensive literature review on computer and video games, which covers a wide range of research traditions (from effect studies to uses and gratifications studies) and content types (from entertainment to educational games). Both negative and positive effects of entertainment and educational games are elucidated. Negative effects of playing computer and video games include aggressive affects, aggressive thoughts, aggressive behaviors, addiction, gender stereotyping, and health problems. Potential benefits of playing games, especially educational games, involve the improvements of learning motivation, retention memory, spatial skills, cognitive skills, and sociability. Existing game research guided by the uses and gratifications paradigm is also summarized, with particular focuses on the differences of gender, age, and personality. Suggestions for future research on computer and video game are outlined."
2004-1073,What Kind of Development? Whose Asian Values? A Critique of Two Theories of Press Censorship in Singapore,Paper,What Kind of Development? Whose Asian Values? A Critique of Two Theories of Press Censorship in Singapore,"Singapore has been well-known for its strict censorship against the press since the 1970s. It is done out of the authoritarian belief that the government knows better than anyone how to advance the economic, social and cultural well-being of their peoples. The press should be kept under the tight control of the government to serve public interest.
The appeal of Singapore's theories of censorship lies in the popular values it promotes. In particular, the generic values, such as patriotism, social harmony and economic growth, are upheld by authoritarian regimes and embedded in their policies, deserve special attention.
To these censorship claims, one may simply denounce them as violating international human rights norms. But criticisms offered by this paper take another path. It will be based on thorough discussion of both the conceptual issues involved as well as detailed analysis of the social situation in Singapore. In the following, two major theories of press censorship in Singapore, namely the development-oriented argument and the Asian values argument, will be presented and criticized. Each theory will be given a sympathetic understanding before it is subjected to critical scrutiny by looking into its theoretical shortcoming and empirical validity. It is hoped that a critique of these two arguments, based on considerate analysis of Singapores situation, can enhance the understanding of their fundamental weaknesses while we show our sensitivity to its cultural particularity that gives rise to these censorship claims."

This paper argues that researchers should adopt a single definition of and a single method of measuring a news frame. Specifically, this paper argues that a modified version of Entmans definition of a news frame should become the standard in framing research."
2004-1075,What's the Buzz?: How Talking Can Impact the Public and Media Agendas,Paper,What's the Buzz?: How Talking Can Impact the Public and Media Agendas,"Talking about politics and political issues has important consequences for democracies and their citizens. The spread and intensity of informal conversations may affect both the publics perceptions of issue importance and actual media coverage. Time series data, collected to take advantage of a predictable, naturally occurring external shock, were analyzed to test the impacts of talking on issue importance and media coverage. First, talking about an issue mediates and augments the effect of media coverage on issue importance, increasing the amount of variance explained in issue importance from 32 in the traditional agenda-setting model to 77 percent when talking is added. Second, talking is a mechanism through which the public manages news coverage, increasing the amount of variance explained in media coverage from 33 percent in the traditional model to 69 percent in the equations that include talking. Moreover, talking completely mediates the relationship between real world indicators and media coverage, indicating that the media react to the public buzz."
2004-1076,What You Say is Who You Are: Types of Speech in Pilot--ATC Dialogues,Paper,What You Say is Who You Are: Types of Speech in Pilot--ATC Dialogues,"Abstract
This research is a preliminary examination into the use of language in the aviation context. The focus of this work is on the institutional talk practiced by pilots and air traffic controllers (ATCs) as they execute their duties. This research finds that pilots and ATCs use different types of speech in the performance of their jobs. ATCs talk more, issue more commands, make more requests for information, and use more statements. Although aviation discourse is strictly regulated, this research found that both pilots and air traffic controllers spent a small but prevalent amount of time engaging in non-essential talk. The findings indicate that the substantial differences in pilot and ATC obligations are reflected in their talk."
2004-1077,When the 'Public Interest' is Not What Interests the Public,Paper,When the 'Public Interest' is Not What Interests the Public,"The Federal Communications Commission regularly solicits comments from individual citizens in its rule making proceedings. In its recently concluded ownership proceedings, the Commission received thousands of comments from citizens, almost unanimous in their opposition to the agencys proposals. Contrary to the stated wishes of the public, the Commission adopted rules that further deregulate media ownership in the U.S. which will result in increased media consolidation.

Commentators have suggested that effective public participation in government proceedings requires the public to provide specific and relevant information, be prepared to participate, and then participate in a timely way. This study finds that while the individual citizens commenting in this proceeding were prepared and provided relevant information, the information was not of the specific type that the Commission sought. Further, 40 percent of the comments were not considered by the Commission because they were filed outside the time frame established by the Commission."
2004-1078,When They Built the Internet and No One Came: The Failure of Videotex,Paper,When They Built the Internet and No One Came: The Failure of Videotex,"Videotex is a failed information system technology from the 1980s. It received much attention and hype, thousands of column inches, and millions of dollars in investments that turned into losses. However, the rhetoric surrounding videotex was exactly the same as the rhetoric of the Internet in the mid-1990s. Given that both inspired the same utopian visions, did videotex have the same potential as the Internet? Why, then, did videotex fail so terribly? This paper briefly explores the history of videotex, focusing mainly on American developments. It describes the utopian visions that videotex inspired, explores what systems were supposed to be like, and the often contradictory reasons that users and providers should have been involved with videotex. Overall, videotex was a very closed and centralized system, and this is why it ultimately failed, especially given the growing PC and online services market in the 1980s."
2004-1079,When will the REAL teacher get here?: Undergraduate perceptions of Graduate Teaching Assistants,Paper,When will the REAL teacher get here?: Undergraduate perceptions of Graduate Teaching Assistants,"Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) are being utilized as primary instructors in undergraduate classrooms in increasing numbers. This benefits both the GTA and the department in which she or he works. The GTA usually receives a tuition waiver, stipend, or some combination of the two while at the same time building a teaching portfolio; the department staffs classes for a reduced pay rate increasing profits and opening classes that may not have been offered. Students, the third part of what can be seen as the education triangle, also benefit from the increased number of classes and sections available each semester. The logistical perks are apparent, but what of the classroom interaction between these often untested teachers and their sometimes unwilling students? Research in teacher immediacy, credibility, and learning combined with that of participant characteristics is not applied often enough to classrooms staffed by GTAs. The purpose of this research is to explore the perceptions that undergraduate students have of their GTAs with regard to immediacy, credibility, and learning based both on the GTAs perceived characteristics and the self-reported characteristics of their undergraduate students. Research of this kind has previously been used to inform the design of Teaching Assistant programs and undergraduate training."
2004-1080,Where Have all the Ethics Gone? An Analysis of Codes of Ethics on Corporate Web Sites,Paper,Where Have all the Ethics Gone? An Analysis of Codes of Ethics on Corporate Web Sites,"Media coverage of corporate conduct and ethics has been extensive in the past two years. This study explored codes of ethics on the Web sites of 130 of the Fortune 500 companies to document corporate efforts to communicate ethical guidelines and to identify patterns in the content of codes. The findings are notable for the absence of such information.
Despite new regulations likely requiring companies to adopt conduct and ethics codes and post them on their Web sites, only 52 percent of sample companies communicated such codes on their Web sites. Fewer than half of those codes detailed compliance procedures or provided specific contact information for reporting, or asking questions about, illegal or unethical behavior. The study suggests that many of the sampled companies are doing little on their Web sites to communicate and make visible their ethical guidelines at a time when business ethics are more important than ever in the eyes of organizational stakeholders."
2004-1081,Which Change Begets Change?: Modeling Risky Behavior Change as the Result of an HIV Prevention Intervention,Paper,Which Change Begets Change?: Modeling Risky Behavior Change as the Result of an HIV Prevention Intervention,"The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA, Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) argues that interventions that change psychological mediators (e.g., intent to use condoms) will change behavior that maintains or improves health (e.g., condom use). Yet, no research to date had examined whether change in theoretical mediators actually produces targeted behavior change. To test TRA theoretical predictions, structural equation models of the TRA were specified and evaluated using measures obtained in an HIV longitudinal prevention intervention study (N = 144 women) where a significant reduction of HIV risk behavior over time had been documented. Although some of the predicted theoretical relationships were significant, predicted mediators accounted for no more than 4 percent of the variance in changes in health-maintaining behavior. These results suggests that other factors need to be considered in the theory and thus in interventions. Implications and limitations of the findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are considered."
2004-1082,Which News Sources Were Used To Picture the 9/11 Attacks and the Afghan War,Paper,Which News Sources Were Used To Picture the 9/11 Attacks and the Afghan War,"This study examines news sources used to visually portray the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan in the English newspaper, The International Herald Tribune of Paris (IHT) and the Arabic newspaper Al-Hayat. Differences were noted in news sources of images depicting the September 11 attacks and the Afghan war. However, despite these differences, the vast majority of photographs were from the main Western news agencies: AP, AFP and Reuters. Results overall then suggest, while there is no indication of changes in patterns of information flow, Western news agencies can yet provide a variety of news to be framed differently by different media."
2004-1083,Whither the Global Citizen?: Implications of the Network Society and the Consumer-Citizen,Paper,Whither the Global Citizen?: Implications of the Network Society and the Consumer-Citizen,"What defines the new global citizen? While it has certainly been argued that something akin to a global citizenship exists today, especially in arguments based on participation in an emergent global civil society (Falk; Deibert), it is difficult to argue that something as formally integrated into the notion of the nation-state truly exists. This is not to say that the experience of something like citizenship, or some form of cultural or political belonging and practice, cannot exist outside the nation-state. The same discursive practices, cultural education, and ideological factors that construct citizenship as a political identity may also affect forms of identity that transcend the nation-state as the primary source of identification. This paper draws upon Castells depiction of the network society and Canclinis theorization of citizenship-as-consumption to elaborate what alternative solidarities outside the tight connection between the nation and the individual might look like under conditions of globalization."
2004-1084,Who Broke Up These Two Families?: Transnational Coverage of a Japanese Abductee and American Husband,Paper,Who Broke Up These Two Families?: Transnational Coverage of a Japanese Abductee and American Husband,"Based on a content analysis of 90 news reports, this comparative study explores media coverage of the continuing story of Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman kidnapped by North Korean agents to train spies. In North Korea, Soga married Charles Jenkins, a former U.S. soldier listed as a deserter. Soga has returned to Japan, but Jenkins and the couples two daughters remain in North Korea. The study finds no significant differences in portrayals of Soga but interesting differences between Japanese and non-Japanese media in portrayals of Jenkins. Overall, Japanese reports were more cautious in examining Jenkins background. The paper suggests that this caution reflects the location, or setting, of this international story and the Japanese journalists conformance with national interests."

Participants completed questionnaires in which they responded to several open-ended questions concerning nagging. Seven categories of characteristics were derived from the data and politeness theory was used to explain the results."
2004-1087,Why are there so Few Female Heads-of-State and What Can Communication Scholars Do about It?,Paper,Why are there so Few Female Heads-of-State and What Can Communication Scholars Do about It?,"Within this paper, I discuss a number of reasons as to why there is a lack of women in head-of-state positions around the world. These reasons include the socialization process, domestic responsibilities, silencing and muting, prejudice and discrimination, myths about the lack of credentials and qualifications, and having limited access to campaign money. In the second half of this paper, I discuss a variety of options that communication scholars have to facilitate the advancement of women in politics. These options come in the form of research, classroom education, and service learning. Additionally, I discuss how using creativity and moving beyond what has been done is an essential step. I provide questions throughout this paper that are intended to facilitate critical thinking and options for change in the minds of scholars, students, and the community. It is my hope that this essay sparks interest and ideas in the minds communication scholars from around the world about the issue of the lack of women in politics and especially the lack of women in head-of-state positions."
2004-1088,Why Dont You Love Me As Much As I Love You?: Unrequited Love and Construction of Korean Diaspora in the United States,Paper,Why Dont You Love Me As Much As I Love You?: Unrequited Love and Construction of Korean Diaspora in the United States,"When does a transnational community become a diaspora and why? This paper attempts to answer these questions by exploring the social constructed aspect of diaspora with a case study of Korean diaspora in the United States. The phenomenon of Korean diaspora encompasses a set of cultural, social and post-colonial relations between Korea and the United States for the past 100 years, as well as the internal racial relations and power structure within the United States. The unequal relationship between Korea and the United States has not only formed the motivational factors that promote Korean immigration to the United States, but also influenced the ways in which Korean immigrants experience America and position themselves in the United States. The racial hierarchy in the United States fosters a critical preconditional context in which Korean Americans maintain or seek out their ethnic identity and culture. The key argument in this paper is that Korean Americans retention or revival of diasporic identity is not so much a consequence of Koreans Americans inherent desire to maintain their ethnic heritage but rather an inevitable phenomenon in white-privileged society that marginalizes non-whites from mainstream social scenes."
2004-1089,Why Partisans See Mass Media as Biased,Paper,Why Partisans See Mass Media as Biased,"Partisan groups, often highly important in public discourse and the democratic process, appear to see mass media content as biased against their own point of view. While this hostile media effect has been well documented in recent research, little is understood about the mechanisms that might explain it. Three processes have been proposed: (1) selective recall, in which partisans perceive different content, (2) selective categorization, in which they evaluate the same content differently and (3) different standards, in which information favoring the other side is seen as invalid. Using innovative field-experiment tests with groups of partisans who either supported (n= 87)or opposed (n=64) the use of genetically modified food, this field experiment found evidence of both categorization and different standards generally. However, only selective categorization appeared to explain the hostile media effect."
2004-1090,Why students communicate with their instructors: A multi-study,Paper,Why students communicate with their instructors: A multi-study,"Two studies were conducted for the dual purpose of validating a shortened version of the Frymier, Shulman, and Houser (1996) Learner Empowerment Scale (LES) as a measure of student interest and to test its relationship to student motives. Results of study one showed no difference between the psychometric qualities of the shortened interest measure and the longer version. This would indicate that the 18-item shortened version of the Frymier et al. (1996) LES is as reliable and valid as the longer version. Additionally, study two found that more interested students communicate with their professors for relational and participatory purposes."
2004-1091,Why We Should be Concerned About Online Interaction: An evaluation of research on uses and consequences of the Internet,Paper,Why We Should be Concerned About Online Interaction: An evaluation of research on uses and consequences of the Internet,"Increasingly, people are connecting to the Internet from their homes, workplaces, and schools in order to interact with others. Many researchers have dealt with the issues of online social interaction. By reviewing key trends of research on the Internet in terms of uses and consequences, this paper discusses some common debates of the Internet use in terms of the following questions: Does the Internet foster socialization or isolation? Does the Internet displace or supplement other existing media? What are the positive and negative effects of the Internet? Finally, this paper addresses the limitations of interpretation of findings of the previous studies and suggests directions for future research for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of Internet use."
2004-1092,Women-Owned Sex Stores and the Business of Social Change: 'It Costs a lot of Money to Change the World',Paper,Women-Owned Sex Stores and the Business of Social Change: 'It Costs a lot of Money to Change the World',"Since the early 1970s, a handful of feminist entrepreneurs in the U.S. have opened sex toy stores specifically geared toward the female sexual consumer. While consumer capitalism has proven to be a productive stage for advancing a public politics of sexuality and social change, these businesses have also struggled to balance their feminist commitments with a desire for profitability and growth in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This paper, then, explores one of the key tensions that shape the commercial reality of women-owned sex toy stores in the U.S.: The uneasy alliance between profitability and social change. To explore how storeowners negotiate the friction between money and their missions, I draw upon extensive ethnographic research conducted at women-owned sex toy stores in five different American cities, including over fifty in-depth interviews with sex storeowners, staff, and customers, and post-structuralist approaches to the study of gender, sexuality, communication, and cultural production."
2004-1093,Womens and Mens Eating Behavior Following Exposure to Ideal-Body Images and Text,Paper,Womens and Mens Eating Behavior Following Exposure to Ideal-Body Images and Text,"Two experiments were conducted to measure the effects of exposure to ideal-body images and text on eating behavior among college students. Women viewed slides of slender female models with no text; with text explaining how to attain the depicted body type (congruent); with irrelevant (incongruent) text; or no slides. Analogously, men viewed slides of muscular male models with no text, with congruent text, with incongruent text, or no slides. The dependent measure was eating behavior in the presence of same-sex peers. Among women with a discrepancy between their actual body type and the body type they believe their same-sex peers expect them to have, exposure to images alone and images plus congruent text led to a reduction in the amount eaten. Among men with the same type of discrepancy, exposure to images alone and images plus congruent text led to an increase in the amount eaten. The distinctions between images and text as stimuli and between male and female eating behaviors as self-presentational strategies are considered in the discussion."
2004-1094,"World leaders as movie characters. Perceptions of Bush, Blair, Bin Laden, and Hussein.",Paper,"World leaders as movie characters. Perceptions of Bush, Blair, Bin Laden, and Hussein.","The present study tested the validity of a theoretical model on engaging real persons mediated through screens, i.e. mediated persons, initially developed to explain mechanisms in engaging fictional characters: Perceiving and Experiencing Fictional Characters (the PEFiC-model ***). However, mediated persons might be conceptualized as fictional characters, even if represented as real or reporting on real issues (e.g., a newscaster). In the present study (N=401), stimuli were the world leaders Bush, Blair, Bin Laden, and Hussein at the eve of Gulf War II. The results demonstrated an even better fit of the PEFiC-model to the data of the real persons. Furthermore, comparable results were found as for the movie characters. Again, the trade-off between involvement and distance explained the appreciation of a mediated person better than either involvement or distance alone. Moreover, the world leaders were perceived equally realistic and less relevant than Hollywoods protagonists. Finally, the results before and after Gulf War II were compared. The discussion will focus on theoretical and methodological implications for perceived realism of mediated people."
2004-1095,World system and its agents: An analysis of the registrants of Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA),Paper,World system and its agents: An analysis of the registrants of Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA),"The research analyzed the registrants of the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), the U.S. law that governs public relations representing international clienteles, to see the changing patterns of the section of public relations industry and how status of nations in the world system correlates to their potential to conduct public relations in the United States. It is found that semi-periphery countries are more likely to hire U.S. public relations firms, followed by the core nations and the periphery nations, and the registrants are engaged in more than cultivating images and building policy agendas. Moreover, the overall numbers of firms and clienteles have decreased in the past years, possibly due to technologic and economic impacts."

This study seeks to explore these concerns by examining discourses that focus on an event in which a state/corporate line is challenged by organized protest, in order to understand how episodes of dissent are handled by the media. The event chosen for this study was the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Washington."

We both utilize and challenge common intercultural training and narrative methods, specifically critical incidents and narrative co-creation. In so doing, we critically reflect on our own practices, questioning the separation between host and guest cultures as parts of relationships. We also offer suggestions for combining these methods in an effort to move toward a more holistic approach to studying intercultural relationships."
2004-1098,Young and Healthy: Effects of TV Brand Placements on Brand Image,Paper,Young and Healthy: Effects of TV Brand Placements on Brand Image,"This study focuses on the effects of exposure on recall, recognition and brand image of brands placed within a television program. A web-based survey (N = 655) showed that repetitive confrontation with brand placement within a certain context (the program) was not related to recall or recognition but did change brand images in the direction of the context. As the exposure frequency increased, the brand image became more in agreement with the image of the program: healthy, fit, energetic and expert. These effects also held when controlled for age, education, gender, product use and attitude toward brand placement. These findings support the applicability of conditioning and learning theory to brand placement and show that brand placement is not only effective in generating recall, recognition and attitude change, as we know from previous studies, but also affects the brand itself. Brand placement seems to be an effective marketing tool for influencing brand images."
2004-1099,"""You Stupid, Lazy Kid"": Perceptions of Verbal Aggressiveness in Older Adults",Paper,"""You Stupid, Lazy Kid"": Perceptions of Verbal Aggressiveness in Older Adults","ABSTRACT

Young adults stereotypes of older adults has been well-documented in
communication literature, however, there has been a lack of research on the impact of message strategy on intergenerational interactions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among three factors that previous research suggests should influence the activation of stereotypes toward a target: age, relational level, and message strategy. This study examines the role that message strategy, in this case, verbal aggressiveness, plays in activating young adults (n = 186) negative stereotypes of older adults. The young adults self-reported levels of trait verbal aggressiveness was positively correlated with negative stereotype activation. Verbally aggressive messages, also, consistently activated more negative stereotypes than did the corresponding neutral message strategy. Although all three factors (age, relational level, and message strategy) accounted for differences in stereotype activation, message strategy had the largest effect on negative stereotype activation. Implications of the findings on intergenerational interactions are discussed."
