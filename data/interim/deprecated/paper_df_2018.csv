2018-0000,2018,Paper Session,#BlackLivesMatter and #AliveWhileBlack: A Study of Topical Orientation of Hashtags and Message Content,3,"This study examines content differences between Twitter hashtags that indicate different topical orientations related to issues of racial discrimination, police violence, and structural inequalities. Two datasets representing #BlackLivesMatter and #AliveWhileBlack were examined to explore how message content varies based on topical orientation. A random sample of 600 tweets from each hashtag were classified based on content categories identified in previous scholarly work on collective coping and social movements. Two topic models were developed to further examine content differences between the two hashtags in a larger corpus of tweets. Results show that differences in hashtags can indicate significant differences in the nature of messages embedded in tweets. A χ2 test revealed that distribution of tweets was differed between the two hashtags in six out of eight categories. Topic model analysis indicated that topics in the hashtag with activist/social movement orientation mainly related to issues/incidents that gained significant media attention.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-0001,2018,Paper Session,The Voices of #MeToo: From Grassroots Activism to a Viral Roar,1,"Following the avalanche of sexual harassment and assault allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, a social awareness and activism project emerged as women and men took to Twitter to add their voices to the growing roar of the #MeToo movement. Twitter became a megaphone for public outcry as women and men, public and private citizens alike responded to the tweet, with responses varying from detailed stories of their experiences to that simple message of “Me Too.” With the attention gathered by the viral movement, it was soon noted that black female activist Tarana Burke actually created an original “Me Too” movement a decade prior to actress Alyssa Milano’s call. This created a compelling new conversation that recalled earlier issues of feminist whitewashing that ignored or diminished issues specific to women of color. This study uses Patricia Hill Collins’ foundational work Black Feminist Thought as well as Kimberle Crenshaw’s concept of intersectionality to explore the power of #MeToo from its genesis to its current viral moment. Applying these ideas to the voices of #MeToo illustrates the intersectional nature of the movement and a legacy of Black women’s activism that gave voice to silenced communities.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-0002,2018,Paper Session,"Voice, Domestic Violence, and Digital Activism: Examining Contradictions in Hashtag Feminism",3,"Scholars have argued that the internet can provide ‘space’ for voices that have traditionally been excluded, ignored, or erased. Such online spaces are claimed to be “fertile ground” for feminist activism, which can be seen in the recent emergence of “hashtag feminism,” or the use of social media hashtags to address feminist-identified issues through sharing personal experiences of inequality, constructing counter-discourses, and critiquing popular culture figures and institutions. However, little empirical research examines hashtag feminism and how it might create a space for feminist activism. Through a qualitative case study combining a thematic analysis of 51,577 archived tweets with semi-structured interviews, we explore how the hashtag #WhyIStayed creates a space for feminist activism. More specifically, we apply a postfeminist analytical lens to interrogate the contradictions and complexities of feminist hashtags and contribute to academic and practitioner understandings of hashtags as a site for feminist activism.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-0003,2018,Paper Session,Women’s Voices in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere,3,"This study examines the online communicative dynamics between women and men during the Saudi women’s rights campaign to end male guardianship (#EndMaleGuardianship), which unfolded on Twitter. We analysed 2.7 million tweets over a seven-month period quantitatively and 150,245 of these qualitatively to examine the extent to which Twitter shapes and facilitates cross-gender communication, and how this helped engender new spaces for expression of dissent. Our study shows that Twitter provided shared online communicative spaces that had several characteristics commonly associated with public sphere(s). There is also evidence that using these alternatives spaces, women transcended to an extent the gender segregation that exists in traditional public discourses and spaces of Saudi society. The anonymity of Twitter offered women a safe place to deliberate their concerns about male guardianship. We suggest that these deliberations created a counter public sphere of sorts, which helped Saudi women legitimise the #EndMaleGuardianship campaign.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-0004,2018,Paper Session,The Mediated Life of Social Movements: The Case of the Women’s March,1,"The emergence of social media gave social movements a new, powerful tool that has proven helpful in self-organization, mobilization and gathering publicity. The Women’s March is a recent example of a social movement which gained world-wide recognition via social media. In this paper, I examine three sets of tweets corresponding with three consecutive phases of the Women’s March. I analyze how patterns of use of Twitter’s technological affordances – in particular hashtags and pictures – change over time, and how these changes correspond with the New Social Movement Theory and theory of collective identity formation put forward by Polletta and Jasper (2001). I likewise analyze the attitudes toward the movement throughout time, as expressed in the sample of tweets. The findings show that the patterns of social media usage closely correspond with the theory of social movements, which suggests promising grounds for furthering online social movement research.",Hashtag Activism,"Activism, Communication & Social Justice"
2018-0005,2018,Paper Session,"Coming ""Home"" to do Global Engaged Scholarship? A Reflexive Account of Organizational Research Across Geographical, Organizational, and Methodological Boundaries",1,"This paper focuses on how my status as an international academic wanting to maintain “local” research relationships in my country of origin both improved and derailed the process of conducting an organizational ethnography. Specifically, it shows how glocal engaged scholarship generated organizational and occupational commitments pulled me as a researcher and the research project in competing directions. In this case, my academic “home” influenced my preferred projects and methodologies, while organizational needs and desires sometimes pulled me “away.” By documenting the multiple ways of being ""home"" and ""away,"" this paper nuances how engaged organizational communication scholars manage ""insider/outsider"" research, since organizational status is dynamic and emergent, as their commitments evolve. In an era of unprecedented academic mobility and the promotion of boundaryless careers, it also provides an empirical example of the challenges involved in crossing the geographic, organizational, and professional boundaries that accompany any glocal engaged scholarship project.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication
2018-0006,2018,Paper Session,Between Media Studies and Organizational Communication: Organizing as the Creation of Organs,2,"In this paper, we propose to examine the notion of medium, which will be compared with another term that, in our opinion, hold a family resemblance, that is, the one of organ. As we will show, these terms should, in fact, be understood relationally, that is, they should always be used to refer to something or even someone that is positioned or positions itself/himself/herself as the means by which something or someone else do something. While both terms—media and organs—tend to be neglected in the organizational communication literature, we believe their heuristic power is worth being examined to understand key aspects of organizing. Having established this point, we then explore how various beings can articulate themselves (in both senses of the word: enunciating and assembling) so that they become the media/organs of one another, and that the ensuing collective action becomes, to a certain degree, that of a collective body. Getting organized or organizing ourselves thus means becoming, partially and temporarily, the medium/organ of a collective action that will materialize and express itself through our contributions.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication
2018-0007,2018,Paper Session,Communicating Resilience in Actual and Imagined Boundaries: Narrative Plots and Meanings of Retention in Organizations,1,"The paper examines the narratives of STEM career pathways of women scientists and engineers through the theoretical lens of resilience to examine their retention practices in organizations. The study is based on qualitative interviews with 42 women scientists and engineers who are currently employed in organizations. Using thematic narrative analysis, the answer to the question, how do women craft stories of resilience when negotiating STEM career pathways, was explored. The three important themes of the study were 1) crafting stories about rebounding from long term career breaks, 2) narratives of short term resiliencies in career pathways and 3) anticipation as a narrative device. The findings suggest that women in STEM careers construct their sustenance in organizations though storytelling and shared meaning making of their present and past challenging experiences with respect to their careers. In addition, some of their stories are anticipatory in nature without having gone through the event in reality. Implications for retention in organizations and policy changes are discussed.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication
2018-0008,2018,Paper Session,The Human Cost of Mindfulness: Toward a More Nuanced Understanding of HRO Theory,3,"Research into HRO theory has nearly always presented the principles of HRO theory in a positive way. This overly positive portrayal of the benefits of HRO theory present a skewed perspective that favors implementation of these principles without fully understanding the human costs to HRO members associated with operating under the intense conditions called for by HRO theory. This paper is a first step toward understanding the costs associated with implementing HRO theory. Our findings suggest that HRO members experience mental and emotional strain due to their membership. Constant comparative analysis identified five ways that this mental and emotional strain is present: paranoia, cost/benefit analyses of performing work tasks, mental fatigue, jadedness, and non-work relationship deterioration. These results indicate that, contrary to calls from HRO researchers for all organizations to implement these principles, caution and mindfulness is required by organizational leaders when adopting these principles.","Pushing Boundaries in Organizational Communication: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological and Beyond",Organizational Communication

2018-0010,2018,Paper Session,You’re a Bad Person! When Moral Violations Lead to Unfriending Behavior on Social Media,3,"People’s unfriending behavior on social networking sites (SNS) is becoming increasingly relevant because the dissolution of digital connections has consequences not only on an interpersonal but also on a political level. If users tend to unfriend people when encountering political disagreements, there is a risk that their networks becomes ideologically homogenous, which – in the long run – could lead to the formation of echo chambers. To address the complexity of political disagreements and its interpersonal consequences, the present study argues that – in many cases – political disagreements are rooted in moral disagreements, manifesting themselves in (subjectively perceived) discrepancies of the fundamental moral domains. A survey study (N = 721) offers preliminary findings on how violations in different moral domains lead SNS users to judge and unfriend someone from their online network.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0011,2018,Paper Session,Invasive or Persuasive?: How Frequency of Brand Mentioning in Native Ads Influences Brand Attitudes,3,"Native Advertising is widely regarded as effective competitor to ad avoidance strategies in online marketing contexts, such as banner-blindness or ad-blocker usage; yet, there are ethical objections considering to some extent questionable disclosure practices, which may lead to consumer deception. The present research demonstrates the crucial role of persuasion knowledge and reactance in the developing process of brand attitudes, thus offering both theoretical and practical implications for further handling of native advertising practices. It appears that a shift of attitudes due to a variation of message type or brand presence depends on the activation of persuasion knowledge – and consecutively a sense of reactance. The most surprising finding is that making participants aware of the message source (i.e. by disclosing an article as sponsored and even giving an additional notice about the message type) does not automatically lead to negative brand evaluations. Further evidence on implicit attitudes, as well as possible explanations for difficulties concerning model formation are to be discussed at the conference.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0012,2018,Paper Session,Effects of Behavioral Inhibition/Approach Systems and Framing: Their Interaction With a Goal-Congruent Topic,2,"An experiment examined an interaction effect between behavioral inhibition/approach systems (BIS/BAS) and message framing on cognition, emotion, and persuasion. A persuasive message was designed to stimulate a goal congruent perception. The results show that in the goal congruence domain, BAS was more potent in persuading people. The persuasion process analysis through structural equation modeling indicates that, consistent with previous research, gain framing was more effective. Interestingly, the loss frame was not evaluated negatively, but less positively than the gain frame, which showed the constraining influence of message topic domain, rather than message framing variation.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems

Rooted in self-determination theory, Attachment style (measured at baseline) and financial stress (experimentally manipulated)were posited to predict smoker's reactance towards an a message promoting using support groups to quit. We tested moderated mediation model wherein attachment style interacted with the effect of our financial stress manipulation to moderate changes to self-reported financial stress, leading to greater reactance to the message. Implications for reactacne as a compensatory process are discussed within.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0014,2018,Paper Session,Privacy Concerns in Context: Testing the Effect of Domains Alone,2,"This paper explores the influence of contextual domains on privacy concerns of individuals
combined with the effects on intention to disclose personal information in exchange for a tangible reward.
The APCO macro model introduced by Smith et al (2011) is applied, and the identified antecedents to
privacy concerns in preceding studies are; trust beliefs, previous privacy invasion, perceived privacy
control and privacy risks. This paper considers perceived regulatory protection as well. The research
model accounts for the effect of contextual domains (finance, health, and e-commerce) on the antecedents
to privacy concerns. Participants were recruited from the Netherlands and the United States to enhance
the generalizability of results. In comparison to the e-commerce domain, the finance domain influences
trust beliefs negatively. The health domain positively affects the perceived regulatory protection
compared to the e-commerce domain. The results revealed an effect of contextual influence on the
antecedents to privacy concerns.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0015,2018,Paper Session,News Media Literacy and Incivility: How Do They Predict News Story Credibility?,2,"Online commenting is a popular tool that allows readers to contribute to journalism. Research suggests, however, that negative and uncivil comments can influence how a reader perceives the story and potentially increase a reader’s perception of the bias of the story. More research is needed, though, that examines individual differences and whether these influences of negative and uncivil comments are unique to specific types of readers. This study will use news media literacy to consider whether certain readers are more adept at differentiating commenter and journalistic content. This experiment will test how uncivil comments and the individual’s news media literacy level affect the perceived credibility of the news story and how both variables affect the difference between perceived news story credibility and comment credibility (source credibility effects). Further, the study will consider whether incivility or news media literacy are better at predicting news story credibility and source credibility effects.",HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0016,2018,Paper Session,The Influence of Opinion Congruence and Incivility on Visual Attention to Online Comments: An Eye-Tracking Study,1,This study examines how uncivil language from online comments and the opinion congruence between audience and commenter affect cognitive resources allocated to the comments with an eye-tracking study. The proposed study explores two research questions: 1) whether people would selectively attend (greater resource allocation) to online comments that are consistent with their own view? 2) whether incivility would facilitate or undermine the selective attention to process online comments? A 2 (belief-congruent vs. belief-incongruent) X 2 (incivility vs. civility) within subject design experiment will be conducted to answer the research questions.,HIGH-DENSITY: Exploring Production of and Response to Controversial Content,Information Systems
2018-0017,2018,Paper Session,"""But How Are They Talked About?"": A Novel Measure of Entity Framing in Online News",4,"In this paper, we introduce a novel method for analyzing entity framing in a large corpus of online news articles. This measure is proposed as a solution to the heretofore intractable problem of large-scale analysis of framing for particular entities within corpora too large to be reliably hand-coded and for which no document selection procedures have been devised. In this method, a semantic network is constructed from preprocessed text wherein nodes represent individual words/n-grams, and edge weights represent cosine distance between words or n-grams in high-dimensional vector space. A random walk with restart (RWR) is initiated across the graph from the node of interest, creating a list of words associated with the node which can then be analyzed using a variety of computational or manual coding techniques. We demonstrate that this method serves as a helpful tool for the analysis of latent frames for both media researchers and journalists.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0018,2018,Paper Session,"Churnalism, Press Releases and Wire Copy: Detecting Textual Reuse in Large News Corpora",1,"This paper introduces a method for detecting shared text between different news articles, at large scale. It evaluates and validates the effectiveness of the method with two different parameter choices, featuring different sensitivity and specificity.

We present the results of applying the methods to a new corpus of 313,450 news articles showing the extent of textual overlap using both the more and less sensitive approaches evaluated. Despite our expectations from qualitative studies of journalists’ working practices, we find little evidence of the large-scale recycling of press releases, or copy from competing news sources. We detect heavy use of wire copy, but find the large majority of it to be directly attributed.

We explore the causes of textual reuse in the corpus, differentiating several distinct sources of overlap.

We conclude the method is robust and valid, and that both of the two variants tested are suitable for handling different research questions.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0019,2018,Paper Session,Fracking Frames: Automatic Detection of Lines of Controversy in the Energy Domain,2,A method to automatically retrieve frames in controversies using argument mining is proposed and applied to the controversy over fracking within the broader concerns over energy. Insights from argumentation theory are integrated with current computational text analysis capabilities to develop a method for argument mining sensitive to the detection of framing used in controversies.

2018-0020,2018,Paper Session,How News Organizations Paraphrase Their Stories on Social Media? Word Counting and Binomial Regression Approach,1,"This study aims to investigate news organizations’ one potential social media strategy – paraphrasing news. Computational data collection and text analysis techniques in this study allow for a large-scale comparison between social media posts embedded with a link to a news story and the original news stories. To test whether news organizations sentimentalize news on Twitter, I compare valence of news and tweets embedding a link to the original news story. Also, I measured the conditional probability that a word appears on a tweet given that it also appeared on the original news story. I categorized news organizations using a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the measured paraphrasing strategies. Finally, I suggested a model-based approach that extends the conditional probability measure, which allows for rigorous statistical tests. These analyses are expected to reveal how news organizations frame news on Twitter relative to frames in news stories.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0021,2018,Paper Session,Is Trump Angrier in Liberal Media? Surface Visual Bias in Media Coverage of Presidential Candidates With Emotion Detection Technique,1,"Emotional display of political leaders can significantly shape voters’ evaluations of them. This study retrieved 14,955 photographs from seven news websites that ranged across the ideological spectrum (Slate, the New York Times, the Huffington Post, CNN, USA Today, Fox News, TheBlaze), and identified the emotions in 2,973 and 2,764 faces that belonged to the two candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, respectively. The results demonstrated that while Clinton displayed more happiness, Trump expressed more emotions like anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise in media coverage. In addition, this pattern was more salient in liberal media outlets than in conservative media outlets. This study provides a pioneering look at the emotional display of the two candidates across media outlets and demonstrates the potential of using computational tools to analyze visual data on a large scale.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0022,2018,Paper Session,Social media Gatekeeping: An Analysis of the Gatekeeping Influence of Newspapers' Public Facebook Pages,2,"Due to the rising importance of social media platforms for news diffusion, newspapers are relying on social media editors to promote the distribution of their news items on these platforms. In this study, we investigate how much of an impact these social media editors really have, focusing on the impact of newspapers' public pages on Facebook. Since the actions of individual users are not visible on many platforms due to privacy consideration, we propose a method that leverages time series of aggregated scores for total user engagement, which are available for various platforms. We use this method to study and compare the influence of Facebook pages for six newspapers from the UK, the Netherlands and Flanders, for all news items published over two weeks in 2017.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0023,2018,Paper Session,The Good and Bad in Economic News: Comparing (Automatic) Measurements of Sentiment in Dutch Economic News,3,"Scholars have repeatedly investigated the tone of economic news coverage over the course of many years or even decades. Because such studies, ideally, analyze more news items than feasibly is done with a manual content analysis, automatic measurements of tone have become increasingly popular and several classifiers have been developed and applied. However, similarities and differences between such automated sentiment classifiers in news items remain largely unknown, especially in smaller languages as Dutch. The current study compares four of such tools (SentiStrength, Pattern, Polyglot, DANEW) with a manual analysis of tone and a simple classifier (based on only 65 words). Results demonstrate that Polyglot and the simple classifier yield tone scores that are most comparable with manual coding. Remarkably, the different automatic classifiers only correlate very weakly among themselves. Overall, automatic sentiments measures are slightly better in capturing the tone of news headlines than that of complete articles.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0024,2018,Paper Session,Understanding News Stories by Clustering Articles: An Information Retrieval Approach,2,"We present a new method for identifying linked news stories from within a large number of articles, using Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to identify the textual closeness between pairs of articles and a network approach using Infomap to subsequently optimize the partition of the group into distinct stories. We distinguish IR approaches from other popular approaches to quantitative analysis of text, including dictionary, supervised and automated clustering methods. We argue for the value of Information Retrieval approaches as a means of quantitatively analysing textual data, particularly when trying to identify small amounts of relevant text within a very large corpus. This paper serves as a demonstration of how a real-world research question can benefit from the application of information retrieval techniques, as well as a substantive contribution to computational research projects with a unit of analysis at story rather than article level.",News Analysis Using Computational Methods,Computational Methods
2018-0025,2018,Paper Session,Media Trust in the Internet Context: A Comparative Study in 34 Countries,2,"The rise of the Internet brings up a debate about its role in eroding or strengthening trust in media. Taking the perspective of media ecology, this paper saw the Internet as a context and explored its impacts on social context in which media trust is formed. Using the data from the World Values Survey, this paper carried out multilevel analyses with 48,546 respondents in 34 countries. The results illustrate three paradoxical impacts. First, the Internet penetration improves media trust, but generates more Internet users, impairing their trust in media. Second, the Internet penetration credits media in general but discredits media when they are actually used, while the Internet freedom discredits media in general but credits media when they are actually used. Third, the Internet penetration and the Internet freedom work against each other, revealing a negotiation process, in which informational distribution is neutralized by cultural distribution.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication
2018-0026,2018,Paper Session,"Journalism in Azerbaijan: A Study of the Media in a Controlled, Post-Soviet Environment",1,"This study seeks to fill a gap in knowledge about the practice of journalism in Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic where freedom of expression is limited and government control is strong. To the knowledge of this researcher, the study proposed here represents the first time Azerbaijan has been studied in a systematic fashion consistent with the literature of comparative journalism. ""Journalism in Azerbaijan” has three primary goals. First, this study will construct a demographic profile of journalists in Azerbaijan. Second, this study will explore the roles these journalists believe they play in the controlled, post-Soviet environment in which they operate. Finally, this study will consider the extent to which the theoretical foundation typically employed in the aforementioned literature, that is, the Theory of Influences on Media Content (Shoemaker & Reese, 2014), is applicable to the environment of Azerbaijan. Data will be collected through an online survey of journalists in Azerbaijan.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication
2018-0027,2018,Paper Session,Assessing New Media’s Impact on Journalism Crisis Perceptions in Singapore and Hong Kong,1,"New media’s relationship to journalism is a complex one, often described as being able to both alleviate and worsen the democratic deficit of news media systems and influence fears of journalism crisis. Research on new media’s impact on journalism crisis perceptions, however, tends to be set in the Anglo-American context that venerates liberal democracy; little is known about societies susceptible to Western liberal influence but continue to experience some form of authoritarian control. This study focuses on two Asian “global cities” in transition, Singapore and Hong Kong. Through a critical discourse analysis of responses from 160 journalists, this study identifies the need for a three-dimensional investigation – at the material, discursive, and ideological levels – to examine new media’s impact on journalism crisis perceptions in such hybrid societies. Results reveal stark contrasts in perceptions between these two cities, prompting alternative ways to understand state mediation of the press in the digital age.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication
2018-0028,2018,Paper Session,Senegalese Journalists’ Perception of Influences in News Production,1,"The purpose of this study was to explore the influences exerted on news content in Senegal and their perceptions by journalists. It hypothesizes that, in a developing country where economic resources are scarce, media owners, advertisers, and public relations practitioners would like to have their voices heard in the news and therefore alter the objectivity and credibility of the journalists. The study used a quantitative method in the form of survey distributed to active journalists in the country. The findings indicate that advertisers and public relations practitioners’ pressures are more severe in private media compared to public media. It also appears that public and private television networks in Senegal are tightly controlled by media owners and managers who want to use them as their “sounding boards”. However, in public and private media, journalists perceive the pressures but they declare to be able to resist.",News Effects in Contexts,Mass Communication
