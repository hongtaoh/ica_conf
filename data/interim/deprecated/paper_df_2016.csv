2016-0000,2016,Paper Session,"A Conditional Model of Political Discussion: Anger, Informal Political Talk, and the Perceived Opinion Climate",2,"Prior research examining whether anger—one of the most relevant political emotions—can trigger informal political conversations has been inconclusive, with some studies showing a positive influence, others a negative one, and still others finding no association. To address this quandary, we suggest considering the perceived climate of opinion, which has also been found to be an important antecedent of political discussions. We posit that the effects of anger depend on the perceived hostility of the surrounding opinion climate, such that in a friendly opinion climate anger increases willingness to engage in political talk and in a hostile opinion climate anger reduces willingness to engage in political talk. Data from two studies—a survey experiment fielded in Denmark, another conducted during a referendum in Switzerland—were analysed, and the findings were consistent with the hypothesis. The implications of these results, as well as directions for future research are discussed.",Political Discussion and Deliberation: Theoretical and Methodological Issues,Political Communication
2016-0001,2016,Paper Session,Deliberation Across a “Space of Reasons”: A Study About the Use of Media Arguments on Divided Groups,6,"Conversation across group differences has attracted growing attention in deliberation studies. However, studies that explore how people make sense of competing arguments in the media are rare. Building on competing frame studies, this article posits a new analytical framework to investigate how subjects from antagonistic social groups – residents of poor neighborhoods and the local police in Brazil – engage with arguments published by the media to negotiate their opinions on sensitive issues. Drawing on the Discourse Quality Index, our study analyses deliberative aspects of a group’s discussion. The results contribute to advancing an understanding of the dynamics by which subjects situate themselves in a “space of reasons”, including in relation to media-based arguments.",Political Discussion and Deliberation: Theoretical and Methodological Issues,Political Communication
2016-0002,2016,Paper Session,Deliberation and Collective Decisions: Individual Changes in Structuring Single-Peaked Preferences in Deliberative Polls,4,"Majority cycles, a threat to the meaningful democracy, can arise in a collective decision among three or more alternatives. Deliberative polling results have showed that deliberation can protect against majority cycles by bringing preferences closer to single-peakedness, as evidenced by the increased aggregate-level proximity to single-peakedness after deliberation. However, the individual differences and changes in structuring single-peaked preferences has remained an unexplored territory. This paper is the first empirical study attempting to explain the individual-level preference changes that underpin the aggregate phenomenon of deliberation-induced single-peakedness. Analyzing a pooled data consisting of nine Deliberative Polls on thirteen policy issues, we found that (1) deliberation helped move individual preferences closer to single-peakedness, at least for low and moderate salient issues; (2) individuals moved closer to single-peakedness as they gained more knowledge after deliberation; and (3) the effect of knowledge on individual's movement to single-peakedness is conditional on issue salience, but independent of the substantive agreement in the small groups.",Political Discussion and Deliberation: Theoretical and Methodological Issues,Political Communication
2016-0003,2016,Paper Session,Measuring Political Thinking: Development and Validation of a Scale for “Deliberation Within”,1,"Compared to the concept of interpersonal deliberation, little is known about the underlying and preceding cognitive processes of citizens’ deliberative discussions. The aim of this paper is to develop a psychometric measurement for these processes, which—following an idea advanced by Goodin (2000, 2003)—may be called “deliberation within”. The measurement is constructed based on theoretical definitions of the concept and further normative criteria of citizen deliberation. In three empirical studies using independent samples, the psychometric properties of the measurement are assessed, and evidence for its reliability as well as structural and criterion validity is offered. The resulting scale may serve as a useful instrument not only for deliberation research, but also for further communication research that is related to political processes.",Political Discussion and Deliberation: Theoretical and Methodological Issues,Political Communication
2016-0004,2016,Paper Session,"A Long Way to Go: Framing Analysis of Chinese Newspaper Coverage of Organ Donation Shortage and Barriers, 2000-2015",3,"Organ donation shortage remains a pressing public health problem in China. This study is the first effort to analyze how Chinese newspaper coverage (n=647) defined the problem of organ shortage and it relationship with culturally specific barriers from 2000 to 2015. We found that over half of news stories portrayed the low donation rates as an urgent problem. Results suggested significant differences in reporting dominant topics among newspapers based in urban vs. rural regions of China. Findings also indicated that legal barriers, medical distrust, cultural concerns, social norm of family disapproval and communication barriers positively associated with news framing of organ shortage. In examining the relationship in a multivariate logistical regression model, communication barrier, cultural concerns about preserving intact body, considerations of Chinese traditional culture, and lack of laws and regulations emerged as significant predictors to the presence of donation shortage frame. The portrayal of family and friend’s support reduced the likelihood that news stories reported the donation shortage frame. Results are discussed in terms of its usefulness of this research in crafting effective messages for policymakers and practitioners.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Health,Mass Communication
2016-0005,2016,Paper Session,A Matter of Degree: Testing an Alternative Approach to Content Analysis in Media Framing Research,3,"There are theoretical and statistical reasons to believe that the nominal coding procedure typically used in media framing research is inadequate to represent audience perceptions of framing in a given text, and that a ratio measure that operationalizes the degree of framing would provide a more valid representation. This paper presents two studies testing these claims by comparing reliably coded nominal and ratio coding of framing in four texts to independent participant ratings of frame prominence in those texts. The first shows that the ratio level measures explain more than twice as much variance in participant ratings as their nominal counterparts. The second shows that the ratio measures are able to discriminate texts in a cluster analysis, whereas the nominal measures are not. We conclude that ratio level measures should become the default method for coding framing in media texts, unless there are defensible reasons to do otherwise.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Health,Mass Communication
2016-0006,2016,Paper Session,"Framing and Agenda Interaction of the Ebola Virus Disease Under the Globalization Era: A Cross-National Study of News Coverage in China, US, Japan, and UK",2,"This study analyzes news coverage of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in China, U.S, Japan, and UK to examine variations in news attention cycles, framing, and to investigate agenda interactions. A content analysis was conducted on 730 news articles from highly circulated and prestigious newspapers in these four countries during the period of March, 24 to December 31, 2014. The findings revealed that news attention patterns by the four newspapers consistently adhered to the development of EVD monitored by the World Health Organization (WHO); common characteristics shown in reporting types, news frames, sources, and predominant tones used by the four countries’ coverage on portraying the EVD; agenda interactions with different extents were identified among the four newspapers. This study enriches understanding of how journalists with variations in media systems, cultural values, and social ideologies construct a global health risk. Limitations and future directions are also discussed in the ending part.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Health,Mass Communication
2016-0007,2016,Paper Session,The Effects of News Framing and Issue Attribution on Chinese College Students’ Responses to Depression Coverage,4,"Depression is now one of the most severe public health threats in China and among Chinese college students. To examine the role of depression news coverage and address barriers in communicating with Chinese college students about the risk of depression and the importance of providing social support to depressed individuals, a 2 (episodic vs. thematic framing) x 2 (individual vs. societal attribution) between-subjects experiment was conducted among 187 students in a large research university in China. The findings provide insights that can inform future depression news coverage in Chinese media: 1) Episodic framing in depression coverage triggered more sympathetic feelings toward depressed individuals; 2) Individual attribution in depression coverage led to higher self-efficacy in detecting people’s depression symptoms; and 3) Female participants felt more sympathy toward depressed individuals depicted in the new story regardless the framing or attribution. The findings shed light on the important role news framing and attribution play in influencing Chinese college students’ perception, attitude, and supportive behavior regarding depressed individuals in Chinese society. Implications for health reporters and health communication professionals in China are discussed.",The Study of Framing in the Context of Health,Mass Communication
2016-0008,2016,Paper Session,Communicating Complex Information About Cancer Research: An Experimental Comparison of Metaphorical and Low-Literacy Messages,2,"Effectively communicating complex information is a key challenge in the field of health communication. The role of randomization in cancer clinical trials is one such example because patients must understand their illness as well as the role of experimental design in order to provide informed consent to participate. The current study reports on the findings from a nationally representative study comparing the effectiveness of different message strategies for explaining randomization (N = 533). Results of a hierarchical regression analyses demonstrate surprising problems associated with the use of plain language strategies for explaining randomization to cancer patients, while the effects of metaphorical message strategies on comprehension, negative affect, and behavioral intentions to participate in RCTs were mixed. Implications for communication theory and practice are discussed.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0009,2016,Paper Session,It Just Makes Me Feel Better: The Creation and Validation of the Mood-Based Indoor Tanning Scale (MITS),7,"Recent research indicates that mood-based motivations may be an important predictor of indoor tanning bed use, and may be related to indoor tanning addiction. Problematically, little measurement research has been conducted to develop a psychometric measure of mood-based tanning motivations. Thus, the current study seeks to develop and assess the mood-based indoor tanning scale (MITS). Two studies were conducted to identify and verify the MITS factor structure as well as assess construct validity. Results revealed that the MITS is a powerful predictor of indoor tanning intentions and behavior, results from the national sample suggest that a one-point increase in the MITS measure corresponds with using indoor tanning beds eleven more times in the past year. These findings suggest that the MITS can be used by behavioral researchers and practitioners to assess the extent to which mood-based motivations impact indoor tanning bed use.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0010,2016,Paper Session,Multilevel Factors Associated With Cervical Cancer Screening Among Latinas,7,"Despite calls for more ecological approaches to cancer prevention, past efforts have focused primarily on individual level factors. This study examined the barriers and facilitators to compliance with Pap test guidelines across individual, interpersonal, and community levels of influence. We conducted a face-to-face survey of Latinas by recruiting from local clinics and community sites. Participants were classified as compliant or not compliant with Pap test guidelines. We grouped 1,150 participants into 25 geographic neighborhood clusters. Neither knowledge nor positive attitudes toward Pap testing were predictive of compliance. However, having health insurance, lower acculturation to the U.S., and self-efficacy were positively associated with compliance. Likewise, talking to more network contacts about Pap testing was associated with compliance. Living in a community with a strongly integrated communication network was positively associated with compliance among new residents only. Our study suggests the importance of incorporating more interpersonal and community-level measures into predictive models.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0011,2016,Paper Session,The Influences of Self-Efficacy in Medical Drama Programming on Cervical Cancer Preventive Behaviors: From the Perspective of Social Cognitive Theory,2,"The present study focuses on the role of self-efficacy in medical drama programing by adopting an experimental design. Following social cognitive theory, we posit that a self-efficacy manipulation will affect subjects’ behavioral intentions and emotions. Results indicate that those in the high efficacy condition show greater behavioral intention to receive a Pap smear and the HPV vaccine, and higher levels of hope than those in the low efficacy condition. The implications for the role of self-efficacy as a message factor in the context of medical drama viewing are discussed.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0012,2016,Paper Session,This is How We Cope: Using PhotoVoice With Parents of Pediatric Cancer Patients,1,"This study examines the difficulties, and communicative strategies of parents of children diagnosed with pediatric cancer. Through the use of PhotoVoice – an approach that provides participants an active engagement in the production of data through photography – twelve parent participants captured photographic representations of what they believed helped them cope. The photo narration results revealed that coping strategies focused on communicating about difficulties faced from the public such as public ignorance and their children receiving increased attention for looking “different.” Results also focused on the healthy siblings; including involving them in social activities to help them receive attention that the parents could not readily provide. Emphasizing play through dolls and tricycles helped not only the children with pediatric cancer, but their parents as well. In addition, being a proactive parent through the use of calendars to record treatment dates, medicine administration and appointments, and keeping their faith, helped parents cope.",Innovations in Cancer Communication Research,Health Communication
2016-0013,2016,Paper Session,How the Political Leanings of Journalists are Related to the Acceptance of Questionable Reporting Practices,2,"Based on a representative survey of journalists in Germany (n = 1536), we test the influence of the political leanings of journalists on their acceptance of questionable journalistic reporting practices, such as paying people to obtain information or using confidential government documents without permission. Theoretically, based on psychological consistency theory, we argue that a combination of the political leanings of journalists and perceptions of failure to achieve subjectively important aspects within the journalistic profession will engender both directly and indirectly the acceptance of questionable reporting practices. A mediation analysis shows that the perceived achievement of an active journalistic role explains to what extent journalists accept questionable reporting practices. We highlight the perceived role achievement as an important variable bridging the gap between journalists’ political leanings and their professional working practices.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies
2016-0014,2016,Paper Session,The GamerGate Scandal and Journalistic Paradigm Maintenance,2,"Ethic scandals in journalism allow journalists to repair their paradigm by explaining to their audience why they do what they do (Hindman & Thomas, 2013). Yet GamerGate was a unique journalistic scandal in that it at once questioned journalistic ethics and was the banner for a witch-hunt against women in game development and gaming criticism. Gaming journalists thus found themselves managing a debate on two fronts. This research explores how gaming journalists undertook paradigm maintenance through interviews with journalists (n=17) in the midst of the controversy as well as a discourse analysis of the texts produced by their publications in responding to GamerGate (n=32). Although gaming journalists operate within a form of lifestyle journalism (Hanusch, 2014), the journalists repaired their paradigm by linking their work to traditional journalism and emphasizing a paternal role.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies
2016-0015,2016,Paper Session,Being There? What's Left of Journalistic Legwork in the Digital Environment,2,"In the age of spirited debates about the mediating role of technologies, the other side of the coin is the state of direct experience in contemporary news production. The present study is the first systematic attempt to identify the circumstances and rationales underlying legwork, by recreating item-by-item the work processes and reasoning behind hundreds of individual news reports in the digital age, across Israeli print, television, radio, and online news outlets (N=859). Such unprecedentedly rich data avail an opportunity to adjudicate between those conceiving of legwork as an epistemic tool, as a cultural and status-related resource and as a derivative of media format. Data indicate, inter alia, that the extent of legwork fluctuated as a function of medium-type, news beat and sources' perceived reliability.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies
2016-0016,2016,Paper Session,"Whose Story is This, Anyway? Four Key Differences in How Journalists and Their Subjects Understand News Production",1,"Journalism scholarship has largely neglected the perspectives of ordinary people mentioned by name in the news, despite the prominent role they play in the news process and product. We know little about how they think about their interactions with journalists, how they assess those journalists’ representations of them, or how they feel they were treated by the journalistic process overall. This paper begins to address some of these gaps. Drawn from a larger project based on in-depth interviews with 83 private citizens who found themselves named, quoted, or featured in mainstream news stories in the United States, here I summarize my main findings as a set of four key differences between the way ordinary news subjects and journalists tend to view the news process. I find subjects’ and journalists’ perspectives differ strikingly in a number of important ways, including who has rightful ownership over a news story; what constitutes fair reporting of a controversy, how important the repercussions of a news story really are; and journalists’ relationship to power. In the discussion of my findings I explore how subjects’ perspectives can shed light on broader questions about public opinion of the press.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies
2016-0017,2016,Paper Session,How Journalists’ Mindsets Influence Their News Stories: Evidence From a Multilevel Analysis of Climate Communication,2,"It is one of the field's fundamental premises that the journalists’ cognitions influence the media content but empirical evidence has been scarce and ambiguous. The present study investigates how journalists’ attitudes towards climate change predict its representation in the mass media. As heuristic, it draws on Shoemaker and Reese’s conceptual model of the individual communicator. Methodologically, we individually match a survey among 62 climate journalists from leading news outlets in five countries (DE, CH, IN, UK, US) with a content analysis of their news stories (N = 747) and conducted a multilevel analysis. We detect a modest but robust partial correlation between the journalist mindsets and their news stories. Besides, we provide evidence for the influence of the journalist’s political orientation and editorial support on the depiction of climate change. The study concludes that journalist effects do matter and that the interplay of individual and organizational factors deserves further analysis.",Making Journalism: How Journalists Produce the News,Journalism Studies
2016-0018,2016,Paper Session,Making Brands Symbolic: How Self-Construal Affects Brand Endorsements on Social Media,4,"Recent research increasingly highlights that consumers engage in online brand endorsements (e.g., Facebook likes) to signal their identity, but has failed to explain why different consumers use this type of signaling to differing degrees. This paper addresses this gap by looking at a culturally constructed individual difference variable, namely self-construal. Self-construal, which can be independent or interdependent, refers to the extent that people define themselves in terms of the relations they have with others. In four studies, this research shows that consumers’ self-construal is related to their intention to endorse brands online. In particular, high levels of interdependent self-construal positively affect consumers’ intention to endorse brands online (studies 1A & 1B). This effect is mediated by an increased perception of brands’ symbolic value (study 2). Moreover, this positivity bias towards symbolic brand cues is conditional upon consumers’ brand attitude (study 3). These findings demonstrate that consumers’ identity plays a central role in their brand perception and brand-related social media use.",Advances in the Study of Advertising and Branding,Mass Communication
2016-0019,2016,Paper Session,"Narrative Persuasion: The What, Why, and How of Narrative Advertising",2,"We propose and test an integrated process explanation for why narrative ads generally are more persuasive than non-narrative ads. Our study involved a random sample of 25 narrative and 25 non-narrative, recent TV commercials and 484 non-student research participants. Study results confirmed that ad hedonic value and ad credibility play key mediating roles in explaining the positive effects of narrative (vs. non-narrative) ads on Aad, and, in turn, that Aad plays a key mediating role in explaining brand attitudes. The results also supported moderated mediation processes in narrative persuasion. Theoretical and practitioner implications of our findings are highlighted in the discussion.",Advances in the Study of Advertising and Branding,Mass Communication
2016-0020,2016,Paper Session,Resisting Persuasion: The Effects of Message Framing and Brand Attachment,2,"Awareness of persuasive intent often results in resistance to persuasion. This study investigates conditions under which explicit persuasive intent may not cause resistance to persuasion. Specifically, the study examines the interplay between persuasive intent and regulatory-framed messages, as well as brand attachment in a marketing communication context. The results show that the negative impact of explicit persuasive intent is less pronounced in promotion-focused than prevention-focused messages. When persuasive intent is explicit, participants in the promotion-focused condition report higher persuasiveness and brand evaluations while those in the prevention-focused condition show resistance to persuasion. The research, however, shows somewhat limited effects for brand attachment as a moderating variable. Additional mediation analyses also reveal that the effects of persuasive intent are mediated by perceived manipulativeness of the message.",Advances in the Study of Advertising and Branding,Mass Communication
2016-0021,2016,Paper Session,The Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsements: A Meta-Analysis,2,"Celebrities frequently endorse products, brands, political candidates, or health campaigns. The authors investigated the effectiveness of such endorsements by meta-analyzing 40 studies published through June 2015 involving 8,209 participants. The studies encompassed for-profit and non-profit communication and used multilevel meta-analysis. Findings revealed celebrity endorsements had no effect on average (d = .05). However, strong positive and negative effects appeared when theoretically relevant moderators were included in the analysis. The most positive attitudinal effects appeared for male actors matching with an implicitly endorsed object (d = 1.28). The most negative effects were with female models not matched with an explicitly endorsed object (d = -1.28). Furthermore, celebrity endorsements performed worse compared to endorsements of quality seals, awards, or endorser brands. No publication bias was detected. The study has practical implications and provides an agenda for future research.",Advances in the Study of Advertising and Branding,Mass Communication
