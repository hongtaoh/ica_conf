2015-0000,2015,Paper Session,Developing Communication Strategies for Mitigating Actions Against Global Warming: Linking Framing and a Dual Processing Model,1,"Global warming does not usually rank high on the list of environmental problems governments need to address and, even though people tend to be aware of global warming, there is a gap between such perception and relevant actions to combat the problem. In order to develop effective strategies for facilitating public actions, we draw upon framing theory and a dual processing model. Using an experiment of 261 participants in Taiwan, this study found that by framing global warming as a local issue, communication messages can trigger both analytic(issue relevance) and affective (negative emotions) appraisals, which, in turn, will increase people’s willingness to take actions.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0001,2015,Paper Session,Effects of Discrete Emotions on Climate Change Beliefs and Policy Preferences,2,"What role, if any, do emotions play in people’s beliefs about climate change and support for climate mitigation policies? This important question has received surprisingly little attention from researchers, despite a growing recognition that the public’s reactions to climate change information is shaped by various factors beyond the relevant information itself. Drawing on emerging perspectives from psychology and communication, we report an experiment (N = 719) in which participants were randomly assigned to one of three emotional-induction treatments (guilt, anger, or control) before reading a news story about the negative consequences of climate change. Immediately after, participants reported on a variety of climate-related beliefs (e.g., attributions of blame) and policy preferences (e.g., support for taxing carbon polluters). Results revealed that number of significant effects—for example, guilt led to significantly increased support for climate-mitigation policy overall—including some that depended on personal background and message factors suggested by prior research (namely, political affiliation and social distance). Overall, research suggests that incidental emotional experiences may play an important role in guiding fundamental climate beliefs and consequential policy preferences.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0002,2015,Paper Session,"Effects of Hope, Fear, and Guilt Appeals on Climate Change Engagement",1,"Negative emotional appeals dominate climate change communication; however, many scholars call for positive emotional appeals. An experiment was conducted with 809 U.S. adults who either read a hope appeal, fear appeal, guilt appeal, or control message. Results indicate that evoking hope is the superior approach for increasing interest, communication intention, and information seeking intention. Evoking hope and guilt are equally effective for increasing self-efficacy and behavioral intention. Evoking fear is superior to evoking guilt, but not superior to hope, for increasing information seeking intention. Otherwise evoking fear is either ineffective or detrimental. Implications for climate change communication are discussed.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0003,2015,Paper Session,Going the Distance: Using Construal-Level Theory to Explain Climate Change Engagement,2,"Climate change has altered our landscapes and weather patterns, impacting economic systems, human and environmental health, and cultural routines. Yet, despite real and present impacts, for many, climate change remains an abstract risk – a low-salience issue surpassed by competing concerns like jobs and family. Using a survey with an embedded experimental manipulation, we assess how manipulating psychological distance in a message about future climate change impacts in four exemplar cities influences individuals’ willingness to engage in mitigation behavior and to support mitigation policy, as well as their perceptions of the degree to which distant others should do the same. Results suggest that with respect to mitigation behavior, close temporal distance led to less social distance perception than far temporal distance. In addition, the exemplar that portrayed both far temporal and spatial distance also significantly increased social distance perception. Theoretical and applied implications are presented, along with directions for future research.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0004,2015,Paper Session,Hostile Media Perceptions as a Driver of Discursive Actions in the Context of Global Climate Change,2,"In recent years scholars have increasingly examined how hostile media perceptions may influence predispositions to engage in discursive actions on an issue. We extend this line of research using an experimental approach (n=1635) to examine a moderated-mediation model, which reveals that the valence of efficacy information in a climate news story impacted perceptions of hostile story bias, but only among partisans who supported action to address climate change. Perceptions of hostile story bias, in turn, had a positive association with both perceptions of hostile bias in media overall and discursive actions; general hostile media bias and discursive actions also were positively associated. Thus, the experimental manipulation influenced discursive actions indirectly through perceived hostile story bias and perceived hostile media bias.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0005,2015,Paper Session,Perceptions of Climate Changes Imagery. Evoking Salience and Self-Efficacy Through Visualization of Climate Change,5,"Although the media coverage of climate change has been given some attention in the last years, only very few studies deal with visual representations of climate change. As a study by O’Neill et al. (2013) for Australia, USA and the UK has shown, climate change imagery can shape people’s perceptions of the issue. Therefore we analyze the influence of climate change imagery on citizens’ perceptions in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. We focus on which images would increase the salience of climate change as an issue (‘this image makes me feel climate change is important’) and which images would enhance self-efficacy (‘this image makes me feel I can do something about climate change’). The data was gathered in Q-methodology sorting sessions which were held in the three countries. Results were quite consistent across countries. Imagery of climate change impacts promotes salience while imagery of renewable energies and mobility enhances self-efficacy. The findings are similar to the US, UK and Australia (O’Neill et al., 2013) and strengthen the cross-cultural consistency in perceptions of visual representations of climate change.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0006,2015,Paper Session,"Guilt, Fear, and Optimism as Mediators of Framing Effects in Climate Change Communication",3,"This study explores the effects of loss frames and two types of gain frames (gain-positive: states positive consequences, gain-negative: negates negative consequences) on perceptions, attitudes and mitigation intentions related to climate change. In addition, the role of discrete emotions (guilt, fear, optimism) is tested for mediating the framing effects. A non-student quota sample of n = 365 persons was randomly assigned a text about climate change containing either a loss, gain-positive or gain-negative frame. The framing conditions did not yield any differences in awareness of climate change, acceptance of anthropogenic causes, action-outcome efficacy and willingness to act. However, the loss frame evoked most fear and guilt, while the gain-positive, followed by the gain-negative, frame evoked most optimism. All three emotions mediate effects, with fear and guilt strengthening them and optimism weakening them.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0007,2015,Paper Session,How You Talk About Climate Change Matters: A Communication Network Perspective on Skepticism and Belief Strength,1,"Climate change attitudes have been explained with a variety of factors, including cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, political ideology, knowledge of climate change, severe weather exposure, and sociodemographics. These approaches, however, assume individuals form attitudes on the basis of preexisting values or beliefs and do not account for dynamic social interaction as a source of influence. This study introduces a network perspective that accounts for the social embeddedness of individuals, using key network variables to predict climate attitudes. Climate change attitudes were developed from an exploratory factor analysis, which identified climate change skepticism and belief strength as distinct attitudinal dimensions. Using nationally representative egocentric survey data from 2011 and hierarchical regression analyses, this study determined that homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, and network valence were significant predictors of skepticism (R2=4.8%), while centrality and network strength were predictive of belief strength (R2=8.9%). Directions for future network research and practical applications are discussed.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0008,2015,Paper Session,The Knowledge Gap Hypothesis: Climate Change as an Impersonal Risk,2,"Climate change is causing severe negative consequences to small low-lying islands. To mitigate and adapt to climate change, it is important to improve public knowledge on its causes and consequences. This study aims to investigate the knowledge gap hypothesis in the context of climate change (an impersonal risk) on public knowledge acquisition in Singapore. A nationally representative random computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey was conducted in Singapore. The findings revealed that both newspaper reading and television viewing could reduce the knowledge gap between the high and low socio-economic status individuals. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

2015-0009,2015,Paper Session,Does Media Affect Farmer’s Crop Choices? Exploring the Role of Media in Enhancing Farmer’s Adaptive Capacity,2,"Agriculture is considered to be one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change impacts, with potential negative impacts on livelihood and food security of millions of people worldwide. Moreover, different crops are expected to be impacted differently due to climate change, and the choice of crop can be an important determinant of adaptation strategy. Although several studies indicate the potential role of media in increasing public as well as farmer’s awareness, understanding, and behaviors about climate change, few studies explore the impact of media on farmer’s specific crop choices. This exploratory study is based on survey data from three villages in a semi-arid region in south India collected as part of climate change adaptation project. We find that media channels through which farmers access weather information, and media consumption affects farmer’s crop choices, distinguishing between their intention to play sorghum, cotton, and pulses in the next season. Providing specific, localized, and differentiated information on weather patterns to farmers, as well as potential adaptation strategies, can potential increase their adaptive capacity.",Extended Session: Climate Change Communication: Testing Messages and Media Effects,Environmental Communication
2015-0010,2015,Paper Session,Older Adults as Media E-Audiences,1,"This study explored the extent to which traditional media are displaced by innovative communication practices within the older e-audience and whether this extent varies among different segments of this population. The study was based on a cross-European survey of 1,039 Internet users aged 60 and up from eight countries. Results indicated that older Internet users are significantly more inclined to use mass media than new social media and prefer synchronous to asynchronous mass media. This e-audience, however, is not homogeneous, as four subsegments were identified. These groups differed in their media practices, sociocultural background and leisure preferences. Overall, despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices, with only a minority making intense use of new practices. With very few cross-national differences, this tendency appears to be universal, suggesting general media-use conservatism and a second-level digital divide among the older media e-audience.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0011,2015,Paper Session,When Meaning Matters More: Media Preferences Across the Adult Life-Span,3,"Three studies considered the roles of emotion and meaning in adults’ media preferences. In study 1, US 18-86 year olds read descriptions of TV programs and rated their anticipated emotions (warmth, humor, fear or sadness) and viewing interest. In Study 2, US and German 18-82 year olds watched violent film trailers and rated their anticipated fear and interest. There were few age differences in relationships between emotion and meaning or emotion and interest. However, in both studies, anticipated meaningfulness was a stronger predictor of interest for older adults and age moderated the indirect path (emotion → meaning → interest). In Study 3, (American Time Use Survey, 15-85 year olds), older adults reported more meaning while viewing and the indirect path (age → meaningfulness → wellbeing) suppressed a negative association between age and wellbeing. The findings suggest stability in the meaningfulness of media-derived emotions, but increases in the importance of meaningfulness.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0012,2015,Paper Session,Age Differences in Recall and Liking of Arousing Television Commercials,3,"This paper examines whether there are differences between older and younger adults in recall and liking of arousing television commercials. As hypothesized, the experiment demonstrated that older adults remembered brands and products in calm commercials better than in arousing commercials, and they also liked calm commercials more. In contrast, younger adults remembered brands and products in arousing commercials better and they liked these commercials more. In addition, (curvi)linear relationships showed that for older adults arousal deteriorates their recall and liking, whereas for younger adults arousal -up till a certain point- is beneficial. These findings strongly suggest that advertising effects found in younger samples are unlikely to be the same for older target groups. An important practical implication is that it currently seems to be wise to make commercials targeted towards older adults calm instead of arousing when the aim is to generate brand recall and liking.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0013,2015,Paper Session,Media Generations and Their Advertising Attitudes and Avoidance: A Six-Country Comparison,4,"The present study, a cross-national survey (N = 5766), examined generational differences in media use, advertising attitudes and avoidance for five media (newspapers, television, websites, social media, and mobile devices) in six countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and France). The survey revealed that the Net Generation and the Newspaper Generation clearly distinguished themselves in terms of their media use, in all six countries. For advertising attitudes, the Net Generation was the most positive generation regarding advertising on social media (US, UK, and the Netherlands) and mobile (UK and the Netherlands). The Newspaper generation, in the UK, was the most positive generation regarding advertising in newspapers and on television, whereas they were the most negative group regarding advertising in the newer media. In the US, they were the most negative generation regarding advertising in all five media. For advertising avoidance, there were no generational differences.",Top Papers on the Lifespan Communication Theme,Theme Sessions
2015-0014,2015,Paper Session,Abu Ghraib Photography and 'Torture Porn' Cinema: Exploring the Visual Relationship and Influence,1,"This qualitative study examines the visual parallels between Abu Ghraib iconography and the popular and successful ‘torture porn’ subgenre of horror that emerged post-9/11. Despite the commercial success of such torture porn movies as Hostel (2006) and the Saw franchise (2004-2010), critics and moviegoers alike were quick to denigrate the subgenre as “low culture” and lacking in artistic value. However, these “low” movies incorporated Abu Ghraib iconography and presented characters in visually similar torture positions, subverting existing political structures and manifesting cultural discomfort with government sponsored torture. Previous research connecting the torture at Abu Ghraib with horror cinema has focused on either figurative or allegorical connections, but this study focuses strictly on how visual parallels between the two indirectly challenged ongoing political issues by triggering the American public’s visual memory of the Abu Ghraib photographs depicting U.S. military’s torture and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners.",Visual Communication in Crisis and Trauma,Visual Communication Studies
2015-0015,2015,Paper Session,Comparative Analysis of Visualizing Natural Disasters: Picturing Images of Floods in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina Versus Pakistan,2,"The current study examines how the news media visualize victims/survivors during natural disasters in two different countries. This study offers a unique insight into comparative visual materials provided by the Associated Press images of flooding victims from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 floods following the monsoon rains in Pakistan. It examines whether AP − a leading Western news outlet − continue to reinforce the stereotype of the poverty stricken as victims and passive, while citizens of ally nations are visualized in superior roles and being actively engaged in survival.",Visual Communication in Crisis and Trauma,Visual Communication Studies
2015-0016,2015,Paper Session,Visuals and Mass-Mediated Peace: Analysis of War and Peace Journalism Frames of the Boko Haram Crisis Coverage in Nigeria,1,"While the media is known as an information and entertainment source, some scholars (e.g Galtung 2002, Lynch 2014) have also proposed ‘advocacy journalism’ in addition. This study provides an insightful account of a complex conflict- the Boko Haram conflict in Northern Nigeria. It considers conflict reporting strategies by adopting the revolutionary peace and war journalism model by a Norwegian scholar Johan Galtung in investigating national versus international media practices in the visual coverage of regional terrorism. Galtung looked at the dichotomy in conflict coverage and views war and peace journalism as two varying frames in the coverage of conflicts.
Through visual analysis this study concentrates on the coverage of the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria in Nigerian Vanguard, The Nation, US' New York Times and Washington Post from January 2012 to October 2014. It considers the extent to which the newspapers visually covered the crisis based on war and peace frames. This period covers the most recent events of the Boko Haram situation in Nigeria, as well as the kidnap of over two hundred teenage girls by the sect, a major issue that drew the most global attention to the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria.",Visual Communication in Crisis and Trauma,Visual Communication Studies
2015-0017,2015,Paper Session,"“The Most Beautiful Suicide”: Memory, Myth, and Violence in an Iconic Photograph",1,"Robert Wiles’ photograph of Evelyn McHale was the “Picture of the Week” in the May 12th, 1947 issue of LIFE Magazine. The tension between the picture’s beautiful composition and its horrible context; between the tranquility of her expression and the violence of her situation, gives “the most beautiful suicide” a unique place in American photojournalism.
This paper explores how: 1) It fits within the panorama of other suicide images, images of the dead, and those about to die; 2) How she invokes deeply embedded cultural “memories” echoing widely shared stories and images, from across history; 3)This photograph is iconic, but not in the same way that the flag raising over Iwo Jima or the Kent State massacre photographs are iconic; and 4) How Evelyn’s suicide fits into past and current attitudes about violence toward women in the media, and how we, as viewers, play a part in its depiction.",Visual Communication in Crisis and Trauma,Visual Communication Studies
2015-0018,2015,Paper Session,Gender Gap Through Media Lens: Visual Portrayal of Women Candidates by Indian Newspapers in Facebook,1,"Women political candidates across the world are under-represented in public offices. Apart from the cultural, social, political and economic influences, mass media also contributes to the global crisis of gender imbalance in leadership roles. The situation is not much different in the biggest democracy of the world, India. In a recent report published by the IPU on Women’s Representation in Parliament, India ranks 108 among 150 countries. The juxtaposition of social media networking sites and news media has not resulted in a significant change in the portrayal of women candidates. The purpose of this study is to assess the visual portrayal of women candidates in India by the top five Indian English newspapers in their social media networks, specifically Facebook, in the period of January 1, 2014 – May 11, 2014, during the campaign and elections of the 16th Indian Parliament.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0019,2015,Paper Session,Leaders and Symbols: Constructing Political Images of Presidents in the United States and Russia,1,The management of political image as one of the most important activities in modern political communication allows to manipulate the public’s understanding of relationships between authority and citizens and perceptions of an ideal leader. This study explored how political images of the presidents of the United States and Russia are constructed on their official websites. Visual rhetoric guides this study’s theoretical approach while textual analysis serves as the method for the analysis of symbolic communication. This study extends application of visual rhetoric as a theoretical perspective to discover how leaders of the countries with distinct political cultures use symbolic means to communicate their political images to their constituents. This study revealed similarities and differences in how the political images of the presidents are constructed by supporting aspects of participant (democratic) and subject (authoritarian) political cultures and how it reflects the understandings of who a strong leader is in these countries.,"The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0020,2015,Paper Session,Visual Frames of Obamacare: The Evolving Roles of Political Cartoons and Memes in Engaging Public Discourse,2,"Political commentary has a long history in visual expression. However, what was once the estate of professional cartoonists and magazine illustrators is now the wilds of the Web. How the landmark legislation of the Affordable Care Act fared in this new frontier offers evidence and lessons on the implications of a shifting visual discourse. During the roll out of Obamacare during a contentious and watershed moment in U.S. history, political cartoonists and creators of image macros produced and circulated persuasive narratives. This study uses visual rhetoric, humor theory, and narrative criticism to analyze a collection of these images, raising questions about their visual propositions and their roles in democratic discourse.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0021,2015,Paper Session,Social Media and Visual Propaganda: A Comparative Analysis of Facebook Images During Syrian Conflicts,2,"From Twitter pictures during the Israeli-Hamas conflict in 2012 to graphic Internet videos by the Islamic State of Iraq or al-Sham (ISIS) in 2014, social media platforms have become important channels for spreading propaganda images during conflicts. This study examines the role of visual propaganda in the social media age by analyzing themes, frames, and structural features of images posted on the official Facebook pages of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces. Our results show interesting differences and similarities between the two sides in using images for their propaganda purposes during the recent Syrian conflicts following the popular uprisings in 2011. Our research highlights the importance of updating existing models of propaganda, as active two-way communication between political actors and the mass public has become more common.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0022,2015,Paper Session,Automated Visual Coding of Politicians in the Mass Media: Correlating Large-Scale Image Analysis With Public Opinion Polls,2,"Modern mass media make extensive use of images to persuade people to make commercial and political decisions. These effects and techniques are widely studied, but behavioral studies do not scale to massive datasets. In this paper, we propose introducing techniques from computer vision to facilitate automated human attribute recognition in mass media photographs. We extend the significant advances in syntactic analysis in computer vision to the higher-level challenge of understanding the underlying communicative intent implied in images. We begin by identifying nine dimensions of persuasive intent latent in images of politicians, such as ""energetic"" and ""trustworthy,"" and propose a hierarchical model that builds on the layer of syntactical attributes to predict the intents presented in the images. We show that the resulting favorability judgments correlate in informative ways with independent measures of public opinion, proposing the contrasting media behaviors of visual agenda-setting and mirroring. This study demonstrates that a systematic focus on visual persuasion opens up the field of computer vision to a new class of investigations around mediated images, intersecting with media analysis, psychology, and political communication.","The Visual in Politics: Rhetorics, Frames, Effects",Visual Communication Studies
2015-0023,2015,Paper Session,A Multidimensional Model of Sport Dramaturgy,1,"This paper provides an analysis of the social field of sport within the general frame of social dramaturgy, using three metaphors that are grounded on Goffman's conceptual heritage: sport as play, sport as game and sport as ritual. After discussing ‘how’ and ‘to what extent’ can Goffman's concepts be re-contextualized in understanding the dynamics of the sport acts, I integrate them into a multidimensional analytic model, contributing thus to both a diversification of the analytical approaches of the sport ethos, as well as to a corollary operationalization process. The model of sport dramaturgy that I have built covers: the dramaturgical dimension, the strategic dimension and the ritual dimension of sport acts as complementary elements that can provide an integrative perspective upon the sport dynamics. Every dimension implies a specific definition for the competitive situation, for the sport actor and for his dispositional orientation when faced with a competitive situation.",Sport Communication Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0024,2015,Paper Session,"Emerging Adults’ Response to Parental Advice About Physical Activity, Exercise, and Sports",4,"Two hundred emerging adulthood children (i.e., age 18 – 29) were surveyed on advice they have received from a parent about physical activity, exercise, or sports. The current study sought to advance both theory and application, by examining advice response theory (ART) to refine understanding of how parental advice might encourage or discourage children from engaging in healthy habits. While some ART propositions were supported, others were not. Children responded more favorably to advice when it was higher in politeness, and emotionally coped better when advice was more efficacious. Parent characteristics were both directly and indirectly influential on advice outcomes; specifically, the child’s rating of parent-child relational satisfaction colored all advice ratings (i.e., child with more satisfactory relationships reported the advice was higher in quality). Furthermore, children evaluations of parental persuasion success (i.e., change, novelty, confirmation) drove advice outcomes both in terms of emotional coping and problem solving.",Sport Communication Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
2015-0025,2015,Paper Session,Ultimate Rebranding: The Active Commodification of Sport Subculture,1,"This study examines the impact of a self-initiated commodification process on a sporting subculture, and advances an emerging scholarly argument that views commodification as an active and potentially empowering process for subcultures. This challenges the perception of commodification as a largely negative and passive process. By aligning itself with other professionalized sports, such as soccer, basketball and football, professional Ultimate Frisbee leagues are re-branding ultimate as part of an effort to expand its fan base. This study empirically evaluates how a historically marginalized sport seeks to remake its image, and how its internal conflicts impact its ability to create a cohesive external message. Fundamentally, media play a key role in structuring outside perception. Through an analysis of player interviews and historical and contemporary media coverage, this paper assesses how a professional Ultimate team modified and marketed its image while maintaining control over its representation and cultural values.",Sport Communication Interactive Paper Session,In Event: ICA Plenary Interactive Paper/Poster Session III
