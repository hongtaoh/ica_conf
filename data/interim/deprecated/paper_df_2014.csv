2014-0000,2014,Paper Session,Strike a Pose! How Pose and Expression in Online Profile Pictures Affect Impressions of Interpersonal Attraction and Intelligence,4,"While the profile picture is one of the most prominent features of social networking sites, little is known about how the way one is depicted on a profile picture affects impression formation. This study investigates how the type of online profile picture affects impressions of physical attraction, social attraction and intelligence. This was investigated in a 3 (camera distance: full body vs. head and chest vs. face only) x 2 (body angle: frontal vs. 45º angle) x 3 (expression: neutral vs. smiling vs. sexy / duck face) experimental design in which 232 participants each rated four profile pictures. Facial expression has the strongest impact on impression formation: profile pictures in which the profile owner is smiling are rated more attractive than neutral or sexy expressions. Although men found a sexy expression (a “duck face”) equally attractive as a smiling expression, women did not. Profile owners with a sexy expression on their profile picture are rated lower on intelligence. Close-up pictures were rated as less attractive than pictures taken from further away. Camera angle seemed to have no effect on ratings of interpersonal attraction and intelligence.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0001,2014,Paper Session,Negative Hyperpersonal Intensification Effects of Religiosity in E-Mail Signature Blocks,1,"This research explores the intensification of email receivers’’ negative attributions of a message sender based on the inclusion of varied religious quotations in the sender’s signature line. Competing hypotheses are tested, drawing from previous research into the inclusion of religious disclosures in professional communication and the hyperpersonal model. Additional hypotheses assess the influence of the strength of a receiver’s religious beliefs and the relational context of the message. A 3 (Christian, Islamic, or Secular signature line) × 2 (personal or professional context) experiment generally supported the hyperpersonal model’s explanation and intensification of attributions and supported two moderation effects. Findings revealed subjects attributions of a sender were more negative when the sender and receiver identified with disparate social (i.e., religious) categories. This perceptual effect was intensified when a) senders more strongly held their religious beliefs; and b) in a professional relational context.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0002,2014,Paper Session,Counting on Friends: Cues to Trustworthiness in Facebook Profiles,1,"Social network sites are frequently used for accessing information about others. Thus, it is important to understand how users evaluate one another on the basis of these profiles. The present study examines how the perceived trustworthiness of Facebook profile owners is shaped by information present in their profiles, or profile cues. Drawing on uncertainty reduction theory, warranting theory, and hardwired perceptions of facial displays, we identify a set of cues utilized by observers when assessing strangers’ trustworthiness on Facebook. Results show that five profile cues (number of friends, number of tagged photographs, number of “about me” categories filled out, comments received from friends, and smiling photographs) explain a third of the variance in trustworthiness perceptions. Theoretical and design implications of the findings are discussed.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0003,2014,Paper Session,Determining Attraction of Online Dating Site Profiles,3,"The aim of this study was to investigate which cues available on dating site profiles determine attraction towards a profile owner. 400 online dating sites profiles were rated by 40 participants, who each rated 10 profiles. The profiles were rated on social and romantic attraction, physical attraction, and perceived similarity. Furthermore, we calculated actual demographic and lifestyle similarity based on the profile owner’s information and the information provided by the participant who rated that specific profile. Finally, we coded the matching score the dating site provided. Results revealed that physical attraction was the strongest indicator of romantic and social attraction. Similarity also affected attraction. Lifestyle similarity and matching score were related to perceived similarity while demographic similarity was not. Findings indicate that the main factors influencing attraction in regular dating also seem to be the most important factors in the online dating process.",Profiles in Social Media,Communication and Technology
2014-0004,2014,Paper Session,Comparing Levels of Mediatization in Television Journalism: An Analysis of Political Reporting on U.S. and UK Evening News Bulletins,1,"This comparative content analysis study (N=946) examines how far political news is mediatized in the US and UK by systematically exploring the conventions used in television news bulletins. According to many of our mediatization of politics indicators – which included sound and image bites, lip flaps, journalistic visibility, ‘wrapping up’, live and interpretive news – broadcasters with the greatest public service responsibilities supplied the greatest level of mediatized political news. Our study thus appears to challenge conventional academic wisdom that US journalistic interventionism is greater than other advanced Western democracies and that enhanced commercialization is a precursor to higher degrees of mediatization. We suggest that the form, structure and style of journalism should be understood more carefully by scholars when making sense of how far news is mediatized, since the greater length of UK television news conventions and the ability to ‘go live’ longer allowed journalists greater freedom to interpret politics.","New Media, New Practices?

2014-0005,2014,Paper Session,Hyperlinking Practices in Swedish Online News 2007-2013,2,"Hyperlinks are considered vital to both Internet and digital journalism. This study utilizes a longitudinal content analysis of hyperlinking practices in Swedish online news from 2007 to 2013 to see how hyperlinking evolves over time. It also compares if and to what extent publishing tradition shapes journalistic practice. The findings primarily shows that the over all impact of hyperlinks remain rather unchanged over time but that internal links, while still being most common, decrease in relative importance while external links increase. The general conclusion is that hyperlinks are not an important aspect of online journalism practice.","New Media, New Practices? Examining Journalistic Conventions",Journalism Studies
2014-0006,2014,Paper Session,When Reporters Disbelieve: Searching for Predictors of Journalistic Cross-Verification,2,"As society's main providers of information journalists are constantly forced to maneuver between their inability to validate every single bit of information and the unacceptability of publishing unverified information – a threat to their professional self-image, reputation and employment. Under what circumstances, then, do reporters exercise their skepticism after all? - The present study is the first systematic attempt to determine the presence or absence of cross-verification in every news item, and to reconstruct the work process which underlies it, on the basis of a large-scale quantitative data set (N=847), including Israeli print, radio, online and television news. We find, inter alia, that the nature of events, the institutional roles and seniority of sources, editorial involvement in the news item, reporters' frequency of contact with sources, perceived importance of information, and technological channels through which information is attained, are all related to reporters' decision to cross-verify. These patterns of reliance on sources call for an epistemological theory of journalism which conceptualizes reporters as economists of skepticism, who regard it as a scarce resource used only under specific organizational, social and technological circumstances.","New Media, New Practices?

2014-0007,2014,Paper Session,"Print is Future, Online is Past: Cross-Media Analysis of Temporal Orientations in the News",2,"News is both constituted by and constitutive of time. Through content analysis of print and online news stories in the Israeli media, this article establishes a link between temporal orientations in different types of media outlets and the temporal constraints of news cycles. The study shows that a future temporal orientation is more dominant in print media, which assume the role of projecting future events, analyzing potential outcomes, and shaping collective expectations. In contrast, online news outlets tend to focus on the near past, thereby fulfilling the ""traditional"" journalistic function of reporting on recent events. Further analysis suggests that these cross-media differences are associated with both the topical focus of news stories and the temporal conditions of news production. It is consequently argued that different media have divergent “temporal affordances”, which shape and reshape their social functions in changing media landscapes.","New Media, New Practices?

2014-0008,2014,Paper Session,Adolescents’ Use of Social Networking Sites: Mass Media Appearance Ideals and an Objectified Self-Concept,2,"This longitudinal study (N = 1,041) examined how adolescents’ appearance-focused use of social networking sites related to their use of sexualizing mass media, their internalization of mass media appearance ideals, and their engagement in self-objectification and body surveillance. Structural equation modeling revealed that reading sexualizing magazines and watching sexualizing music television related to adolescents’ internalization of mass media appearance ideals (Time 1). Internalization, in turn, positively predicted appearance-focused use of social networking sites (Time 2), which subsequently predicted self-objectification and body surveillance (Time 3). The interrelated role of mass media and social networking sites in the development of an objectified self-concept is discussed, and critical questions are raised about the role of mass media as a socialization agent.","Experiencing Risk, Regret, and ""Reality"" via Social Networking Sites",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0009,2014,Paper Session,Social Networking Sites and Youth Privacy: An Examination of Self-Disclosures and Risk Perceptions,1,"Immersed in new technology in general, teens are among the most avid users of social networking sites (SNSs) like Facebook in particular, disclosing a great deal of personal information. Although previous studies have been focused on the factors which influence teens’ privacy concerns, there is limited empirical work which simultaneously captures acceptance factors (positive factors) and resistance factors (negative factors) that motivate voluntary privacy disclosure and privacy protection. Integrated with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a theoretical model was proposed to investigate teens’ perceptions of online privacy and relevant behaviors on SNSs. Drawing on evidences from a survey (N=127), this research found that perceived risks of information disclosure increase privacy concerns, and directly lead to teens’ coping behaviors to grapple with privacy-related threats by restricting information. These findings contribute to understand how teens perceive privacy, and thus what needs to be protected.","Experiencing Risk, Regret, and ""Reality"" via Social Networking Sites",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0010,2014,Paper Session,Longitudinal Effects of Social Networking Site Use on Adolescents’ Social Development,3,"The aim of this study was to examine the role of social networking sites (SNSs) in early adolescents’ social development. We investigated the relation between SNS use and several aspects of early adolescents’ social life (i.e., friendship quality, bridging and bonding social capital, and social competence). A sample of 1.434 early adolescents between 11 and 15 years of age were surveyed twice within a 6 month-interval. Results showed positive effects of SNS use on bridging social capital, the ability to self-disclose and the ability to provide social support. So, even though concerns have been voiced about a possible negative impact of SNS use on adolescents’ social life, we found no evidence of this. Results of this study showed that the effects of SNSs on early adolescents’ social development is positive at least concerning bridging social capital and social competence.","Experiencing Risk, Regret, and ""Reality"" via Social Networking Sites",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0011,2014,Paper Session,Teens’ Use of Social Networking Sites and Online Risks: Their Relationships to Parental Mediation,1,"This study conducted a secondary analysis of 2011 Pew Internet and American Life survey on teens and online behaviors to examine the impacts of online social networking activities and parental mediation on teen’s exposure to online risks. According to the findings, teen’s use of social networking sites was positively associated with increased exposure to cyberbullying, sexual risk and disclosure of personal information. Also, social networking activities differed in the forms of online risks. As for parental mediation, active mediation was found to effectively buffer teens’ exposure to three types of online risks. The relationships between teens’ use of social networking sites and online risks would be weaker if teens’ received active mediation from their parents. Restrictive mediation was only found to be negatively associated with sexual risk. That is, restrictive mediation could only mitigate teen’s exposure to sexual risk.","Experiencing Risk, Regret, and ""Reality"" via Social Networking Sites",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0012,2014,Paper Session,Youths' Regretted Online Self-Presentations: Risk or Opportunity?,1,"Several recent scholarly and popular press accounts highlight the frequency with which teenagers regret their online posts. This article offers a deeper understanding of youth online expression by analyzing the context and consequences of youths’ regretted experiences as described in retrospective essays. Focusing on regretted self-presentations, in particular, the study finds that normal development processes play an important role in why young people engage in presentations they later regret. The types of presentations that are regretted often are quite ordinary or benign, despite the tragic stories that dominate news media coverage of regretful teens. Teens most regret their misrepresentation of self. The study argues that youths’ experiences of regretting an online self-presentation might productively be understood as an opportunity as much as a risk.","Experiencing Risk, Regret, and ""Reality"" via Social Networking Sites",Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0013,2014,Paper Session,Crisis Communication and the Disconnected Coworker: The Role of ICT Access in Shaping Identification and Safety Message Satisfaction,5,"The present study explores how employee identification, in conjunction with perceived message overload and ICT access at work, accounts for how employees process safety and emergency messages. We adapt Cheney’s (1983b) development of organizational identification to explain the how identification influences the reception of safety and emergency messages. Toward this end, we build on existing literature regarding safety and emergency communication, identification, and message overload to construct a structural equation model (SEM) representative of these relationships. Survey data was collected from a large sample of university employees (n=271) to test the hypothesized model. In addition to identification, the modified SEM model shows that ICT access has an indirect effect on identification and a significant direct effect on satisfaction with safety messages. The findings from this study provide contributions to existing research on identification, technological access, overload, and organizational safety messages.","Good Grief!

2014-0014,2014,Paper Session,Negotiating the Non-Negotiable: Managing Nuclear Safety in the US After Fukushima,1,"This essay addresses the principle of nuclear safety through a framework linking the research literatures on high reliability organizations, social systems theory, science and technology studies, and rhetorical boundary work. The disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant has reopened important questions regarding organizational and institutional communication, systems of regulation and governance, and the assurance of nuclear safety. This moment offers opportunities for improving communication practices and for expanding communication theory. Although nuclear safety is often said to be a “non-negotiable” principle, such claims disregard the degree to which it is constituted through communication and the degree to which that communication is fundamentally negotiative in form. Accordingly, the essay conceptualizes nuclear safety as a negotiated and paradoxical accomplishment within complex sociotechnical systems, extending the concept of high reliability organizations to a larger system level and linking it with heuristic concepts from Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory.","Good Grief!

2014-0015,2014,Paper Session,Organizing and Adaptations of Collective Grassroots Efforts for Disaster Response,2,"This research uses a multi-theoretical framework, including Weick’s model of organizing, self-organizing complexity theory, and the technology-in-practice perspective, to examine the dynamic processes of organized efforts in disaster response following Hurricane Sandy in the United States. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 group organizers/leaders involved in response. The findings showed that those citizen groups exhibited the patterns of self-organizing by adopting flexible work routines, adapting fluid membership, and resorting to different communication channels and technologies, such face-to-face, texting, online media, and social media to request and receive resources necessary for response effort. Collectively, those groups formed network forms of organizing, through which inter-group relationships among emergent and existing groups evolved and changed over time. This study advances our understanding of the evolutionary process of self-organizing response group’s organizing and technological structures in response to a disruptive environment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Good Grief! Disasters, Crises, and High-Risk Organizational Environments",Organizational Communication
2014-0016,2014,Paper Session,A Message Worth a Thousand Lives: Understanding Organizational Change in High-Risk Environments,1,"Recent economic turbulence in the United States has resulted in budget cuts for many city-funded organizations, including local fire departments. Budget cuts trigger organizational change and create uncertainty among employees. Given the need to study organizational change in high-risk, high-consequence environments, this study examines inevitable organizational change within urban fire departments and the influence on communication satisfaction with messages surrounding the change. For this exploratory study, focus groups were conducted with full-time firefighters from multiple lower level ranks (i.e., firefighters, lieutenants, and captains) to learn perceptions about these organizational issues. Findings indicate that the source, amount, and frequency of messages during change are the most important components to consider for high-risk environments.","Good Grief!

2014-0017,2014,Paper Session,Explaining Parent-Child Discussion of Television: Active Mediation as a Proxy for Attitude Accessibility,2,"144 children ages 5-12 completed a measure of attitude accessibility and watched a 6-minute clip portraying character violence from SpongeBob SquarePants. Participants provided self-reports of liking of the violent characters, liking of the violent show, perceptions of others’ liking of the violent characters, and exposure to violent TV programming. A parent of each child reported on active mediation efforts. Results showed that active mediation of violent TV was associated with the accessibility of children’s negative attitudes about TV violence and that the accessibility of these attitudes was related to the types of programming children watch and to children’s reactions to watching violent TV. Importantly, results also showed that children with low to moderately accessible negative attitudes about violent TV tended to benefit most from active mediation. This study is the first to show that active mediation works by impacting the relationship between attitude accessibility and children’s reactions to violent TV.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0018,2014,Paper Session,Maternal Predictors of Young Children’s Television Exposure: Findings From a Panel Study of Mothers’ Structural Life Circumstances,1,"The longitudinal association between mothers’ life circumstances and children’s television time was examined within the context of time conflict theory and stress process theory. Structural equation modeling using data from a two-wave panel survey of mothers of one- to four-year-olds (N = 404) demonstrated that mothers’ working hours affect children’s television time. Unexpectedly, this association arises from two different underlying processes. When mothers work longer, their well-being improves and their children consequently watch less television. Conversely, when mothers work longer hours, they experience more parenting time pressure, which undermines their well-being, which, in turn, leads to children watching more television. The findings emphasize the importance of mothers’ life circumstances as contributors to children’s television time.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0019,2014,Paper Session,Pathway to Political Participation: The Influence of Online and Offline News Media on Internal Efficacy and Turnout of First-Time Voters,2,"News media play a key role in informing young citizens about politics and cultivating a sense of political efficacy. Online news media, in particular, are expected to have a positive impact due to their interactivity and new opportunities to share and discuss information. This study analyzes the impact of online and offline news media use on the growth in internal efficacy among adolescents, based on data we collected in a three wave panel survey in the Netherlands (N=729). Additionally we test the impact of internal efficacy on turnout using a fourth wave of the same sample (N=612). The results show that while newspaper reading has the strongest effects among traditional news sources, actively participating in the communication process of political information online has the strongest impact on internal efficacy. Internal efficacy, in turn, is found to be a significant predictor of first time voters.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0020,2014,Paper Session,Stance-Taking in Talking to Children About Media: A Language Socialization Perspective,1,"This paper concerns the process through which the cultural ideas and media ideologies framing children’s experiences in the media are (re)constructed in and through naturally occurring conversations. In particular, the paper focuses on children’s media socialization through everyday talk and the role of parents’ stance-taking in the making of children’s media culture. Two examples of parent-children interactions collected during extended fieldwork in a family are discussed adopting a culturally contextualized conversation-analytic approach. The case study is intended to illustrate a) how family’s media ideologies are reified and maintained on the micro order of everyday life and b) how children are socialized into these ideologies in and through their participation in naturally occurring, unplanned talking activities. In the discussion we contend that talk occasioned by media use is organized by the worldviews of a given community. Yet, at one and the same time, it (re)produces the value system, moral order and the canonical versions of the world for those who engage in these talking activities.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media
2014-0021,2014,Paper Session,The Relationship Between Parents’ Cognitions and Children’s Television Viewing: Implications for Interventions That Reduce Television Viewing,1,"Understanding which parental cognitions predict children’s television exposure is crucial to developing effective interventions to reduce television viewing. Building on the theory of planned behavior, the present study investigates whether parents’ cognitions predict children’s television viewing through parents’ intentions to allow or not allow their children to watch television. The most important parental cognition to target in interventions is parents’ perceived behavioral control, because children watch more television when parents have limited control over children’s television exposure. The findings also point to a strong need for strategies for dealing with social pressure, because parents’ intentions to allow or not allow children to watch television primarily depend on perceived social norms.",Parents and Media as Agents of Socialization,Children Adolescents and Media
