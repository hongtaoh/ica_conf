2017-0000,2017,Paper Session,Asynchronous Modernization of the Mexican Press: A Center-Periphery Comparison,2,"After seventy years of an almost complete hegemony, in 2000 the Institutional Revolutionary Party lost the presidency of the Republic to the oppositional National Action Party candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada. That moment was considered the hallmark of the political transition that started in certain regions two decades ago. According to a group of American scholars, the transformation of the political system involved the modernisation of the media system as well, as the Mexican press as a whole was moving towards its professionalization. Nonetheless, diverse case studies focused on specific regions have found empirical evidence that prove otherwise. That is, the findings consistently prove that local and regional journalism is still determined by the customs of the authoritarian model. Based upon a content analysis of the coverage of the 2015 parliamentary elections in both national and state newspapers, the main argument of this paper is that Mexican journalism oscillates between modernisation and stagnation. In other words, whilst the so-called national media – located in Mexico City – showed a more professional performance than those located in other regions (regarding – for instance - the use of diverse sources of information, and the implementation of different journalistic genres, other than the standard news story); both groups shared a similar political bias and a limited coverage of those elections. Therefore, the main conclusion is that instead of a general transformation or stagnation, Mexican press develops an asynchronous modernisation process in which there are simultaneously liberal and authoritarian features. However, the former are more frequent in national news outlets than in their regional counterparts, which tend to be inclined to the latter.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2017-0001,2017,Paper Session,Ayotzinapa’s Twitter Roll Call: Motivations and Functions of a Social Media Protest,1,"This paper analyzes a daily Twitter protest named Roll Call from 1 to 43 about the Ayotzinapa case, a mass disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results from a thematic analysis, considering the uses and gratifications theory as framework, show that participants of the roll call, which had an organic origin sparkled by individual citizens, are motivated by an emotional connection with the victims, and their desire to support the students’ parents. The commitment to engage is strengthened by the emergence of a shared identity among participants. Moreover, the protesters conceive that the roll call fulfills the functions of keeping the memory of the students present in public discourse, and filling informational voids in the coverage of the case by traditional media. The protest also constitutes a virtual assembly at a specific time and place to discuss other social and political problems.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2017-0002,2017,Paper Session,Constructing the Socialism of the 21st Century on the Airwaves: A Rhetorical Analysis of President Hugo Chávez’s Characterization of Venezuela’s Socioeconomic Shift on Aló Presidente,1,"This case study examines President Chávez’s characterization of the socialism of the 21st century through second-level agenda-building endeavors in his weekly show Aló Presidente. The study found that the president pivoted a discussion about a major socioeconomic shift to a debate about the moral foundations of Venezuelan society, which could have tangible implications in the conduction of politics in the country.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2017-0003,2017,Paper Session,When Elites Protest: News Coverage and the Evolution of Antigovernment Demonstrations in Brazil,1,"In 2013, small demonstrations against bus fares in Brazil evolved into a series of large protests expressing generalized dissatisfaction with center-leftist President Dilma Rousseff. After she was reelected, another wave of protests returned in 2015 with a clear agenda: the removal of the President. Communication research has long examined the “protest paradigm,” a pattern of coverage delegitimizing social movements. The Brazilian context provided a chance to assess the extent to which the paradigm holds when protests take on an elite-driven narrative contesting the government. Through a quantitatively-driven mixed methods, results revealed that when grievances evolved into coherent anti-government demands, official sources from opposition parties served to legitimize the movement. This study departs from an understanding of protest coverage as paradigmatic towards a complex view of the relationship between protestors and the press. The experience of Brazil shows that when an elite opposition supports protests, journalistic norms and routines validate demonstrations.",Political Communication in Latin America,Political Communication
2017-0004,2017,Paper Session,Configuring Shared and Hierarchical Leadership Through Authoring,2,"Shared and hierarchical leadership have long been described as co-existing leadership forms; however, there is very little process research that examines how they intertwine in day-to-day interactions. Using the lens of “authoring” claims and grants (Taylor and Van Every, 2014), to illuminate an ethnographic study of a Danish municipal department, we display the complex relationship between shared and hierarchical leadership. Our findings suggest that issues of time and timing are fundamental to understanding their interrelationship. We highlight discursive devices such as “bookending,” including the creation of authoritative texts, which render the shared and hierarchical leadership configuration an ambiguous space that requires interrogating leadership outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the centrality of leadership as a concept for both hierarchical and collaborative decision-making situations.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-0005,2017,Paper Session,"Collective Innovation Adoption across Interorganizational Systems: Organizational Boundary, Social Networks, and Decision-Making Status",3,"Most research on innovation adoption focuses on the attitudes and behaviors of members of a single organization. However, little research has examined innovation adoption across an interorganizational system where the results have public consequences. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action and Social Information Processing Theory, this study examines three factors that influence intentions to adopt six health innovations across the system of 1,849 state health departments in Bihar, India. The collective attitudes of advice network members and organizational co-members influence government healthcare workers’ (N = 6,776) attitudes and perceptions of social norms toward each innovation. Perceptions of social norms and attitudes influence the intentions to adopt each innovation, a reliable precursor to innovation adoption behaviors. However, individuals’ decision making status moderates these relationships, such that the collective attitudes of advice network members have a greater influence on decision makers (n = 953) and the collective attitudes of organizational co-members and perceived social norms have a greater influence on non-decision makers (n = 5,823). Implications for the study of innovation adoption within and across organizations are drawn from the results.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-0006,2017,Paper Session,Taking the Moral High Ground: Avoiding Accounts as a Practice for Being Uncompromisingly Principled,2,"We apply a discourse analysis of accounts to a video-recording of a confrontation between a same-sex couple seeking a marriage license, and a county clerk refusing to provide the license for religious reasons, which took place after the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act in the U.S.A. (which had prohibited same-sex couples from marrying). In the case we examine, account sequences exploit the multiple frames available in a situation and appeal to incompatible authorities in order to accomplish “being morally principled.” This case study illustrates how mediated public conversations around social changes provide participants opportunities to perform moralities and define the terms of debate in relation to particular institutions. We reflect on how the consequence of this practice is a form of debate in which participants speak past each other and construct problems as unresolvable.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-0007,2017,Paper Session,Team Safety Communication: Confronting Production Pressure in a High-Reliability Organization: A Mixed Methods Study,1,"Production pressure refers to feeling obligated to work in hazardous circumstances when safety is not fully implemented. It is prevalent in high reliability organizations (HROs) in which members act quickly, sometimes at the expense of fully identifying and addressing hazards. Safety climate literature examines how members counteract production pressure through communicating to question and refuse assignments. These studies often focus on individuals’ discretionary communication behaviors while ignoring how team practices perpetuate or mitigate production pressure. This mixed methods study develops a construct, team safety communication. A qualitative study compares two wildland firefighting teams, identifying dimensions of team safety communication, and hypothesizing how the construct relates to production pressure, team interpersonal climate, and the team’s valuing of after action reviews (a learning practice). A quantitative study tests the model on N = 222 wildland firefighting teams. Findings direct attention to ways that situated team communication patterns perpetuate or minimize production pressure.",Top Papers in Organizational Communication,Organizational Communication
2017-0008,2017,Paper Session,Are Audiences Fragmented in How They Consume News Online?,3,"We analyze online news consumption in the UK using the browsing behavior of a representative sample of close to 70 thousand web users. We focus on two salient political events: the general elections of 2015 and the Brexit referendum of 2016. We first identify the websites devoted to news and information that were most accessed during the months prior, during, and after the events (i.e. those with the highest audience reach); we then analyze the patterns of audience overlap between those sites to determine whether there is evidence of fragmentation in online news consumption. We find no strong evidence of fragmentation. The media landscape carved by audiences is, instead, characterized by a very stable core of highly interconnected sites, i.e. the sources of information for most web users, which also happen to share a significant fraction of their readers.",Online News,Communication and Technology
2017-0009,2017,Paper Session,The Aggregation Effect: Does the Type of News Aggregation Personalization Influence Information-Seeking Behavior?,1,"Aggregators are popular outlets for news delivery because of their ability to curate and personalize content. Yet as readers continue to use aggregators — and those aggregators learn more about users and their interests — concerns have developed that aggregators will lead users, especially young adults, to narrow their information-seeking behavior. To test whether these concerns are valid, a 4 (type of aggregator: an aggregator that uses an algorithm to provide personalized news recommendations like Google News, an aggregator that uses on social connections to provide personalized news recommendations like Facebook, an aggregator that uses editors to provide personalized news recommendations like inshorts, and no aggregation) x 2 (type of news: civic affairs or entertainment) experiment was conducted. Results revealed that young adults hold a positive attitude toward popular aggregators like Google News and Facebook, but they did not have a narrowing impact on information-seeking behavior, which dampens concerns of selective exposure.",Online News,Communication and Technology
2017-0010,2017,Paper Session,Processing Layered News Sources on Facebook: Effects on Credibility and Learning,2,"Social media sites such as Facebook are becoming increasingly central sources of news. Yet, judging news content on these sites is complicated, as the reader has to consider multiple sources: media and friend. This study (N=233) employs the Heuristic-Systematic Model and Cognitive Mediation Model to understand how layered source cues are processed by news readers, especially when these cues are in conflict. A 2x2x2 factorial experiment tested the effects of reading a news story (high or low involvement) posted on Facebook by a friend (close or distant) from a news media organization (trusted or untrusted) on perceptions of credibility and learning outcomes. Results indicate that while trusted media sources affect credibility perceptions directly, the type of friend who posted the story has an effect moderated by media source and involvement. Greater elaboration about the content and learning were dependent on the level of involvement in the news story.",Online News,Communication and Technology
2017-0011,2017,Paper Session,Contextualised Network Maps: A Qualitative Approach Exploring the Role of Social Networking Sites in News-Related Media Repertoires,1,"This paper introduces contextualised network maps as a qualitative approach to study media repertoires. With their origins in the sociological analysis of personal networks, egocentric network maps are adapted here to visualise patterns of media use and then contextualised with qualitative interviews and data collected during participant observation. This integrative approach is illustrated by a study on the routines and practices of news consumption within and around social networking services. We will demonstrate how the mapping exercise can complement other qualitative methods to explore the structure, meaning and processes of cross-media user practices and discuss the scope and limits for visualizing and analysing the interrelatedness between social networking services and traditional mass media.

2017-0012,2017,Paper Session,The Effects of a Nutrition Media Literacy Intervention on Parents and Children,4,"This pretest/posttest experiment with control group examined a family-based media literacy curriculum (N=101 dyads) designed to improve parents’ media management skills and decrease youths’ susceptibility to appealing but unrealistic food marketing. The six weekly sessions focused on minimizing marketing influences and strengthening the family communication environment for decision making about nutrition. Structural equation modeling and additional Bayesian analysis for small sample sizes showed that the curriculum increased parental mediation to foster youths’ critical thinking about food marketing, increased parent efficacy for making healthy dietary changes for their families, and fostered family discussion about nutrition labels. In addition, influences of perceived desirability and wishful identification on youths’ requests for marketed foods was reduced. The results showed that media literacy education that empowers parents and promotes critical thinking among youth can reduce negative effects of food marketing on families while improving their use media effectively for nutrition information that aids dietary choices.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2017-0013,2017,Paper Session,Can Theory-Based mHealth Messages Promote Antenatal Care? An Intervention Study in Bangladesh,4,"This study examines the effects of theory-based intervention imparting health education messages to influence ANC uptake among expectant women in Bangladesh. We deployed a three-month intervention program using mobile phones and traditional platform to relay threat-framed and coping-framed information about pregnancy complications and ANC derived from Protection Motivation theory-based cognitive and socio-cultural constructs among 420 pregnant women. The findings revealed significant differences in hypothesized dependent variables, namely response efficacy, self-efficacy, social connectedness, women’s autonomy, and intention to uptake ANC among participants receiving mobile-based messages over those using traditional platform, but only among those exposed to threat-framed messages. In contrast, participants exposed to coping-framed messages, interaction effects with combined platform revealed significant more positive responses. The research findings suggest to the potential role of mobile phone in influencing pregnant women’s knowledge on pregnancy complications and ANC, and can be used to tailor mobile-based health education materials in a resource poor environment.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2017-0014,2017,Paper Session,Unblurring the Lines of Sexual Consent With a College Student-Driven Sexual Consent Education Intervention,2,"While interest by colleges and universities to provide sexual consent education and sexual assault prevention programming to their students has increased in recent years, relatively few studies on the effectiveness of such programming exist. The current study presents results from three online surveys spanning more than a 21-week period to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multi-faceted, student-driven sexual consent education intervention. The intervention was created with extensive formative research and implemented under the guidance of an undergraduate student advisory board and university faculty, staff, and administration. Compared to baseline, at the end of the intervention period, students reported significantly greater positive attitudes about establishing sexual consent, perceived behavioral control to obtain sexual consent, intentions to obtain and respect a partner’s sexual consent, and understanding of what constitutes sexual consent. The intervention was especially effective with historically hard-to-reach populations, such as college men and sorority and fraternity members.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2017-0015,2017,Paper Session,Randomized Trial of an Advanced Sun Safety Intervention for Vacationers at 41 North American Resorts,9,"Vacations to sunny locations are associated with skin cancer. This study tested a sun protection intervention based on diffusion of innovations and transportation theory to increase vacationers’ comprehensive sun protection, i.e., use of clothing, hats, and shade and use, pre-application and reapplication of sunscreen. The trial enrolled 41 warm weather resorts in a pair-matched group randomized pretest-posttest controlled design and assessed adult vacationers at outdoor recreation venues regarding sun protection at pretest (n=3,531) and posttest (n=3,226). Results showed no overall effect on comprehensive sun protection across venues, the intervention produced statistically significant improvements in sun protection at waterside venues (pools and beaches). The intervention may have worked best with guests in the highest-risk recreation venue, i.e., waterside recreation venues where they exposed the most skin. Alternative approaches that alter resort organizations, such as through policy, environmental features, or occupational efforts might be more effective than targeting vacationers with behavior-change messages.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2017-0016,2017,Paper Session,The Culture-Centered Approach in Designing a Gender-Tailored Heart Health Intervention for Female Heart Patients,7,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number killer of women in Singapore and globally. Despite public health campaigns such as ‘Go Red for Women’, there is still a considerable gap in terms of improvements in heart health outcomes among women, and their knowledge of CVD risk factors and prevention behavior. In this study, grounded in the culture-centered approach, we report the findings from a one-year long gender-tailored heart health intervention with 100 female heart patients of a government hospital in Singapore. The findings suggest limited support for the role of a culture-centered health communication intervention in addressing the heart health risks experienced by women. However, the study offers preliminary insights on how a culture-centered intervention might impact on a patient’s willingness to discuss treatment options with their physician, and whether they seek out health information from health-oriented information sources.",Evaluating Health Communication Interventions,Health Communication
2017-0017,2017,Paper Session,Why Journalists Use Social Media in France and the United States: Explaining Technology Adoption Across Media Systems,2,"This paper examines why journalists in France and the United States use social media. Drawing on interviews with 60 journalists in the two countries, it argues that adoption occurs when new technologies are integrated into existing work routines. Such integration, it finds, matters more than other potential reasons for adoption (e.g., management directives, diffusion from tech-savvy journalists). Media system differences are also found to shape adoption. American media’s greater exposure to commercial forces leads many journalists to view social media as tools for audience engagement, while lower levels of commercialism in France corresponds with journalists using social media primarily to seek peer recognition. These findings thus provide a cross-national perspective on the importance of journalistic routines and media systems in shaping technology adoption.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies
2017-0018,2017,Paper Session,"Awareness, Reporting, and Branding: Exploring Brazilian Journalists’ Social Media Use Across Platforms",2,"Social media have disrupted the news industry, forcing journalists to rethink their practices and relationships with audiences. With this in mind, this study employs a technology appropriation approach to examine the individual- and organizational level factors shaping Brazilian journalists’ use of social media for awareness, reporting, and branding. Results from a survey of 1,250 journalists show individual factors influence awareness and reporting uses while organizational factors more strongly relate to branding. Findings also point to important differences in uses across platforms, highlighting the need to understand social media use through a disaggregation of its components. Further, results show journalists have yet to fully embrace the participatory potential of social media as only trust on information posted by other journalists relates to adoption. Together, results suggest all journalists have fully incorporated social media as an awareness system and for traditional reporting, and online reporters are also engaging in branding.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies
2017-0019,2017,Paper Session,News Organizations’ Use of Native Videos on Facebook: Tweaking the Journalistic Field One Algorithm Change at a Time,2,"Guided by field theory, this paper explores the influence of the technological field on the journalistic field by examining how news organizations responded to Facebook’s algorithm tweak, announced in June 2014, that prioritized videos directly uploaded on the social media platform. In announcing the tweak, Facebook did not just change its own internal rules, but also imposed them on users, including news organizations traditionally governed by journalism’s own set of rules. Based on large scale data collected from 232 Facebook Pages operated by major news organizations in the United States, this study found that most news organizations complied with Facebook’s updated rules on Native Videos by significantly increasing their social video production, opening up the journalistic field to the influence of an agent external to journalism.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies
2017-0020,2017,Paper Session,Facebook News Captions as Outsourced Emotions: A Computational Analysis of Subjective Language of Newspapers on Facebook,2,"With the rising popularity of social media as news sources a new common format element for presenting news has emerged: in addition to the classic headline, lead and picture, social media users can add a caption containing their own message about the news article. We argue that news media use these captions to bridge the gap between objective reporting and the more interpersonal and subjective logic of social media. To investigate this we used computational text analysis to measure whether captions from newspapers on Facebook contain more subjective and positive language compared to headlines and leads. Our analysis, covering nine newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years, confirms that captions are more subjective and more positive. We conclude that newspapers use captions to outsource emotion to the social media format, and call for research into how this takes shape and affects the audience.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies
2017-0021,2017,Paper Session,"Staying True to the Mission: How C-SPAN Translated Espoused Into Lived Values to Pull off a ""Boring"" Social Media Strategy",2,"The path most news organizations have taken to successfully navigate social media is to encourage reporters to share their personality and build a brand. But what if that brand has frequently been called “boring”? Through an ethnographic study of C-SPAN, the cable network dedicated to covering the U.S. House and Senate “gavel to gavel” this study examines how to resolve conflicts between an organization’s espoused values and the accepted best practices on social media. It finds that building a brand, even if it is seen as boring, can be an effective social media strategy because audiences align with the overall message rather than individual attributes. The key to building that brand is clearly communicating the journalistic benefits of living espoused values and how adopting new technology fulfills the organization’s public service mission. When conflicts arise, staffers turn to heroes and outlaws for guidance.",What Use Are Social Media to Journalists?,Journalism Studies
